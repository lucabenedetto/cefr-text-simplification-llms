CPE_15,"Charging families for each bag of rubbish they produce seems like a good idea for the environment and economy, but it might not be. In many developed countries, rubbish collection is a common service. Rubbish bags or bins are collected regularly and taken to a landfill. Economists find this service strange because it is usually free. Households pay for it through local taxes, but a family that throws away a lot of rubbish pays the same as a couple that throws away very little. However, rubbish disposal is not free. More rubbish means more collectors and trucks are needed, and local authorities have to pay more for landfill fees. This is a basic economic problem: if rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish. The solution seems to be to charge households for the waste they produce. This would encourage them to throw away less and recycle more, assuming there are places to recycle. 

However, American economists Don Fullerton and Thomas Kinnaman found that this approach has complex and sometimes disappointing results. They studied several American towns and cities that started charging for rubbish. The most common system is selling stickers or tags for rubbish bags or cans. Only bags with these labels are collected. In a study of Charlottesville, Virginia, where residents were charged 80 cents per bag, the number of bags fell by 37%. But this was mainly because people packed more rubbish into each bag, a method known as the 'Seattle stomp'. The weight of rubbish collected fell by only 14%, and in other Virginian cities without such a scheme, it fell by 3.5% anyway. Some people also resorted to illegal dumping to avoid paying. This is hard to measure, but it might account for 30-40% of the reduction in collected rubbish. 

One positive outcome was a 15% increase in recycling, as people chose to recycle for free rather than pay for rubbish collection. However, this might not be due to the fee, as many were already recycling voluntarily. In a later study, Fullerton and Kinnaman found that pricing does reduce rubbish weight, but not by much. A 10% increase in sticker prices only reduces rubbish by 0.3%. This is lower than other studies, but not surprising. To significantly reduce rubbish, people would need to buy less of everything. A small tax on rubbish is unlikely to make a big difference. Other factors, like income and education, might be just as important. In wealthier towns, people throw away more rubbish and have less time to recycle. 

Should we abandon the idea of charging for rubbish? Not necessarily. Free disposal is too cheap, but simple policies can have complex effects. Detailed economic models are often needed to understand them, and the results are not always pleasant."
CPE_19,"Theodore Zeldin explores how our work life might change. Are you respected and appreciated as you should be? Just having a successful career isn't enough anymore. Many professions feel undervalued, and even famous individuals often feel bitter. Loving your job used to be enough to make you special, but now you need to consider how your job affects you personally, your mind, character, and relationships. This is important because no matter how skilled you are, if your work makes you boring or unable to talk to people outside your field, or if you're too busy to gain wisdom or use your imagination and humor, then status or money won't make up for your shortcomings as a person.

I am exploring how work can prioritize personal fulfillment instead of just shaping us for industrial needs. Work should be more than just creating wealth; it should be a meaningful lifestyle, helping us discover hidden talents and connect with more people. However, this doesn't mean eliminating unemployment, as educated people want jobs that are enriching and useful. A career should be like a work of art, with a fulfilled person at its center.

Even middle-class jobs aren't as appealing as they used to be. Doctors are often more stressed than their patients, accountants worry about ethics, architects rarely use their creativity, and administrators are stuck in bureaucracy. Middle managers, once proud of their status, are losing confidence. Companies and public institutions are downsizing, and strategies like decentralizing decisions and rewarding performance haven't gained employee commitment. In Britain, only 8% of employees strongly feel their values match their organization's.

I am investigating various jobs to see how they shape or harm people. I've studied how different cultures have expanded what humans can do and how courage can be developed. I've looked at happiness, love, friendship, and respect, and now I'm focusing on finding more satisfying ways to work. Many experts focus on extending the life and income of companies, but we also need to evaluate ourselves as people and decide who we want to spend our lives with. How many of us feel truly alive at work? How many are like part-time slaves, theoretically free to leave but actually trapped by our qualifications and careers, working not to become better people but because we see no other choice?

Take hotel workers, for example, as 10% of the workforce is in the hospitality industry. There's a lot of untapped potential. Many smart and lively people accept low prestige, low pay, and long hours because hotels haven't been rethought since the Ritz's 19th-century luxury model. A hotel isn't just a place to sleep; it's like a mini United Nations. People from around the world meet there but often don't interact. Many hotel staff are foreigners eager to learn a new language and culture, but they have shallow interactions with guests. Hotels could be cultural hubs, connecting guests and the city, and bringing people together. Hoteliers could use the knowledge of the students they employ instead of giving them only basic tasks. If they focused on their staff's true ambitions, they'd see many other services hotels could offer. But accountants often limit them, saying firms should focus on one main activity to maximize profits. It's time to rethink this from a human perspective, not just a financial one, and move beyond traditional categories.

For me, work is about relationships. Now that many people want more than just obedience and see work as a way to express independence or personality, they should have the chance to design their jobs and choose their colleagues and even customers, within practical and profitable limits. This means they need to communicate beyond professional jargon, with minds that might seem different at first. Everyone knows communication is important, but it's different from conversation. Traditional conversation is different from the new kind of conversation people miss today. This is a more personal interaction that creates respect and helps understand others, possibly changing you. It's more than just relaxing; it's the best way to create equality. Every time you have a conversation like that, the world changes a little bit."
CPE_24,"**Broadcasting: The Social Shaping of a Technology**

The term 'broadcasting' originally comes from agriculture, where it meant spreading seeds widely by hand. This metaphor suggests planned growth and a rich harvest if conditions are right. It implies a central source of seeds, or resources, meant for spreading and reproducing. The question is why a new technology that could send words and pictures electronically was organized in a way that fit this agricultural metaphor.

Television, like the telegraph and telephone, is a form of communication. However, from the start, it was seen as a centralised 'mass' medium. Broadcasting to private homes from a central source matched the socio-economic structures and lifestyles of modern societies. Other forms of organization were tried but remained just experiments.

Two lesser-known alternatives show what television could have been in a different social context. In the early 1930s, radio amateurs in Britain experimented with two-way television as a possible replacement for the telephone. Popular science magazines published articles on building TV transmitters and receivers. However, in 1938, the British Radio Manufacturers Association set standards that pushed these grassroots efforts aside. This ended the chance for television to develop as a grassroots, egalitarian form of communication in Britain.

Broadcasting was linked to strong economic interests and the structures of modern societies. Despite TV amateurs' efforts, television in the USA in the early 1930s was mainly a medium for public viewing, often seen as a competitor to the film industry. In Britain and Germany, public viewing was how most people experienced television. While grassroots, two-way television was unlikely to succeed, public viewing systems in several countries in the 1930s posed a potential threat to the domestic use of television. However, this threat did not materialize. Manufacturers saw the potential for mass sales of home TV sets once prices dropped. Given the division between public and private life in modernity, centralised broadcasting to homes was the most suitable organization.

As working-class people improved their living standards and joined 'consumer' society from the 1920s, the dream of the home as a center for entertainment and culture became possible for many in Western countries. This trend is now global. There is a link between social modernization and the structures of broadcasting. As societies modernized, centralization and concentration of power increased, and traditional communities broke up, leading to new ways of life. People became more mobile, both socially and geographically, leaving them more isolated than in stable early communities. Centralised broadcasting helped governments efficiently reach citizens with important information and created a sense of national community.

These processes made broadcasting the dominant form of radio and television. However, broadcasting also played a positive role in democracy. Between the World Wars, many countries saw broadcasting as a way to ensure equal access to information needed for informed participation in political, social, and cultural life. Television is changing, and the term 'broadcasting' might become outdated. If so, this metaphor will refer to a specific organization of audio-visual technology during a centralised phase of social modernization."
CPE_13,"**Clutter**  
Sometimes, it feels like no matter how many things you own, you never feel safe. It's normal to want a home that meets your needs, but sometimes the desire to get more things goes too far. Modern advertising is designed to make us feel insecure. It often suggests that if you don't own certain things, you're not as good as others. To see how much you're influenced by ads, try not to read any billboards next time you're out. These expensive ads constantly influence us in powerful ways without us noticing. We see them everywhere—on TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, T-shirts, the internet—all telling us to buy more.

**Caves**  
Research centers and universities worldwide have spent years studying caves, focusing on their origins, water systems, and biology. Caves are a small but intriguing part of nature, sparking our curiosity and desire to learn. This has led to a lot of research. In places where caves have impacted our lives, studies have increased. However, exploring caves often requires physical skill, so cave research is not just for professors. There is a unique overlap between professional scientists and amateurs who explore caves for fun.

**Weather Watch**  
Many observant people, using only their senses, laid the groundwork for meteorology, which has evolved into a technical science since the 17th century. Satellites and electronic tools now provide us with constant weather updates quickly, and computers solve complex math problems faster than humans can. Meteorological theory uses complex terms that can be confusing to non-experts. However, simple weather wisdom is still important. Human experience is crucial in turning computer data into weather forecasts. Observations from people can offer unique insights that help professionals understand the atmosphere better."
CPE_16,"**MUSIC AND THEATRE**

Until recently, I believed opera was mainly about theatre. But after working at a national opera house, I realized that music is actually the most important part of opera. This makes sense, but I come from the theatre world, where the spoken word and the actor are the focus. In theatre, there is no one directing the action once the play starts, and the audience usually understands the language being spoken.

In musical performances, whether in a concert hall or opera house, many people, like me, don't have a deep understanding of music. Some might feel embarrassed about this, but most are amazed by the performers' skills. A brilliant singer or a perfect string section is easy to admire. Even a good musician shows the results of years of hard work. Watching top-class music is like watching an athletics match—we see athletes doing something similar to running for a bus, but much better.

Theatre audiences have different expectations. They often don't understand an actor's skill and aren't as impressed by something that seems like what they could do themselves. They don't usually applaud when an actor finishes a long speech, although they often ask, ""How do you learn all those lines?"" This doesn't mean theatre audiences are more generous or less demanding than music audiences; many are the same people. But in theatre, audiences and performers meet on more equal terms, no matter how challenging the play.

The question is, should music learn from theatre about this relationship? I think yes, because a different approach can change the concert-goer's experience. Live music is naturally theatrical, full of emotion and drama, and it connects with the audience as a group. However, music presentations often emphasize the difference between performers and listeners, which can feel hierarchical. Also, audiences sometimes interrupt performances by applauding at the wrong times, which can disrupt the flow of the music.

Is there a solution? Yes, a lot is being done to attract new audiences to concerts and operas and to make serious music more accessible. I remember a special event, Jonathan Dove's community opera ""In Search of Angels,"" which moved from a cathedral to the town. It was a high-quality musical experience that involved the audience directly, changing many people's lives.

I wish music had more of the risk and boldness that theatre can show. This can happen in unusual locations, where normal expectations are challenged. It can have surprising effects on both performers and audiences. Theatre audiences are used to following artists into unexpected spaces, even if it's uncomfortable.

Most plays are performed in a traditional way, similar to concerts. But I believe something should change in music conventions. I am just an enthusiast who loves theatre and music, and I want both to succeed so more people can enjoy them as much as I do."
CPE_21,"**Sand**

While I admire sand's amazing ability to be turned into useful things like glass and concrete, I don't really like it in its natural form. To me, it's mostly an annoying barrier between a seaside car park and the water. It blows in your face, gets into your sandwiches, and hides important things like car keys and coins. When you're wet, it sticks to you like plaster and is hard to remove, even with a strong hose. But here's the strange part: as soon as you step onto a beach towel, get into a car, or walk on a clean carpet, it falls off you. For days, you keep finding piles of it on the floor every time you take off your shoes, and more sand flies around when you remove your socks. Sand stays with you longer than many illnesses. No, you can keep sand, as far as I'm concerned.

**Lock and Key**

The search for a safe home, privacy, and security has been around since humans first built permanent homes. The simple wooden beam behind the door has evolved into an electronic lock activated by a plastic card with countless combinations. But the desire to keep out the 'bad guys' remains. The appeal of a lock and key is partly psychological. Recently, some companies have tried computerized locking systems, where smart cards control electronic locks. But people don't like them. You might accept them at work, but at home, everyone wants the comfort of turning a physical key in a lock. So, when one locksmith company created a new electronic system, they made sure to include a real metal key in the design.

**Modern Art**

I was nervous about visiting the new Tate Modern gallery because, like many people, I find modern art confusing. I know I like some of it, especially furry things, neon light sculptures, and large photographs. Maybe if I knew more about it, I'd have opinions on more pieces. But you're not supposed to analyze it like a school essay. The idea is not to understand art but to let it speak to you. This is a great idea, but it never worked for me. However, this new gallery tries to give visitors a real understanding of the art. The first thing I noticed were the labels, proper labels that explained the context and meaning of the works. Instead of just staring blankly at the pictures, these bits of information helped me understand."
CPE_46,"**Every Picture Tells a Story**

Adapting novels into films often means cutting down, shortening, and removing parts of the story. This can be frustrating for writers but also enlightening. When I worked on a script, I realized I could remove a lot of dialogue and description from a scene in the novel and still convey the same message. This doesn't mean the original text was unnecessary. It's about the different ways each medium engages the audience and uses repetition. In novels, repetition might include repeatedly mentioning character traits or using speech tags like ""he said."" These help readers understand the story better. In stage drama, which is mostly dialogue, real speech is imitated with some stylization. Some modern plays use so much redundant language that it seems like the dialogue is just for making contact between speakers, leaving the actual message unclear.

**Watching Movies**

Watching movies can transport you into the world of the film, making you feel like you're part of it. It's an experience that takes you away from reality for the duration of the movie. Once the movie ends and the lights come on, you're back in the real world. People often don't feel responsible for the time spent watching a film, and this sense of unreality means they might not take movies seriously. In the past, movies were seen as mere entertainment, not art, by some people, including our parents' generation and many teachers. They enjoyed being entertained but didn't consider movies to be an art form.

**The Film Studios**

The Leiper Film Company studios were a mix of different buildings. The layout was confusing and hard to understand. There were a few permanent landmarks like the Script Department, but most of the place was made up of small, similar rooms used for meetings. These rooms were identified by a strange system of numbers and letters, making it hard to find your way around. The studio didn't have a clear main entrance, which added to the confusion. There were three main entrances, all similar, and only one led to where you wanted to go. There was no place to ask for directions, making it difficult for newcomers. However, strangers were rare because the studio didn't encourage their presence. Employees, on the other hand, knew their way around and worked together to create films that offered audiences a break from everyday life.

**Film-makers**

Many people dream of making movies. Bookstores are filled with guides on scriptwriting and film production, and universities offer courses on the subject. Competitions offer cameras like the one Robert Rodriguez used to make El Mariachi, a film that cost $7,000 and launched his career as a top independent director in America. Rodriguez's dreams came true quickly. In his book about making El Mariachi, he recalls thinking on his 23rd birthday: ""Orson Welles made Citizen Kane at 25. Spielberg made Jaws at 26. I have only a few years to make my breakthrough film."" In the past, filmmakers were expected to take time to develop their skills. They worked behind the scenes as editors, writers, or cinematographers, and directed low-budget films to learn the craft. John Huston was 35 when he made his first film, The Maltese Falcon. Fred Zinnemann, who directed High Noon, found success in his forties. Today, without the support of studios or television, aspiring filmmakers often have to be independent and unconventional."
CPE_3,"In those days, council houses covered the western side of the city, with rows of cramped, dull homes made of orange half-brick or pale white stucco. In summer, chemicals from the May and Baker factory, two miles away, filled the air with a strong sulfur smell. The most common sight in that part of Norwich early in the morning was a paperboy wrinkling his nose in disgust as he walked up to someone's front door. I've forgotten most of my early life, but I remember sitting, or maybe balancing, near an upstairs window, watching the houses fade into the distance. Later, I recall vague memories—faces I can't name, my mother ironing towels in a house that might not have been ours, and snow falling over the turrets of the great mansion at Earlham.

My mother often appears in these early memories. I remember her as a small, precise, and often angry woman, though I never understood why she was angry or how to make her happy. Even as a child, when I went with her to the small shops in Bunnett Square or on longer trips into the city, I sensed her unusual personality. She was the most solitary person I have ever known, as alone in a crowded room as on a deserted moor. She also had a strict sense of propriety uncommon in West Earlham, which sometimes led to intense cleaning or handwashing and instructions to 'behave properly.' This moral code was beyond my understanding, and even now, I'm not sure I fully grasp it. It meant not walking into neighbors' gardens or damaging their rose bushes, sitting quietly in the dining room with hands folded, listening to radio programs my mother liked, and following countless other rules.

Despite her solitude, my mother had a few friends. There was Mrs. Buddery, who was obsessed with the Royal Family, Mrs. Winall, who rarely spoke except to agree with others, and Mrs. Laband, who was livelier and somewhat disapproved of by the others. It was only later that I realized how poor their company was, as they formed a gloomy group, talking about bad legs, cold weather, and ungrateful children—a category I often felt I belonged to. Looking back, it felt like a heavy burden of West Earlham houses, my mother and her friends, and the need to 'behave properly' weighed on me, and I felt I had to grow up quickly to escape it. This was easier said than done.

Growing up in West Earlham followed a set pattern. Until you were five, you stayed at home, often getting in your parents' way. I remember aimless days when I was about four, playing on a rug while my mother sat coldly in an armchair. Then, the September after your fifth birthday, you went to Avenue Road infants school, half a mile towards the city. The lucky few had a mother with a rickety bike and a child seat, which were unusual contraptions with makeshift safety straps. As far as I remember, my mother left me in the care of other children in the street for this journey.

If I remember anything about those early years, it's the summer holidays, when you caught glimpses of the world outside West Earlham. There was an old man next door to Mrs. Buddery who told stories about his time in the Merchant Navy, and a charity fete once at a house far away on Christchurch Road, where a kind woman offered lemonade and tried to interest me in something called the League of Pity—a kind of junior charity, I think. But my mother dismissed it, saying the organizers were 'only after your money.' She often talked about mercenary motives, and she had a deep contempt for politicians. If she thought about the House of Commons, it was as a place where wealthy people opened letters filled with money from a gullible public. I might be exaggerating, but there was little kindness in my mother; it seemed to have been drained from her.

To be fair, my mother did care about my education. Sometimes on Sundays, she would take me, dressed in my 'good clothes,' on the 85 bus to the Norwich Castle Museum. There, we would walk through rooms of paintings by the Norwich School of Artists. My mother wasn't entirely against this activity and eventually developed some opinions on the art. I remember her once stopping in front of a painting of a Roman soldier in full armor and saying, 'Well, I wouldn't like to meet him on a dark night!' This is the only time I remember her trying to make a joke."
CPE_10,"**Philadelphia Avenue**

I walked down the odd-numbered side of Philadelphia Avenue. The evening was getting darker, and the air was thick with a light, prickly drizzle. This made my walk feel secretive and sheltered. I knew this side of the street well from my childhood. Our neighbors were the Matzes and the Pritchards, and there was Han Kieffer's grocery store. My first playmates, all girls, lived in the Kring's and the Pottses' houses. Each house was as familiar to me as the small grooves in the sidewalk that guided rainwater to the street. These grooves marked my path when I used roller skates or my scooter. As the street sloped down, the houses seemed to reflect a slight drop in social status: the porches were closer to the ground, and the front yards were smaller. Over the years, changes occurred: wooden porch railings and pillars were replaced with wrought iron in a vaguely Southern or Spanish style. In Shillington, some houses I remembered as homes had become stores, and some stores, like Pep Conrad's and Han Kieffer's, had turned back into homes. I wondered how people lived in those spaces that used to be shops, with the lingering smells of merchandise.

**Bachelor Fads**

Furniture designer Rick Gilbert lives in a flat that used to be a curtain warehouse. It has typical loft features like exposed brickwork and large doors, which were once used to bring in curtains from trains on the nearby railway. However, Gilbert didn't want an open-plan space for practical and aesthetic reasons. In his previous home, his living and working areas were combined, making it hard to separate work from relaxation. So, he divided the space near the entrance with a large sheet of corrugated plastic. This screen hides the office, creates a hallway, and leads the eye to the kitchen in the middle of the flat. Gilbert wanted the kitchen to be a neutral area where he could either cook for friends or make coffee for clients. To balance the modern look of the plastic screen and stainless steel kitchen, he used light wood for the floors. While his flat has futuristic chairs and sofas, it also contains sentimental and homely furniture from his parents or bought from markets.

**Bruce Chatwin**

Was Bruce Chatwin's life about escaping or exploring? This question has puzzled many. Chatwin's life and work were full of secrets, subtle connections, and sometimes lies. Despite this, he was a brilliant and unique writer. His first book, ""In Patagonia,"" published in 1977, is a remarkable work of imagination. It is a travel book that changed travel writing, with the excitement of a thriller, the charm of romantic fiction, and the deep insight of extraordinary literature. Even in this book, Chatwin mixed fact with fiction. He would change or even ignore reality to make a story more interesting or to get to the heart of what the book seemed to suggest: that through travel, one could discover entire histories that seemed to exist just to captivate future explorers.

**Swimming**

During a warm summer rainstorm, I hurried across the lawn behind my house and took shelter in the pool. As I swam, I kept my eyes just above the water. Each raindrop created a small, bouncing fountain that turned into a bubble and then burst. The best moments were when the storm grew stronger, drowning out the birdsong, and a mist rose from the water as if the pool was reaching up to the sky. It was during this intense rain in the summer of 1996 that I started thinking about a long swim through Britain. I wanted to follow the rain as it traveled across the land to the sea, breaking free from the routine of swimming laps and turning back on myself like a caged tiger. Most of us live in a world where everything is labeled and explained. This makes reality seem more like a visual experience. Walking, cycling, and swimming are rebellious activities because they help us reconnect with what is old and wild by getting off the beaten path and escaping the official version of things. A swimming journey would let me explore parts of the world that, like darkness, misty woods, or high mountains, still hold mystery."
CPE_67,"Text: 'CRYING Charles Darwin believed that crying had no clear evolutionary purpose, but he was likely mistaken. Scientists now suggest that crying has social importance. Psychiatrist John Bowlby noted that crying helps build the bond between a mother and her child. Many think that tears, especially in children, show helplessness. However, why adults continue to cry is more difficult to understand. In adults, the visual signal of tears seems more important than the sound of crying. Crying might have helped early human groups by building trust and social connections. Tears can also have other reasons. We might cry to show sympathy for people facing injustice. Sometimes, we cry without meaning to, like when we hear inspiring music or speeches. We might cry during a sentimental movie, and this often happens more when we are with others than when we are alone. The social role of crying seems clear, but research is ongoing.'"
CPE_27,"**The Heat is On**

We've all heard about global warming, but how much warmer will the Earth get, and how will it affect us? Most people know something about global warming, but its exact consequences are uncertain. A warmer climate will likely change the weather everywhere. Since the atmosphere is connected to everything on our planet, any climate changes will significantly impact plants, animals, water, and soil. Humans rely on these natural resources to produce food, build cities, and support billions of people. So, any changes to these resources are important.

The challenge is understanding how the world will change and what causes these changes. Over the last 100 years, human activities have increased the levels of certain gases in the atmosphere, which are linked to global temperatures. These increased levels are likely affecting the global climate, but our limited understanding of the Earth's heat balance makes it hard to predict the future.

We know that greenhouse gas levels have changed along with global temperatures over the past 40,000 years, suggesting a strong connection. Evidence shows that the Earth's surface has warmed by about 0.6°C over the past century. Most scientists believe this warming is not natural and is partly due to human pollution.

Researchers use computer models called general circulation models (GCMs) to predict future climate conditions. These models use physics and chemistry to analyze factors like temperature and solar radiation. However, they simplify the real world and have limitations, making their predictions only approximate. Despite these challenges, most agree that climate change will happen faster than ever before.

GCMs predict that by 2100, the average global temperature could rise by 1°C to 3.5°C, sea levels could rise by 15-95 cm, and precipitation patterns could change. Extreme weather events like heatwaves, floods, and droughts may become more common. These changes could significantly impact the environment and human life.

Climate change could alter the locations of ecosystems like forests and grasslands, affecting the species they contain and the benefits they provide to society. Resources like food, water, and human settlements are sensitive to climate changes. While some effects might be beneficial, many are likely to be harmful. For example, in Australia, warmer temperatures have increased wheat yields by reducing frost damage. However, climate change could also reduce water availability, especially in dry regions or areas with existing shortages, like the Mediterranean Basin.

Glacial changes could affect ice, vegetation, wildlife, and human structures. The Arctic ice might melt completely, making marine transport easier but increasing iceberg risks. The most dramatic effect of global warming could be rising sea levels due to ocean expansion and melting ice. With about half the world's population living in coastal areas, rising sea levels could cause severe flooding and displacement. Cities like London, New York, and Tokyo could face significant disruptions, and many people might become environmental refugees. Small island nations could be most affected, potentially disappearing if worst-case scenarios occur, leading to devastating consequences for their people and cultures."
CPE_66,"Text: 'Mission to Mars Wanted: a middle-aged, married couple for a 501-day round trip to Mars. Applicants must be physically and emotionally strong. This will be the profile of the first astronauts to go to Mars if multi-millionaire Dennis Tito's plans to launch a capsule on 5 January 2018 succeed. The capsule will take the crew to about 160 km above Mars. The spacecraft will use Mars's gravity to return to Earth without using more fuel, as saving fuel is important. The 2018 deadline is set because the next time Mars and Earth align for a launch is in 2031. It's a big challenge, and the race is on to create systems with new technologies. If these can be developed in time, the spacecraft might make it. But even if it doesn't launch, the efforts to reach these ambitious goals will still be valuable, as they will lead to important advances for future missions.'"
CPE_44,"AESTHETICS

Ironically, the very existence of art, which is essential for developing aesthetic theory, can sometimes hinder our understanding of it. This is because art is often seen as just physical objects like buildings, books, paintings, or statues, separate from human experience. However, the true essence of art lies in what it does to our experiences. This misunderstanding can block our understanding of art.

Moreover, the perfection and long-standing admiration of some art pieces create conventions that prevent new insights. Once an art piece becomes a classic, it often gets disconnected from the human conditions that created it and the effects it has on our lives. This separation builds a barrier around art, making it hard to understand its broader significance, which is what aesthetic theory tries to address. Art is often placed in a separate realm, disconnected from other human efforts and achievements.

Therefore, a key task for anyone writing about the philosophy of fine arts is to reconnect art with everyday experiences. Just like mountain peaks are part of the earth, art should be seen as part of human experience. Those who study the earth, like geographers and geologists, show how mountains are connected to the earth. Similarly, those who study art should show how it connects to human life.

If we accept this idea, even temporarily, we realize something surprising: to understand art, we need to step away from it for a while and look at ordinary experiences that we don't usually consider aesthetic. We need to approach art theory indirectly. Understanding art is about gaining insight. Just as one can enjoy flowers without knowing plant biology, understanding flowers requires knowledge of soil, air, water, and sunlight. Similarly, to understand art in its refined forms, we must start with raw experiences that capture our attention and provide enjoyment.

However, many people are put off by the idea that their everyday activities have aesthetic value. The arts that resonate most with people today are often not seen as art, like movies, jazz, comic strips, and sensational news stories. When art is confined to museums and galleries, people seek enjoyable experiences in their daily lives. Even those who criticize the museum view of art often share the misconception that art is separate from ordinary life. The best appreciation of art happens when it is closely connected to everyday activities."
CPE_22,"**Observing Lions**

In our imagination, lions hunting for food look like a well-coordinated team: as the sun sets, a group of sneaky lions jumps out from the shadows and surrounds their prey. Lions seem like perfect social animals, working together without any arguments to achieve a common goal - getting their next meal. However, after many years of watching these animals in the wild, we have a different view. When we began our research in 1978, we wanted to find out why lions hunt together, raise their cubs, and scare off rivals with loud roars. If an animal's success is measured by how many of its offspring survive, then being too cooperative might not be beneficial: if an animal is too generous, others benefit at its expense. So, why don't the evolutionary rules of self-interest apply to lions? We thought we could solve this question in two to three years. But lions are very good at doing nothing. If there were a list of inactive elements like krypton, argon, and neon, we would add lions to it. Therefore, it has taken various research methods to find clues about their behavior. Since wild lions can live up to 18 years, we are only now starting to get clear answers to our questions.

**Pop Music Review**

The release of Bedrock's third album was a major event for the band, which had been talented but unstable. ""New Life"" started a movement that changed rock music in this country for the rest of the decade. The serious and plain style of the past, with loud guitars, was replaced by a lighter mix of melodic local styles. The album combined social commentary and strong emotions with the sounds of fairground organs and northern brass bands. Humor and irony were prominent, as were voices that didn't hide their origins. The album showed Bedrock as skilled collectors and observers, and a clever team of songwriters. They playfully explored traditional English themes like sunbathing and Sunday afternoons. But the album's real strength was in its gentle, sad songs like ""So Low,"" a beautiful tune about weather, and ""To the Brink,"" a serious ballad. The beauty of ""New Life"" is its consistently high quality - 16 tracks with no filler, which is rare in the era of long CDs.

**Extract from an Autobiography**

As a child, I was always intrigued by stories of ""The Sibyl,"" wise women who had great influence in ancient times. At first, I only knew about one from a story my mother told me. An old woman from Cumae offered Tarquin, King of Rome, nine books for 300 gold pieces. He refused, and she burned three of them, offering him six for the same price. When he refused again, she burned three more books. He bought the last three for the full 300 gold pieces. Even then, I understood there was a deep truth in the story - a lesson in salesmanship and life. I was sometimes a lonely only child. I would ask to play with other children and be refused. My mother told me to do something so interesting that other kids would want to join me. It worked. It was another lesson I've never forgotten. When I got the chance to write a travel book, I had to find something I was interested in, something relevant to my life. I'm a reluctant traveler - I sent my editor a long list of places I didn't want to go. In the end, I'm only interested in ruins because I like traveling through time in my mind.

**What Becomes of Your Manuscript?**

When you submit your manuscript, it will likely join a pile waiting to be sorted - the so-called slush pile. The person sorting it is usually a junior in the editorial department or an experienced freelancer who works part-time. Neither has much influence, but they want to find something original - the junior to make a name for themselves and find an author, the freelancer to keep their job. If they think your novel is promising, they will pass it to a senior editor, and it will eventually be discussed at an acquisition meeting. The editor will need to justify accepting your novel based on its quality and potential sales, and also consider if you, as an author, seem like a long-term prospect (which you will have assured them of in your letter). They will also consider how promotable you are, which is important when a new novel needs all the help it can get. Publishers often like to meet a potential author before making an offer."
CPE_39,"**Advertising on Trial**

If you worked in an advertising agency during the early 1990s, you probably faced one of the toughest times in your career. The economic recession was severe, lasting longer and hitting harder than expected, especially in industrialized countries. In Britain, 1991 was particularly difficult: the economy shrank, interest rates were high, consumer spending dropped, over half a million people lost their jobs, and many homes were repossessed. Every business felt the impact, with industries like vehicle and construction seeing a 30% decline. Many people and companies across different countries suffered.

Advertising professionals were not the only ones losing jobs, but those who remained employed felt significant pressure. They were expected to help boost company profits and were closely watched by their colleagues and bosses. They also had to work with smaller budgets, being told to achieve more with less. Despite these challenges, the importance of marketing grew. Companies began to focus more on producing what customers wanted rather than just what was convenient for them. This shift meant marketing activities received more attention from management, raising the status of marketing professionals but also increasing their responsibilities.

Marketing was often seen as a solution to all problems, and since about half of marketing budgets went to advertising, the pressure was on advertising professionals. The 1980s were a great time for advertising, but the early 1990s brought a downturn. This was partly due to the economy, but also because companies started questioning the value of advertising. They wanted to know exactly what they were getting for their money and whether it was worth the investment. Advertising, always viewed with some skepticism, was now under more scrutiny than ever.

Companies demanded better strategies, targeting, creativity, media placement, and thinking from advertising agencies. They wanted the best people working hard to produce outstanding work. This meant that advertising professionals faced the same challenge as their clients: doing more with less. The recession made it difficult to produce effective advertising, as companies were hesitant to take risks, which are often essential for good advertising.

Other challenges included demographic changes, the growing power of retailers, changing consumer needs, the rise of sponsorship, stricter legal restrictions on advertising, and the challenge of advertising internationally. These factors, along with the economic situation, forced advertisers to reconsider the effectiveness of their work. The pressure to make advertising more effective was higher than ever.

Unfortunately, help for those trying to improve their advertising was not readily available. Companies and agencies were too busy dealing with the situation to share their insights, and those who succeeded were reluctant to reveal their secrets. Conferences and seminars offered some help, but books on advertising often failed to provide practical guidance. They tended to overestimate the quality and value of advertising work, which did not help those responsible for making advertising decisions."
CPE_18,"**The Lure of the Kitchen**

When I was at university, I decided I wanted to become a chef. This was an unusual choice among my peers. Cooking wasn't a popular career choice. On the surface, being a chef seems unattractive. Chefs have tough lives: the work is long, stressful, and not well-paid. But these factors didn't discourage me. I was unhappy at university. The studies were difficult, and the social life felt closed-off and self-important. Being a chef seemed like the perfect escape from this. It offered a seriousness and honesty that I felt was missing in my college life. My desire to cook wasn't just a reaction to being a student. It also represented an artistic ideal for me. I first saw this ideal when I ate at a famous London restaurant. It was eye-opening. I still remember my starter clearly. After that meal, I felt like I wanted to thank the chef deeply. I felt happy and light for days. After this experience, I wanted to learn the secrets of this amazing art. I turned my student life into preparation for entering the culinary world. My history degree felt empty, distracting me from my real passion. I learned about cooking in a random and incomplete way by reading cookbooks, visiting markets and delicatessens, and making elaborate meals.

**The Swimming Instructor**

The school's swimming instructor was a former drill sergeant, small and muscular, with tattooed arms. When I asked him to teach me how to dive, he told me to sit on the pool's edge, put my hands above my head, and roll forward, pushing off with my feet. I practiced this move until the lesson ended. The next time, he had me stand up and dive off the edge. The instructor was strict, and every time I surfaced, he criticized me: 'Don't look down, look up!' 'Keep your legs straight.' 'Point your toes!' The following week, I went up to the high board. It was a fixed board, and its front edge bent slightly downward. It seemed very high as I stood there, trying to gather my courage. Gradually, the echoing voices faded, and I felt like I was in silence. I waved my arms as I had been taught, tried to look up, not down, and launched myself into the air. For a brief moment, I felt like I was flying. When I hit the water, I fell awkwardly, and my legs were everywhere. The instructor looked at me with disapproval and shook his head. But even he couldn't take away my joy. That's what they mean by 'free as a bird,' I thought.

**The Traveller**

For those of us who value a comfortable bed, running water, and the likelihood of living at least until tomorrow, the idea of the traveller is both puzzling and fascinating. These are people who are drawn to the dangerous allure of the unknown, who choose to risk their lives by climbing icy, avalanche-prone mountains; who sail alone in fragile boats through huge waves; who will eat maggots and river insects if nothing better is available, and who can live for months in the shadow and promise of the unknown. It's easy to dismiss such people as oddities, which they are, and to categorize them with the truly eccentric: hermits, freefall divers, or writers. They exist, but the strange, uncomfortable world they inhabit is far from our everyday experience and can be dismissed, we tell ourselves, as irrelevant. We can shrug and return to our world of microwave ovens and answering machines, grateful that the only risks to our health are predictable ones, like running across a busy street.

**Sailing**

Jonathan Raban is afraid of the sea, saying it is not his natural environment, which is probably why he spends so much time on it. He doesn't claim to be a top sailor, though he is clearly competent. His main reason for sailing is that, as a writer, he likes to write about his sailing experiences. Sailing provides plenty of challenges and achievements for him to write about. Raban's small boat has an electronic device that gives sailors their exact position anywhere on Earth. While he appreciates this tool, Raban has a somewhat old-fashioned view of other sailing aids. He believes the invention of the compass was a mistake, causing a 'fundamental rift in the relationship between man and sea.' Raban argues that since the compass came into use about a thousand years ago, it has become the main focus for sailors, meaning they no longer need to study the waves and feel the sea. The ocean, once full of activity, is now just a space. Since the helmsman's job is just to stay on course, he can be replaced for long periods by an autopilot. This might be why Raban had time to observe the waves so closely."
CPE_62,"**Holiday Reading**

Summer gives us two great joys: leaving home and reading books. These joys are closely linked. Books help us feel more connected to the world. We can relate our experiences to those in books from long ago or faraway places because there are fewer types of people than there are people. In books, we find our own thoughts and feelings. Authors can describe situations we thought were unique to us, or express our thoughts with clarity we can't achieve. What is unclear in us is clearly expressed in their words, especially if the book is from a different time or place. We feel thankful to these authors for helping us understand ourselves. Through reading and travel, we break free from routine. Our eyes are most open in a new place, or when reading a great book, which shows us things we ignored before. Our mind becomes aware of new details, like the sky's colors, a friend's hypocrisy, or a hidden sadness we didn't know we had.

**Author's Note**

These travel reflections were published in the Observer newspaper over seven years. I've restored some small cuts made by the editor to fit the page, but added little else. I've corrected a few mistakes, but only if they were details I should have gotten right. I could have made more improvements with hindsight, but that process would never end. For example, in an article about China, I thought the Hong Kong dollar would stay strong, but it fell a year later. If I rewrote it to predict this, it would seem like I had foresight, which I didn't. Like any traveler, I was there at that moment, unaware of the future, trying to understand what had already happened. This is the story of mass travel: the world opening up to people with no qualifications except the price of a ticket. But I believe my fellow travelers aren't blind. Even a postcard can have a purpose.

**Ecotourism**

If there were awards for overused tourism phrases, 'ecotourism' would win. The term appeared in the early 1980s, as people became more environmentally aware and tour operators realized travelers wanted to avoid negative impacts. It quickly became a popular marketing term. Now, 'ecotourism' includes anything from living with remote tribes for two weeks to a one-hour boat trip in Australia. Any tour involving culture, nature, wildlife, or adventure is labeled as ecotourism. The original motives were good, aiming to help people make informed choices, but the lack of regulations and a clear definition left many travelers confused.

**Transylvanian Journey**

I lost my notebook from my Transylvanian journey for 50 years, but found it by luck a few years ago. It helped me remember that time and write about it, but it wasn't perfect. In Transylvania, I had an easier time than expected, moving from one welcoming house to another, often staying for weeks. When I stopped moving, I stopped writing, thinking there was nothing to record. I was slow to start writing again, and sometimes only made brief notes instead of detailed stories. Worried that details might be out of order, I added many disclaimers. But then I realized this wasn't a guidebook, so I let the story unfold naturally."
CPE_49,"**Fashion**

Fashion is often thought of as a modern trend, linked to the capitalism of the 19th and 20th centuries. However, many fashion historians emphasize that fashion, in terms of style and design, has a long history. They often start with the rise of markets and trade in the 16th and 17th centuries. As societies have become more complex, populations have grown, and new technologies for making different types of clothing and accessories have been developed, the meanings of clothing have also become more complex. Today, it is hard to say exactly what any piece of clothing or accessory means. For example, a man's suit, which seems very uniform, can have different meanings in different situations and to different people.

**Writer**

Reports of publishers fighting over promising manuscripts have given a false impression of what life is like for most novelists. For those of us not topping the best-seller lists, there are two ways to make a living. The smartest among us write in the evenings and have full-time jobs that are secure even if the book doesn't become a hit. Others, like me, do various literary jobs, such as teaching, running workshops, and writing articles like this one. I've heard of writing jobs at a chocolate factory, but I've never gotten anything like that. Somehow, by juggling part-time jobs, using credit cards, and often relying on the generosity of people mentioned in Acknowledgements, the novel gets written.

**Sudden Fame**

The small venues we were performing at across the country started selling out, and extra security was needed to manage the growing number of screaming fans. We had to use secret entrances to the places we played to avoid being mobbed. On the few nights we weren't working, it was hard to leave the house without being chased by fans. In just a few days, we became celebrities. Our fans watched our every move, and our management and others took care of all our needs. Even though I was always shy, this was replaced by a strange over-confidence that only naturally shy people in similar situations can understand. In short, I was emotionally overwhelmed."
CPE_31,"**Music - The Future Challenges**

Technological advances are changing how we live, work, and enjoy our free time. Susan Hallam talks about how these changes affect music in Britain. In the late 20th century, we had more ways to listen to music, like radio, TV, records, tapes, CDs, and videos. However, live music performances and full-time jobs for musicians have decreased. It's clear that access to music will keep growing because it meets many human needs. Music is essential for national events and personal activities, both formal and informal. A world without music is hard to imagine. The question is not if there will be music in the 21st century, but what kind of music it will be and if people will still want to learn musical instruments.

I believe people will continue to learn instruments. The music industry is a big part of Britain's economy, and musical skills will remain important for many jobs, especially in media. Besides job opportunities, playing an instrument can help develop skills early on. Research in the USA shows that listening to or making music can improve spatial reasoning, a part of intelligence. Although these findings need more support, studies in Europe show that group music lessons can improve social skills and concentration in children, including those with behavioral issues. Further research is exploring if playing an instrument can help develop skills that can be used in other areas, like good study habits and organization.

In the short term, there will likely be a demand for music lessons. But what about the long term? I see two possible trends. First, people will listen to more diverse music, with new genres mixing different styles. Second, technology will play a bigger role in composing and performing music, making it easier for more people to create music without needing advanced technical skills. This might reduce the need for live performances and musicians focused only on performing. At the same time, more people of all ages might want to participate in music-making, often in community settings that reflect local musical traditions.

To prepare for this future, the music profession needs to adapt. Instrumental teaching should change to allow more people to learn different instruments throughout their lives. This will affect the music curriculum and how progress is measured, requiring them to be relevant to a wider audience and cover more musical skills. Training musicians will be key. They need to inspire and teach learners of all ages, work with diverse groups, and have communication, social, entrepreneurial, and management skills for community work. This is a big shift from traditional methods and will require accountability. Positively, it offers a chance to show the quality of music education.

Finally, we need to raise the importance of music in our lives. Music is crucial but often overlooked. Everyone in the music profession should work together to change this."
CPE_58,"**The Actor's Craft**

Actors often face criticism and mockery. This is partly because they sometimes talk about their work in interviews, which can lead to clichés or gossip. They could learn from dancer Pavlova, who said, ""If I could tell you, I wouldn't dance it,"" when asked about her dancing. Paul Scofield, a respected actor, once wrote that acting only has meaning when performed. Discussing it makes it seem empty and theoretical. Each new play is a fresh start for an actor, who learns and grows with the characters and the writer's insights. After a play ends, the actor feels empty until the next role. This emptiness is evident in any discussion about acting.

**A Review of Hamlet**

Adrian Lester's performance as Hamlet is a balance between youth and adulthood, showing simplicity and confidence. His skill with the text and his control make him a standout actor. Lester portrays Hamlet as a tense young man with hidden anger, using sharp wit and humor to be both intimidating and charming. His performance is subtle yet impressive. His body language, like his stiff arms, suggests a character ready to come to life. Similarly, Handy's portrayal of Horatio shows a character moved by an inner force. This raises questions about acting and behavior: Is acting an imitation or a creation of real behavior? What drives these characters, both morally and physically? This is a key question in theater.

**One Director's Approach to Rehearsal**

This director starts rehearsals with a method called ""dropping in."" The stage manager projects the script on a screen. Actors listen quietly to others, noticing the effect of the words. When it's their turn, they read a phrase, think about its meaning, and wait for the impulse to speak. For example, with the line ""Queuing all night, the rain, do you remember?"" they breathe, let the thought sink in, and visualize a scene, like waiting in line for a concert. They find the impulse to speak, which the director calls ""The pathway to the line."" Impulses can come from outside or within. Actors should look into each other's eyes and consider their character's situation. The director encourages actors to approach with an open mind and trust that something will happen.

**The Perfect Theatre**

The perfect theater should make you feel that your presence matters. Attending a live performance is an event, and the staff should recognize this. It's discouraging if the staff treats it like just another job. The theater should create a connection between the performer and the audience. No one should feel too far away; they should be able to hear, see, and feel connected to the stage. The auditorium's size is important; it should suit the human voice and body. If it overwhelms the actors, it's not right. Many theaters from the late 19th century got this right, creating spaces that embrace the stage. I like theaters with a sense of history, like worn steps in a church, showing layers of human presence. You can't please everyone with a play. Audiences don't always know what they want to see. When you go to the theater, you want to experience something unexpected, something you couldn't imagine at home."
CPE_37,"**Paul Simon**

In the 1950s, rock and roll was mainly popular among young people, but its real significance was the big impact it had on middle-class and older people. It also set the stage for the next wave of rock stars, who listened to it with amazement, knowing that this new, exciting music would be a big part of their future. For Paul Simon and other young people in the US, the main way to hear this fresh and exciting music was through Alan Freed's radio show, Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party. Freed's show was essential listening for many future rock stars. Just like young John Lennon, who was in Liverpool, listening to Radio Luxembourg—the only place in Europe to hear the new rock and roll—Paul Simon was captivated by the music from Freed's show. He was getting ready for the next step for a teenager obsessed with rock and roll: moving from just listening to making his own music.

**Snow**

There was no clear path, but I thought I would be fine if I walked carefully. The wind was strong, pushing me down as I slipped on the icy surface. Suddenly, the snow, which looked harmless, collapsed under me. I fell, surprised, into a hole about four feet deep. The snow had created a roof over a gap between two rocks, which had melted away, leaving only a thin layer that I broke through. I pulled myself out, feeling shaken and worried, thinking about what I would have done if the hole had been thirty feet deep. I leaned against the top of a pine tree sticking out of the snow to assess the situation. In an hour, I had only covered about half a mile. It was clear that I needed to give up my plan.

**Qualitative Research**

There are many books now that try to guide researchers on qualitative research. While a lot has been written about collecting data, these books often don't talk much about how to analyze the data. There is a lot of mystery around how researchers analyze their data. So, we asked different social scientists who have done qualitative projects to talk about the methods they used. The goal was to share insights and understanding of the process of analyzing qualitative data, not to create a guidebook for new researchers. This involves making hidden procedures more clear. While this might seem easy, we found it quite challenging. We allowed our contributors to present their work in different styles, including personal stories and more formal approaches."
CPE_2,"**Screen Learning**

Recently, I saw my six-year-old eating noodles in a strange way. He was pulling them up with his teeth and trying to look fierce, saying, ""I'm a little dinosaur."" He was acting out a scene from a TV show he had watched. When I asked him what he remembered about dinosaurs, he didn't recall much. Nowadays, many people are eager to use the internet and computers for learning, but is learning from a screen effective? One writer shared his experience with an interactive program he tried with his son. The father read the words carefully, but the son was more interested in playing with the pictures. The father thought that if his son had spent ten minutes with a book, he might have learned something. Television, as shown by my son's noodle game, is a medium that suggests ideas rather than teaches them directly. Research shows that learning happens best in environments where there is dialogue with teachers or parents. Technology can be useful for teaching, but formal education still plays a crucial role.

**Hollywood**

By 1918, most of the world's film-making had moved to Hollywood. Local residents were not happy, seeing their area of Los Angeles changed by these newcomers. However, in the end, they accepted it because of the success it brought. In Hollywood, success is measured by box-office earnings. Hollywood can recognize a good film, one that might make a star but will definitely make money. In less than a century, Hollywood transformed from a small village to a town as famous as New York, Rome, or Paris. Physically, it has changed a lot; a century ago, you would walk through orange groves to get to the village store. Yet, in some ways, it remains like a village, with a narrow focus on films. People there talk about how much films have made, who is dating whom, and who is involved in which project. Successful people often try to leave, preferring to work there but live elsewhere. Still, Hollywood is the place where almost everyone in show business eventually goes.

**Photography**

Photography was created by 19th-century artists as a new art form. These artists wanted a lasting and accurate record of their surroundings, and they found it with photography. The combination of light, lens, shutter, and a chemical-coated surface produced images that were more lasting and detailed than paintings. This caused concern among other artists, and art critics argued that photography was not true art. They believed that because photography relied on mechanical means, it couldn't be considered a product of human creativity. Despite this criticism, photographers knew they had discovered a new form of art. They used photography to interpret the world and present their vision of nature and people, just as other artists used brushes and pencils.

**Book Illustration**

In the past, it was common for every children's book to have illustrations, even novels for older readers. However, as print runs became shorter, this practice declined. Children's publishing was active but often operated on a low budget, leading to a mix of routine and mediocre work. Still, the best artists always delivered high-quality work. The black-and-white illustrations from this period are a mix of junk and treasures, offering a rich area for research and discovery. The true treasures are likely to be showcased again, either through reissues of books or exhibitions of original works. There are signs that interest in this period is returning, and publishers may soon see the potential for reprinting classic children's book illustrations or creating new editions using the original artwork."
CPE_68,"**Blogging: Sharing Your Life Online**

A while back, a website warned about the dangers of public check-ins—telling everyone where you are online. The message was clear: you might think you're just saying, ""Hey, I'm here,"" but you're also letting everyone know you're not at home, including people you might not want to meet. This highlighted the potential downsides of sharing too much online. The internet offers huge opportunities to share every part of our lives with a global audience, promising things like wealth and fame. So, we dive into the online world, sharing confessions, photos, and stories. But soon, we realize it's a crowded and risky place, and we can get lost. 

Feeling down? Don't be. There's a guide to this future, created by early internet users. In the early days of the web, these pioneers explored the online world and faced its challenges. They lost jobs, made and lost friends, and dealt with the ups and downs of fame—long before social media existed. These early bloggers have already experienced what many of us are going through now. Before we forget their stories, it's worth learning from them. As the saying goes, those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.

In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started posting online. Back then, the web was mostly used by students, scientists, and a few curious teenagers like him. The web was created at CERN, a physics lab in Switzerland, to help researchers share their work. But Hall saw it as a way to share his life. He created a detailed online autobiography with words, photos, and art. In January 1996, he started a daily blog, and people were drawn to his bold use of this new medium. Hall's rule was simple: if you crossed his path, you might end up on his site; no topic was off-limits. While his work was exhibitionist, it also had a certain beauty that some might even call art.

One day, visitors to Hall's site found it replaced with a video titled ""Dark Night."" He shared that he had fallen deeply in love, but when he wrote about it online, he was given an ultimatum: ""either the blog goes, or I do."" He realized that sharing his life online made people not trust him. He stopped blogging, but the issue remains. Sharing online is exciting, but if you expect it to make people like you, you'll be let down.

In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a web worker in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job at a software company. One day, a colleague anonymously sent her blog to the company's vice presidents, including those she had criticized, and she lost her job. Experts call this the ""online distribution effect"": the feeling that we can say things online that we wouldn't say in person. But our online and real lives are connected. Ignoring this can lead to serious mistakes.

Armstrong's story ended well. Though she was upset and stopped blogging for a while, she got married and restarted her blog, focusing on her family. Now, she's a successful ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing supports her family. Once an example of online mistakes, she has become skilled at sharing her life carefully. Armstrong learned an important lesson: just because the web lets us say anything, doesn't mean we should."
CPE_23,"Text: 'Enough Sleep? Many people today feel tired all the time. In busy and wealthy countries, more people are experiencing sleeplessness and anxiety. In the USA, research shows that 40 million Americans have chronic sleep problems. In Britain, some popular novels feature characters who can't sleep or are set in sleep research labs. People are interested in sleep, its patterns, and its problems. A main concern is that people need more sleep. A leading sleep researcher says, 'People cut back on sleep when they're busy. They wake up too early to avoid traffic.' 

A sleep researcher conducted an experiment where he let people sleep up to 14 hours a night for a month. It took them three weeks to settle at about eight-and-a-quarter hours of sleep, showing they needed to catch up on lost sleep. In Europe, a university sleep research lab in the English Midlands tests these ideas. They study things like how tiredness affects sailors, how airport noise affects sleep, and the dangers of driving when tired. They find volunteers through student newspapers, pay them £5 an hour, and ask them to change their sleep patterns. Dr. Louise Reyner reassures participants who worry about electrodes on their heads, explaining that the lab is more interested in physical effects.

In a dark room, there is a motorway simulator with a car facing a large screen. Participants come at 2 pm, when people naturally feel sleepy, after a short or no sleep. They drive while answering questions. The road seems endless, the sun is bright, and the air is warm. Young men often say they won't fall asleep, but Dr. Reyner has a video of one trying not to. At first, he sits upright, eyes open. Then he starts blinking more and more, his head nodding. Each nod gets heavier, and the blinks turn into 10-second blackouts. He wakes up suddenly, but by then, the car has veered off the road. A coffee might help. Dr. Reyner says two cups can make you a safe driver for over half an hour, even with no sleep. She suggests using alertness products like tablets, energy drinks, and caffeinated gum, especially for shift workers.

What do we know for sure about sleep? Humans, like other mammals, sleep in a daily cycle. During sleep, they go through four stages, from light to deep sleep. Dreams usually happen in the lightest sleep, and the brain stops the body from moving to prevent injuries. Beyond this, there are theories. Some say sleep repairs the body, restores muscles, or rests the brain's creative part. But these might also happen when awake and relaxed, so it's uncertain. Scientists are sure women sleep half an hour longer than men, and older people need less sleep, but they don't know why.

When asked about the purpose of sleep, some researchers say, 'Sleep is a way to pass time safely.' Sleep patterns may have been different in the past. A history professor found that between 1500 and 1850 in Britain, people had different sleep routines. They went to bed at nine or ten, woke up after midnight for an hour, and then had a 'morning sleep.' This break was a time for reflection, remembering dreams, or even stealing. The poorest benefited most from this quiet time, free from daily work. By the 17th century, with more artificial light, the rich started sleeping in one long stretch, which was more efficient. The industrial revolution made most people work longer hours in lit buildings, changing sleep patterns for everyone except some rural people. Outside Europe and America, the old pattern was common until recently. In some non-western cultures, there are no strict bedtimes. People sleep for a few hours, then get up. Continuous sleep is not the norm. In some tribal societies, noise and the need to watch for danger make uninterrupted sleep impossible. It seems people everywhere need more sleep.'"
CPE_60,"Text: 'We're talking about really big cowboy boots here. Expensive ones. I was standing in my $800 designer cowboy boots on the rocks in the Arizona desert. Money wasn't an issue. I wore the full cowboy outfit, thinking it might make me feel like a cowboy. But it didn't. I squinted into the morning sun, looking at the Arizona mountains, and realized I didn't belong there. I had flown in from Denver just after dawn, feeling like I might pass as a cowboy from the sky. But that feeling disappeared when I saw a real cowboy at the Phoenix airport. He was wearing a sweaty T-shirt, needed a shave, and was lifting a dirty bag off the conveyor belt. He noticed my new boots, raised an eyebrow, and walked away without a word. 

I wished there was an outfit for an ex-racing driver that made me feel like I fit in. Something that made me feel like I wasn't out of place. I loved being a racing driver, driving fast cars. I'm addicted to it, and it's all I know. But I don't do it anymore. I can't, even if I wanted to. So, I wondered, looking at the distant mountains, what do I do now? A racing driver should have a backup plan for when they stop racing. I thought I had one, but it vanished when I needed it. 

How about becoming a commentator at the racetrack? 'We have fifteen former drivers ahead of you, Forrest, waiting to be commentators. We'll call you.' Or maybe selling classic cars? That idea lasted almost all winter with meetings and phone calls. But it was a bad year for selling old Ferraris, and Honda was reconsidering its dealers. So, I backed out before there was nothing left. Being an 'ex' anything is tough. Who wants to hear about how I almost became World Champion? Nobody likes a story that ends with 'almost'. Even if I had been champion, people would only listen for a few minutes. Last year's champion is old news. 

I don't want sympathy, and I don't get any. Why should I? I had a good career, made money, and kept enough. But I miss the thrill of driving those powerful cars. Going from zero to 150 miles per hour in 4.9 seconds. I miss the danger and the excitement. I miss the interesting people and the reporters who cared about what I said. Being a little famous wasn't all bad. Businessmen and politicians liked to say they knew me. Kids wanted my autograph. But now that I don't race... Last week, the phone rang only twice. I have a lot of free time now. 

I looked up at the blue sky. No buzzards flying above. Maybe Arizona doesn't have buzzards. But there were some small birds in a cactus nearby, singing as if to tell me to leave. I never thought the desert had songbirds. I realized that a fake cowboy in designer boots has a lot to learn.'"
CPE_1,"**Vancouver**

In the past decade, many people from around the world have moved to Vancouver, located in western Canada. In the evenings, locals enjoy walking through the city streets, and if you join them, you'll likely hear a variety of languages. People are attracted to Vancouver for its mild weather, beautiful location between the ocean and mountains, clean and safe environment, and opportunities for education and work. Although some people complain about the rapid construction of new buildings, it's clear that the influx of new residents and a booming tourism industry have contributed to the city's revival. Vancouver was once called 'Terminal City' because it was a gateway to other places. While the name is less popular now, Vancouver is more of a gateway than ever.

**Putting Pen to Paper**

Journalists, like myself, often aren't great at writing personal letters. Some say it's because we don't like writing for free, but I don't think we're that focused on money. It's more likely that, since we're always trying to make a big impact in our work, we lose the natural flow needed for a letter. True creative artists, who don't consciously focus on the effect of their words (even if they rewrite a passage many times), don't have this issue. I believe that understanding the impact of their words is what truly defines a real artist. When Shakespeare wrote his famous lines, he probably didn't consciously think about how the mix of long words made them powerful, yet it showed his greatness as a writer.

**Supermarket Opening**

In the past, opening a new supermarket in Britain was a big event. You could expect a soap opera star, a radio DJ, or a minor royal to cut the ribbon. Nowadays, new supermarkets open so frequently that celebrities are no longer needed. Why pay a famous person when anyone can do it for free? Last week, waiting pensioners didn't care who opened the new Superbuy store, as long as they were first in line. According to a customer who knew an employee, the first five men would receive a bottle of aftershave, and the first five women, a bunch of flowers. This news quickly spread through the crowd, making those at the front feel pleased and those who arrived later feel envious."
CPE_53,"**Citizen Kane**

When the film *Citizen Kane* was finally released in 1941, it faced a lot of controversy. The release was delayed because distributors were worried about the reaction of William Randolph Hearst, who was thought to be the subject of the film. Despite receiving mostly excellent reviews, the film was not a commercial hit. It was television that later brought it back to public attention. *Citizen Kane* is perhaps the most influential film, inspiring many to become filmmakers. This is especially surprising because it was Orson Welles's first film. Welles said its success came from not knowing what he could or couldn't do, so he just did what he wanted. He had a great team, including cameraman Gregg Toland, screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, and special-effects expert Linwood Dunn. When Welles and Mankiewicz decided to create a story about a newspaper tycoon similar to Hearst, Welles saw it as a perfect opportunity for himself as both director and actor, and he took it with great enthusiasm.

**Dermot and Carmel**

Dermot noticed that Carmel seemed a bit strange that morning. He mentioned twice that he might be late and might stop by the golf club on his way home to chat with someone. Both times, Carmel nodded as if she wasn't really listening. ""Will you be okay? What are you planning to do today?"" he asked. She smiled and said, ""It's funny you ask. I was just thinking I have nothing to do today, so I might walk downtown and look at the shops. It feels almost wrong to just spend the day doing nothing."" Dermot smiled back and said, ""You deserve to enjoy yourself. And as I mentioned, if I'm late, I won't need anything to eat. So don't worry about it."" ""No, that's fine,"" she replied.

**Title Race**

Human nature can be quite amusing. A recent study showed that job titles are a major cause of jealousy and tension at work. A survey by a top recruitment firm found that 90% of employers and 70% of employees agree that titles create divisions among colleagues. Surprisingly, the survey revealed that 70% of office workers would prefer a more 'motivational' or 'professional' job title over a pay raise. If our desire for impressive titles is so strong that it outweighs even the basic desire for more money, we are in a difficult situation. In today's world, no one wants to be seen as inferior. The job titles being discussed focus on skills (like specialist or coordinator) but are really just nicer ways of saying the same thing."
CPE_55,"I was in Vienna to take photographs. Photography was not just my job; it was a big part of my life. I loved how light could change a scene and how a single photo could capture the essence of a place or person. I always hoped to take the perfect picture, as long as I had film in my camera. I once got lucky with a photo of a smoke plume from a burning oil well, which became famous worldwide. After that, I decided to work freelance, but things didn't go as planned. The mid-nineties weren't as successful as I had hoped, even though my photo was on the cover of Time magazine. That's why I was in Vienna, not somewhere more newsworthy. But I was still taking photos and getting paid for it, which was fine by me.

The Vienna assignment came by chance. I had taken photos for a picture book called ""Four Cities in Four Seasons,"" which included London, Paris, Rome, and Vienna. I had captured different seasons in London and was ready to move on. The Austrian photographer, Rudi Schussner, had left the Vienna project, and they offered me the job. The Austrian publishers liked my work, and I was available, unlike the other photographers. I was happy to go because things at home weren't great. A week in snowy Vienna sounded perfect.

They put me up at the Europa Hotel in the heart of the old city. I had been to Vienna before with my wife during a busy summer, but this time was different. As soon as I arrived, I felt inspired by the snowy city. On the first day, I didn't take any photos. Instead, I rode the trams around the city, getting a feel for the place. I wanted this to be my Vienna, not Schussner's. I waited for the right moment to take my photos.

The next morning, I was out at dawn. Fresh snow had covered Stephansplatz, making it look untouched and empty. I struggled to capture the cathedral in one shot because its spire was so tall, and the base was massive. I realized I might have to settle for a partial view, but it could still be magical. Photography has always had a magical quality, even for the pioneers in the 19th century. Watching a photo develop in a dark room is mysterious, and that sense of wonder never goes away. So, when something unexpected happened at Stephansplatz that morning, I wasn't entirely surprised."
CPE_50,"**Kinetic Art Rejoice**

Something amazing has happened at London's Hayward Gallery. It has become a place of wonder, not because of a big-budget show, but thanks to a unique exhibition about kinetic art. Kinetic art is art that involves movement. This exhibition looks at the history of kinetic art over the last 60 years. It shows that creating art that moves or explores movement has been an important, though often overlooked, part of 20th-century art. Curator Guy Brett, who has studied kinetic art for many years, has put together a collection of paintings, drawings, documents, and films. These are displayed without much explanation, allowing visitors to make their own connections and discoveries.

**David Hockney**

David Hockney's art is popular with many people, even those who might not usually be interested in art. This could be because his work is figurative and easy to understand, or because it offers an escape from everyday life. Some people might be drawn to Hockney's personality and humor, which make him a favorite in the media. Critics sometimes say Hockney is overrated, but this might be because being popular is not always seen as a good thing. Hockney himself knows his limits and doesn't claim to be a great artist. He believes that only time will tell how his work is judged.

**Window-shopping - an art exhibition**

I've seen many contemporary art exhibitions, some great and some not so much. What bothers me are shows that try to push a certain idea or trend among artists. Sometimes this works, but often it feels forced. As a curator, I wanted to do something different. I worked with seven artists to create an exhibition in an empty warehouse called 'Window-shopping.' The artworks were connected only by the fact that they were art. For example, Sam Cole's knitted cats chased each other on a toy train track, while Matthew Crawley's video camera experiment flickered on a monitor. These works didn't fit into a specific theme, but they complemented each other through their differences. I didn't make any big statements about contemporary art, but that's okay because art is a personal activity where artists set their own rules.

**Art History**

People who love paintings sometimes avoid analyzing them because they think it might ruin their experience. Some say that art historians focus too much on theory and ignore the joy of simply looking at art. This is like saying that knowing how a dish is made takes away from its taste. Understanding more about art can actually enhance our enjoyment. Pleasure is complex, and how we experience it can be influenced by the society we live in. While it's important to appreciate the sensory experience of art, the idea that thinking about art takes away from its enjoyment is outdated. Art can be both a sensory and intellectual experience."
CPE_25,"**Metals**

Stone Age people might have been interested in metals because they wanted to decorate themselves. Imagine sitting by a river, waiting to catch a fish, when one of our early ancestors found a shiny yellow pebble. It didn't feel like a regular stone, but it was attractive. This is how gold might have become part of their lives. Gold is easy to shape, so it quickly became a popular material. Copper might have been discovered by accident too. Once people realized how useful copper tools were, they eagerly searched for copper ores and ways to extract the metal. This is how metalworking became one of the skills that improved their lives.

**St Ives**

We walked silently, carrying our bags down the winding, cobbled street leading to the town center. We struggled against the strong wind and tried to avoid the cold waves crashing over the promenade. The streets were empty, and the shutters on every waterfront cottage were tightly closed against the storm. We had watched the weather get worse as we arrived in St Ives on the small single-track train. As the dark grey skies closed in, visiting Cornwall in the off-season without a car didn't seem like such a good idea anymore. I had convinced my friend to come with promises of beautiful coastal walks and cozy evenings by open fires.

**Computer Modelling**

Studying the past is challenging because it is gone. The people who lived through peaceful times and hardships are long dead. The reasons they settled in certain places or formed families, clans, villages, and cities are forgotten. Archaeology gives us some clues, but we can't test our ideas with experiments on past cultures. We can't replay history. However, computer modelling offers a solution. It allows us to recreate ancient landscapes and fill them with virtual communities—digital versions of humans with some real-world needs and abilities. We can set rules for behavior and create social groups. Then, we can change conditions, like reducing rainfall or increasing population, and observe how this digital society reacts."
CPE_34,"**Vervet Monkeys**

Cheney and Seyfarth observed a group of vervet monkeys. One day, the dominant male noticed a strange male monkey nearby. This stranger wanted to join the group, which could mean the dominant male would lose his position. To prevent this, the dominant male used a clever trick. Whenever the stranger tried to approach, he gave an alarm call that vervets use to warn about leopards. This scared the stranger back into the trees. The trick worked until the dominant male made a mistake: he gave the alarm call while casually walking in the open, revealing his deception.

**What Cats Catch**

In the English village of Felmersham, residents collected prey caught by their cats. Over a year, 70 cats caught over 1,000 animals. An American professor estimated that, based on these numbers, cats in Britain might be killing 100 million birds and small mammals each year. However, this calculation is misleading because most cats live in towns and catch fewer prey. The important question is whether these numbers are sustainable. The answer seems to be yes, as many people feed birds in winter, and gardens provide nesting sites, keeping bird populations high. The survey showed that cats are significant predators but not destroying Britain's bird population.

**Buffalo's Day**

Buffaloes are very important to marsh people and are well cared for. Every morning, the buffaloes leave their sleeping area slowly and with groans, heading to the reed beds. They stand at the edge, complaining about the day's work, until the leader moves into the water. Once in the water, they seem to forget their purpose and rest there for a while. Eventually, they start moving so slowly that it's hard to notice. They swim with just their noses above water, looking exhausted. They spend the day among the reeds, eating leisurely.

**PICASSO, Pablo - The Soles, 1940**

In early 1940, Picasso painted several still lifes of fish while staying in the fishing port of Royan. One painting shows a fishmonger's slab with a crab and some soles. The fish and crab look alive despite their situation. The painting is complex, with overlapping transparent shapes and soft colors, creating a calm underwater scene. However, there is tension, as the fish and crab seem ready to fight. The sharp forms and even a chain around one fish add a sense of danger, giving the painting a symbolic meaning."
CPE_12,"Photography has been a tool for capturing human life and activities for the past 150 years. In this short time, it has grown to capture moments in time and space, allowing us to see both fleeting moments and vast or tiny details. Photography has shown us images from faraway places on Earth and in space, as well as the complexities and crises of modern life. It has become a powerful way to express the human experience.

However, using images to record events is not new. The earliest examples date back to the Upper Palaeolithic period, about 35,000 years ago. We don't know exactly why early humans created cave paintings—whether to record hunting events, as magic to increase animals for hunting, as religious symbols, or simply to decorate their living spaces. But images have always been a part of human culture.

Throughout history, people have questioned how accurate visual images are and their importance in society. The saying ""seeing is believing"" has given visual images a special status. When photography was invented in the mid-19th century, it promised to provide a truthful visual record automatically. The camera, like the human eye, was seen as a tool that could capture a fixed image, very close to what we actually see. This was a major achievement, as artists had long worked to develop the skills to create such images.

Photography was thought to be a ""universal language"" that everyone could understand. For example, in 1933, photographer August Sander said that even isolated people could understand a photograph of the sky. But as global communication increased in the late 20th century, we began to question whether photography could truly cross cultural differences. Is photography as influenced by cultural norms as language is? Our familiarity with photographs might make us overlook the medium's ability to convey reality.

Photography is often seen as providing clear evidence, making it seem transparent and blurring the line between reality and its photographic representation. It's common for someone to show a photo and say, ""this is my grandson."" Since its invention in 1839, photography and attitudes towards it have changed significantly. Photography has moved from being a simple record-keeper to becoming part of ""mythic time,"" where images have become historical documents revealing much about the people and society that created them.

The camera is not just a silent recorder of events. Photography can inspire social and political change. Just as the development of perspective was crucial to the cultural changes of the Italian Renaissance, photography has played a key role in shaping the media culture of our time. It also brings the harsh realities of the world into our everyday lives, like on a coffee table."
CPE_26,"**How to Write Poetry**

Teaching someone how to write poetry is tricky. It's like walking through a minefield: you need to be spontaneous, but one wrong move can ruin everything. Claiming to know everything about poetry is risky, so instead, I suggest that beginners should read a lot, write often, and let their imagination and spirit run free, as long as it doesn't lead to chaos. Some people need a stable life to write a poem, while others can write even when they're unhappy. Some follow a schedule, while others wait for inspiration. All methods are valid, as long as they aren't just copying someone else's rules. The key is to find your own voice, nurture it, and let it grow until it can stand on its own.

**The Short Story**

In a short story, you can't have too many characters or long descriptions. Flashbacks should be brief and only used if necessary to explain something. A good way to do this is through a quick memory in the main character's mind, which can help move the story forward. Dialogue is very useful because it can show different sides of a situation quickly and keeps the reader interested. Writing too much can ruin a short story, but that doesn't mean it should be as short as a summary. A short story needs to have conflict and action, just like a novel, but every word must be important because of the limited space.

**Screenplays**

Writing a screenplay is like playing chess. Many chess players don't know much, but they know enough to play. They make moves without knowing what will happen next. Over time, they learn that chess is more about long-term strategy than short-term tactics. They start to see the whole game, not just individual moves. In chess, as in screenwriting, the more you practice, the more you understand its complexities.

**Looking at Writing**

Charles Darwin once said that humans naturally speak, as we see in young children, but they don't naturally write. Language is found in all societies, and while languages change, they don't get better. English today is not more complex than ancient languages. All healthy children learn to speak without lessons. When children are together without a common language, they create one. Writing, however, has been invented only a few times in history, in complex societies, and it developed slowly. Until recently, most children didn't learn to read or write, and even today, many struggle. Children are naturally good at speaking, but writing is a skill that must be taught carefully. We need to understand how writing works and how children's minds work to teach them effectively."
CPE_8,"I have never started writing a novel with more uncertainty. I call it a novel because I don't know what else to name it. I don't have much of a story to tell, and it doesn't end with a death or a marriage. Instead, I leave the reader with an open ending. This book is about my memories of a man I met only occasionally, and I don't know much about what happened to him in between those times. I could make up details to fill the gaps and make the story more complete, but I don't want to do that. I just want to share what I know. To protect the privacy of people still alive, I've given them made-up names and taken care to ensure no one can recognize them. The man I'm writing about isn't famous. He might never be. When he dies, he might leave no more impact on the world than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the water's surface. If my book is read, it will be for its own interest. But maybe his chosen way of life and his unique character will influence others, and people might realize that he was a remarkable person. Then, it will be clear who I'm writing about, and those interested in his early life might find something useful in my book. I think my book, despite its limitations, will be a helpful source for his future biographers. I don't claim that the conversations I've included are exact quotes. I never took notes, but I have a good memory for things that matter to me. I've written these conversations in my own words, but I believe they accurately reflect what was said. I mentioned earlier that I haven't invented anything, but I've taken the same liberty as historians to create speeches for people in my story that I didn't hear myself. I've done this to make the scenes more lively and realistic. I want my book to be read, and I think it's fair to make it engaging. Intelligent readers will notice where I've used this technique and can choose to ignore it if they wish. Another reason I'm nervous about this book is that the people I'm writing about are from a different culture. It's hard to truly know people, and I think you can only really understand your own countrymen. People are shaped by where they were born, the places they grew up, the games they played, the food they ate, the schools they went to, the sports they played, and the poets they read. These things make them who they are, and you can't fully understand them unless you've lived them. You can only know them if you are them. Because you can't fully know people from another country just by observing them, it's hard to make them believable in a book. I've never tried to write about anyone but my own countrymen, and if I've done so in short stories, it's because you can describe characters more briefly there. You give the reader broad hints and let them imagine the rest. In this book, I don't claim that my characters see themselves as I describe them; they are seen through my eyes, just like the main character."
CPE_4,"**POETRY RECITALS**

Throughout history, the literary world often seems confusing to those experiencing it. It's only later that we can see clear patterns and recognize important figures. Today, poetry is especially complex with many different styles, debates, and ideas about the poet's role in society. Generally, there is a divide between 'literary' poets, who write for reading on the page, and 'popular' poets, who prefer performing their work to an audience. However, this division isn't strict.

Public poetry readings have become more common over the last twenty years. These events happen in various places, like small town halls, schools, colleges, and arts festivals. The impact of these readings on poets is mixed. For 'pop' poets, who write specifically for live audiences, these performances are beneficial. Their work is often simple and easy to understand in one hearing, but may seem lacking when read on the page.

On the other hand, poets who focus on crafting their work with depth and complexity might not be fully appreciated in a live setting. They might feel pressured to choose their most accessible poems, which might not represent their best work. Listening to poetry readings is not a replacement for reading poetry, but it can be a helpful addition. Hearing poets read their work can show where to place emphasis, but it's best if the audience has the text or knows the poems beforehand.

The main reason for popular poetry recitals, sometimes mixed with music, is to make poetry enjoyable and accessible to everyone, not just a select few."
CPE_30,"**Oral History**

Historians are increasingly using oral evidence, but this method has challenges. It's a mistake to think that someone's spoken account is a perfect reflection of past events. During an interview, both the historian and the person being interviewed influence each other. The historian chooses who to interview and what topics to cover. Even if the historian just listens, their presence can change how the person remembers and talks about the past. The final account is shaped by the historian's social status compared to the interviewee and how the historian has learned to interpret history, which might affect the interviewee's responses. Historians must acknowledge their role in shaping new evidence. However, challenges remain even after the interview. The interviewee's memories might be influenced by other sources, like the media, or altered by nostalgia or later life experiences. Emotions and attitudes can make the testimony seem convincing, but they might not accurately reflect the past.

**Animal Science**

Animal science can be studied in two main ways: focusing on physiology or on the whole animal. Physiologists study how the body functions, such as how nerves and muscles work together to create complex behaviors. Those who study the whole animal look at the behavior of the entire animal and what influences it. Within this approach, psychologists and ethologists are distinguished. Psychologists usually work in labs, studying how certain animals, like rats and pigeons, learn. Ethologists study natural, instinctive behaviors, often in wild settings. Although these fields are merging, physiologists often claim their methods are more fundamental. However, understanding nerve cell functions doesn't eliminate the need to study behavior as a whole. Behavior has its own structure and must be studied at its own level. Describing a bird's nest-building by looking at nerve cells is like trying to read a book with a microscope.

**The Social Sciences**

New social science students face the challenge of learning both the content and the methods of their subject. They need to understand the knowledge and research findings in textbooks and the methods used to gather and organize this knowledge. These two aspects are closely linked. Since we all experience social life daily, social sciences might seem like common sense. However, textbooks show that each social science goes beyond common sense. Each focuses on a specific part of social life, uses particular study methods, and has its own concepts. These concepts form the 'logical basis' of the subject, allowing social scientists to go beyond everyday understanding and distinguishing one discipline from another.

**Classical Architecture**

In Ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was more than just building structures. According to the Roman architect Vitruvius, architecture involves order, arrangement, proportion, symmetry, propriety, and distribution. He used Greek terms for some of these ideas, likely from an earlier Greek source. Utility and function are not part of his definition, though he later discusses the best designs for different purposes. Initially, the focus is on aesthetics, viewing architecture as an art. The origins of classical architecture are complex, with a long history of simple constructions in Greece and Italy that didn't meet Vitruvius' artistic standards. These early structures, though basic, contributed essential elements to later sophisticated architectural designs. Despite their elaborate appearance, classical temples are essentially simple, single-roomed huts."
CPE_7,"The two sisters, Lily and Mui, kept Lily's driving a secret from Chen for a while. Lily would drive around the allotments, near the railway line and gasworks, even jumping a small bridge with all four wheels off the ground, which was her only mistake. Despite this, Chen found it amusing when he discovered what Lily had been doing. ""So you can really drive, Lily? Well done!"" he said. Mui thought men were strange; Chen should have been upset, but instead, he was excited and started planning a trip with Lily. They decided to go on a Monday at the start of next month, leaving early and returning by midday to avoid losing customers. Meanwhile, Lily practiced driving around the allotments. Mui, despite her doubts, bought a road map and got a ten percent discount, which impressed Chen. Lily, however, felt a bit insulted by Mui's lack of trust in her navigation skills.

Within an hour of leaving home, they were looking at the English Channel. Lily drove perfectly, and even Mui, who was ready to give directions from the back seat, had to admit it. Lily overtook a few slow vehicles with great skill, and Chen even applauded. After passing through the gasworks of a seaside town, they drove along the empty promenade. Lily parked in a small street with many empty parking spaces. She wasn't sure about the road markings, so she preferred to pay a fee rather than risk being towed or fined. This cautiousness might have reassured Mui. On the way, Lily noticed Mui's tense face in the mirror and thought it best not to add to her worries.

Lily locked all the van doors carefully. ""Don't worry,"" Chen joked, ""no one will want that heap of tin."" The sisters were annoyed. Lily accused Chen of being ungrateful, and Mui scolded him for being too easily fooled by appearances. Surprised, Chen took their son, Man Kee, to look at the sea. He held Man Kee on the railing, feeling the warmth and responsiveness of his son. In that moment, Chen decided to raise Man Kee his way, ensuring he got a good education and eventually owned many restaurants.

The sight of the sea made Chen feel thoughtful as he planned Man Kee's future. He saw a ship on the horizon and used a telescope to look at it. At first, he couldn't find it, but then he saw it clearly: a small, old tramp steamer. He lifted Man Kee to the eyepiece. ""Do you see the ship, Son?"" he asked. ""It's a special ship for us. It may look small and old, but we know better. It will take us back home when we're done here. It will take you to your homeland, which you've never seen."" Chen kissed Man Kee's head. Lily and Mui joined them, and Lily put her arm around Chen. ""The little old ship,"" Chen said. ""Let your mother see, Son."" Man Kee didn't want to let go of the telescope, and when he finally did, the view was gone. By the time Chen found another coin, the ship had disappeared over the horizon, leaving Lily with a view of seagulls following the ship's wake."
CPE_43,"Text: 'THE WELL I had read somewhere that if you looked up from a deep hole, you could see the stars during the day. I convinced you to help me test this idea. You watched nervously as I pulled up the well bucket, steadied it, and climbed in. I asked you to lower me down. I didn't consider how much heavier the bucket would be with me in it, or that you might not be strong enough to hold it. You tried to hold the handle but then let go, and I fell into the well. I hit my head and saw strange lights, like the stars and planets you see in cartoons when a character gets hit. At first, I was dazed, then scared, then relieved, and finally angry at you for letting me fall and worried about what Mother would say. You called down to see if I was okay. I was about to shout back when you called again, sounding panicked, which stopped me. I lay still, watching you through my eyelashes. You ran off to get help. I quickly climbed out of the well and hid in the shadows near the moat bridge. I could hear voices from the castle. Mother and Father came out with you and Arthur. Mother was upset, and Father told Arthur to use the winch. You looked pale and shocked. I felt a mix of excitement and fear. Then I noticed the trail of water drops I had left from the well to where I was hiding. I was scared someone would see them. Father was shining a flashlight into the well. I couldn't believe no one noticed the drops. Mother was screaming, and I felt guilty. I realized my prank had gone too far and would lead to serious trouble. I regretted not thinking it through. I decided to act like I had just escaped. I came out of hiding, pretending to be weak and exhausted. I told them I found a secret tunnel from the well to the moat and crawled through it. I thought they believed me until Father asked me to repeat the story. I added that the tunnel collapsed after I got out, hoping to stop them from checking. But Father didn't believe me. He looked at me with disappointment, and I realized he saw through my lie. Arthur also looked at me with pity, worried about my character. Their reactions made me feel ashamed and regretful.'"
CPE_51,"**REMOVAL DAY**

Susan, now a widow, is leaving her family home as her children have grown up. The moving van had ""Removers of Distinction"" written on it, and indeed, everything unique about the house was being packed away. Fred, the removal man, with his large fingers, carefully handled the fragile items, while his team was less gentle. Susan was leaving a beautiful four-story house overlooking a small harbor. The memories of her children growing up there lingered like dust in the air. 

When they first bought the house, her son Robert, then five, had asked, ""Mum, when you buy a house, how do you get it home?"" Now, Robert was there helping with the move, making sure Susan didn't mention the piano. Francesca, her daughter, was also helping, insisting that only she could handle the Steinway piano properly.

Fred, the removal man, noted that Susan didn't seem like she was going to cry. Susan asked if people often cried during moves, and Fred explained that they do, but they feel better once everything is at the new place. Susan could understand this feeling. She would have warned the movers about the piano, but Robert insisted it was their job to notice any issues.

The piano was in the best room of the house and would be moved last. Sitting on the stairs, Susan remembered when they first moved in. The piano had been brought in first and got stuck on the stairs. The movers struggled for hours, and Francesca, then a child, cried that they couldn't live without a piano. Her husband Peter had solved the problem by hiring a builder to remove a window and using a crane to bring the piano in. It was an expensive process, and they couldn't afford to tune the piano for months. Peter had said, ""That's there forever,"" but forever is a long time.

Now, the children were busy, and Susan found it hard to move around the house. She thought about the stairs and the imperfect banister rails, feeling she should have warned the movers. But it was too late. Fred reassured her that only the piano was left to move. Susan felt emotional, realizing how moving things made them seem important. 

As the piano was carefully moved down the stairs and out the door, Susan, Robert, and Francesca laughed with relief. They walked down the path together for the last time, arm in arm, with tears of laughter in their eyes."
CPE_11,"Title: Online Literary Criticism for Everyone

The idea of open access to the Internet was meant to allow anyone to publish or share content. In reality, some technical skills were needed, especially in the early days. However, one area that truly became accessible to everyone was literary criticism. With Amazon.com, the first popular online bookstore, anyone could write book reviews. Amazon's approach allowed anyone to express their opinion on a book and rate it up to five stars. This seemed like a great idea because it provided free reviews for Amazon and gave potential buyers insights from other readers, not just publishers or professional critics. Other online bookstores offered similar features, but Amazon, being the largest, attracted the most reviews and also faced the most issues.

This open review system led to some problems. Thousands of reviews were submitted daily, and it was impossible to check them all. Amazon had a team to ensure reviews followed guidelines, such as not allowing single-word reviews, personal attacks, or spoilers. However, reviewers were anonymous, and inappropriate reviews were only removed if noticed by Amazon's team. This allowed for some mischief, like authors writing fake positive reviews for their own books. For example, Lev Grossman wrote fake positive reviews for his book after receiving negative ones. His fake reviews were removed once he admitted to the deception.

Authors could also comment on their books through a special link, but Amazon didn't verify if the comments were truly from the authors, except for well-known writers. For instance, a fake comment pretending to be from John Updike was removed. Most issues arose from reader reviews. When James McElroy's book ""We've Got Spirit"" was published, it received positive reviews from the press but negative ones from people mentioned in the book. These critical reviews disappeared after a few days.

Despite these challenges, Amazon saw the high number of reviews as beneficial for business. Reviews were meant to be a forum for discussing books, not a chat room, so Amazon closely monitored reviews of bestselling books. Silly reviews were more likely to be found on less popular books. For example, a humorous review of ""The Story about Ping,"" a children's book, compared its plot to Internet architecture.

Overall, most reviews on Amazon were serious and provided a good indication of whether a book was worth buying. The writer George Orwell once said that reviewing too many books required inventing feelings about them. This makes the democratization of book reviews a positive development."
CPE_14,"**Art in Modern Times**

In the last two hundred years, we often talk as if every artist must rebel against the art of their time. We praise art for being unique, revolutionary, or even shocking. We admire artists whose work was not appreciated a hundred years ago. But when it comes to contemporary art, we hesitate and say an artist has gone too far, questioning if it can still be called art. The media often voices these doubts for us, and we tend to agree because we expect art to be puzzling and new. This expectation makes us overlook the old themes, methods, and virtues present in today's art. We want artists to be different from the rest of us, with special talents and energy that break conventions. In the past, people commissioned art for specific purposes, making it part of everyday life. Today, we let artists work independently and get annoyed if they try to be more relatable.

**Picture This**

Let me describe a situation and ask an important question about it. An artist selects a piece of text from an art book. The text questions the diversity of pictures, asking, ""What are they all about?"" and concludes, ""There is no end to the number of different kinds of pictures."" The artist then asks someone to prepare a canvas and take it to a sign painter. The sign painter is instructed to write the text on the canvas in simple black letters, without any flashy or charming style. The question is: Is the finished product a painting?

**Underground Encounters**

At the Mercury Gallery in London until June 26th, there is an unspoken rule in the art world that once an artist finds success in a particular style, they should stick to it. Collectors expect consistency, and trying something new can disappoint the public. Gallery owners prefer safe choices, and the art-buying public often seeks comfort in continuity. However, some artists, like Picasso and Hockney, successfully break this mold. Eric Rimmington is another artist challenging expectations. His new show moves away from the still lifes he is known for to paintings of the London Underground. Rimmington has always been fascinated by railways. His earlier drawings of Kings Cross Station led him to explore the underground world. These sketches inspired ""Underground Encounters,"" an exhibition of 40 paintings and drawings capturing the unique charm of this hidden world.

**Extract from a Novel**

I have come to this island with a few books. The villagers joke that only a sick person would choose such a remote place to rebuild. So, I am here to heal myself, if you want to put it that way. Apart from an old peasant woman who comes daily to clean, I am alone. I am neither happy nor unhappy; I feel suspended in memories. I spoke about the uselessness of art but didn't mention its comforts. The solace in my work as a painter or writer is that in silence, reality can be reimagined and shown in a meaningful way. Our everyday actions are like a rough covering hiding the true beauty beneath. For artists, art offers a joyful compromise with life's challenges, not to escape destiny like ordinary people, but to fulfill it through imagination. Otherwise, why do we hurt each other?"
CPE_63,"Text: 'Family Business'

""Look here, it's no good!"" said my Dad. We were driving back to London. My father, with my brother Maurice, had just picked me up from the fancy girls' school I attended. He had also just sat through Parent's Day, where I received the Latin prize and the prize for doing best in my final exams. He had a long talk with my headteacher, and now we were heading home for the holidays.

""What isn't?"" I asked, though I had a feeling about what he was thinking because he was unusually quiet. Normally, he talked a lot. ""You can't fool me. You'll do what you want now,"" he said. ""With all those certificates, I was told you'll get a scholarship to Oxford.""

""So?"" I said, trying to act confident. ""Mightn't that be useful?""

""I also hear,"" he continued, and I knew a confrontation was coming, ""that you want to be a barrister. A barrister of all things!"" My father knew a lot about barristers and the law.

""I just said that,"" I replied. ""I couldn't think of anything else to say!""

""And apparently,"" he went on, ""you have the right personality - you can quickly understand a lot of information, you can talk well, and you enjoy performing.""

""I don't know about that,"" I said. ""I only know what I see in TV dramas.""

""Be that as it may,"" he said, pulling himself together, ""I feel your heart's never going to be in the family business now. Obviously, you'll go to Oxford University, and after that, I can't see you wanting to join us.""

The problem was that, like many children in family trades, I felt trapped by family expectations. I saw different career options and wanted to explore them. At the same time, I didn't want to upset my father. I wasn't as scared of him as Maurice was - I was the favorite - but I found him intimidating.

""It's too soon to know,"" I said weakly.

""I tell you, you're not going to want to join us,"" said my father, who was usually right about these things, ""and it's a pity because you've got the gifts - the brains, the nerves, the vision.""

""There's still Maurice,"" I said, sulking. My father snorted. We both knew Maurice hated the business.

""Anyway,"" I continued, ""you could always use me as a sort of consultant.""

My mother wasn't around to help - she had died when I was young, and my father raised me and Maurice. Maurice was two years younger, and because he was motherless, I got used to taking care of him. It wasn't a burden. I loved Maurice. Because the business was successful, we lived in luxury - a big house in London, fancy schools, nice clothes, parties, theatres, operas. My father knew all kinds of people - politicians, actors, businessmen - and our house was full of interesting conversations.

""I tell you what,"" my father continued. ""You can help us during holidays until you leave Oxford, and then if you decide to leave us, you can. It will give you some pocket money and be a real help to me.""

""OK,"" I said, relieved to avoid immediate decisions and especially the depression and sulks my father would fall into if I opposed him. This was how he controlled us.

So it happened. In my last term at school, and then during university vacations, I helped out, never more than twice a year, and always on safer tasks. I became one of the smarter students, with a little house of my own, a small but powerful white car, designer clothes, and a black dress with a Paris label that I planned to wear for my final exams.

In my last term, my father visited me and took me to a village for a meal and a chat. There were only a few weeks left. My tutor predicted I would get a First Class degree in Law, and I knew that if I stayed focused and used these last days wisely, he might be right. I felt confident and concentrated.

This was not to be. My father told me that, in about a week, he needed me for one last assignment, the most important business the family firm had ever attempted, and that it would be worth my while.

""But Dad,"" I protested, ""I've got my final exams coming up, and I need to focus on that. It's really important that I do well, and I don't want to think about anything else right now.""

I could tell that such pressures were beyond my father's understanding (or maybe he was jealous of my life away from him?) and that he would see a refusal as a betrayal in his time of need. That wasn't all. As he explained the task, I saw more clearly than ever his single-mindedness - the clarity and resourcefulness with which he approached his work, his energy, and self-control. In his way, he was a sort of genius, and I respected that. It made my own plans seem less important.

""All right,"" I said. ""I'll do it."""
CPE_56,"Simon Costello realized that buying the house in Pembroke Square was a mistake within a year of moving in with his wife, Lois. They could only afford it by being extremely careful with money, which wasn't ideal. At first, it seemed like a good decision because Simon had many successful cases, and Lois had returned to her job at an advertising agency with a salary increase to thirty-five thousand. Lois was the one who pushed for the move, arguing that their flat wasn't suitable for a family, and they needed more space, a garden, and a place for an au pair. These needs could have been met in a less expensive area, but Lois wanted more than just space. She felt their old address wasn't suitable for a rising barrister and a successful businesswoman. 

To save money, Lois decided one of them should use public transport. Since her job was far away, Simon had to take the crowded tube, which made him resentful. He often thought about his grandfather's house in Hampstead, where his grandmother made sure his grandfather had peace after a long day in court. But times had changed. Lois made it clear before they married that her career was as important as his. Their lifestyle depended on both their salaries.

Now, their situation was threatened by Venetia, who was very upset when she confronted Simon. She accused him of knowing that a client, Brian Cartwright, had bribed jurors four years ago and that Cartwright had given shares to Simon's fiancée before the trial. Simon denied it, but his denial felt weak even to himself. He felt guilty and remembered feeling similar shame as a child facing punishment. He wished he had been prepared and could have said that Cartwright only mentioned the bribes after the trial and that he didn't believe him. But he lied directly, and Venetia knew it. Simon wondered why she was so angry and if she had the right to ruin his career. He wasn't sure what she could do, but even a rumor could destroy him."
CPE_36,"I chose to live here because I thought I could be anonymous among people who didn't care if their rented houses were falling apart or if their gardens were overgrown. But I was wrong. People in the shops start to recognize you, even if you're not living your ""real life."" The roses next door remind me that the gardens were once loved. Usually, I stay inside, trying to ignore the summer outside, but tonight I'm watching the swifts fly between the trees and roofs. I've cleared some space in the garden for a chair, and my arms are scratched from cutting back rosemary and lemon balm. It's a small London garden where plants have to grow tall or spread out to survive.

My upstairs neighbor, Jaz, leans out of the window. She's written several unpublished manuscripts, and as an English teacher, I sometimes have to pretend to be interested in them. I have her latest one now. ""How's the work going, Jaz?"" I ask. ""In no other job do you have to explain yourself a thousand times a day,"" she replies. Then she offers to bring something to drink from her fridge. I don't really want her in the garden, which now looks messy. The only way to the garden is through my flat, and Jaz is knocking on my door. ""You're on holiday now,"" she says, lounging in shorts and a vest on the chair. ""I should've gone into teaching. Writers don't get holidays. But you know what they say, those who can, do; those who can't, teach."" And some can't do either. ""So, what are your plans for the holidays?"" she asks.

I feel anxious about the school year ending. Empty days, hot pavements, and loneliness in the park. ""Actually, I'm going to Stonebridge tomorrow. Can you feed the cats?"" I ask, my heart racing. ""Of course,"" Jaz says, knowing she will be around. ""Where will you stay? A fancy B&B?"" ""No, I'll stay with my oldest friend, Ruby, at the Rising Sun. We've known each other since we were eight."" It's not true, but I often deal with fiction. ""Going back to your roots. So, what do you think of my manuscript?"" Jaz asks about her work, The Cruelty of Red Vans, which I've only half-read. I like the title and tell her so. Red vans can seem cruel, always bringing gifts to other houses and rejection letters to hers. I decide to be honest. ""Try writing about nice people for a change, people who want to be good,"" I suggest. ""Teachers!"" Jaz responds like a rebellious student. ""I keep a journal,"" I say, ""where I write something good about each day."" My words sound old-fashioned. ""Keep a journal! Nice people! Get a life, Ann,"" Jaz says.

Oh, I have a life. I have my work, and I go out sometimes, reading on the tube. When we finally go inside, my calm kitchen reassures me. Then I suddenly remember my school geography teacher, Miss Tarrantine, who was about my age now, winking at us and saying, ""I've had my moments."" We nearly died laughing."
CPE_6,"**Heritage**

Heritage is important because it connects people and communities to the past. We often feel connected to our personal heritage, knowing about our grandparents and their lives. Beyond personal stories, there is a need to learn about our broader past to understand our future. Heritage gives us a sense of continuity, helping us feel secure about the future by understanding the past. Just like inheriting genes, we inherit culture passed down through generations. Even if there are parts of our national heritage we don't like, it is still part of us and provides a sense of belonging. Heritage teaches us a lot and is essential for our well-being, influencing everything from customs to material culture. Traditionally, we connected with the past through stories from our ancestors. However, Western industrial society disrupted communities, leading to the loss of many oral traditions. Now, places and buildings help us understand our past. It is crucial to preserve these links to honor our ancestors' identities.

**The Fens**

I started writing a novel called ""Waterland,"" where the landscape of the Fens in England became important. People often ask why I, a Londoner with no personal connection to the Fens, chose this setting. I picked the Fens because they seemed plain and empty, a perfect backdrop for my story. However, I learned that the Fens are neither flat nor empty. They are as English as any other part of England but also strangely unique. It's surprising that in the middle of England, the Fens feel foreign to many English people, even though other distinct areas have become part of the nation's cultural heritage. The Fens are both empty and full, cultivated yet wild, open yet mysterious. My research for the novel wasn't extensive; I haven't visited places like Wisbech or Prickwillow. As a fiction writer, I prefer imagining worlds rather than seeking documentary proof. Imagining the Fens has its logic because, as Edward Storey's book shows, the Fens are not just a landscape but a state of mind.

**Museums**

Museums need to make their collections accessible. In the past, this meant putting items in display cases with long labels that were hard to understand. Today, accessibility means more. Displays should be lively and interesting, using theatrical or architectural techniques to engage visitors and evoke emotions. Museums should also reach out to the community. For example, they can provide loan boxes of objects for teachers or use similar materials to help elderly people with memory loss. Museums focus on real artefacts and specimens, not replicas. They offer encounters with authentic items that existed and had meaning in history. This is their strength, setting them apart from heritage centers, theme parks, books, and digital media. Museums that embrace this challenge and offer exciting displays, catalogues, and outreach programs will find that virtual history can actually support them by increasing interest in the real items they offer.

**Architecture and Environment**

The desire to preserve things isn't new, but changes in our towns happen so quickly now that everyone feels their impact. This can turn some people into strong preservationists and make others think more about the nature and future of towns. It's reasonable to say that people who have lived through events like world wars are more inclined to preserve things than those before them. Stability becomes important. If there is a psychological need for preservation, planners should consider it. Change isn't bad if we learn to manage it. Physical changes in our towns reflect social changes, like changes in population, welfare, and demands."
CPE_33,"**Einstein**

If you ask someone on the street to name a scientist, they will probably say Albert Einstein. His image is often used to sell products related to intelligence, like computers and encyclopedias. Most people don't know much about what Einstein did, except that he created some complex theories called 'relativity'. These theories are famous for being hard to understand and for making strange predictions that don't match everyday experiences. Einstein was part of a big change in scientific thinking, which marked the start of modern science in the 20th century. Scientists were trying to describe the universe in a new, more logical way by studying how matter and natural forces interact. Einstein made important contributions by rethinking the basics: time, space, matter, and energy. Before him, scientists followed Isaac Newton's idea that stars and planets moved in a fixed space and time. Einstein changed this idea, saying that time and space are not fixed but relative.

**Young Readers**

When we were children, Lydia and I didn't trust books that won prizes because we thought they would be 'worthy', which to us meant 'boring'. Our mother didn't like our attitude and often criticized us, but our father would happily give us small amounts of money to encourage us to read these 'improving' books. He would also sneak in some better-quality books among our Christmas and birthday gifts, marking them with a note saying, 'This Book is NOT Literature'. Although we ignored most of these books as 'boys' books', he did manage to introduce us to some good short stories and, once, a famous collection of poems.

**Language**

In 1851, Jacob Grimm wrote that 'the origin of human language is truly secret and marvellous'. This mysterious origin has led to many strange ideas. In 1928, Charles Caller suggested that early humans might have made sounds like ""meuh"" when they felt danger. ""Meuh"" sounds sad, and humans in dangerous lands full of scary animals might have made desperate noises. Some words in languages today might still echo these sounds, like 'malaria' meaning ""fever"" or the Latin 'mors' meaning ""death"". Because of such odd theories, many people avoided discussing the origin of language, thinking it was a topic for eccentric people. However, recently, the origin and evolution of language have become important research areas. Language likely developed in East Africa around 100,000 years ago. It was mainly used for friendly communication and played a key role in power struggles. Sharing information was probably not its original purpose, despite philosopher John Locke's idea of language as a 'great conduit' for sharing knowledge."
CPE_20,"Text: 'Writing Reviews Frank Kermode explores the art of writing reviews from a writer's perspective. Most reviews are created and shared under conditions that make them relevant for only a short time. There are deadlines and strict limits on their length. Once published, they last only as long as the newspaper or magazine they appear in—maybe a day, a week, or at most a month. The temporary nature of reviews often defines their literary value. Many people, including the writers themselves, often think that reviewing is a job done out of necessity, like needing extra money, or because they can't spend all day working on a novel or a serious book. However, reviewing is a skilled and complex task. Writing a concise and fair review in 600 to 800 words for a newspaper is different from writing a detailed 6,000 to 8,000-word piece for an international journal. A 1,500-word article in a weekly magazine combines challenges of both short and long reviews. Length isn't the only factor. Reviewers must consider their audience, from casual weekend readers to those deeply interested in the subject. A reviewer needs to know a lot about various topics and write in a way that intelligent readers can understand and enjoy. This means reviewers often write other things besides reviews. The American novelist John Updike, who sees criticism as staying close to the shore, still enjoys writing reviews between his major novels. He collects all his reviews, even the short ones, into books with modest titles. While some might think less famous writers should accept the temporary nature of their work, it's understandable if they want some recognition, especially if they believe their best writing is in their reviews. I feel this way about my own work. My main job has been academic, and most of my serious books are academic, the kind professors are expected to write. In the English-speaking world, unlike some other cultures, there's no strict separation between reviewing and literary study, so it's common for the same people to do both. The days when academics criticized professors for writing reviews are mostly over, and complaints from non-professors about professors taking their opportunities are less common, partly because there's more reviewing work available now. I believe this is good for readers, who can trust that the reviewer knows what they're talking about, and for professors, as it helps keep them grounded. It also reminds them to communicate clearly with non-academics. While they might use complex language with each other, they need to be clear when addressing intelligent non-professors. Ultimately, reviewing is a secondary job. You can only do it well if you are also doing something else well.'"
CPE_40,"Ralph unlocked the door to his apartment and entered the dark, still hallway. Even after three years, he sometimes felt a brief unease about owning the place when he came home alone at the end of the day. When he first bought the flat, he would come home eagerly, wondering what the flat had been like while he was away. It felt like a welcoming place where he was in control. He thought he should worry about things like intruders or plumbing issues, but the flat always seemed to be waiting for him, either tidy or messy, depending on how he left it. Over time, he started to see it as just another part of himself, a space filled with his thoughts and feelings. He became frustrated that it couldn't change. Sometimes, there would be a small pile of letters by the door or the answering machine would have messages, which he appreciated. He was glad the windows weren't broken and nothing was stolen, though he wondered what it would look like if it happened. From his dull office on Holloway Road, Ralph often looked forward to his evenings alone at home. Once he left the office and started his bus ride home, he felt more like himself and didn't need to be alone anymore, though he often forgot this when planning his social life. At his desk, he longed for solitude and time with his belongings, but once home, he felt empty and waited for a sense of self to return. Instead, he felt a deep emptiness, making him think that his unsatisfying job had changed him, moving him away from who he thought he was. He would read or listen to music at night, but now questioned why he did these things. His sense of direction and purpose had faded; thoughts and feelings would come and go without finding a place. He remembered a time when he felt more in control and might have escaped his situation if he had realized his own value. After university, he tried to plan for a better future but found he only wanted to survive quietly. He applied for jobs his friends talked about, following their paths without imagining a job that would make him happy. He went to one interview and didn't think to evaluate the job, an editorial role at a free local newspaper. He was just relieved to have a pleasant conversation with Neil, his boss, and didn't think about the long meetings he now faced daily. Neil offered him the job on the spot, saying Ralph was the only graduate who applied, which Ralph took as a compliment at the time."
CPE_45,"**Goat Racing**

I was about to see goat racing on Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. I pushed through crowds, ice-cream vans, food stalls, and loud music to get a good spot. The racecourse was a simple area marked off for the event. It wasn't like professional racecourses, but people stood on either side of the track to watch the goats race. Keeping the goats in order was a challenge since they are known to eat almost anything.

**Canoe Trip**

As the day ended, I worried about the night ahead. The canoe was too wet to sleep in, and we hadn't seen any villages or huts since morning. In the dim moonlight, we used a torch to see the cliffs, but the batteries were dying. We replaced them, but the new ones didn't work. We couldn't find a place to camp. A few miles later, Lesley thought she saw a light, and we got hopeful. It was just moonlight on the waves. Soon, we heard the loud noise of fast water, but we couldn't see what was happening. Time seemed to stop as we continued on.

**How to be Presentation Perfect - We Answer Your Questions**

I am not naturally good at making presentations, but as a managing director, I often have to present to my colleagues and major shareholders. How can I improve my presentation skills and confidence? 

You're not alone. Presenting requires different skills than running a company, but many senior executives need to be good at it. To convince your audience, you must first convince yourself. Show your belief through passion and enthusiasm in your presentation. This means you need to prepare well. Test your ideas in advance and ask colleagues to think of tough questions the audience might ask. Start by creating a positive atmosphere. Begin with something everyone can relate to and gradually lead to your main point."
CPE_64,"Some activities cannot be rushed; they take the time they need. If you're late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you rush making mayonnaise by adding oil too quickly, it will curdle. If you pull too hard on a tangled fishing line, the knot will tighten. The mind also works at different speeds. Some tasks are done quickly, while others take longer. We can get faster at solving puzzles or doing math in our heads, but some things can't be rushed. If we try, they might fail, like the mayonnaise, or get more complicated, like the fishing line. Sometimes, saying ""Think fast; we need the results"" is as silly as trying to sleep in half the time. We learn and think in different ways, and these ways work at different speeds, suitable for different tasks. ""He who hesitates is lost,"" says one proverb. ""Look before you leap,"" says another. Both are true. The mind has three processing speeds. The first is faster than thought. Some situations need an instant reaction. When my motorbike skidded on a wet road, my brain and body reacted immediately, and only afterward did my conscious mind catch up. A concert pianist or an Olympic fencer doesn't have time to think about their next move. This fast physical intelligence is like our ""wits."" Then there's thought itself, which involves figuring things out, weighing pros and cons, and solving problems. A mechanic fixing an engine, a scientist interpreting results, or a student working on an assignment all use this kind of intelligence, which we call ""intellect."" People good at this are called ""bright"" or ""clever."" Below this is a slower mental process, less clear and more playful or dreamy. In this mode, we are ruminating or meditating. Sitting by the sea, lost in the sound of the waves, or just before sleep, we are in a different mental state than when planning a meal or writing a letter. This slow, seemingly aimless way of thinking is just as intelligent as the faster ones. Allowing the mind to wander is not a luxury to cut back on when life gets busy. Slow thinking is essential. We need the slow mind as much as the fast one. Some problems are better solved with a slow mind. Some mysteries require a relaxed mental attitude. Recent studies show that patient, less deliberate thinking is good for understanding complex or unclear situations. Deliberate thinking works well when the problem is clear. When deciding where to go on holiday, the options might be obvious. But when we don't know what to consider or which questions to ask, or when the issue is too subtle for conscious thought, we need the slow mind. If the problem is managing a difficult team at work or deciding to change careers, it might be better to ponder than to search frantically for answers. This type of intelligence is linked to creativity and wisdom. Poets have long known the limits of conscious thinking and have embraced these slower ways of knowing. Philosophers have written about the parts of the mind beyond conscious thought. Only recently have scientists begun to study these slower ways of knowing. Cognitive science is showing that the unconscious mind can do many important tasks if given time. It can learn patterns too subtle for normal consciousness, understand complex situations, and solve difficult issues better than the conscious mind."
CPE_29,"**Surviving in a Foreign Land**

I have been warmly welcomed here. It's a friendly and well-equipped base camp in a very remote area. At any time, there are about forty people - scientists, students, weather experts, and satellite trackers - forming a close community where everyone helps out. My basic French is just enough to communicate, but not for casual conversation. I miss the subtle meanings, and my phrasebook is useless at breakfast. This isn't a practical problem for me, but at first, it affected my confidence. I found myself slightly dreading mealtimes. I would hesitate, unsure which table to choose, worried about the silence when I spoke, feeling anxious like I did in my first weeks of school. I still smile awkwardly or panic when people talk to me. I think this occasional sadness isn't about missing company or communication; it's because I've lost the social advantage my speaking skills usually give me.

**Elliot**

When I first met Elliot, I was just a young author like any other, and he didn't pay much attention to me. However, he never forgot a face, and when we met again, he would shake hands with me politely but didn't try to get to know me better. If I saw him at the opera with someone important, he often pretended not to see me. But then I had a surprising success as a playwright, and I noticed that Elliot started to show more interest in me. One day, he invited me to lunch, and I thought he was testing me out. After my success brought me many new friends, I began to see him more often.

**Alfred Hitchcock**

The film director Alfred Hitchcock always said he didn't care much about the story or the acting in his films. He focused on the photography, the soundtrack, and all the technical details. For Hitchcock, it wasn't the message or a great performance that moved the audience. He believed that people are affected by pure film, no matter their cultural background. So, if a film is designed well for emotional impact, audiences from Japan and India should react at the same moment. Hitchcock's view of himself was always clear and logical. He was a man of reason and a talented craftsman who enjoyed hearing an audience scream. He didn't deal with speculation or abstract ideas, and he didn't explore his screen characters deeply. He focused on film, pure film, and the precise, calculated beauty of what a strip of film can do to an audience."
CPE_57,"**Amateur Astronomy**

Astronomy has changed a lot in the last 50 years. About 30 years ago, there were not many charts or catalogues, and telescopes were basic. There were also few books on how to do practical astronomy. Today, you can buy almost any telescope or equipment you need. Electronic calculators and computers have changed how we make almanacs and charts, and they help us analyze observations and publish results. This could be considered the best time for amateur astronomy. However, some things have been lost. Now, you might need to travel 80 km to find a sky as clear as it was in cities 50 years ago. During the day, airplane trails can last for hours and turn into clouds, making it hard to observe the sun and stars.

**Too Much Choice**

Society today has too many choices. There are too many things to do and too many options. In the new economy, people always want the latest product or service, and technology makes changes happen faster. New products come out quickly, making it hard to keep up. This can make people feel tired and disconnected from life. More choices mean more stress, less time, and more complexity. Because of this, people are looking for 'simplexity'—simple things that bring meaning in a complex world. But simplifying life is hard when there are so many products and services. There are more types of detergent and breakfast cereals than we need, and more software updates and phone plans than we can follow.

**McAndrews Hotel**

Every summer, we spend two weeks at McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. It is a family tradition started by my grandmother, and it has become very important to us. Nothing can interfere with this ritual. The guests at McAndrews are similar: old-fashioned, maybe a bit odd, and some might say snobbish. I dislike the rude behavior of shop assistants today, which is seen as being equal. I also don't like overly friendly waiters who seem like they might slap you on the back. I know most of the other guests' names because they have been coming here since they were children, like me. But I can be sure that when I see them in the hotel, we will only exchange polite greetings. Such respect for dignity and privacy is rare in commercial places these days."
CPE_9,"**Othello**

The move of an outstanding production of Shakespeare's play ""Othello"" from Stratford to London gives me a chance to correct a harsh review I wrote when it first opened last spring. At that time, I criticized Ray Fearon for being too young for the main role and unfairly judged his acting. I still believe that changing the age difference between Othello and Desdemona alters the tragedy, but I take back my criticism of Mr. Fearon's excellent performance. In fact, the entire cast is excellent. Memorable scenes include Cassio's competitive games with other young officers that become dangerously intense, and the moment when Iago starts to lose control and struggles to regain it. I dare anyone not to be moved to tears during the scene where Emilia helps Desdemona prepare for bed. The pace and tension throughout the play are fantastic. Don't miss this production.

**Lake Vostok**

In the center of Antarctica, nothing moves. On the edges of the continent, there are many penguins, seals, and birds. But on the vast white plateau inside, life cannot survive. Except, that is, in a huge hidden body of freshwater called Lake Vostok, which lies under nearly 4 kilometers of ice, directly beneath the coldest place on earth. The water has been cut off from air and sunlight for up to 25 million years. Biologists are eager to explore its mysterious depths and find out what strange organisms live there. Geologists and glaciologists are also very interested. For two years, researchers worldwide have been planning how to uncover the lake's secrets, and if they succeed, the next few years will be known as the decade of Lake Vostok.

**Scientists**

There was an interesting discussion on the radio last week. It seems that a group of scientists is getting very excited about what motivates them to be scientists; the phrase ""because it's there"" comes to mind. We all know it's the timeless quest for knowledge, the desire to understand everything from atoms to black holes. But these scientists want to know why we want to know all of this in the first place and why science can't explain our curiosity. Surely, it's more important to know whether what we scientists are doing is right, rather than getting stuck in debates about the purpose of it all. I would have thought that the key issue here is not why we pursue science, but to recognize that science is a tool, and we should decide how, where, when, and why to use it."
CPE_42,"**Food**

Our connection with food is very basic and fulfilling. Many people who love cooking buy cookbooks like this one. Often, we think that cooking is only worth it for special occasions or complex dishes. But that's not true. You can make a delicious soup just by putting some chopped carrots, a leek, celery, and a few herbs into water. This is much more satisfying than buying a packet or opening a can. Instead of buying a chocolate mousse with too much sugar and preservatives, you can make a delicious dessert in five minutes that both adults and children will enjoy. Cooking is also a way to show care and love by bringing your own creation, no matter how simple, to the table. Sharing food is full of meaning and meets our deep human needs, which is why all our celebrations, like birthdays and anniversaries, happen around tables. No one would have a takeaway for a wedding or anniversary party! And not many people would want to discuss a business deal over canned soup.

**In the Elevator**

This morning, Alistair tried to tidy up his office, but papers were still everywhere. Tax forms were overflowing from desk drawers and boxes, waiting for a day when he felt like filing them. Plus, there was extra paperwork from owning an apartment building. Books and journals were piled near the new bookshelves. As the elevator took him to his floor, he knew Mallory would be on time for their meeting. She would knock on his office door exactly on the hour. She was very precise about time and neatness. How would she react to the mess? She might think his office had been vandalized. He could pretend to be shocked when he walked in behind her. Mrs. Wilson, his cleaning lady, arrived while he was trying to clear some space on the carpet. He smiled at her hopefully as she unlocked his apartment door. Her look said she had no intention of cleaning his office. She believed he was from somewhere far away, not from her familiar world in Brooklyn.

**KAREN**

Karen wanted to be different from her mother, which led her to create her own story of strength. In her personal story, there were important moments, like when she was twelve and her brother accidentally hit her in the eye with a golf club. At first, she thought she was blind, but the doctor assured her that the bone had protected her eye. She only needed a few stitches, which healed as a reminder of her past suffering. When she opened her eyes in the doctor's office and saw her mother talking about miracles and small mercies, she felt she was saved for a purpose.

**Miss Fogerty**

Miss Fogerty was walking back to her duties across the wet grass of the village green. She felt both excited and sad about what she had just seen. It's thrilling to be the first to know something important, especially in a small community, and Miss Fogerty's life was usually quiet. But she was very sad about Dr. Bailey's condition. He had been her doctor for many years, and she appreciated his care for her yearly throat infections, which were her only health issues. She valued how he always made time for his patients and truly wanted to hear about their worries. This quality made him very loved in the village. He was always ready to give his time, knowledge, and humor, and in return, he received great loyalty and affection."
CPE_59,"Joanna's Lessons

Joanna MacGregor is a busy concert pianist. Despite her hectic schedule, she has started writing books for young children learning the piano. Her performances are so captivating that even someone who is completely tone-deaf would be moved. Watching her play is like seeing a pianist push human limits. However, at a recent concert for children, one boy was not impressed until she played ""Match of the Day,"" a popular TV theme. For Joanna, this was amusing. She realized that in his eyes, she wasn't a real pianist until she played that tune. She easily played it and likely remembered the experience for future children's concerts.

Joanna is unique among top pianists because she is interested in how young children learn the piano. She has published her own beginner piano book for children called ""Joanna MacGregor's Piano World,"" even with her busy schedule. This summer, she is involved in many festivals and projects, including running her own recording label, Sound Circus. She often collaborates with other artists. So why take on writing a book? Joanna believes the first lessons are crucial. She thinks the music profession focuses too much on creating child prodigies, while most people have a more ordinary interest in music, which she finds more interesting.

Joanna's experience comes from teaching beginners between the ages of 18 and 25, before she became a concert pianist. Her childhood was filled with other children learning piano from her mother, which influenced her approach to music. She believes everyone should have the chance to learn piano, just like learning to swim or speak a little French. Some children progress quickly, but she is more interested in those who take their time and enjoy it, even if they eventually stop. She worries that some parents push their children to achieve in music, rather than letting them enjoy it. Children often quit because they can't meet their parents' expectations.

Joanna's books are not the only ones designed to make learning piano fun, but she has a unique approach. She includes a storyline in her books and CDs to make learning interesting. From the first lesson, there are accompaniments in different styles for teachers or parents to play along with the child. If parents can't play, the CDs provide the music. Joanna insists that learning should be fun. She encourages improvisation and exploring the keyboard.

As children progress, they need to learn to read music instead of just playing by ear. Joanna understands this challenge because she relied on her ear as a child. However, she believes practice is the most important factor. She admits she didn't practice seriously until she attended the Royal Academy of Music, where she had to practice to handle difficult contemporary pieces. Now, she enjoys practicing for eight hours a day, which she considers the core of her musical life, even more important than performing.

Joanna sympathizes with those who find practice difficult and believes it's not discussed enough. Her advice is to plan what you want to achieve before practicing, treat yourself by playing the whole piece even with mistakes, and mix hard pieces with easy ones."
CPE_54,"Writing by Hand and on Screen

Dr. Johnson once said that writing without effort is often not enjoyable to read. This suggests that good writing is challenging. When I look back at my handwritten school essays, I notice there were few mistakes. Today, I would rewrite them many times. I think this is because writing by hand was physically hard, which made me think more carefully. The slow process of writing by hand disciplined my mind. Since it was hard to change or erase, I wrote with care. On the other hand, using a computer can lead to carelessness. Many writers find that the time spent fixing early drafts on a computer is similar to the time spent writing by hand. Also, emails, unlike handwritten letters, can be emotionally heavy. Some say emails have brought back the art of love letters, with millions being sent instead of just casual talk. That's a good thing. At least these emails are written in some form of English and grammar. But words on a screen can feel dull. Writers often don't realize the power of written words and may exaggerate their meaning. Words typed quickly lack the care and personality of handwriting.

The CD

I put down my cup and looked at the CD. The case was not impressive, but the shiny disc inside was interesting. ""Aren't they amazing?"" Mr. Warriston said as he came back into the room. I agreed and carefully handed the disc to him. ""It's incredible they can fit seventy minutes of music on them,"" he said, turning on the hi-fi device. He pressed a button, and a small drawer opened. He placed the disc inside, pressed the button again, and the tray slid back in. ""Some people say they sound sterile, but I think they..."" ""Do you have to turn them over, like records?"" I asked. ""What? No,"" Mr. Warriston said, standing up straight. ""No, you only play one side."" ""Why?"" I asked. He looked puzzled, then thoughtful. ""You know,"" he said, ""I have no idea. I don't see why you couldn't make both sides playable and double the capacity..."" He looked at the machine. ""You could have two lasers, or just turn it over by hand... hmm."" He smiled at me. ""Yes, good point."" He nodded at my wooden chair. ""Anyway, let's get you sitting in the best spot for the stereo effect, okay?"" I smiled, happy to have asked a technical question Mr. Warriston couldn't answer.

Books versus Electronic Text

When comparing books and electronic text, author Malcolm Bradbury was right when he said that if matches were invented after lighters, we'd be amazed by the improvement. Many people, excited by new technology, claim that electronic text is as revolutionary as the invention of printing and that this change is almost complete. They ignore that changes in how we think take generations. This kind of talk falls into the trap of thinking our generation is at the center of history. For example, a book from 1979 predicted that the 1980s would see books slowly disappear. So far, that prediction was wrong. Reading long texts on a screen is often unpleasant, so most people don't do it. Also, the way information is organized on computers encourages people to read only parts of texts. Some technology enthusiasts argue that this leads to new forms of storytelling and creativity. But there's nothing new about ""non-linearity."" Many books, like religious texts, dictionaries, and poetry collections, are not read from start to finish. What's new is that computers don't encourage reading a whole text in one go.

The Office

Charles walked into the office and saw a perfectly organized space. The carpet was free of the paper mess that had covered it since it was laid down, and the desk was dark wood, just as he remembered from the Sotheby's auction five weeks ago. Neat file-holders were being placed in their drawers. Twelve years of trade journals filled the shelves on one wall. Kathleen struggled to close the filing cabinet and then turned to him. ""You need to switch to computers, Charles. This is too much."" ""Hello, Kathleen. Oh, this is amazing."" He admired the room and its antique furniture. He wasn't thinking about a computer or any other device, not even a pencil sharpener. ""Simply amazing,"" he said, avoiding the topic of computers. Over the two years he had known her, they had this conversation many times. She couldn't understand why he resisted technology when he was so skilled with computers and had even published an important paper on computer-related talents. She had inspired that paper. With a keyboard, she could transform any software into something new and exciting."
CPE_32,"Text: ""You don't take sugar, do you?"" shouted his secretary. She wasn't really asking because she had been making Lancelot coffee for months. Her excuse for forgetting was that he wasn't usually supposed to be there. But now, he was there all the time. He realized that staying away would lead to chaos. He thought about how he had gone from being a valued advisor, meeting authors and playwrights over lunch, to a stressed worker with no parking space at work. ""This came,"" she yelled, waving a manila folder before putting it in front of him. ""From that guy in Los Angeles. You said you wanted to see it."" The label read: ""A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert."" Below it, it said ""An Expanded Synopsis."" Lancelot didn't want to see another synopsis. He wanted to see a ""First Draft."" Ian Cuthbert had received a large advance for this book when Lancelot bought the company. Ian was one of several old friends Lancelot had made the mistake of commissioning books from. Ian was proof that people with unpredictable temperaments become even less reliable when working with friends. Lancelot skipped the introduction, which he had read many times, and looked at the synopsis. He recognized almost every phrase. He closed the folder and set it aside. It was clear Ian's manuscript would never come. The synopsis lacked the brilliance Ian was known for and felt like it had lost its conviction. Lancelot remembered stories of a famous author whose last book was published incomplete after his death, with payments made chapter by chapter. But in that case, the payments were from a hypothetical advance that was never given. Ian's advance was huge, going against the business principle that authors should deliver a manuscript before being paid. Lancelot, who studied modern languages at Oxford, remembered when Ian was the most promising talent in a Cambridge full of promise. Ian's peers had taken over British theatre quickly, but Ian's energy seemed like laziness compared to them. He wore his coat like a cape and talked about famous French writers as if he had overheard them. Yet, Ian's creative talent remained hidden. While others succeeded, Ian withdrew further. At the peak of his influence, he was difficult to work with. Appointed to edit an arts magazine, he was like a general stuck on the beach with too many opportunities. The magazine used up its budget without publishing once. His contract with a fashion magazine led to stories about his large salary, which increased to try to make him produce more, and then anything at all. At editorial meetings, Ian was witty but harsh, criticizing others' ideas. Ten years later, he was unreliable even for his own funeral. Lancelot was close to admitting that ""A World History of the Short"" was a mistake from the start."
CPE_65,"Text: 'The breakfast change in England

Health experts agree that having a good breakfast is very important. However, historically, breakfast is a relatively new concept in England. In medieval times, breakfast was rarely mentioned in literature. There are some references to travelers eating at dawn before long journeys and to sick people having breakfast for health reasons. But most people, except for kings and nobles, did not eat breakfast. In the sixteenth century, breakfast slowly became common for everyone. Some believe this was because food became more available. However, they often overlook other important social changes. For instance, new work patterns might explain why breakfast became more important. People started working fixed hours, often very early in the morning. So, having breakfast became necessary and was no longer just for the wealthy."
CPE_61,"**Photography**

When a photographer takes a picture, they choose what to include based on their technical skills, artistic taste, personal opinions, and experiences, along with social and cultural norms. In this book, we will explore how these factors influence the style, content, and expression of a photograph, and how viewers perceive and react to these images. For instance, a newspaper reader might have an implicit understanding of the photos they see. However, instead of accepting the photo as it is, we might ask if it truly shows the scene as it was. Or, does it reflect the photographer's perspective? Is the exact moment captured important, or should the photo be seen as a symbol representing a situation in the world?

**More than a Game**

For me, sport has always been more than just a game. The most successful athletes have complete self-confidence. You need to focus entirely if you want to succeed in sports. There's only one way to be the best, and you have to prioritize it above everything else. Sport is tough, and no one will do it for you. It's a matter of survival. Sport has taught me personal discipline and determination, but it also shows the value of teamwork. My sport allows and encourages individual excellence, yet it is a team game, and you must balance these two aspects. It's much like life—you can succeed individually, but you must remember others around you. Sport has given me a lot—not just money. It has opened doors for me and broadened my perspective, allowing me to see things worldwide that others might not. But you also have to sacrifice a lot for these benefits.

**Tuning In**

Some experiences are so vivid that they become clear memories. For me, one such moment happened one night in California years ago. I lay awake, listening to the beautiful singing of a mockingbird hidden in one of the tall trees in the neighborhood. I don't usually have trouble sleeping, but the bird's amazing singing kept me awake. As I listened to its complex melodies, I found myself in an unexpected artistic experience. To follow the bird's patterns, I had to use my knowledge of jazz and Indian classical music. The bird made me feel like I was hearing an incredible, spontaneous musical performance. I reacted with groans and cheers as each surprising musical variation came through the open window, until I finally fell asleep."
CPE_52,"Text: Human culture has always had a lot to say about birds. But what does that say about us? Paul Evans reports. There's a bumping sound from the greenhouse as a small brown bird hits the glass. It's a wren, a bird often seen as a sign or omen. Is it trying to send a message from the edge of my imagination? Or is it just a bird trapped in a greenhouse? Both could be true, depending on your perspective. Wrens have been part of British culture for a long time. In medieval times, people believed the direction a wren flew could predict their luck. Today, images of wrens are still found in British homes, even if the old beliefs have faded. A forest without wrens feels empty. This is because folklore about birds is deeply rooted in our history, from a time when people relied on nature for survival. As cultures change, so do the meanings we attach to animals. For example, in the early 1500s, red kites were common in London and seen as helpful scavengers. But later, they were considered pests and nearly disappeared, except in Wales. Now, red kites are protected and have become symbols of conservation in Britain. Our connection to birds goes back to early human history. The first birdwatchers observed birds to detect predators, weather changes, and food sources, and also saw them as links to the spiritual world. When we ask why birds matter to us, we're also asking about our own identity. Birds represent flight, song, and freedom, which we admire and envy. Some might say these feelings are outdated, but like the appendix or wisdom teeth, they are still part of us. Birds have become indicators of environmental change. In Britain, 30 bird species are endangered, which is not only a loss of unique birds but also a cultural loss. Birds like the skylark, turtle dove, and lapwing symbolize love and magic. Their decline is felt deeply by those familiar with literature and folklore. However, the loss of birds not featured in stories often goes unnoticed. Folklore is important because it connects us to birds in a way that scientific terms cannot. It evokes feelings and attitudes buried under modern life. Whether watching wildlife films or birds in our gardens, the excitement we feel is hard to explain scientifically. Birds engage us in ways we struggle to understand, and the stories we tell about them help us interpret their messages. The wren in the greenhouse creates a link between the present and a distant past, holding its song as it flies into the future, leaving us with a mystery to ponder."
CPE_28,"Maps are used to show the relationships between different points and features on the earth's surface. These relationships are based on distance and direction. In the past, people often measured distance in terms of time, like ""a day's journey by river,"" which told more about how easy it was to travel through an area than the actual distance. Direction was less important for travelers who mainly wanted to know where to go and how far it was. Because of this, written travel guides were popular for a long time, sometimes more so than maps. Even today, some maps, like those of railway systems, might not show true directions accurately. Early maps used signs to show important landmarks, and these signs varied in size to show their importance. The style of these signs depended on the map's purpose and where it was made, so understanding early maps requires knowing the conventions used at the time.

The history of map-making, or cartography, is about improving the accuracy of distance and direction and adding more details to maps. Cartography has used other sciences to help with this. For example, instead of using shadows or stars to find direction, people used the magnetic compass, which allowed for more precise measurements. As people explored more of the world, they tried to map it more accurately. Astronomers found out that the earth is slightly flattened at the poles, which led to more precise mapping of large areas.

Over time, the needs of map users changed. Travelers and merchants were no longer the only ones using maps. Soldiers needed accurate maps for artillery, which required showing the land's surface features accurately. This led to the invention of contour lines. Archaeologists, historians, and modern geographers also had specific needs for maps. Today's cartographers have developed ways to map various distributions, like geological layers and land use. The recognition of maps' value in many sciences has led to a modern revival of cartography.

However, the development of cartography has not been a smooth, continuous process. There have been times of slow progress and times of rapid development. Sometimes old ideas persisted alongside new ones. Cartographers often knew what needed to be done but had to wait for better tools to implement their ideas. Since it was easier to copy old maps, and because of the investment in printing, map publishers were sometimes slow to adopt new ideas. Therefore, maps should not be taken as perfect evidence of the knowledge and techniques of their time. The many maps we have today are the result of much human effort and thought, making them valuable records for studying human history. This is what makes the study of historical cartography so interesting and educational."
CPE_35,"TIM RICE

I was invited into a young man's living room, which felt like a calm and cultured space compared to the messy rooms around it where his less ambitious family members spent their time. Moving from the kitchen to his living room felt like going from economy to business class on a flight. This room had the largest collection of records I had ever seen, the first stereo record player and tuner I had encountered, and surprisingly, a teenager who had spent money on Georgian wine glasses, pictures, and furniture. His name was Andrew Lloyd Webber. He had won a scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford, to study history, and he had nine months before starting. During this time, he wanted to become England's version of the composer Richard Rodgers. My own dreams were just as wild; I wanted to be a pop star for the usual reasons: women, money, and fame. The difference between Andrew and me was that my dreams weren't a matter of life or death, though I can say that now. They might have been if I had failed. So, when Andrew suggested a new crazy ambition for me—to become as famous a lyricist as Oscar Hammerstein—I was open to trying it. This was partly because, within ten minutes of meeting, he played me three tunes he had composed, and I could tell he was very talented. As he confidently played selections from the many shows he had written and produced at school, I was reminded of the best show albums from my parents' LP collection. He needed a new lyricist for the outside world. I didn't have much to impress him with, except for instant praise for his music and a real, released seven-inch single of a song I had written (both words and music) that an unknown pop group had recorded three months earlier, which ended their failing career. We parted, promising to meet again and write something together. I was still more interested in the music charts than in West End theatre, but on the bus back to my flat, I told myself I had just met someone with rare talent and determination, and I would be foolish to miss the chance to work with someone who was clearly going to make a big impact on musical theatre, probably very soon. And even if we didn't succeed in challenging the top musical composers, we could try to compete with the Beatles and Rolling Stones later in the summer. The Everly Brothers had just made a comeback and would need new material. The next day, back at my desk in the office where I was training to become a lawyer, the certainty I had felt about a life in show business with Andrew Lloyd Webber had faded a bit. I would, of course, keep looking at the small ads in Melody Maker for groups needing a vocalist and would write a few more simple songs that wouldn't show the limitations of my voice, but it was still likely that I would eventually pass my exams and become a respectable lawyer by the time I was twenty-five. By then, I would surely have outgrown pop music, as my father confidently predicted I would by the time I was twenty-one. This was worrying—if he was right, I only had a few more months to enjoy it. But in the meantime, I felt I had nothing to lose by seeing Andrew again. It would be fun to see a musical with him and to write lyrics that imitated musical lyricists rather than pop stars. Andrew was a fascinating person who talked about Good Food Guides and Victorian architecture, and he supported the Leyton Orient football team. I wasn't convinced by the idea for a musical he had been working on for the past year, but in 1965, I was rarely convinced about anything. His talent was undeniable, and he claimed to have all the contacts. I was soon back in his living room. The idea was about the life of Dr. Thomas Barnardo, the nineteenth-century philanthropist who founded the orphanages that bear his name. His story was indeed worthy, but it didn't really inspire me. The hero was too perfect, at least in Andrew's version of his life, and the project was unoriginal in both concept and execution, borrowing too much from Lionel Bart's hit show, Oliver. On the other hand, Andrew's belief in the brilliance of his score was infectious and not entirely unjustified. What did I know about musicals? As David Land, who later became my agent for over twenty-five years, memorably (and repeatedly) said, if there's a demand for one hamburger bar on the block, there's room for two. We could be the second hamburger joint. I started working with great enthusiasm, especially on the songs meant to be funny. Andrew outlined the plot, played me the tunes, and often gave me the title as well, most of which had probably been thought up by his former school friend who had already tried. I skipped a day at the solicitor's office, pretending to be sick, to write my first batch of theatrical lyrics. I didn't know it that day, but I had changed careers."
CPE_5,"**Language**

Humans have an amazing ability: we can influence each other's thoughts with great accuracy through language. Language is so essential to human life that it's hard to imagine living without it. If you see two or more people together anywhere in the world, they will likely start talking. Even when alone, people often talk to themselves, their pets, or even their plants. I like to think of language as an 'instinct.' This means that people know how to speak naturally, much like how spiders know how to spin webs. Spiders didn't learn web-spinning from a genius spider or need special training; it's just something they do naturally.

**Climate and Weather**

Climate and weather, mainly created by the air around us, have a big impact on where animals and plants live. Climate can shape the look of landscapes. For example, warm and wet conditions all year allow tropical jungles to grow, which are rich in different species. On the other hand, cold and windy areas have fewer living things. Daily weather patterns, which together form the climate, are caused by large air masses moving and mixing, as the atmosphere is always in motion. Some of this movement is because the air surrounds a spinning Earth, and since air is light, it doesn't move as fast as the Earth. However, the sun is a more important cause of air movement.

**Coffee**

As a bar-person, I had to serve drinks and, more importantly, make coffee. In Lygon Street, Melbourne, a restaurant's success can depend on its coffee. I went through several days of intense coffee-making training, learning more than I ever wanted to about cleaning and maintaining the restaurant's shiny espresso machine. I also learned the key steps to making a perfect cup of rich, frothy cappuccino. By the end of the first week, I realized that making a good cup of coffee was harder than it seemed, and I thought I might be demoted to cleaning ashtrays. Fortunately, my boss was patient. ""Making coffee is both an art and a science,"" he said, ""and you need time to get the hang of it."""
CPE_41,"**Art on TV**

Why does television often fail to create good programs about visual arts like painting and sculpture? These art forms should be perfect for TV because cameras can show the whole artwork and then zoom in on details. However, there are few TV series that successfully show both the enjoyment and complexity of viewing art. A good example of this issue is Robert Hughes's series ""American Visions,"" which is about American art. Hughes is a reliable critic with a strong personality, and he had almost eight hours to introduce British viewers to American art, which is often ignored by British galleries. I expected the series to focus on great artworks, but instead, it was more about how American history and culture are shown in its art and architecture.

**Dealing in Metals**

For 20 years, I worked as an international metals dealer and became known as a speculator. The metals market is less regulated than others. With some luck, a willingness to take risks, and a good understanding of the market, you can make a lot of money. Risk-taking is a normal part of the industry. This adventurous culture fits well with a free-market global economy. However, free-trade economists who thought the market would keep the prices of scarce metals stable have found the opposite. More minerals are being extracted, and the cost of raw materials is going down. Considering inflation, the prices of most metals are about half of what they were 20 years ago. Recently, I was asked to investigate claims against a multinational company that benefits from these cheap raw materials.

**Extract from a Holiday Brochure**

Abaco and its offshore cays are part of the 700 islands of the Bahamas, stretching from Florida past the Tropic of Cancer to Cuba. Each island has its own character and offers something unique. To get around the islands and cays of Abaco, you need a boat. If your accommodation doesn't include one, don't worry. There are many ferries and water-taxis available. You can also rent a boat if you prefer to travel independently. Sailing is the most popular way to get around here. Abaco is called 'The Sailing Capital of the World' for a good reason. The calm, naturally protected waters are perfect for fishing, diving, snorkeling, and swimming. The cays and their beaches stretch for 200 miles like a string of pearls. It's not just the sea that has treasures. At night, the lights of the restaurants and cafes in Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay shine brightly."
CPE_69,"Text: 'Build it yourself at the UK's first bamboo bike workshop

At the Bamboo Bike Club, run by engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan, you can join a course to build your own custom bamboo bike frame. It's a fun weekend activity in Hackney Wick, east London. On a Saturday morning, the Bamboo Bike Club is buzzing with activity. Bamboo is becoming a popular material for bike construction, with companies like Calfee Design in California and Bamboo Bikes in Yorkshire leading the way. However, these bikes can be expensive, with ready-made frames costing around $2,995 or £1,868.

James and Ian wanted to make bamboo bikes more affordable. They spent years developing their idea in a shed in Brecon, Wales. They realized they didn't just want to sell frames; they wanted to share the experience of making something unique and sustainable. This led to the creation of the Bamboo Bike Club, which is more of a community project than a business. James works with wind turbines, and Ian is a civil engineer, but they run monthly courses where participants can build their own bike frames.

The course teaches you how to select bamboo for strength and form strong joints. You start by assembling the front triangle of the bike with 40 mm diameter bamboo, then move on to the seat and chain assembly. Alloy tubes are used for parts that need extra strength, like the handlebars and wheel forks. The process involves using jigs, power tools, and design blueprints, which can be challenging for those not used to DIY projects. However, James and Ian are there to help and ensure everything is done correctly.

Building the bike yourself is a big part of the appeal, and many participants are engineers. But even if you're not, Ian reassures that mistakes are okay and you can always try again. The bamboo is pre-checked for quality, and you can choose from different styles like plain, black, or mottled bamboo.

On Sunday, the focus is on building the lugs, or wraps, using hemp bindings and epoxy resin to create strong joints. A final polymer coating makes the bike waterproof. Once finished, the bike is ready for wheels, brakes, gears, and other personal touches. These bikes are built to last and are as strong as metal ones. Ian has used his for over a year on a 16-mile commute, and James has tested one off-road for three months without any issues.

Bamboo bikes may look a bit rough compared to professional frames, but they have a unique charm. They are ideal for a relaxed ride rather than racing. I chose a 'Classic English' frame for a smooth, easy-going ride. The bikes are light and absorb vibrations well, making them comfortable to ride. James says the real joy comes when you take the bike on the road. The price for building your own bamboo bike is less than £500, making it an affordable and enjoyable project.'"
CPE_38,"**Self-help Books**

Dione Reverend was just an editor at Random House in New York when she first saw a manuscript by an unknown pop psychologist, Dr. John Gray. ""I took one look at the title and knew it would be a number one bestseller,"" she says, laughing. She was right. Dr. Gray, who is very understanding, is now a multimillionaire, and Dione Reverend has her own company. Dr. Gray's small book on how to improve communication between men and women is a key part of the growing self-help industry. This industry claims to help Americans who want to improve their lives. It also benefits from these desires, creates many more, and supports the New York publishing world. Britain is learning that this genre can fill shelves with books that are as exaggerated as their covers. However, many self-help books are rejected for being too similar to others or too specialized, which is a relief. Editors are looking for the next big hit, and the writing style is not their main concern. What matters is how marketable the book is. ""How promotable is the author? What's the 'hook'? Is it universal enough?"" Ms. Reverend lists the key questions and admits, ""If someone comes to me with a really catchy title, that's two-thirds of the battle won. You know you can reach people.""

**Autobiographies**

There needs to be an unspoken agreement between an autobiographer and the reader that the truth is being told. This agreement is rarely fully kept. There are many reasons why a writer might not tell the whole truth. They might feel too ashamed to share certain actions or thoughts. They might leave out things they think are not important. There are also more complex reasons for not sticking to the truth. The writer might believe that inventing stories can better capture the truth about themselves than sticking strictly to the facts. Or they might decide from the start not to follow the truth at all. They might call their book an autobiography to make readers believe it is true, which helps them tell their story. Some readers might still believe it is true even after finishing the book, thinking they have read a true story when it is actually fiction. This can be done without any intention to deceive.

**Dashiell Hammett's Detective Stories**

Experts on detective stories say this genre became popular because it reflects the conflicts of late 19th and early 20th-century society. A detective story is like a symbolic story. The crime represents human desires like lust or greed, and solving it, at least in traditional stories, shows how a person can fit back into society, calming their lawless desires so society can work smoothly again. In Hammett's unique version, society returns to its previous state, but it is shown to be corrupt and false. The detective and the criminal in Hammett's stories are two sides of the same person. They understand each other and are, in a strange way, comfortable with each other. The private detective is part of both the criminal world and the law. To criminals, he seems too honest, and to the law, he seems too shady. He is both a criminal and a competitor. The private detective's mission is sometimes affected by his feeling of being part of both worlds, and sometimes his desire to punish is stronger because he is worried about this ambiguity.

**Science Writing**

Stephen Jay Gould is considered today's greatest scientific essayist. To talk about his writing and get his advice, I met him at the Grand Hotel, where he was staying while promoting his new book. Neither of us felt very comfortable there. Gould said, ""I couldn't write about a place like this: Trollope might, but he knew the culture. Understanding the culture is key to being a successful writer. Science, for example, is its own civilization. Only scientists can effectively present it. If you don't live in the community and don't understand its rules, you are at a disadvantage from the start."" One of Gould's principles is to never underestimate the reader. ""Make no concessions,"" he says. ""You can simplify the language but must never dilute it. Above all, you cannot simplify the argument. Once readers feel they are being talked down to, your piece is finished."""
CPE_17,"**Air-conditioning**

At Cannons Gym, a popular spot for City of London workers during lunch, the air feels very cold. To cope with this summer's high temperatures, the gym has used a lot of air-conditioning. At quieter times, it feels as cold as the Arctic. This is an example of how air-conditioning is often overused in modern life. It has become a key part of work and leisure, showing how humans can control or change the climate. However, many buildings with air-conditioning could use other cooling methods. They could use natural light and ventilation and have thicker walls that absorb less heat during the day and release it at night. These simple measures can be very effective and would greatly reduce the need for air-conditioning.

**Sundials**

It's not a coincidence that the start of a new millennium has brought renewed interest in sundials, which measure time based on the sun's position. A hundred years ago, sundials were essential for keeping clocks accurate. As clocks and watches improved, sundials became garden decorations—romantic but outdated in a modern technological age. Now, interest in them is growing again. David Harber, a sundial maker, believes their charm comes from their connection to the planets. He says there's a magical moment when a sundial starts working. They are calm, romantic objects that remind us of our place in the universe.

**Paint Your Own China**

My idea of china-painting came from a visit to an arts and crafts show long ago, where serious-looking older women showed how to paint delicate flowers on a teacup with precise brushstrokes. It was fascinating because each stroke created a perfect petal or leaf. Their hands were steady, and the paint never smudged, suggesting they had either practiced for years or had a natural talent for precision. Remembering this, I wondered who would be brave enough to take a china-painting course. Would beginners show natural artistic skill? In reality, the atmosphere was not intimidating. The students were there to have fun, and even the teacher didn't want to paint petals on teacups as quickly and precisely as I remembered."
CPE_47,"Uncle chose a package holiday for Keith and Dawne at a good price: a flight from Gatwick Airport and twelve nights in Venice at the Pensione Concordia. When they went to book the trip, the travel agent mentioned that the other people in their package were a school group learning Italian. However, something went wrong. Either at the travel agency, the check-in desk, or in a computer, a mistake happened. Keith and Dawne ended up in a hotel called the Edelweiss, in Room 212, in Switzerland instead of Venice.

At Gatwick, they gave their tickets to a girl in a yellow-and-red uniform. She checked their details and said everything was fine. On the plane, they were surprised to hear people speaking with North of England accents. Keith thought maybe there was a cancellation or the Italian class was on another plane. They ordered drinks and relaxed.

When they landed, a woman with glasses told everyone to stay together. There was no mention of an overnight stop in their brochure, but Keith thought it was just a stopover. It was almost midnight when they arrived at the hotel, and they were too tired to question it. The next morning, they realized they were supposed to stay there for the whole holiday, and they became worried.

The receptionist told them about the lake and the steamer to Interlaken. Keith calmly explained there was a mistake; they were supposed to be in Venice. The receptionist didn't know about any mistake. Dawne described the travel agent who booked their trip, hoping it would help.

A woman named Mrs. Franks, who they had seen at Gatwick, approached them. Dawne asked if she was in charge because they were in the wrong hotel. Keith explained they must have joined the wrong group. Mrs. Franks explained that many holidays have similar tickets and labels, and it was easy to follow the wrong group.

Keith insisted they were not meant to be in Switzerland. Mrs. Franks said she would check and left them standing there. The receptionist was gone, and they heard typing. Dawne thought Mrs. Franks seemed kind, but Keith was lost in thought, trying to remember everything that happened.

An elderly couple, Mr. and Mrs. Nottage, interrupted Keith's thoughts, saying they had a great night's sleep. Keith and Dawne left the reception area. They didn't mention the irony of ending up on a holiday with elderly people when they wanted to escape the demands of the elderly. Uncle had insisted on this trip, even though they tried to convince him to come with them."
CPE_48,"Text: 'HE WAS A PEOPLE PERSON American executives are now looking up to the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton as a model for good management. Eluned Price reports. In Britain, most people know who Sir Ernest Shackleton was and have a general idea of his achievements. However, America has only recently discovered him. The Wall Street Journal described Shackleton as 'an Antarctic explorer whose feats went largely unnoticed for most of the 20th century,' which might be an exaggeration. But now, Americans are showing great enthusiasm for him. Biographies and accounts of the Endurance voyage are being produced and are expected to sell quickly. The American Museum of Natural History is organizing a major exhibition, and Columbia Tristar is making a film about Shackleton's life. Some American managers have also started to see Shackleton as a role model. His admirers share stories of his achievements with admiration and draw lessons in leadership and communication from them. They even refer to each other as 'speaking Shackleton.' The determined and resourceful Shackleton, with his reindeer sleeping bag and blubber-stove, has become a model for modern management consultants. Jim MacGregor, the managing partner of Abernathy MacGregor Frank in New York, chose Shackleton as a role model years ago. His firm specializes in 'communication aspects of mergers and acquisitions and corporate crises.' For example, dealing with situations like 'this firm's plant blew up' or 'half the workforce has to go.' While Shackleton once worked in public relations for a Glasgow steelworks, it might be hard to see the connection between surviving on albatross in freezing temperatures and handling a financial crisis. 'Even if a company manages its crises well, it can still cause harm by communicating poorly,' says MacGregor. 'Shackleton is a model for management because of his leadership and communication skills. He had his values in order and was at his best when he and his team had a lot to lose, like their lives. One of Shackleton's most fascinating decisions was to turn back when only 97 miles from the South Pole. That decision showed his credibility for future expeditions: the lives of his men were most important.' This refers to Shackleton's 1908 expedition to the South Pole when, 97 miles short of their goal, with supplies running low and limited time to return to their ship, Shackleton made the brave decision to turn back. In a crisis, says MacGregor, people want to know someone is in charge. While managers today often avoid responsibility, Shackleton was ready to take it on. His 1914 expedition became legendary. His ship, the Endurance, was trapped in ice for nine months and eventually crushed. When it sank, Shackleton told his men, 'we should all eventually reach safety if you continue to do your best and trust me.' From the accounts and diaries kept by his men, it's clear that Shackleton was always in charge. 'Shackleton thought everything through, planned for every possibility, kept his men informed, and sought their opinions,' says MacGregor. 'He was adaptable, willing to let go of losses and start anew. We've developed effective principles here that Shackleton exemplifies. Clients can relate to his story without feeling criticized.' Shackleton believed an explorer needs optimism, physical endurance, and patience. 'One of the hardest things to do in desperate situations is to do nothing, especially in America, where the culture is against letting time solve problems,' says MacGregor. 'If you buy bonds and guess wrong on interest rates, you hold on, and eventually, you'll get your money back. To ""fix it"" and sell would mean a big loss. Similarly, don't be afraid to change plans if they're not working. If a new product fails, don't keep selling it.' Shackleton led by example. On the return journey from the Endurance, he saw Hurley, the expedition photographer, without gloves. He forced his own gloves on Hurley, saying if he didn't wear them, he would throw them overboard. Someone else remembered him doing the same with a biscuit when they were starving on the 1905 expedition: 'He said he'd leave it in the snow. Millions of pounds couldn't have bought that biscuit.' As Caroline Alexander, author of Endurance, the human account of that expedition, says: 'The public's interest in heroic efforts is growing. Shackleton shows that there is little heroism today. Everything else fades away, and he stands as the true embodiment of the ideals we long for now.'"
CAE_15,"In the forests of Madagascar, there is a primate called the aye-aye that has a lifestyle similar to a woodpecker. Both the woodpecker and the aye-aye search for insect larvae by making holes in wood. The woodpecker uses its beak and long tongue, while the aye-aye uses its sharp teeth and a long, thin third finger. Although scientists knew about the aye-aye's feeding habits for over a hundred years, they recently discovered how it finds insects inside the wood.

Dr. Carl Erickson from Duke University studied the hunting skills of some aye-ayes named Nosferatu, Poe, Samantha, and her daughter Annabelle. He tested if they found insects by looking for visual signs, like holes on the wood surface. He gave them logs with drilled holes, some leading to mealworms and others to empty spaces. The aye-ayes went directly to the mealworms without needing visual clues.

Dr. Erickson also tested if the aye-ayes used smell or sound to find the insects. They could still locate mealworms even when the smell was blocked and when the mealworms were dead and silent. This showed they weren't using sight, smell, or hearing.

Dr. Erickson found that aye-ayes could sense empty spaces in the wood. They tap the wood with their middle finger and listen with their large ears. He suggests they use echo-location, like bats, to detect hollow spaces. They might also hear insects moving when disturbed by the tapping.

The idea that aye-ayes take the place of woodpeckers in Madagascar is interesting, but there are birds like the Sickle-billed and Nuthatch Vangas that also search for insects in wood. The aye-aye is unique because it combines traits of a woodpecker, an echo-locating bat, and even a squirrel. Its teeth grow continuously like a squirrel's, and it has been seen in the wild gnawing through nut shells and using its long finger to get the nut meat."
CAE_19,"Text: 'Ordinary people, ordinary lives Most of us have photos of our grandparents, but how many of us know what their lives were like when they were young? Diaries give us small, incomplete glimpses, and family stories are often only half remembered. What will our grandchildren know about us? We often plan to write things down but never do. We might leave videos instead of photos, but they are still just images. Hannah Renier has a solution: she writes autobiographies for other people, creating a hardback book of at least 20,000 words, with pictures if needed. These books are not about famous people, but about ordinary ones. The idea came to her when she talked to her family and realized how much of the past was disappearing. ""When I started, I didn't take it as seriously as I do now,"" she says. ""I've met people who have led interesting lives. They say they do it for their children or for the future, but they also enjoy it themselves."" The promise of privacy helps people be honest. ""I had the confidence to be honest,"" says a 62-year-old man who made and lost a fortune before making another. ""I was surprised at what came out. There were painful things, like my divorce, and the pain was still there."" ""I did it for my family, so they might learn something, but I haven't let my children read it yet. They were hurt by things in my life, and there are details I don't want them to know right now. If they insist, I'll let them. But I'd rather they read it after I'm gone."" He also saw patterns from his childhood that led to repeated mistakes. Ms. Renier has noticed this in others too. ""It's amazing how many people are influenced by their parents,"" she says. ""The things parents say and do affect their children for life. People often marry someone their parents would approve of, or they rebel and do the opposite."" ""Many disappointments come out. Even sixty years later, people regret or resent things that were never resolved with their parents. There is no age of reason. If people had issues in their youth, they still have them in middle age. They try to impress a parent who wasn't impressed, and if that fails, some seek permission to say 'I can't stand my mother.'"" Ms. Renier is more of a recorder than an interrogator and keeps her distance. ""It's not for the public, and I'm not there to be nosy. People sometimes tell me things and then say, 'I'm not sure if that should go in.' I include it anyway—they can remove it when they see the draft. But generally, people want to be honest, with all their flaws."" ""It's not vanity publishing. It's not people saying, 'I've had such an interesting life, the world needs to know.' Things are changing faster than ever, and we're losing touch with the past. This is a way to connect with our roots. We need a link to our ancestors because families don't sit together as they used to. People want a little immortality."" Each book involves up to 30 hours of recorded interviews, which Ms. Renier uses to write the life story, rearranging the timeline and interpreting. Modern technology allows her to produce everything except the binding with its gold lettering: you can choose your own color and title. Fascinating to the private audience each book is for, the results are not about revealing secrets at any cost. Ms. Renier organizes her material logically and writes well, so the final content is as good as its subject. The book looks high-quality and costs nearly £3,000, with extra copies at £25 each. She gets about 10 inquiries a week, but the cost, due to the time involved, deters many people. ""I thought it would be a more affordable product,"" she says. ""But the people I've worked with have all been well-off, readers of Harpers & Queen, where I advertise. They're the kind of people who would have had their portraits painted for their descendants.""'"
CAE_24,"**A. The University Museum of Classical Archaeology**

The Museum of Classical Archaeology has one of the few remaining collections of Greek and Roman sculpture casts in the world, with over 600 pieces. It's important to know that none of the sculptures are original; they are all precise copies made from the originals, mostly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The museum is located in a specially designed gallery with great natural light. Plaster casts have many benefits: sculptures that were originally displayed together but are now in different museums across Europe can be seen together as they were meant to be. You can view almost all the famous Greek and Roman sculptures in just one afternoon.

Cambridge Darkroom is a photography center with community darkrooms and a gallery that hosts various photography exhibitions. We offer courses and workshops for all ages and skill levels, including a popular Beginner's Course, a shorter Induction Course, and Master Classes with guest photographers. We have a membership program that allows members to use our darkrooms. We also support young photographers (ages 12 to 16) through our Young Members scheme, led by our resident photographer. We sell photography books, magazines, and a full range of photographic materials.

**C. Sedgwick Museum of Geology**

The Sedgwick Museum has an impressive collection of fossil animals and plants, rocks, and minerals from all geological ages and parts of the world. It also holds Britain's oldest complete geological collection, belonging to Dr. John Woodward (1665-1728), with nearly 10,000 rare specimens in their original 18th-century cabinets. Adam Sedgwick, a Professor of Geology, greatly expanded the collections, creating an outstanding museum. The collection is organized by geological age, allowing visitors to trace major changes in life on Earth over time. The new Whewell Gallery displays beautiful minerals and gems, with detailed labels explaining their nature and modern uses.

**D. The Cambridge University Collection of Air Photographs**

This collection includes over 400,000 oblique and vertical air photographs taken by university staff over the past 45 years. The University has its own aircraft at Cambridge Airport and conducts photographic work throughout Great Britain. The photographs are interesting as they provide a detailed, year-by-year record of the landscape, showing both natural features and human impact from prehistoric times to today. There is a small display in the entrance hall, and the knowledgeable library staff can help with inquiries. The photographs cannot be borrowed, but copies can be purchased, usually taking about a month to make.

**E. Cambridge Medieval Brass Rubbing Centre**

The Cambridge Brass Rubbing Centre is the second oldest and longest-running center of its kind in the world, and it's a unique tourist attraction. Visitors can enjoy making wall hangings by rubbing one of over a hundred different brass plates from the tombs of medieval knights and ladies. By creating resin copies, known as facsimiles, the center preserves the originals while making brass rubbing accessible to everyone. Brass plates, an alternative to tomb statues, spread from Germany across medieval Europe and Scandinavia. Many were destroyed during various revolutions, but most of the remaining brasses are in Britain, with a wide range available at the Cambridge Centre."
CAE_13,"**From Here to Fatherhood**

**A. The Theatre Director**

I've had 35 years of raising young children due to my unusual personal life, and I've loved every moment. This morning, I fed the baby, and to me, that's what being a father is all about. I'm very lucky with my children. We all enjoy opera, theatre, books, and music, which has created a strong bond between us. Now that they are mostly grown, I've become more of a friend than a father. I don't believe in physical punishment. I've slapped my children in anger before, but I don't support it. I may not have been the most attentive father, but I've always tried to be available. I'm here if they need me, but I let them contact me. If you start chasing them to ask why they haven't been in touch, it creates a burden of guilt. My parents did that to me, and I would never do it to my children.

**B. The Advertising Executive**

I was young when my children were born, around 25, and I found the responsibilities challenging. It made me feel older quickly, but it also kept me young, which I value. As they became teenagers, they introduced me to music, youth culture, and fashion, which has been helpful for my work at the agency. I never felt out of touch. When they were young, I was busy building my business, so I missed some events like first concerts and sports days. I'm sad about that, but now I can take them on holidays to the south of France. They get along well with our friends and join us at parties and advertising award ceremonies without feeling shy. I think it's an advantage that they see my job as glamorous and interesting.

**C. The Politician**

My first child was born just as I was about to be elected to the Greater London Council, and the others came soon after. My wife and I promised to make time for them, but as I became more politically active, time became a problem. I only accept weekend meetings and public appearances if my kids can come with me. This way, they understand what I do when I'm not with them, and there's no feeling of me disappearing. I've noticed more MPs bringing their kids to the House. Maybe we're all realizing the importance of involving our children in our lives.

**D. The Writer**

My first marriage ended when Kate and Bonnie were young, so I had to think a lot about fatherhood. I made great efforts to stay in touch with them. My ex-wife and I even tried living next door to each other so the kids could come and go freely, but Kate and Bonnie found it confusing. Kate has said in interviews that I was always there for her, but I'm not sure I was a very good father. I was around a lot, but like many parents in the Seventies, I treated the kids as adults too soon. Kate recently complained that we were too liberal. I think I should have introduced more structure and order. Instead, I took a very relaxed approach, which I regret now. I still worry about my older daughters as much as my youngest. In that way, your kids never really leave you.

**E. The TV Presenter**

I was ready for kids. I was 30, met my wife, and we had a lovely house. We thought, ""Why keep spending money on new sofas when we could have a child instead?"" Having my daughter Betty has made me understand who I am. You feel special when you have a child, and you are, but you're also just one more parent in a long line of parents. It's a great equalizer. Sometimes I feel annoyed, but one look at her dispels it. A baby's smile is the best way to melt a grown man's heart."

Mick improves his self-worth through a role in a school play and with the help of a sensitive teacher. It's highly recommended, though it's a painful read, especially at the end."
CAE_46,"Title: 'Science Defying Gravity'

Journalist Tom Mumford joins students testing their theories in weightlessness. From the outside, it looked like a regular aircraft. The pilot informed the young passengers that it was a Boeing KC-135 refueling tanker, built in 1964, based on the Boeing 707 passenger plane. However, appearances were misleading, and the 13 students from Europe and America were about to experience an extraordinary flight. Inside, the plane was transformed into a long white tunnel with few windows, lit by lights along the padded walls. Most seats were removed, except for a few at the back, where the nervous young scientists sat. They had spent 12 months competing with other students across the continent for a chance to be on this flight. The European Space Agency challenged them to propose creative experiments to conduct in weightless conditions. Those with the best ideas won a spot on this unique flight, which can be described as the most extraordinary roller-coaster ride ever created.

For the next two hours, the Boeing's flight would mimic a giant bird flying erratically, soaring upwards and then diving towards Earth. The goal was to achieve a brief moment of weightlessness at the top of each curve. At 3,000 meters, the pilot cut the engines, and the plane continued to rise due to its momentum before gravity pulled it back down. In the few silent seconds between climbing and falling, the aircraft and everything inside became weightless, and the 13 students would feel, in theory, closer to the moon than to Earth.

The aircraft took off smoothly, but any remaining illusions that we were on a regular passenger flight vanished when the pilot put the Boeing into a 45-degree climb for about 20 seconds. The engines roared, blood drained from our heads, and bodies were scattered across the cabin floor. Then the engines cut out, and the transition to weightlessness was almost immediate. For 20 seconds, we floated in silence: the floor felt like a trampoline, and one step sent us flying towards the ceiling. We drifted aimlessly; the idea of direction lost its meaning. Only gravity, by anchoring us, allows us to understand the concept of moving somewhere else.

After ten seconds of freefall, the pilot pulled the aircraft out of its dive. The return of gravity was less immediate than its loss but still sudden enough to cause some students to land with a thud. With the first curve completed, some turned green at the thought of the 29 more to come. Thirty curves provided ten minutes of 'space time' for experiments. The Dutch students quickly began studying the movements of Leonardo, their robotic cat, to understand how cats always land on their feet. At the right moment, they released their device, which floated belly-up, and one student managed to turn it belly-down using radio controls. However, during the next curve, another student accidentally landed on it during a less controlled return to gravity.

Next to the slightly dazed robotic cat, a German team from the University of Aachen studied how the quality of metal joins is affected by the absence of gravity, with future space station construction in mind. Another team from Utah State University explored the possibility of creating solar sails from thin liquid films hardened by ultraviolet sunlight. They spent the flight trying to produce these films in microgravity. They believe that once perfected, satellites could use solar sails to harness the sun's radiation, similar to how a yacht's sails use the wind.

After two hours of swinging between heaven and Earth, breakfast felt unsettled, but the main feeling was exhilaration, not nausea. This was an experience that would stay with us for a long time. ""It was an unforgettable experience,"" said one student. ""I was already aiming to become an astronaut, but now I want to even more."""
CAE_3,"**With the Trees, I Planted My Stake in New Zealand**

**Jonathon Porritt Talks to Danny Danziger**

Jonathon Porritt is the author of *Seeing Green - The Politics of Ecology*.

I had a unique time in my life when I didn't experience any summers. I traveled to New Zealand every summer from here, which is winter in New Zealand, so I had nine winters in a row. I enjoyed it because I like winter. My parents had the idea of buying a small piece of land for my brother, sister, and me to take care of. My mother said, ""If you take the time to plant it with trees, you can have it."" This way, we would always have a connection to New Zealand, which was nice since my father grew up there. They found a plot about 20 miles north of Auckland in a place called Rangitoupuni. The land wasn't very fertile, but it was good for planting trees.

I've always been interested in land. I spent a year in Australia working on sheep farms and doing various farming jobs, so the idea of planting trees appealed to me, and I was eager to start. The rest of the family became enthusiastic as we progressed. We started planting in 1968, and by the end of 1972, we had planted the entire 70 acres.

In New Zealand in 1968, it was a very rainy winter. It rained almost every day we were planting, and I don't think I've ever been wetter or colder for such a long time. Every morning was a challenge: getting ready for another day of planting. Coming out of the Land Rover warm and dry, with rain pouring down, wearing a damp anorak from the day before, boots soaked, and hands struggling with wet laces. During this time, my mind would wander, and I would have many thoughts and reflections about life.

In the first year, I worked with an experienced tree-planter, which was helpful since I had never planted trees seriously before. You carry a planting bag around your neck filled with as many trees as possible. When the bag is full, it's difficult, but it gets easier as it empties. The hardest part was getting the lines straight. You decide the spacing for the trees, line up three poles across a long distance, and those poles guide your lines. Once aligned, you plant down the line, turn around, and come back.

I enjoy hard physical work, and it made me fit. After a while, you can plant trees almost automatically, finding a rhythm and using the fewest spade strokes needed to dig a hole. This rhythm is common in many farming jobs, where you train your body to perform standard moves, making the process easy: taking a tree from the bag, digging a hole, planting it, stamping it in, and moving on.

Mentally, it was fascinating. My mind would wander, and I would have many thoughts about the natural world and our place in it. These ideas have since become central to my life. I've returned to New Zealand four times since then and watched the trees grow, which is satisfying because I planted them and feel connected to their success. I worry when I read about storms or droughts in New Zealand, but the trees are now 20 years old and doing well.

In 1984, I took a break from teaching and returned to New Zealand alone for three months. I wrote my first book, *Seeing Green*, there. There's a simple cabin on the tree farm with just a bed, table, and chair. I wrote in the mornings, pruned trees in the afternoons, and did research in the evenings. My connection to that area is still very strong. It's the place where I feel most connected to the earth, a powerful bond."
CAE_10,"**Bringing Up Badgers**

When one of my helpers handed me a cardboard box, my first thought was, ""What now?"" Six years ago, my husband Derek and I turned our dairy farm in Somerset into an 'open farm,' and since then, we've become known for caring for orphaned animals. The noise from the box—a mix between a cackle and a bark—was unfamiliar to me. Curious, I looked inside and found three small grey badger cubs, each about eight inches long. Their coats were like velvet, and their milky eyes looked up at me from their tiny black-and-white striped heads. I had never seen badger cubs before. Most are born between mid-January and mid-March and spend their early life underground. If orphaned, they usually die of starvation and are never found. These three were brought in by building contractors who accidentally disturbed their sett while laying drain pipes. The mother was found dead with her babies still suckling her. The cubs were healthy but cold and whimpering. After removing their fleas, I took them into the farmhouse kitchen and placed them by the stove for warmth. There were two females, Primrose and Bluebell, and a male, Willow. At first, I fed them with a syringe, but I had to wipe each cub with a warm cloth to mimic the mother's licking, which helped them relieve themselves. For the first few days, they were fed every four hours. Within a week, they were drinking from a bottle and moving around, though unsteadily. With each other for company and a heated pad as a substitute 'mum,' they seemed content. 

Three weeks later, I noticed Willow was lethargic, although he was still eating normally. It was a warning sign I didn't recognize. The next morning, I found him dead. A vet's post-mortem revealed Willow had died from a lung infection. When bottle-feeding, it's important not to let the animal drink too fast, as liquid can enter the lungs. In Willow's case, this caused an infection that would have been hard to treat, even with antibiotics, in such a small animal. Disheartened by my failure, I continued caring for the others. Then, six days later, a local farmer who heard about our cubs brought me another male cub, abandoned by its mother. The area had been disturbed too much, and the cub was cold and hungry. Willow II joined us. At six weeks, he was about two weeks younger than the females, and I soon discovered why his mother left him. He was very difficult to feed. I had to keep moving the bottle's teat around in his mouth and squeezing it to get him to drink. After ten minutes, he would finally latch on as if he hadn't drunk all day. By the end of April, the females were weaned onto creamed rice and then anything else. Willow was different. He was happy to give up the bottle but couldn't eat without walking through his food, tipping it over, or sitting in it. Eventually, I offered him a sausage, which he slowly chewed, played with, and finally ate. After a week of sausages, he was ready to try other foods. 

At nearly five months old, they were all eating cereals for breakfast, a meat and vegetable meal for lunch, and fruit, nuts, cheese, hard-boiled eggs, and sunflower seeds in the evening. Badgers usually eat 60% earthworms, plus beetles, bugs, baby rabbits, mice, voles, and even plant shoots or roots. My badgers were better off than others that year; the summer was very hot, making it hard to dig for earthworms. By August, my foundlings had become nocturnal and would only go for walks at dusk or late at night. We often walked through the cider orchard, where the cubs would get excited, fluff up their fur like snowballs, and chase each other's tails. As 'human badgers,' we were part of this game. I learned to avoid their playful nips, but Derek, who joined us less often, never did and sometimes reacted colorfully to being caught. During these late-night walks in the dry period, I saw other badgers in our field. They were likely extending their territories to find food, as badgers are territorial and will kill intruders. We were warned they might climb into our badger pen and harm the cubs, so we covered the gate with sheet metal to keep them out. The local press took pictures of me walking the badgers, and the response was so great that we started an appeal to build a sett on the farm for them. With advice, we designed a new home for the badgers. Our son Daniel drew up the plans, and we built a sett with tunnels, an enclosure, and a badger gate facing their usual walking direction. It had three chambers, one larger than the others, with a glass side for viewing from a darkened enclosure. As the sett took shape, the badgers explored it before their walks. Eventually, they forgot the walks in favor of climbing through the tunnels and arranging bedding. The building cost more than expected, but a local bus company, Badgerline, sponsored part of the appeal, and local firms donated materials. Everyone wanted to see the badgers with a home of their own. 

Early one evening, they finally moved in. After watching them for a while, we left them to settle. Half an hour later, I returned to find them curled up in their chambers, sound asleep. These days, my walks with them are less frequent, especially since they aren't fully awake until midnight. We see Primrose only occasionally, as she has joined a neighboring sett, but Bluebell and Willow II still rush up to greet us before dashing off into the night. This is their territory now, a place they know well and a home they have accepted."
CAE_67,"Text: 'In search of true north - and the man behind Halley's comet Dr. Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, wants to follow Sir Edmund Halley's journey to map compass variations. Anjana Ahuja reports. Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) is famous for the comet named after him. However, his important work was mapping 'compass variations' during his sea voyages on the warship Paramore. These variations, now called 'declination', are the angle between magnetic north and true north. Without knowing this, sailors couldn't accurately use their compasses to find longitude and navigate the seas. Halley, one of the few people paid to do scientific research at the time, set out for the Cape Verde Islands to map declination in the North and South Atlantic. The first trip was stopped due to crew problems, but Halley tried again. This time, he traveled to Rio de Janeiro, South Georgia, Newfoundland, and back to England. From these travels, Halley published a 'New and Correct Chart showing the Variations of the Compass in the Western and Southern Oceans' in 1701. This chart was very useful to sailors for over a century until changes in Earth's magnetic field made it outdated. Dr. Clark, who loves sailing, plans to celebrate the 300th anniversary of Halley's trip by retracing the Paramore's route. He needs to raise £70,000 for the journey, and Sir Vivian Fuchs, known for leading the first cross-Antarctica expedition, is supporting him. Dr. Clark became interested in Halley while working at Halley Station in Antarctica, where he read about the scientist. 'Halley led a remarkable life,' Dr. Clark says. 'He was a respected scientist and explorer. He wasn't just an astronomer; he also did geophysics research. As Astronomer Royal, he mapped stars and had other interests.' During this time, Halley invented a diving bell and helped Sir Isaac Newton with his book Principia Mathematica, the foundation of classical physics. Dr. Clark believes recreating the voyage will give Halley the recognition he deserves. The new expedition, called 'In the Wake of the Paramore', will also have scientific value. It will involve taking the same measurements Halley did, but with more accurate tools. These measurements are important because Earth's magnetic field is always changing. The data will help improve the international geomagnetic reference field, a model of Earth's magnetic field. 'We usually measure the size but not the direction of the magnetic field because you need to know true north for that,' says Dr. Clark. 'On our expedition, we can use global positioning satellites to find true north.' The British Geological Survey and the United States Navy will provide instruments. A Danish satellite will also be taking similar measurements, and Dr. Clark hopes his data will fill any gaps in the Atlantic Ocean. Ground-based measurements are useful for comparison. Halley's Atlantic journey was very important. It was the first scientific sea expedition, and Halley was the first civilian naval captain focused on declination. Does Dr. Clark have what it takes to succeed? He spent two years in Antarctica, works in the geomagnetic group at the British Geological Survey, and has sailed 13,000 kilometers from Rio de Janeiro to England. He plans to complete the expedition in four stages with different crews. Is he as dedicated as Halley? 'I'm willing to spend eight months on this, so some might say I'm obsessed. But I wouldn't cross the Atlantic again without a good reason. Halley and his fascinating life have given me a real sense of purpose.'"
CAE_27,"Every summer, the peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire show off their beautiful tails to the female peahens. This display raises a question that puzzled Charles Darwin: in a world where survival is tough, how did such extravagant features evolve? Darwin believed that evolution happened through natural selection, where the strongest and most adaptable survive. However, the peacock's tail seemed to be a disadvantage, so Darwin suggested another idea called 'sexual selection.' He thought females chose mates based on beauty alone.

Darwin's friend, Alfred Russel Wallace, disagreed. He believed that if peahens chose the most beautiful males, there must be a practical reason. The impressive tails might signal some hidden quality that helps survival. Today, this debate continues because studying peafowl behavior is challenging. At Whipsnade, researchers like Marion Petrie are trying to find answers. They want to know if peahens really prefer males with the most eye-catching tails and if these males have other advantages.

Observations suggest that peahens do prefer males with more eye-spots on their tails. However, it's unclear if these males are better in other ways. William Hamilton from Oxford University proposed that showy birds might be healthier and free of parasites, but this hasn't been tested in Whipsnade peacocks yet. This year, Dr. Petrie is comparing the offspring of attractive and less attractive males to see if the former grow faster or are healthier.

There's another theory by R.A. Fisher called 'Fisher's Runaway.' It suggests that if females start preferring slightly better tails, this preference and the trait itself will grow stronger over generations. This could explain the peacock's tail and support Darwin's idea of 'beauty for beauty's sake.'"
CAE_66,"**THE BOAT OF MY DREAMS**

Tom Cunliffe believes the best boat design should mix old and new ideas. He did this with his own boat, 'The Westerman'. This week, the Summer Boat Show in London is full of modern yachts with the latest technology. Most of these yachts are based on design changes from 25 years ago. In contrast, my boat is quietly anchored in a tidal creek on the south coast. It was designed last year, but it looks like it could be 100 years old. You might think I'm a romantic dreamer, but I don't think so. My boat uses the charm of old boat designs, but modern technology made it easier to build. However, while technology is important in boat design today, it often separates sailors from the real experiences of being at sea. These are the experiences they wanted to find by sailing. I'm not saying sailors should suffer through every hardship. I always make sure my boats have a coal stove for warmth and comfortable beds. But why sail if every sail sets and furls itself automatically? Sometimes, dealing with the sails is part of the sailor's life. And why should we move the steering from the safe back of the boat to a risky spot in the middle? Sadly, this is done to create a cabin as big as a room at home. For me, a boat should be a boat, not a floating house. When I bought my previous boat, Hirta, which I sailed around Britain for a TV race, the former owner said it had every comfort but no luxury. During my time with Hirta, I learned how right he was. Her sails were heavy, and she had no pumped water, no electricity, no fridge, no central heating, no winches, and no electronics, especially for navigation. Yet, she was the easiest and kindest boat I ever sailed. However, classic boats need a lot of care. After a back injury, I realized I had to let go of my 15-year relationship with her. I couldn't find a suitable new boat, so I decided to build one from scratch. The Westerman has never let me down. Although designer Nigel Irens and his assistant Ed Burnett use computer design, Irens first sketched the boat on a napkin and then used the computer. After creating a model, we refined the design. The final version was perfect. The finished boat has crossed the North Atlantic and won four out of six races. She looks timeless, sails beautifully, and her interior, made from reclaimed pitch pine, feels peaceful. This is because she was designed purely as a sailing boat, not based on furniture. This traditional method proves that you don't need to follow trends to be satisfied. Built with wood treated with a special glue, she is completely waterproof. She has all the advantages of a fiberglass boat but looks, feels, and sails like a traditional one."
CAE_44,"**RETREAT, RELAX, RECHARGE**

Health farms and country house hotels with spa facilities are becoming very popular. We asked five journalists to review some of these places.

**A. HENLOW GRANGE**

I was excited to visit Henlow Grange for six days because I needed to relax. My room in the large 18th-century house was very comfortable, and I felt calm immediately. On the first day, I rested and slept a lot. From the second day, I joined many classes like body conditioning, yoga, and stretching. The instructors are very skilled, and I felt more flexible as the week went on. They offer many treatments, such as aromatherapy, seaweed baths, manicures, and pedicures. The hour-long facial made me feel refreshed. The staff were friendly and professional, creating a lively and enthusiastic atmosphere. Henlow plans to renovate soon, adding a half-size Olympic pool and a Light Diet Room. You can also ride bicycles around the grounds or enjoy a peaceful walk in the garden. By the end of my stay, I felt energetic and happy. This is a perfect getaway for a stressed working woman. I can't wait to return! - Marcella D'Argy Smith

**B. SHRUBLAND HALL**

From the moment I entered this grand home, I felt calm and relaxed. The Hall has a beautiful library, a lovely conservatory, and plenty of space, so you can have privacy if you want. Upon arrival, everyone gets a medical check-up, including weight and blood pressure. We were called ""patients,"" which felt strange since I was healthy. However, they found a shoulder issue during my check-up, and the fitness instructor helped me with it in group and individual sessions. Each person follows a specific diet. I lost weight without fasting but got a headache on the second day from hunger. My daily menu included grapefruit and honey for breakfast, salads for lunch, and exotic fruit with yogurt and broth for dinner. If you're not on a diet, you can eat in the main dining hall, where the food is delicious. You get a massage or water therapy every other day, and extra treatments are reasonably priced. - Liz Gregory

**C. CAREYS MANOR**

Careys is not a health farm and doesn't claim to be. It's a charming old manor with cozy log fires and a spacious lounge. If you're watching your weight, you might skip the gourmet food, which includes rich sauces and creamy desserts made by the French chef. Luckily, the hotel has a gym and a pool to help burn off the calories. You can choose a health-conscious diet if you want to lose weight. There are also spa baths, steam rooms, saunas, and treatment rooms. A highlight is the sports injury clinic, where I got advice on an old shoulder injury. The physiotherapist suggested good posture, exercises, and massage. Careys is both comfortable and luxurious, relaxed and calm. If you want to explore, the surrounding countryside is beautiful. - Beverly D'Silva

**D. CLIVEDEN**

Cliveden is a grand country home and a five-star hotel that treats guests like royalty. It offers health and beauty treatments, a gym, saunas, a pool, tennis, horse riding, and more. The 376-acre National Trust estate has beautiful woodland walks and gardens. Waldo's, the acclaimed restaurant, offers a menu that is hard to resist. The meal was fantastic, especially the sticky-toffee pudding with banana ice cream. I went to bed very happy! The next morning, I spent time in the gym to burn off some calories before my next meal. I enjoyed a facial and an aromatherapy massage in the Pavilion. Cliveden offers fitness assessments, workouts, and beauty treatments if you want them, but you can also indulge at Waldo's. - Kay Letch

**E. SPRINGS HYDRO**

The best and worst thing about Springs Hydro is the carrot cake. It's the best because it's delicious, but the worst because it's 360 calories, which isn't great if you're trying to lose weight. You've been warned! The second best thing is the amazing aromatherapy massage. I chose relaxing oils and fell asleep twice during the massage, then had a very refreshing night's sleep. The modern facilities are well-run, with luxurious bedrooms and plenty of therapists, so it's easy to book appointments. They offer a variety of treatments, from manicures and pedicures to deep-cleansing facials and body treatments. Guests include football teams, mothers and daughters, best friends, and singles. I would love to visit here once a month. - Eve Cameron"
CAE_22,"**NATURAL TALENTS**

In the seven million years since humans split from chimpanzees, we haven't changed much genetically; we're still over 98% the same as chimps. On the evolutionary timeline, what makes humans different from animals is a recent development. Our ability to create art and other uniquely human traits must come from a small part of our genes. This means that the differences between us and animals are mostly small. For example, both humans and animals use tools: chimpanzees use sticks, and sea otters use rocks. Monkeys have simple language systems with different sounds for different predators. These findings suggest that there are few absolute differences between us and animals, except for art.

If human art comes from a unique genetic trait, it's interesting that our ancestors didn't create art for most of the time since we diverged from chimps. Early art might have been wood carvings or body painting, but these don't survive over time. Clear evidence of human art appears with the Cro-Magnons around 35,000 years ago, with cave paintings, statues, necklaces, and musical instruments.

If we say our recent creativity sets us apart, how is our art different from animal creations? Three main differences are often suggested: human art is non-utilitarian, made for aesthetic pleasure, and learned rather than instinctive.

First, as Oscar Wilde said, ""All art is quite useless."" This means human art doesn't help us survive or reproduce, unlike most animal behaviors. While human art can communicate ideas, it's not the same as passing on genes. Birdsong, for example, helps birds defend territory or attract mates, directly aiding reproduction. By this measure, human art is different.

Second, human art is said to be motivated by aesthetic pleasure. We can't ask birds if they enjoy their songs, but they mostly sing during breeding season, suggesting they sing for practical reasons, not just for pleasure. Again, this makes human art unique.

Third, human art is learned, not instinctive. Different human groups have distinct art styles that are learned, not inherited. For example, songs in Tokyo and Paris are different, but people can learn each other's music. Some birds, however, are born knowing their species' song. It's like a French baby raised in Japan spontaneously singing the French national anthem. Human art changes quickly, unlike animal behaviors. Roman authors described geese honking 2,000 years ago, just as they do today. But human art evolves so fast that even a casual observer can tell a 20th-century painting from the Mona Lisa.

However, even experts might confuse the works of two mid-20th-century artists, Congo and Betsy, with human abstract expressionists. Congo and Betsy were chimpanzees who painted for their own satisfaction. Congo once made up to 33 paintings in a day and got upset when his pencil was taken away. Their paintings were shown in a 1957 exhibition in London, and most were sold, a success many human artists can't claim.

These chimpanzee paintings blur the lines between human art and animal activities. Like human art, they weren't made for practical purposes but for the artist's satisfaction. You might argue that human art is different because it's often meant to communicate. However, some famous human art was created for the artist's personal satisfaction, not for communication."
CAE_39,"Title: A Big Adventure

The Taklamakan Desert in western China is one of the last unexplored places on Earth and is very dangerous. Charles Blackmore crossed it and survived to share his story. Today, there are few big adventures and few heroes. In the past, children's stories often featured brave explorers. Nowadays, such people are rare in both fiction and real life. However, Charles Blackmore is an exception.

Blackmore led an expedition across the Taklamakan Desert, known as the ""Desert of Death."" He shared the dangers and excitement of this journey from the comfort of his home. His team included four Britons (one was a medical officer), an American photographer, four Chinese experts, 30 camels, and six camel handlers. Surprisingly, the camel handlers were actually long-distance truck drivers, which was a misunderstanding that could have endangered the expedition.

This diverse group set out to cross 1,200 kilometers of harsh desert. Blackmore wrote a captivating account of their journey. At the time, he was leaving the Army after 14 years and wanted to prove something to himself. He took a big risk, and his wife, Tina, was worried because no one had ever completed that route before. It took them 59 days to cross the desert, and Blackmore described the desert as ""kind"" to them.

The team faced many hardships: dysentery, extreme temperatures, severe thirst, and loss of water supply. However, they managed to find water when they needed it most. They avoided the desert's famous sandstorms and extreme cold, which could have stopped them completely. Despite constant challenges, like fine sand getting into wounds and climbing high dunes, they persevered.

Blackmore was driven by the need to survive. They had no backup plan, and no aircraft flew over them. Once in the desert, they were completely alone. He was confident in his mental strength but worried about his physical ability. On the first day, the heat was overwhelming, and he felt scared but determined.

Towards the end of the journey, after walking 1,000 kilometers, they were exhausted but strong. Blackmore's body was well-toned, and he felt he could walk over anything. In the book, he describes lying in the desert, looking at the moon, and thinking of his family. He realized that while the expedition was a personal achievement, his family and their happiness were more important.

Has Blackmore found peace? He still longs for challenges and open spaces. The sense of purpose during the expedition was uplifting, and he finds it hard to adjust to the routine of modern life."
CAE_18,"Susan Harr decided to unplug her gadgets and rediscover the joys of doing things by hand. Everyone loves technology because it gives us gadgets that make life easier and give us more free time. However, we've been subtly convinced that technology is essential, which might not be true. A recent problem with my word processor, which cost a lot to fix, made me question if gadgets are worth the trouble and expense. Are we as dependent on technology as we think? Gradually, I've been letting go of household technology as it breaks down. This makes me wonder what 'extra time' technology really gives us. Is it just time to buy more gadgets? If so, marketing experts have tricked us. When my gadget started making strange noises, I left it in the backyard, where it now sits like a ghost. I'm no longer tied to a noisy machine and can take my time with my sewing. I was always a bit scared of electric machines that move quickly towards your fingers. Best of all, I can take my sewing with me wherever I go. Of course, there are some gadgets I wouldn't want to live without. A year without a washing machine showed me the value of an electric one. But losing some gadgets has been surprisingly nice. We were spending too much time in front of the TV, so I returned the rented color TV and went back to a small black-and-white one. It's hard on the eyes but makes us focus on what's worth watching. Now, we spend more time walking the dog, reading, talking, or doing other hobbies. One of my hobbies is sewing, and I no longer use my old Singer sewing machine, which is now a plant stand. I can't afford a new one, so I sew by hand. We've come to believe we can't live without technology, but if we resist this idea, we might find we don't want to give it up. We feel sorry for past generations who had to work hard without gadgets. Computers now do amazing calculations and provide entertainment, making life easier. But sewing by hand is not boring; it's relaxing and has many benefits. I can sew while listening to the radio or talking with family and friends. If it's a simple task, I can watch TV and feel less guilty about sitting in front of it. It's lovely to sit by the fire and sew with a pot of tea. I used to think sewing by hand was hard work, but it's actually soothing and satisfying to see my work improve. Things get done quickly, and life slows down to the pace of my hands. I'm also free from the rush of modern life, where we hurry from one task to the next. I've regained control of my sink, where I enjoy washing up and daydreaming. Now, I look around the house and wonder if we really need the freezer, microwave, or lawnmower. We could save a lot of money by doing without electric lights!"

Hurst has been in this business for ten years and has a great reputation. He always has orders lined up for months, even though he doesn't advertise. People know that if they want quality furniture, Hurst is the person to go to.

Finding a furniture-maker isn't hard, but finding one like Hurst, who focuses on clean, simple designs, is rare. Hurst is disappointed by some modern furniture and criticizes mass-produced, low-quality pieces. His quest for perfection and his talent are key to his success. He is confident in his skills, saying he has a natural ability for making things. He learned his craft by asking the right questions and teaching himself.

Most of Hurst's work comes from private clients, and some return for more pieces. He finds it satisfying to furnish entire homes. However, he admits that not all client relationships are smooth. He prefers clients who know exactly what they want. Hurst is also willing to praise others when deserved, acknowledging that some craftsmen are better than him. He criticizes those who take too long to make a single piece and those who try to make fashion statements with furniture. For Hurst, furniture should be practical and usable.

Despite his confidence, Hurst is humble about his work. As I leave, he says, ""After all, I am only making furniture,"" showing a down-to-earth attitude."

CAE_31,"Eccentrics are people whose behavior is different from what is considered normal in society. This raises the question, ""What is normal?"" Most of us have our own unique habits or interests, like entering newspaper competitions, collecting beer mats, or writing letters to the press. Eccentricity is about expressing our individuality. Inside us, there is a constant struggle between wanting to be unique and wanting to fit in. It's like having two trains on the same track, one called individualism and the other conformity. For most people, the desire to be accepted and loved is stronger than the desire to stand out.

People with unusual hobbies or strong opinions often gather together. They form clubs and hold meetings to share their interests, which others might see as odd. Being part of a group, even a small one, is comforting. We all feel a tension between wanting to be unique and wanting to fit in. We might say things like, ""I say what I think,"" or ""You must take me as you find me,"" to show our individuality.

At any time, we can choose to express our individuality more strongly. Many successful people have done this. For example, Bob Dylan, the American singer, said that when you follow your instincts and don't give up, you might confuse others. But this self-expression isn't eccentricity, at least not at first. When a pop singer wears strange clothes for attention or a hostess makes shocking comments to be noticed, that's not eccentricity. However, if they continue these behaviors until they become a natural part of who they are, then they might be considered eccentric.

The key to eccentricity is its naturalness. Eccentrics don't try to be odd; they just are. They are not concerned with public opinion and do what they do because of who they are. This makes them different from enthusiasts, practical jokers, criminals, exhibitionists, and recluses, who are all very aware of society and react to it. Eccentrics, on the other hand, continue on their own path without concern for what others think."
CAE_58,"**Natural Books**

We asked four well-known naturalists to share the wildlife book that has influenced them the most.

**A. Geoffrey Lean**

Choosing the author was easy for me. As an environmental journalist, I've been lucky to meet some of the pioneers in this field. None impressed me more than Barbara Ward, a small but powerful woman who was central to environmental issues in post-war Europe. She combined her experiences into a strong philosophy that made sense of the environmental movement for me as a young journalist. Choosing the book was harder. It could have been ""Only One Earth"" or ""Progress for a Small Planet."" But ""The Home of Man,"" despite its old-fashioned title even in 1976, is her most important work to me. It focuses on the rapid growth of cities and the big themes she cared about, like what we now call 'sustainable development.' I've read many books since, but none match its impact.

**B. Linda Bennett**

When I read ""Signals for Survival"" by Niko Tinbergen, I can almost hear the calls of herring gulls and remember the smell of their colony. This book explains animal communication wonderfully with words and pictures. After reading it, watching a gull colony changes from chaos to a well-organized social system. You can see which birds are partners and recognize families. Niko Tinbergen was a great behaviorist who wanted to share his findings with everyone. His work with wildlife artist Eric Ennion in this book was inspiring. Ennion's paintings, based on years of observing birds, show with just a few lines and colors how one gull is aggressive and another is peaceful. This is true field naturalist art.

**C. Lee Durrell**

""My Family and Other Animals"" by Gerald Durrell is the book that has influenced me the most. It not only led me to a wonderful husband and a career in conservation but also confirmed my love for the natural world. I first read it while researching animal sounds in Madagascar. I was feeling down due to many challenges, but reading this book each night made everything seem better. It beautifully combines animals, people, joy, and beauty, showing a world worth saving. Some say humans are the worst species because of the harm we've done, but I prefer to think of Gerald as a boy in the book, seeing the world as a family where all members are connected. This is a concept we all need to understand.

**D. Bruce Pearson**

I found ""The Shell Bird Book"" by James Fisher in my school library soon after it was published in 1966. I was immediately drawn to the 48 color plates of birds by Eric Ennion, described as painted with 'skill and charm.' These images captured my attention. I already had other bird books and had spent holidays learning to identify birds, which led me to start sketching them. But ""The Shell Bird Book"" offered much more. It included chapters on bird migration, the history of birds in Britain, and even birds in music, literature, and art. This wide range of information and exciting images encouraged me to appreciate birds and nature more broadly. The book showed me that my emotional and creative response to nature was as valid as a scientific one. Since art was a stronger subject for me than math or physics, it opened a new path for me."
CAE_37,"Text: 'DO REVIEWS SELL BOOKS? We asked five top British publishers about how book reviews affect sales. Here is what they said. Publisher A Reviews are crucial for publishers - they are the first thing we look at in newspapers. The Book Marketing Council found that more people buy books because of reviews than any other reason, like ads or word of mouth. Authors and publishers both dislike getting no reviews, but publishers are usually less upset by bad reviews. They believe that any attention, whether good or bad, can lead to sales as readers want to form their own opinions. Publishers enjoy reviews that match their own views of a book since they are often the first to read it. Publisher B Publishers and the press both care about book reviews, but they have different needs: newspapers want to entertain readers, while publishers want their books reviewed positively. Book reviewing is better now than 40 years ago, being more varied and less elitist. However, paperbacks, which most people read, are often overlooked. Publishers shouldn't complain too much, as reviews are a cost-effective way to promote books and authors. A lively review by a trusted critic can boost sales, especially if there are several such reviews. Fame helps get books into readers' hands. Publisher C Reviews are vital for literary publishing; without them, we would lose an essential support. Our books are usually not by famous authors, so we rely on reviews since we rarely advertise. Positive reviews are more valuable than ads because readers trust them as unbiased. Reviews can boost a book's success, but they need to be combined with other factors like word-of-mouth, support from bookstores, and smart marketing. Publisher D The link between publishing and reviewing in Britain is unclear. In the U.S., a review in the New York Times can greatly impact a book's success. In Britain, bookshops often don't seem to pay much attention to reviews. Sometimes it takes years of good reviews for a writer to gain readers, while poorly reviewed books can become bestsellers. It's unpredictable, though non-fiction reviews often focus more on the reviewer's knowledge than the book itself. Publisher E All publishers and writers hope for long, positive reviews. But do they sell books? I once published a biography that got great reviews, but it didn't sell well because people felt they didn't need to buy it after reading the reviews. Does the reviewer's name matter? Thirty years ago, certain reviewers could influence public opinion. Now, it's more about the choice of an unexpected reviewer or the strength and originality of the review that encourages people to buy the book.'"
CAE_2,"The craft of making weathervanes is very old, dating back to ancient Egypt. Today, Graham Smith keeps this tradition alive in his workshop. He is one of the few people in the country who still make weathervanes by hand. Graham creates custom designs based on what his customers want. ""This way, I can make a unique, personalized item,"" he says. Many of his customers are women buying gifts for their husbands, looking for something special that reflects the man's job or hobbies. This is quite different from the traditional cockerel design, which is the most common weathervane. Graham's first weathervane was not a cockerel but a witch on a broomstick, which he made as a surprise gift for his wife. His friends liked it and asked him to make weathervanes for them too. ""I realized there are endless possibilities for designs,"" he says. Graham decided to focus on a weathervane business. He had trained as a precision engineer and worked in that field for 15 years. Then, he and his wife, Liz, decided to switch roles—she went to work as an architectural assistant, and he stayed home to care for their children and grow the business. That was five years ago, and he is happy with his choice. ""My previous job wasn't artistic, but this is exciting and creative,"" he says. ""I really enjoy designing."" Graham has now created over 100 original designs. He pays close attention to detail and always gets the customer's approval for the silhouette design before cutting it by hand. He also keeps many traditional designs in stock because they are as popular as the custom ones. ""People are drawn to hand-crafted items,"" Graham says. ""They like having something a bit different."" Graham does not plan to expand his business because he wants to keep it as a rural craft. ""I have found my place in the market. People love the uniqueness, and I enjoy turning a simple shape into something almost lifelike,"" he says. ""For centuries, weathervanes have helped communities understand the weather by showing changes in wind direction,"" he explains. ""Now, with more people moving to the countryside, they want to add a unique touch to their homes. This has helped crafts like mine."" Graham is now very busy, sending flat-packed weathervanes to clients around the world, especially in America and Denmark. ""The price,"" he explains, ""depends on how complex the design is."" His latest request was for a curly-coated dog. Whatever the occasion, Graham can create a special gift."
CAE_68,"**Beginner Takes All**

Before it was even published, *The Horse Whisperer* was the most talked-about book of the year. This first novel by British screenwriter Nicholas Evans brought him record-breaking earnings. Here, he shares his inspiration and success story.

The start of the year was tough for Nicholas Evans, who was a screenwriter, producer, and aspiring director. Things went wrong when *Life and Limb*, a film he had been working on for months, suddenly fell apart. He was worried because he hadn't earned any money for two years, and this film was his only hope to keep the bank manager from getting angry.

Instead of finding a job, which would have been the sensible thing to do, Evans made a bold decision. He bought a ticket to America to research his first novel for three months. The idea for the story came from a farrier he met on Dartmoor. The farrier told him about a calm horse that suddenly became wild. Its owners were desperate until they found a gypsy who calmed the horse just by talking to it. These men were called 'horse whisperers,' and Evans was fascinated.

Initially, Evans thought of writing a screenplay about it, but after his disappointment with the film industry, he decided to write a book instead. So, he traveled across the US, visiting ranches and learning about horses and the people who work with them. He felt alone and worried about his future, as he was in debt and unsure how to support his family.

By August, he had written half of the book and showed it to a friend who was a literary agent. The agent thought it was ""fine"" and estimated Evans might get $30,000 as an advance. This amount was less than what Evans needed to pay off some debt and continue writing. He was advised to write a 12-page summary of the rest of the book.

In October, the first 200 pages and the summary were sent to seven UK publishers just before the Frankfurt Book Fair. Within days, his agent called to say he had turned down an offer of $75,000, sensing something bigger was happening. Soon, the novel was sold to Transworld Publications in the UK for $550,000 and to Delacorte in the US for $3.15 million, both record-breaking amounts for a first novel.

Evans and his family were shocked by the success. They hadn't even sent the manuscript to New York or Hollywood, but major studios were already competing for it. His UK agent involved a US agent, and they received an offer of $3 million for the film rights. Evans was amazed as top filmmakers called him to pitch their ideas for the movie.

While enjoying coffee on his verandah, Evans shared that he turned down an offer to write the screenplay for *The Horse Whisperer*. He didn't want to spoil the fairy tale-like success by becoming an employee of the people who paid him so much. He preferred to stay involved from a distance.

The success of his novel also brought new interest in *Life and Limb*, but Evans was unsure if he wanted to pursue it. He felt it would be wise to write another novel instead."
CAE_23,"Text: 'Young Masters

Bobby Fischer is trying to make a comeback in the world of chess, but age is not on his side. Chess has become a game for younger players. After 20 years away from the game, Fischer is playing against his old rival, Boris Spassky. Fischer won the first game with a brilliant move, but he is not the same player he was in 1972. Now 49 years old, he is out of practice and not in the best physical shape. Spassky is even older.

Chess has changed a lot in the last 20 years. Fischer himself helped make the game more popular, leading to a new era of professional chess. Today, winning is the main goal for players. In international chess, a player's nerves and stamina are just as important as their intelligence and wisdom. The pressure is intense: players must make a certain number of moves in a set time, or they lose the game. Now, games last longer and are often played without breaks, which benefits younger players. In the last 30 years, each new world champion has been younger than the one before. Of the top ten players in the world, eight are under 30.

The way chess is played has also changed. Much of the game happens off the board, with players preparing extensively before matches. Computers have had a big impact, as they can store millions of games and help players study their opponents. In one recent match, both players had teams working nonstop to find weaknesses in each other's strategies. The opening moves of a game are now analyzed in great detail, and being well-prepared can decide the outcome.

Today, there are more top-level players than ever before, and many grandmasters compete for modest prize money around the world. Success requires both physical and mental effort. A single game can last up to eight hours, and players must stay focused the entire time. Losing concentration can lead to disaster, and the chess clock adds to the tension. The end of a game often involves a frantic rush to make moves before time runs out. In these moments, players need nerves, determination, and a strong will to win.

At the highest level, losing is very painful, while winning brings great satisfaction and a chance to recover from the stress. But one win is not enough to win a tournament. Chess masters must be ready to compete day after day. Most tournaments last 9-11 days, with games every day, and there is a year-round tournament circuit. World championship matches are even tougher. In 1984, a match between Anatoli Karpov and Gary Kasparov in Moscow had to be stopped because both players were exhausted. Karpov lost about 10kg during the match.

Can Fischer overcome these challenges? He once said, ""All I want to do, ever, is play chess."" This made his sudden departure from the chess world in 1972 even more puzzling. But it also made him a legend. If Fischer has returned for the money, he will earn a lot. No matter what happens in his match with Spassky, both will become much richer. But if Fischer truly believes he can prove he is still the best, the result could be disappointing.'"

Simon has always worked hard, even performing in comedy clubs during university. ""University was very theoretical,"" he recalls. ""It made me realize I preferred comedy over straight acting. People think comedy is the hardest job, but it's not. If you have courage and good material, making people laugh is wonderful."" He has worked with the comedy group Funny Business, but his collaboration with Steve Coogan has been the most rewarding.

Looking at Ciaran's early career, his success seems inevitable. Encouraged by his mother, he went from school plays to the Ulster Youth Theatre, where he stayed for four years. ""I used acting as an excuse to avoid homework,"" he laughs. ""But I realized I had a talent and passion for it.""

""I didn't go to university until I got bored with a theater job,"" he explains. After university, he published a children's book in 1992. ""My parents didn't expect me to be a writer; they thought I'd be a reader because I read a lot as a child."" With his poetry praised, moving to novels is bold.

CAE_1,"A. Isabel, the main character in this quirky novel, is a 31-year-old art student who loves historical romances. She thinks she looks good in jeans but avoids wearing them to not attract the wrong kind of people. Isabel is searching for Mr. Right but worries her knobbly knees might be a problem. Despite her concerns, she remains hopeful, which helps her and others in the story. The author writes with great energy, using a fast-paced style similar to early silent films, with chapter titles like 'Our Hero Feels Inspired.'

B. This story celebrates the rise and near-fall of a local radio station in America. It is told from the perspective of Francis With, a smart but weak child. Francis works for WLT (With Lettuce and Tomato) Radio, a station started by Roy and Ray Soderbjerg to promote their sandwich shop. The station broadcasts a mix of singers, preachers, soap-opera stars, and announcers. The small-town American setting allows the author to use dry humor and simple writing. The story takes readers back to the 1940s and 1950s, a time of dime stores, old cars, and the radio.

C. In this story, it's normal for a second husband to chat with his wife's first husband. So, when successful professor Richard Vaisey falls for a beautiful Russian poet, he talks to his wife's ex about it. The poet writes bad poetry, which bothers Richard, and she also wants his help to free her wrongly imprisoned brother. The author skillfully untangles these complications with humor and insight into relationships, making it a fun and sophisticated read.

D. Two pairs of best friends—two women and two men—meet in 1960s London and stay connected for 25 years. At the start of this long novel, one of them, the mysterious American businessman James Hudson, is launching a newspaper, which his friend Richard Blake is editing. The launch is important, but so is the fact that the woman they both loved (and one married) was killed years ago. The story includes murder, ambition, love, and jealousy, with well-written characters that draw you in.

E. This story, by a top American fiction writer, is both funny and touching. It follows Ian Bedloe, who, feeling guilty for a past mistake, becomes the 'father' to his brother's three orphaned children. At 40, Ian is slowly becoming an eccentric bachelor, surrounded by the chaos of family life. The story explores deep emotions, especially the tender relationship Ian forms with the youngest child, Daphne. It's a warm book with a perfect mix of sadness and humor."
CAE_53,"**Volunteer Tourism: Perspectives from Four Academic Writers**

**A.** The direct impact of volunteer tourism on development is often limited. Volunteers, especially those on gap years, may help build homes or schools, but they usually pay a fee to participate. This money, if given directly to local communities, could hire more workers than the volunteer can replace. Many studies question whether gap year volunteering is truly altruistic or if it's more about gaining 'cultural capital' for career benefits. However, these projects might help volunteers become more ethical and supportive of less fortunate people in their future careers.

**B.** Volunteering can improve international understanding, conflict resolution, and participation in global issues. It can also create international social networks. Ideally, both volunteers and host communities benefit, contributing to the global good. However, if volunteering is mostly done by people from wealthier countries, it may only give them a broader perspective and career advantages, while doing little for those without access to such opportunities. These volunteers might use host communities as a step towards personal growth.

**C.** At its worst, international volunteering can be seen as imperialistic or self-serving, focusing on personal or career development for wealthy Westerners. At its best, it benefits both volunteers and host organizations, allowing for an exchange of skills and cultural experiences. Importantly, volunteering can increase awareness and commitment to fighting inequality, poverty, and unsustainable development.

**D.** Volunteer tourism aligns with the trend of life strategies aimed at helping others. These strategies, focused on 'making a difference,' can seem positive in an anti-political climate. They avoid big government and business but also bypass the democratic process, reducing development to individual charity acts. While volunteering is commendable, when marketed as sustainable development, it can degrade the true meaning of development. This approach shifts away from understanding global inequalities and the poverty experienced by many in developing countries."
CAE_55,"**Sound the Alarm: A Review by Stuart Harris**

Many of us use a radio to wake up in the morning, often relying on a clock radio to help us get out of bed. But how do you choose a good one? Our panel, including myself, inventor Tom Granger, and broadcaster Paul Bridges, tested five models currently available.

The first model we tested has a 'dual alarm function.' Initially, I thought this meant you could snooze with the buzzer and then get up later. However, the instructions suggest setting two different wake-up times, one for weekdays and one for weekends. This model is priced similarly to the second one we tested, but it includes a cassette player, which is a great deal. You can fall asleep to your own tapes and wake up without news. We all agreed the radio quality was excellent, but the device is quite large, about the size of a rugby ball. Paul Bridges mentioned that he needs space on his bedside table for his keys, wallet, glasses, and phone. He also books a wake-up call as a backup in case the alarm fails.

This model was voted the most attractive and overall winner. Paul Bridges said he was 'in love with it,' although the clock on his unit kept getting stuck at 16:00. I liked the digital display with its grey numbers on a green background. The wide snooze bar is easy to tap even with your eyes closed. However, the smooth buttons encouraged me to play with them like piano keys, which was a problem when I finally looked at the 50-page instruction booklet. The clock has a self-power backup, so you don't need to reset it if someone unplugs it to use a hairdryer or vacuum cleaner. We all appreciated this feature, though setting it up was technically challenging. Completing the setup made us feel 'cool' and sophisticated.

Tom Granger described another model with a built-in lamp as 'unbelievably tacky.' You have to force the light out of its socket to make it work, raising concerns about its quality. He had to read the instructions twice to get it working, as the clock kept jumping from 12:00 to 02:00. The lamp is hard to position and only shines on the clock, which is already lit. Paul Bridges found the lamp idea amusing but agreed the radio was hard to tune. The buzzer is loud, like an alarm on a submarine, and made me want to throw it across the room. Despite this, it's the third most popular model on the market.

Aimed at young people, with its bright colors and matching strap, this model appealed to Tom Granger and me. 'I would choose this one because it stands out,' he said. Its traditional controls made it the only model we could set up without reading the instructions. Unfortunately, the alarm has a 20-minute margin for error, sounding about 10 minutes earlier or later than set. Paul Bridges criticized this, calling the model 'terribly fiddly' and 'completely useless.'

The simplest and cheapest model scored points with Tom Granger because it was 'very standard and took up little space,' and it had old-fashioned dial tuning. 'It's more intuitive to set up. With modern push-button tuning, you're never sure if you've pressed the buttons correctly, so you can't trust it to work.' He acknowledged that manufacturers have improved radio quality due to button-tuning. I found the tuning crude, as did Paul Bridges, but we agreed the radio quality was fine. The buzzer on this model was effective, getting me out of bed in just two beeps!"
CAE_50,"Hedgehogs

A hedgehog is a small mammal known for the sharp spines covering its body. Hedgehogs live in many parts of the world, but they are not native to America or Australia. All hedgehogs can roll into a tight ball when they feel threatened, making their spines stick out as a defense. How well this works depends on how many spines the hedgehog has. Some hedgehogs that live in deserts have fewer spines because they have evolved to be lighter. These hedgehogs might try to run away from danger and only roll into a ball if they have no other choice. Hedgehogs are mostly active at night and sleep during the day, usually under bushes or in holes in the ground. Although all hedgehogs can hibernate, not all of them do. If the conditions are right, some hedgehogs stay awake all year."
CAE_25,"**Great Sportswomen on a Winning Streak**

Excelling in sports is challenging for everyone, but women often face extra hurdles. Training and competitions demand sacrifices, leaving little time for a normal life. Despite these challenges, women are overcoming prejudice and setting new records. Here, we talk to some remarkable British sportswomen who are achieving their goals.

**A. Jill, 27, Skier**
""It's an amazing feeling to fly through the air and land smoothly, but it can be scary. Sometimes you feel unwell or it's windy and hard to see, but you just push through. It's difficult to have a career outside skiing because we train for ten months a year. You give up a lot of your social life and friends, but it was my choice. There are six men and three women in the British team. We all compete on the same courses and are treated equally—it's a young sport.""

**B. Caroline, 22, Cyclist**
""Two years ago, I borrowed a bike for a charity race and won because I cycled faster than everyone else, which was surprising since I'd never cycled before! I'm well-paid as a professional, and cycling offers many opportunities for endorsements. However, I worry people might think I succeeded because of my looks, not my skills. So, I focus on cycling rather than earning money. I train at least four hours daily on the bike, plus stretching, swimming, and running. My boyfriend is also a cyclist, so he understands the time commitment—it would be impossible otherwise.""

**C. Annabel, 26, Rower**
""Rowing is hard for girls to get into because few girls' schools offer it. Most start at 19 or 20, making it harder to succeed internationally. Also, coaches often stay for only a year, so there's no continuity, and the women's squad is disorganized. But it's great fun, I love being fit, and there's a good social life.""

**D. Ffyona, 24, Long Distance Walker**
""At 13, I dreamed of walking around the world—I didn't realize how big it was! Britain felt too small and safe. I was headstrong and hated being controlled. Now I'm more tactful. Each walk is different. Walking across Australia was the most painful experience I've had. I walked 50 miles and 21 hours daily with only three hours of sleep, in high temperatures, and with 15 blisters on each foot. But I got the record! I had to, as my sponsorship money was running out after 95 days. Men often think women are more likely to fail, so sponsoring them is seen as riskier.""

**E. Lisa, 26, Saloon Car Racer**
""Some men have big egos when driving—you see it on motorways. When I'm doing well, they don't talk to me. Being a woman has its downsides. At corners, men think, 'I've got to beat her,' so I've had many collisions! You need to be naturally competitive and aggressive. It's tough to earn money, and what I do make goes back into the sport. Women have raced since the 1920s and were seen as eccentric. It's great that more women are racing each year. For me, the appeal of saloon car racing is aiming for perfection—always trying for a perfect lap.""

**F. Alison, 28, Triathlete**
""I get up at 5:30 three mornings a week to swim. I need Tuesday and Thursday mornings to catch up on sleep. In the evenings, I cycle or run. Yes, I sometimes fall asleep at my desk! There's a lot of nervous anticipation before races, and you really push yourself during them—you don't feel good if you don't. I've often asked myself why I do it. The answers are: a) I'm happier when I'm fit, b) I'm naturally lazy and would be worse if I didn't push myself, c) racing is very social. Men and women usually compete together, but when events are covered in the press, 90% of the article focuses on the men's event, with only 10% mentioning the women's event. The prize money isn't as good either. But we've formed an International Triathlon Women's Commission, so we're working on it."""
CAE_34,"Title: The Day I Met Picasso

Richard Cork remembers meeting the famous artist Picasso when he was 18 years old. Even from a distance, Picasso was easy to recognize as he ate lunch at a restaurant in Cannes. Richard was traveling around Europe and Morocco in an old van before starting university. He had run out of money and found a job painting boats. He loved drawing and had a sketchbook with him when he saw Picasso.

Picasso was known to be a private person who usually worked alone in the hills. So, Richard was surprised to see him at a table with his wife, Jacqueline, and three friends. Encouraged by a friend, Richard nervously approached Picasso to ask for his autograph. To his surprise, Picasso agreed and signed his sketchbook. He even added a playful drawing on the page.

Richard was thrilled and started a conversation with Picasso, though they needed an American woman at the table to translate because Picasso's English was not good. Richard expressed his admiration for Picasso's work. After showing his friend the autograph, his friend encouraged him to go back and draw Picasso's portrait.

Richard returned to Picasso's table and began to draw him without asking for permission. Picasso noticed and made funny faces, making it hard for Richard to draw. Despite this, Richard felt challenged and continued. Eventually, Picasso stopped moving and allowed Richard to study him. Richard noticed how youthful and intense Picasso's eyes were, despite his age.

When Richard finished, the American woman said Picasso wanted to see the portrait. Richard was embarrassed but showed it to him. Picasso nodded in approval and then decided to draw Richard. In a few quick strokes, Picasso created a playful drawing of Richard, moving one eye onto his nose and capturing his smile with a single line.

Richard asked Picasso to sign the drawing, but Picasso declined, saying Richard already had his signature. Despite this, Richard felt incredibly lucky to have met Picasso and received his attention. This encounter meant a lot to him."
CAE_12,"**Talking Shop: How Stores Encourage You to Spend More**

Have you ever gone into a store and left with more than you planned to buy? Here, we explain the strategies shops use to make you spend more money.

**A. The Image of Freshness**

Supermarkets know that customers value fresh produce. To create this impression, they often place fruits, vegetables, or even house plants at the store entrance. They might also have an in-store bakery, spreading the smell of fresh bread throughout the store. The store's color scheme, like using green, can also enhance this fresh image. However, most of what supermarkets sell, like frozen foods and cleaning products, doesn't fit this fresh image.

**B. Displaying to Advantage**

The placement of products in a store is crucial for sales, especially in supermarkets. With computerized stock control, supermarkets know which areas attract the most shoppers. They place high-profit or fast-selling items in these spots. The saying ""eye-level is buy-level"" means that shelves at eye height are prime spots for products. Special offer bins attract bargain hunters. Another tactic is ""complementation,"" where items like salad dressings are placed near salads or ice creams.

**C. Spreading Staples Around the Store**

Supermarkets often place essential items like bread, tea, and sugar far from the entrance. This forces shoppers to pass by more tempting, higher-profit items. Similarly, chain stores might place popular products far from the entrance, relying on customer loyalty to draw shoppers through the store, exposing them to other products.

**D. Less Sells More**

Chain stores have changed how they display products. The Next chain, for example, moved away from the ""pile them high, sell them cheap"" model. Their stores have a ""boutique"" feel, displaying limited items to create an exclusive impression. Despite this, Next's clothes are as mass-produced as their competitors'. Their success is due to both good store design and well-designed clothing.

**E. Tempting Totals**

Food shoppers often focus on the total cost of their shopping rather than individual prices. Supermarkets use this by offering a mix of low and high mark-up items. Not everything in a supermarket is cheap. Some items, known as ""loss leaders,"" are sold at a loss to attract customers. More often, low prices come from buying in bulk, offering manufacturers prime display spots, or meeting sales targets, which earn discounts from manufacturers.

**F. The All-Important Price Tag**

In chain stores, shoppers buy fewer items and are more aware of individual prices. Pricing a blouse at £14.99 instead of £15 is still effective. This pricing strategy also helps reduce theft, as staff must process the sale to give change.

**G. Lighting to Effect**

Both supermarkets and chain stores carefully consider lighting. Chain stores aim for lighting that resembles natural light, so clothes look the same as they would in daylight. Supermarkets use special lighting and mirrors to make fresh produce look more appealing.

**H. Walk This Way**

Many chain stores use different carpeting to guide shoppers. One pattern marks the main routes, while another defines sales areas. These routes, known as the ""Yellow Brick Road,"" aim to lead shoppers through the store. However, not all shoppers follow these paths. Marks and Spencer, for example, use wood or marble for routes, encouraging shoppers to step onto the more inviting carpet in sales areas.

**I. In-Store Promotion**

As you enter a supermarket, large photos of delicious foods greet you, especially tempting if you're hungry. In the U.S., some supermarkets are testing ""video trolleys"" with screens that show ads as you shop. Sensors trigger ads relevant to the products nearby, like an ad for ready-made meals near the cook-chill section. These trolleys target impulse shoppers and reportedly increase sales by about 30%."
CAE_26,"Chris Bonnington, a well-known mountaineer, is famous for climbing Everest in 1985. He has also created new climbing routes in Britain and the Alps and has written books like ""Quest for Adventure"" and ""Everest the Hard Way."" Robin Knox-Johnston started his sea career in the Merchant Navy and was the first person to sail around the world alone in 1968-9 with his yacht, Sunhaili. He also set a record for crossing the Atlantic in 10 days. Chris and Robin teamed up to sail and climb in Greenland, which they wrote about in their book ""Sea, Ice and Rock.""

In 1979, while working on ""Quest for Adventure,"" Chris contacted Robin for an interview. Robin invited Chris to join him for a sail, where Chris could teach him climbing, and Robin could teach Chris sailing. It was Chris's first time on a yacht. They sailed, anchored, and then went ashore to climb. Chris was impressed by Robin's calmness in difficult climbing conditions. Robin had never climbed before, so Chris showed him how. Robin then used his own method to descend, which was safe but different from what Chris expected.

During their trip to Skye, Chris and Robin became good friends. Robin suggested they combine their skills for a trip to Greenland, which was a bigger version of their Skye adventure. Chris admired Robin's leadership. Although the skipper usually makes all decisions, Robin involved everyone in the decision-making process. Chris found the sailing part boring and challenging, as he preferred land and wasn't handy with repairs. Robin, however, enjoyed sailing and fixing things. Chris sometimes felt useless, which was hard for him. The yacht was crowded with six people in a space meant for four, unlike mountain expeditions where you can have some space.

When they reached Greenland, Chris led the climbing part. He found it hard to be responsible for Robin's safety, as a fall could endanger both of them. Climbing Greenland's highest mountain, the Cathedral, was tougher than expected. Robin, not a natural climber, impressed Chris with his determination. On their first attempt, they climbed for 24 hours straight and were exhausted. Robin trusted Chris completely, even when they had to turn back. Despite worrying about the boat, Robin was eager to try climbing again.

The only tension between them happened on the yacht home. Chris was supposed to take a watch shift at 4 am, but Robin didn't wake him, thinking he could handle it alone. Chris felt insecure, thinking Robin didn't trust him, but Robin reassured him it was a misunderstanding. By the end of the Greenland expedition, Chris realized that beneath Robin's tough exterior, he was a kind and sensitive person."
CAE_8,"**A History of the Apple**

Apples have been around since ancient times, in many different colors, shapes, and sizes. However, in the late 20th century, we risk losing this rich heritage.

**Prehistoric Wild Apples (8,000 BC)**

Humans have been eating apples since prehistoric times. In Neolithic Britain, people spat out apple seeds. Around 10,000 years ago, they left apple remains near their homes by Swiss and Italian lakes. In Switzerland and near the Caucasus mountains, ancient people even stored dried apple halves for winter. These were wild crab apples, small and shriveled, known in Ancient Britain as 'windings'. They were quite different from the apples we know today.

**Norman Influence (1000 AD)**

The French learned fruit-growing skills from the Romans, which were developed in monasteries. This knowledge, including cider-making, was brought to Britain, along with the dessert apple, Decio, introduced by the Roman general, Etio. However, most Roman apple varieties didn't suit the British climate, so Norman varieties became more popular. British monks continued to experiment and develop new apples, and many Western apples today come from these varieties.

**Medieval Favorites (1200)**

In the 13th century, several apple types became popular in Britain. The Old English Pearmain, recorded in 1204 and named for its pear-like shape, was the main dessert apple until the 18th century. Its cooking counterpart was the Costard, sold in Oxford markets from 1296 to the late 1600s, giving us the word 'costermonger' for a street fruit and vegetable seller. However, prosperity declined due to droughts, the Black Death, and the Wars of the Roses, leading to fewer apples being produced and more being imported. This changed in the 16th century when Henry VIII sent his chief fruiterer, Richard Harris, to France to learn about apple cultivation. Harris returned with many grafts, including the famous Pippins, and created the first modern-style orchard in Kent.

**Settler Treasure (1750)**

By the 17th century, apples were so popular in Britain that settlers took them to Canada, Australia, the US, South Africa, and New Zealand. Captain Bligh took the first apples to Australia, Jan van Riebeeck brought them to South Africa, and the Pilgrim Fathers carried them to America. In North America, the most famous apple-planter was John Chapman, or 'Johnny Appleseed'. Born in 1774, he planted apple nurseries from Pennsylvania to Indiana. The Indians saw him as a medicine man, and his love for apple trees, unique clothing, and religious devotion inspired many folktales. He was even said to be so kind that he slept with bears.

**Modern Delicious (1850)**

Around this time in Iowa, a Quaker farmer named Jesse Hiatt found a new apple tree growing from a dead tree's roots. The apple was new, and Hiatt named it 'Hawkey'. At a fruit show, a judge tasted it and exclaimed, 'Delicious, delicious!'. In 1895, it was introduced to the market as 'Delicious' and became one of the most widely grown apples worldwide.

**Granny Smith (1850)**

Another famous modern apple was discovered in Australia by Maria Anne Smith. The daughter of convicts, Maria was independent and worked as a midwife in Eastwood, New South Wales. Known as 'Granny Smith', she managed the family farm and orchard. In 1868, she found a small tree growing from discarded fruit. She replanted it and soon harvested the first major crop of green apples, which became famous worldwide. When asked about the tree, she said, 'Well, it's just like God to make something useful out of what we think is rubbish', referring to both the fruit and her convict origins.

**Uniformity Issues (1950)**

Today, apples are grown worldwide, from northern India to small orchards in Africa. Most are grown commercially and come from just a few varieties, chosen for their red skin or ability to travel well, rather than taste. This uniformity is reducing the variety and gene pool of apples. While amateur gardeners in the UK have preserved many old apple varieties, the US has lost most of its apples from 100 years ago. Consumers are now demanding more variety. We can't rely on amateur gardeners to save apple diversity. We must value and protect natural diversity for everyone's benefit."

CAE_30,"Richard Nerurkar, a top British 10,000-metre runner, visits a high-altitude training camp in Kenya. Located ten miles south of the equator, a mountain track leads from a quiet road from Nairobi to Mount Kenya, the highest peak in Kenya. This beautiful but isolated place is Nanyuki, where I have trained for the past three winters. However, I had never trained with Kenyan runners on their home ground until my fourth trip. During this visit, I competed in my first race in Kenya's thin air and stayed at the national team training camp. I was invited by the national team coach after finishing fifth in the World Championship 10,000 meters race, behind three Kenyans and a Moroccan. It was an opportunity I couldn't miss. Training at high altitudes increases red blood cells, improving oxygen capacity, which has benefited many Kenyan runners. My first race in Africa, held in Nairobi, was the continent's first international cross-country race. It was a humbling experience, as 41 runners finished ahead of me, all but three were Kenyan. I didn't think I ran poorly, but Kenyan success isn't just about altitude. They have a simple approach to running, with an effortless style, simple diet, and relaxed manner, but they love competing. The least discussed aspect of their success is their training. My stay at the Kenyan training camp revealed their methods. The camp is at St Mark's College, 6,200 feet up Mt Kenya, surrounded by playing fields and tropical vegetation. It's basic, with few comforts. Athletes live with regular students, six to a room in dormitories. Their days include three workouts: an easy morning run, interval training mid-morning, and a steady run in the late afternoon. The day starts at six, with a briefing from coaches. ""Run easy, you have a hard job today,"" we were told. They cover about 40 kilometers daily, just short of a marathon, except on Sundays, with only one 20-kilometer run. Life outside running is simple. A splash of water and brushing teeth is enough before breakfast, which is tea, bread, and boiled eggs. Lunch and dinner are similar: ugali (a maize dish), stew, cabbage or spinach, and tea. After running, we would drive to bathe in streams from Mt Kenya's glaciers. By the time I left, I appreciated Kenyan success even more. It's not just genetics, upbringing, or altitude. Perhaps the simple lifestyle, tough workouts, and passion for success are the real reasons behind Kenya's dominance in distance running."
CAE_7,"**Hit and Miss of Mass Marketing**

Advertising is struggling, and it's not just because of the recession. The decline started in 1989, before the recession hit hard. The main issue is that advertising hasn't kept up with economic changes. Advertisers focus on mass markets and mass media, but as more brands and media options have appeared, target markets have become more fragmented. Even big brand campaigns should aim at smaller audiences, but they often don't. This is where advertising has gone wrong.

Think about your shopping habits. When you go to a supermarket, you might buy 30 to 50 items, but only a few are advertised brands. Over a year, you probably buy only a few hundred brands. For consumer durables, maybe a dozen a year. Cars? If you have a new one, it's likely from your employer. If not, you buy one every three years. You don't buy many clothes either, and most aren't advertised brands. Even with all the products and services you buy, it's unlikely you purchase more than 400 different brands a year.

Compare that to the 32,500 branded goods and services advertised. Let's focus on the 9,500 brands that spend more on advertising. The average person buys 400 of these, and not all because of advertising. That's about 4%. So, the saying that half of advertising is wasted is outdated. It's more like 96% is wasted, but no one knows which part.

When you watch TV, count how many ads are for brands you buy or might buy. For most, it's about 1 in 16 (6%), meaning the other 94% are wasted. You might think you're not influenced by ads, but almost everyone thinks that. The truth is, most people don't buy most of the brands they see advertised. Waste is part of media advertising. It's unrealistic to think everyone will buy all the advertised brands. People notice only a few ads and ignore the rest, so waste is unavoidable.

However, advertising can still be cost-effective. It reaches many people to find the right audience, even if the advertiser doesn't know who will respond. Media advertising works because it's a cheap way to communicate with many people. But all waste is unpleasant. With smart targeting, advertisers can reduce waste by reaching more people who will respond, but they can never know exactly who will. Even the best direct mail campaigns don't get a 100% response.

This is different from face-to-face selling, where a salesperson might succeed with every client. That can't happen with media. If advertisers knew exactly who would respond, they wouldn't need media. They could contact people directly. This applies to all types of ads, from personal announcements to soft drink commercials. An advertiser who gains one million new customers (2% of the adult population) is doing well. For soap powder, the top brands would be thrilled with a million extra customers. Any campaign that wins over 2% of the population is very successful, but that's still a small part of the population. To succeed, advertising needs to target its message more precisely than ever before."
CAE_43,"Title: Exploring Britain's Most Eco-Friendly Home

Charles Clover visits Britain's most eco-friendly home in Southwell, Nottinghamshire. This town is known for its ancient cathedral, Southwell Minster, which features medieval carvings of 'green' men. The town also hosts the 'autonomous house,' designed by Robert and Brenda Vale, which is the greenest home in Britain.

The Vales' house uses rainwater for washing and drinking, recycles sewage into garden compost, and is heated by waste heat from appliances and the body heat of the family and their two cats, Edison and Faraday. The house looks traditional with its clay tile roof and blends in with the town's 19th-century architecture, even though it is in a conservation area.

The house is super-insulated with special windows, making it very quiet inside. Visitors must remove their shoes, and the house feels peaceful. On a sunny day, the conservatory warms the air before it circulates through the house. The Vales open special ventilation shafts to create airflow because the house is very well sealed.

The Vales, who teach architecture at Nottingham University, have been committed to environmental issues since the 1970s. They wrote a book called ""The Autonomous House"" and designed their home to produce no carbon dioxide emissions. They also decided to live without mains water, using rainwater tanks and special filters for drinking water. They avoid using strong detergents, so they don't have a dishwasher.

Robert Vale explains that they wanted to show it's possible to design an environmentally friendly house without sacrificing comfort. The house's design is modern, but the hall has a medieval aesthetic with a high ceiling.

The Vales pay no water bills, and last winter, their electricity cost was only about 70p a day, much less than typical homes. They plan to install solar panels to generate even more electricity, possibly enough to charge an electric car. The only heating is a small wood-burning stove, rarely used.

In winter, the house stays warm without extra heating. Robert Vale says that the house's insulation and lack of drafts make it comfortable even at lower temperatures. He suggests that people living in older homes could be comfortable at lower temperatures by dressing warmly, as people did in the past.

The house is low-tech, with most materials sourced from local builders, making it affordable to build. However, commercial builders are not eager to adopt this approach."
CAE_51,"Text: 'The camera never lies Arthur Conan Doyle, who created the Sherlock Holmes stories, considered himself a logical and scientific person. However, in 1920, when he saw photos of fairies taken in a garden, he believed they were scientific evidence that fairies existed. He published these photos with an article he wrote, claiming fairies were supernatural wonders. It wasn't until 1939 that the two women who took the photos confessed they were fake. They had simply cut out pictures of fairies from a book and placed them among flowers. The photos are undeniably beautiful, but the simplicity of the trick challenges the idea that the camera cannot lie. In fact, it can, and always could. Today, we are familiar with using computer software to edit our digital images, and it's a myth that photography ever had a time of complete honesty. From the moment cameras started capturing reality, that reality was being changed.'"
CAE_11,"Blacksmiths have always been important throughout history. Iron has fascinated people, and blacksmiths were once as respected as doctors because they made weapons, armor, and farming tools. They were also seen as artists. In the 18th century, blacksmiths created beautiful ironwork for places like St Paul's Cathedral. The elegant metal designs in French and Belgian Art Nouveau buildings were also made by skilled blacksmiths. However, by the late 1960s in Britain, blacksmiths were almost gone because heavy industry no longer needed them, and modern architecture rarely used decorative ironwork.

In the past 10 years, there has been a revival in blacksmithing due to a renewed interest in decorative architecture and more creative interior design. Despite this, much of the work still looks old-fashioned, with many products being labeled as 'classical' or 'Victorian-style'. Trendy design stores often sell rusty candlesticks with decorative bits. Fortunately, there are new and exciting options, and upcoming events aim to promote the blacksmith's craft. One such event is an exhibition by the British Artist Blacksmiths Association (BABA) at the Fire & Iron gallery in Leatherhead, Surrey.

Alan Dawson, BABA's secretary, believes we might be entering a new Iron Age. Modern tools have made it easier for blacksmiths to work with metal, allowing them to be more creative. The exhibition features about 250 pieces, from bookends to a spiral staircase, with prices starting at £90. Most of the money from sales will go to the artists, but some will support the promotion of quality ironwork.

Dawson's own work includes an eight-foot gate and a lamp with a glass shade. He describes his style as letting steel naturally bend and shape when hot, like drawing with metal in space. Many artists are fascinated by iron because it is soft when hot but becomes hard and unmovable when it cools. Susan May, a jeweler, finds this transformation magical. Ann Catrin Evans creates door-knockers and handles inspired by horror film castles, with designs like a ball and chain or a Celtic cross. She loves the cold, hard feel of steel and its permanence.

Iron has provided people with visual pleasure and a sense of security for centuries. It is likely to continue being used decoratively for many years, as long as we avoid more rusty candlesticks."
CAE_14,"Text: 'THE DAY I GAVE UP SMOKING I thought everyone would be happy, but one of my colleagues was really angry. 'What do you mean?' she shouted. 'If it was that easy, why didn't you stop years ago?' I guess my inability to explain how I went from being a pack-a-day smoker to not smoking at all in just four hours was a bit annoying. I find it strange myself. The stop-smoking session was a mix of group therapy and hypnotherapy, and it happened exactly two months and three weeks ago. I hadn't planned to quit, and I didn't even really want to. For one thing, I was annoyed by the constant pressure from anti-smoking groups - and I still am. Also, I had low blood pressure and a healthy family with long lives. I didn't cough or feel sick and seemed to recover from colds more easily than friends who had healthier lifestyles. On that ordinary Thursday afternoon, I went to the Birmingham session of The Easy Way to Stop Smoking to write an article about other people trying to quit. 'I won't be trying to stop myself, it wouldn't be fair,' I said firmly. 'Since I'm here to write, not to quit, it wouldn't be right to expect your method to work on me.' I thought I was being reasonable. After all, I really enjoyed smoking. It gave me real pleasure. I thought the counselor looked at me knowingly. We were encouraged to smoke as much as we wanted, and most of the afternoon was spent in a room so full of smoke that we had to open the windows. I noticed with interest that when I was told to smoke, I didn't want to - and neither did the others. I guess the stop-smoking messages made sense intellectually. Just as smoking had become a challenge against opposition, the idea of stopping started to feel appealing. The possibility of not being a smoker began to make me feel powerful. It was a secret feeling that was just for me. Could I also conquer the world? In many ways, it was easy. The physical craving, the desire for nicotine, in the same place where you feel hunger, faded after a minute or two, and I only felt them for four or five days. The one activity - my work - that I thought would be the hardest to do without cigarettes didn't cause any problems. I really believed I wouldn't be able to meet deadlines without nicotine and that for the first time, I would fail to write a story on time. Surprisingly, spending time at home on weekend mornings was the hardest thing - and it still is. I'm starting to think that for me, smoking was a way to avoid boredom; having a cigarette was an activity in itself. Yes, I do miss my cigarettes, but not too much. Each 'new' experience as a non-smoker has to be faced - eating out, waiting for a plane, checking into a hotel, a theater break. All are key moments when I would have smoked before.'"
CAE_63,"Dorothy Hodgkin is the only British woman scientist to have won a Nobel Prize, yet she is not well-known in her own country. Georgina Ferry, who is writing Hodgkin's biography, has noticed that many people in Britain are unaware of Hodgkin's achievements. Hodgkin, who passed away in 1994, was an extraordinary person. Her life mirrored significant changes in the 20th century, such as the progress of women's education and the global spread of science.

When Ferry started her research, she looked into scientific biographies and found that even famous scientists like Linus Pauling, who won Nobel Prizes in chemistry and peace, were not well-represented in British bookstores. This lack of interest in scientific biographies is partly due to the belief that scientists' lives are less interesting than those of artists or writers. This idea is part of the 'two cultures' mentality, which suggests a divide between the arts and sciences.

However, this view is changing. Scientists are now more visible in the media, and scientific biographies are becoming more engaging. Books like Richard Feynman's ""Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman?"" have shown that scientists can have fascinating personal lives. Even famous figures like Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein are now portrayed with their personal flaws.

Dorothy Hodgkin was deeply committed to her scientific work. She made significant discoveries, such as the structures of penicillin, vitamin B12, and insulin, which earned her the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1964. Despite her demanding career, she was also a devoted mother of three and managed a family life with a frequently absent husband.

While her personal life may not directly relate to her scientific achievements, it shows her ability to balance different aspects of her life. Her story is universally interesting, and her passion for science is something we can all learn from. Communicating this passion is a challenge for biographers, as many readers may not have the scientific background to understand complex ideas. However, understanding science is not more difficult than learning a language or reading Shakespeare; it just requires effort.

It is unfortunate that many educated people are unaware of the contributions of scientists like Dorothy Hodgkin, who have greatly enriched our world."
CAE_56,"Margaret and Her Water-Finding Skills

Margaret Wilkins is known for having a special ability, often called a 'sixth sense'. She can use a forked hazel rod to find water underground. Many farmers, whose wells have dried up, seek her help. Margaret and her husband run a well-drilling business, using equipment like drilling rigs and air-compressed hammers. However, to find water, Margaret only needs her hazel stick. Their success rate in finding water is over 90%.

This skill, known as dowsing, involves finding water, minerals, or lost objects underground. There are many theories about how dowsing works, from physical explanations like magnetism to spiritual ones. One credible theory suggests that everything on Earth vibrates, with water vibrating more than other materials. Dowsers might have a heightened ability to sense these vibrations. Some say they can 'sense' water, while others claim they can smell it, as smell is a very strong sense.

In recent drought years, the Wilkins have been very busy, with a waiting list of almost six weeks at one point. Most of Margaret's clients are farmers with dry wells. She says, 'We usually see customers only once because wells last a long time.' Other clients include owners of remote cottages or barns, now used as holiday homes, where installing water pipes is too costly. Some clients are golf-course developers needing water for clubhouse facilities.

Margaret aims to find water between 50 and 70 meters deep. 'You can't drill a well where there's any risk of contamination from farm waste. The water we find flows through cracks in solid rock, and if we bring it straight up, it should be clean. However, in Cornwall, you have to watch out for minerals like iron.' Electricity is also needed to power the pump, so the well should be near existing power sources to avoid high costs.

To start finding water, Margaret uses a map and a pendulum on large areas like golf courses. 'I hold the pendulum still and move it over the map. It swings when it's over an area with water.' After identifying potential spots on the map, she walks the fields with her hazel stick. 'When I'm over water, I feel a bit dizzy. Once that feeling passes, I use the stick to find the exact spot to drill.' She holds the stick's forks with both hands and applies slight tension. 'When water is directly below, the stick's straight part rises. It's crucial to drill exactly where the stick indicates. Even a small mistake can miss the water completely. My husband also checks the area, and we usually agree on where to drill. If we don't agree, we keep searching until we do.'

Margaret Wilkins is not alone in practicing this unusual skill in the west of England. Anthropologists and writers have long been interested in this mysterious intuition. Margaret calls it an 'intuitive perception of the environment', which is the best explanation for her accurate water-finding ability. Without this 'sixth sense', how else could her family sustain their well-drilling business year after year?"
CAE_36,"**We Changed Lives for a Day!**

Have you ever thought about swapping lives with someone for a day? Maybe you think it would be fun to try something different. We arranged this for four people. Here’s what happened.

**Amanda's Story**

Amanda, a 23-year-old mother with two daughters, swapped lives with her friend Cindy, a 30-year-old waitress at a busy London restaurant.

Amanda had never been in such a lively place before. It was dark, noisy, and full of people. It was very different from her hometown, and she wasn't sure she could handle it. Being a mother is busy, but this was something else! She had only 15 minutes to learn how to carry a tray of drinks with one hand. The other waitresses made it look easy, but Amanda struggled. The drinks fell off the tray, and she was embarrassed, but the other waitresses laughed and said everyone makes mistakes at first.

By 11:30 am, a line had formed outside, and Amanda felt nervous. She worried about remembering orders, but everything was automated, so that wasn't a problem. After a few hours, her feet hurt, and she couldn't get used to the loud music. She had to keep asking customers to repeat themselves, which was embarrassing. By the end of her shift at 5 pm, she was exhausted and wanted to soak her feet. She was surprised when a waitress said it had been a ""quiet"" day. Amanda realized waitressing was tiring and required a bubbly personality and a cool head. She didn't think she could handle a busy Saturday night. She wasn't impressed with the pay either, as she didn't get any tips. She was glad to return to her children, which seemed easier after waitressing.

**Cindy's Story**

Cindy was nervous but excited to be a ""mum"" for the day. She was warned that Amanda's daughters were cheeky, but she thought she could manage. She was wrong. After Amanda left for work, Cindy had to dress and feed the girls. She dropped Sophie at school and Katie at nursery, thinking she’d have three hours of peace. But Amanda left a note reminding her to make the beds, clean the house, and do the washing.

At 1 pm, Cindy picked up Katie, went to the supermarket, and then took her home for lunch. When Sophie came home from school, the real chaos began. The girls turned the sofa into a trampoline and screamed loudly. Cindy thought they would tire out, but they didn’t. She managed to get them to bed by 8 pm, but they kept asking for water to stay up and watch TV. It was exhausting negotiating with them all evening. Cindy realized how tiring it was to look after two small children. There was no time for herself, and the responsibility was overwhelming. Despite this, she enjoyed the day.

**Rosemary's Story**

Rosemary, a 42-year-old dairy farmer, swapped with Hilary, a 30-year-old primary school teacher.

On the farm, Rosemary wakes up at 5:30 am, so sleeping until 7 was a luxury. She worried about what to wear, as she couldn’t show up in overalls and boots. At the school assembly, she hoped to blend in among 400 pupils. In a maths class, children worked in small groups, which was different from her school days. She helped with a nature project involving snails. By lunchtime, she was tired but found out teachers only have about five minutes to eat. She attended a staff meeting and helped with athletics trials. After lunch, there was a silent reading lesson, which was a relief, and then a French lesson. The children wanted to practice French with her, which showed her rusty skills. Finally, they had Physical Education, and Rosemary was drained, but the children were full of energy. The hardest part was speaking in front of the class. Despite teachers having more holidays, Rosemary preferred farming.

**Hilary's Story**

Hilary arrived at White House Farm at 8:30 am, only to find Rosemary had been up for three hours. The farm has 100 Jersey cows, 15 calves, and about 800 ewes. Rosemary also makes ice cream, yogurt, and cream, which are sold in shops and restaurants.

Hilary spent the morning in the ice-cream parlour, bottling milk and packaging ice cream. It was hard not to taste the treats. At lunchtime, she checked the sheep and helped a fallen ewe. Sheep need to be checked daily, especially in winter. After feeding the calves, she started milking, which took two and a half hours. Rosemary does this twice a day, every day of the year. Hilary found the day lonely and missed the children. Animals don’t talk back! The hardest part was not being able to take time off, as cows need milking twice a day. Rosemary only gets about three days of holiday a year. Farming seems romantic, but the reality is different. The income is irregular, and the weather can be a big challenge."
CAE_6,"Text: 'A trumpet isn't just for Christmas... It's interesting how many musicians, even famous ones, come from families without a musical background. Hakan Hardenberger, the only child of non-musical parents in a rural area of southern Sweden, has become a standout trumpet player at the age of 30. His recordings are expanding the trumpet repertoire, including concertos by lesser-known composers from the baroque and classical periods, as well as new works. When you meet him, he appears even younger than his age, with a fresh and open demeanor, much like the sound of a trumpet. Recently, he performed the Hummel Trumpet Concerto, a favorite of his, in one of London's top concert halls, and a television feature highlighted his work and development, filmed in both the UK and Sweden. Born near Malmo, his career began with a Christmas gift when he was eight. His father, who liked Louis Armstrong's music, decided to give him a real trumpet instead of a toy. The gift was a success, and Hakan never stopped playing. His mother found a teacher for him, the second trumpet player in the Malmo Symphony Orchestra, Bo Nilsson, who recognized his natural talent. Hardenberger is grateful for having such a dedicated teacher from the start, someone who was passionate about the trumpet and connected with players worldwide. Hardenberger explains that the trumpet is a simple instrument with imperfections, and it's important to understand and work with them. From the beginning, he had a talent for finding the right balance and creating his unique sound. Unlike John Wallace, a great British trumpet player who started in brass bands and orchestras, Hardenberger always saw himself as a solo artist. He admired the French trumpeter Maurice Andre, who also focused on solo performances. His parents supported his ambition to make a career out of trumpet playing. At 15, he needed to decide where to study. America was considered too far and dangerous, so at 16, he went to Paris to study with Pierre Thibaud. Thibaud advised against joining an orchestra, comparing it to gardening. Hardenberger knew he played better than others his age, but it was during his first competition in Paris at 17 that he realized he had a special ability to connect with audiences. Thibaud suggested entering the competition for experience. Hardenberger only prepared for the first round but advanced to the second, where he knew most of the pieces. In the final, he faced a challenging concerto but enjoyed the performance, realizing that even if he didn't play perfectly, people listened to him. His honesty about his work might seem arrogant, but that's not the case. He avoids analyzing his gift for communication, believing that trying to explain it could ruin it. The power of music lies in its ability to move people.'"

CAE_20,"**Take Five Careers**

Rebecca Cripps talks to five women about their different jobs: the good parts, the challenges, and what a typical day looks like.

**A. THE BRAIN SURGEON**

**Name:** Anne  
**Age:** 34

**ANNE'S DAY**  
Anne wakes up at 6:30 am, goes to the gym at 7 am, and starts work by 8 am. She begins operating at 8:30 am on Mondays, Wednesdays, and some Friday afternoons. Most brain surgeries take about three hours, but some can last all day. Sometimes, she works for ten hours without a break. Deciding when and how to operate can be stressful. While she doesn't feel stressed during surgery, she sometimes worries about the next day's operations. Brain surgery is often a last option for patients, but successful surgeries are very rewarding. From 10 am to 1 pm, she runs an out-patient clinic, explaining operations to patients. She enjoys talking to them, but time constraints can make it hard to comfort upset patients. Anne leaves work between 6 pm and 8 pm. She is on call some nights and weekends, always carrying her pager. On holidays, she worries about her patients for the first few days and dreams about operating at night. She finds it hard to switch off from work.

**B. THE SENIOR DESIGNER**

**Name:** Marita  
**Age:** 31

**MARITA'S DAY**  
Marita gets up at 7:45 am, leaves home by 8:20 am, and arrives at work by 9:15 am. On Mondays at 10:30 am, her team meets to discuss projects and any issues. Her team includes three senior designers, a company partner, and a junior designer. Only 10-15% of her work is design; the rest is production. She receives a brief from the client and spends three to four weeks designing and developing the project. After presenting her ideas to the client and getting approval, she works on estimates and budgets, and hires photographers and illustrators. She coordinates with printers to ensure deadlines are met. Managing multiple projects can be very stressful, with no set daily structure. Lunch is at 1 pm for an hour, often at a pub, or she eats sandwiches while working. It's satisfying when clients like her designs, but disappointing when hard work is rejected. She gets home at 7:30 pm at the earliest, often later, and finds it hard to relax if she's busy.

**C. THE CHAUFFEUR**

**Name:** Linda  
**Age:** 42

**LINDA'S DAY**  
Linda usually wakes up at 7 am, but on days she meets early flights, she gets up between 4:30 am and 5 am. Around 10:30 or 11 am, she might go for a bike ride or swim to stay fit, as her job is mostly sitting. She eats a big breakfast and snacks during the day. She needs to know good restaurants, nightclubs, and shops to recommend to clients. Many jobs are pre-booked, allowing her to plan routes. Not all passengers are polite; some are rude, but most are well-behaved, and she has good relationships with regular clients. She sometimes overhears conversations in the car but keeps them private. The press has tried to get her to talk about clients, but she refuses. Linda works seven days a week, up to fifteen hours a day, and tries to sleep by 11 pm.

**D. THE LANDSCAPE GARDENER**

**Name:** Tracy  
**Age:** 27

**TRACY'S DAY**  
Tracy wakes up at 7 am, leaves home by 7:30 am, and starts her first job. She and her assistant mainly maintain gardens they designed. They do some commercial work but mostly private gardens, spending about an hour and a half at each. Around 11 am, they have a big breakfast at a cafe. In summer, she may work until 10 pm; in winter, until 4:30 pm. Her business office is at home, so she checks messages and returns calls after work. If someone wants a garden designed, she arranges evening consultations. They use old materials and unique plants to create gardens that look aged. Sometimes clients have specific, unappealing ideas, but it's satisfying to see a garden completed and blooming. Tracy finds it hard to relax in the evenings because she hears the business phone. She sleeps well because the physical work is tiring. The job is tough but allows creativity.

**E. THE CIVIL ENGINEER**

**Name:** Zena  
**Age:** 27

**ZENA'S DAY**  
Zena arrives at the construction site by 8:30 am. As an assistant resident engineer, she oversees the building of bridges and a retaining wall. She ensures contractors follow schedules, safety rules, and minimize environmental impact. She coordinates site professionals and solves problems. Contractors start at 6 am, so she first checks with the clerk of works about overnight progress. Her day depends on this information. She reviews paperwork and answers design questions. Lunch is usually a quick half-hour between 2 pm and 2:30 pm. When contractors are on break, it's easier to inspect the site. Checking their work can cause tension, so she maintains open communication. She meets the duty resident engineer daily but acts immediately on urgent issues. Zena leaves the site around 6 pm and is always on call."
CAE_40,"**Careers: Six People Talk About Their Typical Working Day**

**A. Credit Card Executive**
I wake up at 6 am and get to the office by 7:30 am. I handle customer development programs for our regular credit card users. My job includes launching and managing the Membership Rewards scheme in major European markets. I keep in touch with current card users, find new ones, and build relationships with partner companies. I spend the first 45 minutes organizing my day and responding to emails. I manage advertising for the membership program across Europe, so I meet with marketing staff and advertising agencies to plan strategies and future developments. I have meetings most of the day, but I keep my door open for questions. I travel to different markets in Europe once or twice a week to discuss issues. When I'm in London, I leave work between 6:30 pm and 7:00 pm.

**B. Record Company Executive**
I start work at 10:00 am and go through the mail, which includes demo tapes, letters from producers, concert information, and invoices. The phone starts ringing around 10:30 am with calls from producers and publishers. I have meetings throughout the day about campaigns or projects for artists, involving the press, marketing, and the managing director. When I listen to demo tapes, I try to be constructive because it's important work for the artists. I know instinctively if the sound fits our label. After signing a band, we work on the first album, choosing songs, producers, and musicians. I share my vision of the album with the company for marketing and sales. I also manage budgets and spending. I leave work at 7:00 pm at the earliest and often go to gigs, sometimes seeing up to five new groups a night. After gigs, I might visit an artist in the studio. My social life is mostly work-related, and I often get home at 1:00 am, where I listen to music to relax.

**C. Sales Director**
I wake up at 8:00 am and drive to work, arriving by 9:30 am. I open the mail, check the diary for client visits, and wait to see who comes in. I enjoy showing people around the showrooms and making sales, knowing the furniture is going to a good home. We sell antiques priced between £1,000 and £6,000, buying from London salerooms, country house sales, private clients, and overseas. Many items need restoration, so I work with gilders, picture framers, and paper repairers. I read the Antiques Trade Gazette during coffee breaks to stay updated on the business and often visit the Victoria and Albert Museum to compare furniture. I do the accounts monthly and tax returns every three months. I go home at 5:30 pm and take about an hour to unwind.

**D. Air Traffic Controller**
I work set shifts, leaving home at 6:00 am for early shifts. At 7:00 am, I take over from the night shift at one of the four control positions in the tower. We rotate stations, working for about an hour and a half, then taking a half-hour break before switching stations. The team includes air traffic controllers, a supervisor, and a watch manager, and we control aircraft movements together. In winter, we handle about 1,000 movements a day, and even more in summer. Night shifts are quieter, allowing time to read up on new air traffic requirements. It's crucial to be alert in this job, so I don't hesitate to call in sick if I'm unwell. The work is stressful, and it takes time to relax after a shift. I aim to become a watch manager and eventually a general manager of the airport.

**E. Shop Manager**
If I'm on an early shift, I leave home by 8:00 am. I start by setting up the electronic point-of-sale system and ensure someone is at the till. I coordinate staff lunches and breaks. I spend the morning helping customers and ordering books for them. I enjoy serving customers, though it can be frustrating when they expect me to gather many books based on reviews. Between 2:00 pm and 4:00 pm, publishers' representatives visit, and I discuss new titles for the upcoming months. I decide how many copies of a title the shop might sell. When featuring a new title, I ensure timely delivery. The early shift ends at 5:45 pm. Twice a week, I work a late shift, closing the computer system, locking up, and going home.

**F. Financial Analyst**
I listen to the news at 7:00 am, then take a taxi to work, arriving by 8:45 am. I contact freelance reporters to learn about events in my region. I assess financial risks for multinational companies abroad, warning clients of potential issues. I provide three services: an online executive preview, a security forecast, and a travel information security guide. From 9:15 am to 9:30 am, I meet with editors to discuss stories. My first executive preview is due online by 10:00 am, and the second by 11:00 am, so I quickly gather stories. I type them, send them to my editor for approval, and make any necessary changes before they are published. I travel to Africa about three times a year to report on events or stay updated. I leave work around 6:00 pm, but it's hard to switch off, and I'm often awake until 1:00 am."
CAE_45,"**Career Power: Take Control at Work**

**A. What Makes a Good Leader?**

A good leader inspires others and brings about change. Leadership isn't about your background or height, as some early theories suggested. It's not just about intelligence either. Pat Dixon, author of ""Making the Difference: Women and Men in the Workplace,"" says leadership is about ""making things happen through people who are as enthusiastic and interested as you are."" Enthusiasm is crucial, and a good leader should speak clearly and confidently. Dixon says it's about having the confidence to say ""I believe"" instead of ""I think.""

**B. Recognizing Leadership Potential**

John van Maurik, who directs a Leadership in Management course, believes most people have more leadership potential than they realize. Becoming a leader involves recognizing, developing, and using these hidden talents. In a way, we are all born leaders; we just need the right environment to grow. While it's easy to see leadership in famous figures like Emmeline Pankhurst, Mahatma Gandhi, or Richard Branson, it might be harder to see it in our own workplaces. Yet, leadership is now seen as essential for effective management.

**C. Comparing Leaders and Managers**

Think about the best and worst bosses you've had. They might have been equally good at setting goals and meeting deadlines. But how did they achieve these? The best leader motivated and supported you. The worst made you feel unimportant and withheld information, blaming you when things went wrong. The first was a true leader; the second just managed poorly.

**D. Leaders vs. Managers**

Leaders and managers are different. Managers like working within set boundaries, while leaders create new possibilities. Michael Shea, author of ""Leadership Rules,"" writes that a good manager can keep a company running smoothly, but a good leader can transform a struggling organization, whether it's a company, a sports team, or a nation.

**E. Improving Your Leadership Skills**

Whether you're a boss or a middle manager, you can improve your leadership skills. Here are some lessons:

- Leadership is best when you choose to do it. Find out what you're passionate about. When you feel inspired to lead, use that energy and take action.
- Think of yourself as a leader. Recognize your ability to lead.
- Collaboration is good, but sometimes firm leadership is needed. Try different styles. If you're usually a negotiator, try taking charge. See how this changes the outcome.
- Set goals and exceed them. Identify areas in your job where leadership can improve your effectiveness and career prospects.

**F. Developing Leadership**

- Leadership doesn't just happen. It develops from taking the lead, taking risks, and learning from mistakes. Learn to delegate, motivate, organize, and give feedback.
- Don't assume your leadership style will immediately win over colleagues. It might even push them away. Keep improving your communication skills. You don't have to be liked, but your ideas and achievements should be.
- Be visible and accessible to those who matter. Remember, you don't have to lead all the time. Know where your contribution is crucial and how you can help others become leaders."
CAE_64,"**Films on Video: Reviews by Film Critic Nick James**

**A. Abyss**  
Before Titanic, director James Cameron created this intense Cold War thriller. It’s about oil rig workers and navy experts trying to save a nuclear submarine deep underwater. The characters, especially foreman Bud and his team, remind us of the cool heroes in Howard Hawks' movies. The production design and special effects are very impressive, but the dialogue and character development are not as strong. Despite the skilled filmmaking, the story feels like a typical B-movie.

**B. The Thin Red Line**  
This video release of Andrew Marton's version of the James Jones novel about the battle for Guadalcanal is interesting compared to Terrence Malick's new film. While Malick's version is mystical and poetic, Marton's is a more traditional war movie, often closer to the book. It focuses on one soldier and his tough relationship with his sergeant. Although Malick's film is richer and more complex, Marton's version has its highlights. The flashback scene, where the soldier dreams of his wife, is portrayed with a harshness that might work better than Malick's softer imagery.

**C. On Guard**  
Loosely based on Paul Feval's 1875 novel, this entertaining swashbuckler is better than most musketeer adventures. Fabrice Luchini plays a perfect villain, a scheming politician causing chaos behind the scenes. Vincent Perez is a lively hero, though his role is short-lived, and Daniel Auteuil, while perhaps too serious for this type of film, also shines as an acrobat-turned-swordsman. The filmmakers use costume-drama clichés with such wit and energy that it remains enjoyable.

**D. Character**  
This is a visually striking but somber story set in early 20th-century Rotterdam. The detailed production and costume design make the film look like a museum piece. Jan Decleir plays the grim bailiff Dreverhaven, who is ruthless in evicting tenants. The tense relationship with his son is central to the story, but the filmmakers focus too much on period details, missing the depth of the dark and intense tale.

**E. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly**  
This digitally re-mastered video release highlights director Leone's skill. The sound editing is excellent, making every sound clear and impactful. The story is harsh, and whenever it slows down, Morricone's powerful music brings it back to life. Morally, there is little difference between the good (Clint Eastwood), the bad (Lee van Cleef), and the ugly (Eli Wallach), as they all act ruthlessly in the post-Civil War West.

**F. The Longest Day**  
This three-hour war epic by Darryl Zanuck boasts 'forty-eight international stars.' With four directors and 23,000 extras, it feels overdone. The early scenes, where soldiers wait for the invasion, are as slow for the audience as for the characters. Logistically impressive, it is best suited for the big screen. On video, the experience is less impactful."
CAE_29,"**BOOK A**  
""Compelling Evidence"" by Steve Martin is a gripping story. The narrator is a lawyer trying to start a new practice after leaving a big law firm. He ends up defending his boss's wife, who is accused of murdering her husband. The trial scenes are exciting, with the verdict uncertain until the end, and there's a surprising twist in the final pages. This is a great first book in a popular genre.

**BOOK B**  
""Curtains for the Cardinal"" starts with excitement and throws Sigismondo, a problem-solver for the Italian Renaissance aristocracy, into a mix of politics, church intrigue, and murder. We always believe he will solve the mystery. The plot is complex and the book is a bit long, but it's still very enjoyable.

**BOOK C**  
""File Under: Deceased"" introduces a new detective, Leah Hunter, created by first-time author Sarah Lacey. Leah is a tax inspector who starts investigating when a man suddenly dies at her feet. Despite facing challenges and the disapproval of a local detective sergeant, Leah is determined and successful.

**BOOK D**  
""Double Deuce"" by Robert B. Parker features Spenser, a smart private investigator, helping his friend Hawk to remove drug dealers from a poor area in Boston. The dialogue is quick and sharp, and there is more philosophy than violence. As always, Parker delivers high-quality entertainment.

**BOOK E**  
""False Prophet"" by Faye Kellermann follows detectives Pete Decker and Marge Dunn as they investigate an attack and burglary at the home of a famous film star's daughter. The author's easy writing style and keen observation of human behavior make this an entertaining mystery.

**BOOK F**  
In ""Blood Red, Snow White,"" written by Diane Henry and Nicholas Horrock, a lawyer defends a female client, but the action happens outside the courtroom. The lawyer becomes a victim as the story unfolds. The novel combines romance, money, and violence to create a captivating suspense story.

**BOOK G**  
""Dead for a Ducat"" by Simon Shaw features actor Philip Fletcher, who becomes a target. A funny group of characters gathers to film a Robin Hood story, but Philip feels his career is not going in the right direction. While entertaining, this book doesn't quite reach Shaw's usual high standards.

**BOOK H**  
""Fall Down Easy"" by Lawrence Gough is his best work in a while. Canadian police are on the trail of a clever bank robber who targets female bank tellers. The slow, well-paced tension and the portrayal of the intelligent but troubled robber make this a standout detective novel."
CAE_57,"Text: At 34, Tim Pozzi has decided to leave his good job and go backpacking. He thinks about why he and others his age are making this choice. This summer, he quit his job, rented out his flat, and planned to travel in Southeast Asia for a year. You might think he's lucky, but he's 34 and nervous. It's not his first time traveling; after university, he spent two years backpacking in the Americas. When he returned, he wanted to do it again, but life happened. He fell in love, started a career, bought a flat, and got used to earning a salary. Over time, he realized he was sacrificing his happiness for money. Quitting his job felt like taking control of his life again. Now, he has no ties. Many of his friends are married with children, and while they wouldn't trade places with him, they envy his lack of responsibilities. He's single and has no strong career ambitions, so he feels he should make the most of his freedom, partly for his friends' sake.

Why is he nervous? First, it's about making arrangements. How could he let someone else live in his home? How would he organize the rental? And he had to decide where to go. He's a procrastinator and is already weeks behind schedule. He told himself to enjoy the summer in England and then thought about staying for the football season. Emotional ties make it harder. He's delaying because he wonders if he can still handle backpacking. Can he adjust to a simpler life? Will he fit in with younger backpackers? Maybe. More Britons in their late twenties and thirties are leaving their lives behind to travel. Jennifer Cox from Lonely Planet says people are realizing they can have adventures if they're brave, organized, and confident.

For Danny, a 30-year-old accountant, and his girlfriend Tammy, a 28-year-old teacher, it's a chance for a final adventure before settling down. They bought a round-the-world ticket for a year. Danny is willing to risk job security for the trip. He knows he might not advance in his career, but he thinks it's worth the risk. When he left his office, he threw his calculator into the river as a symbolic act of defiance.

For Matt, who just left the Army, a year of traveling was a time of change. In the military, there's a set way of doing things. He traveled to change this mindset and adapt to civilian life. There are many reasons to travel at this age, but common factors exist. Angela Baron from the Institute of Personnel Development says the workforce is more flexible now. More people work on short-term contracts, so if a contract ends, there's nothing to lose. Some companies even have career-break policies to keep trained employees from leaving for competitors.

Dan Hiscocks, managing director of Travellerseye, says more people in their thirties are re-evaluating their lives. If they're unhappy, they don't just stick it out. They know opportunities exist, and jobs aren't ""for life"" anymore. Travel offers a chance to reassess and think about life. Is wanderlust just avoiding adulthood? Jennifer Cox disagrees. She says it's a sign of a better-educated, stable society when people want a balanced life. They're asking, ""Is this what I want?""

Ben, a 32-year-old picture researcher, is going to Central America for a year. He doesn't think he's running away; he's running towards something he wants. But he feels nervous about leaving behind a comfortable routine, like going to the office, greeting colleagues, and having coffee. Tim shares Ben's concerns about leaving a stable life. He might not be traveling if his boss wasn't so difficult. Jennifer Cox says there's often a catalyst, like a breakup or job loss, that pushes people to travel. It took a push for Tim to start, but now he's excited about the next 12 months. Whatever happens, he'll be proud of taking this step. He believes many older backpackers feel the same way."

She felt unqualified for jobs requiring desktop publishing skills, which she lacked. As a self-proclaimed technophobe, even simple gadgets confused her. She knew she had to act fast to save her career.

Unexpectedly, she won a computer package in a local newspaper competition. This included a laptop for her husband and a personal computer for the family. They quickly adapted to new terms like cyberspace and Internet. The children stopped watching TV, and Georgina set up a mini-office in the kitchen with a phone, fax machine, CD-ROM, and modem. This allowed her to work from home while still taking the kids to school. The children were already familiar with computers from school, but Georgina was cautious, fearing she might lose her work with a wrong button press. However, she learned the basics and found it logical and easy.

Georgina started freelancing for a magazine, writing two articles a month. She felt she had the best of both worlds. The computer helped her become organized, especially with office tasks. Spreadsheets tracked income and expenses, and pre-formatted invoices saved time. For a journalist, being online meant researching stories and connecting with others globally.

However, working from home had downsides, like isolation and household distractions. There were also arguments over computer use when the children were home. Despite this, more people were buying multimedia PCs for education and entertainment, leading to a new type of home-based work industry.

A report on PC usage in UK homes described the typical computer user as 38 years old and well-educated, with most owning a personal computer and many having a CD-ROM and modem. Georgina felt ahead of the curve and imagined one day emailing a column to a newspaper in Melbourne or even publishing her own magazine from home. The possibilities seemed endless."
CAE_59,"The Tartan Museum

The modern buildings of Scotland's national museum stand out in historic Edinburgh. But are its exhibits just as impressive? Sally Varlow visited the museum before it opened.

You can't miss the Museum of Scotland. It's located on the corner of Chambers Street in Edinburgh, with its large, yellow sandstone tower and unique cheese-wedge shaped buildings, topped with a hanging garden. Last winter, the building received mixed reactions: some praised it as a modern architectural masterpiece, while others were more cautious or even hostile. Now, as the museum prepares to open, the exhibitions inside are likely to receive similar mixed reviews.

The museum tells the story of the nation in a chronological way, with each exhibit centered around a historic object. There is a timeline to help visitors understand the displays, but it doesn't restrict them. The museum doesn't let national pride overshadow its treasures, like Mary Queen of Scots' jewels and the Holyrood chapel silver.

The main question is whether people will find the museum interesting enough to return. Dr. David Clarke, the head of exhibitions, wants the museum to be a visual and enjoyable experience for everyone, not just specialists. He believes in showing the truth about the past, without relying on imaginative recreations. The museum uses explanation panels, captions, and multimedia to tell the stories of the objects, with only about 30 computers throughout the museum.

Inside, the museum's design is impressive. The galleries flow into one another, with different sizes and shapes, and pale wood-paneled walls that look like stone. Daylight streams through narrow windows and roof lights, creating a pleasant atmosphere to enjoy the exhibits.

The museum also has a Discovery Centre for children, thanks to a Junior Board of 9- to 12-year-olds from across Scotland. Although they couldn't have a ride through the displays, they did get a hands-on center for kids. The Twentieth Century gallery on the top floor is the only temporary exhibition, featuring objects chosen by Scottish people and personalities that impacted life in Scotland during the twentieth century. The Prime Minister suggested an electric guitar, while others chose televisions, Thermos flasks, and favorite toys. This gallery might seem light-hearted, but it could feel more substantial when the computerised bank of personal stories goes live.

Overall, Dr. Clarke believes that objects can vividly open windows to the past. As for the modern architecture, it works well from the inside, but whether it fits the historic location is another question."
CAE_54,"The end of print newspapers might take longer than expected. Transition is a comforting idea, suggesting a smooth change from the present to the future. However, the shift of newspapers to the online world is uncertain and uncomfortable. Many believe it will happen eventually, as print sales drop and online visits increase. For example, The Daily Telegraph and The Guardian have seen print sales fall by 8-10% annually, while their websites gain more visitors. 

Yet, the situation is more complex. The World Association of Newspapers reports a 1.1% global increase in newspaper circulation, with Asia compensating for declines in the West. News magazines, expected to struggle in the digital age, actually saw a 5.4% increase. Similarly, while e-readers like Kindle are popular, physical book sales only dropped by 0.4%. This suggests that both digital and print formats are thriving.

Claims that young people are abandoning newspapers are exaggerated. Nearly 5 million people aged 15 to 35 still read major national dailies. Different countries show different trends: the UK has seen a 10.8% drop in print sales, while Germany's decline is only 7%, and France's is 3.1%.

The idea that online advertising would support digital newspapers is fading, as digital ad revenues decline. Many US newspapers have introduced paywalls, but the most successful strategy combines print and digital subscriptions. Print remains important for attracting online subscribers and generates significantly more advertising revenue than digital.

Maintaining both print and online editions is challenging and costly for newspapers. However, print still plays a key role in maintaining a newspaper's visibility and reputation, which is harder to achieve online."
CAE_32,"**Photographing People**

People are the most interesting subjects to photograph. A photo with a person in it is usually more engaging than one without. However, photographing people well is challenging. Besides technical and artistic aspects, photographers must pay attention to actions, gestures, and expressions. Sometimes, the camera itself can make people act unnaturally.

**A. Grouping People**

Avoid straight lines in group photos. Ask people to stand at different angles and distances, or on different levels. You can also have some people sit or kneel in front so all faces are visible, or take the photo from a higher angle.

**B. Posing for Pictures**

People often act unnaturally in front of a camera. They might become stiff and awkward. Help them relax by suggesting comfortable positions, like folding their hands or putting them in their pockets.

**C. The Right Approach**

Don't pretend you're not taking a picture when you clearly are, as this can create tension. Most people will agree to be photographed, even if they protest at first, and might feel flattered. However, they may become self-conscious, so you might need to guide them. A photo can be ruined if the subject looks aimlessly away, making the interest lie elsewhere.

**D. Eye Contact**

A photo has more impact if the subject looks at the viewer. Ask them to look into the lens, but they don't have to smile. They might not be able to do this for long, so remind them just before you take the shot. You can also say something funny or unexpected to get a genuine reaction.

**E. Candid Concentration**

Instead of direct eye contact, the subject can focus on something within the picture. This might be easier for them, and the viewer can follow their gaze. Candid shots are fascinating, and the subject's expression is crucial.

**F. Expressions and Gestures**

Expressions and gestures reveal a lot about the subject. A laughing child can make the viewer smile, while a sad expression can evoke sympathy. Look for familiar expressions like shrugs, winks, or thumbs-up. They are a universal visual language.

**G. Situation Interest**

While close-up shots of faces are impactful, the background can add interest and information. When using a background, exclude irrelevant details or blur them. Ensure the subject isn't overshadowed by the background. A wide-angle lens can make the subject appear larger compared to the background.

**H. Interaction**

When people are interacting, there are great photo opportunities. Couples, mothers and babies, or teams working together make appealing shots. Look for eye contact or physical contact, like a handshake, or wait for an expressive gesture.

**I. People and Places**

Many photos of people are taken on holidays to show the places they visit. To improve these photos, use a standard or wide-angle lens and step back to include the whole scene. Ask your subjects to come close to the camera, forming a foreground without blocking the background. An elevated camera position can help balance the subjects and the place.

**J. To Pose or Not to Pose?**

Decide why you want to take the picture. If it's to remember someone you met briefly, ask them to pose against a nice background. Family photos can be boring if they are just formal poses. Candid shots of events are more lively, especially when you know the subject well. A spontaneous photo can bring back memories better than a posed one."
CAE_65,"**Under Sarah's Spell**

Sarah Janson is a trompe-l'oeil artist, which means she creates paintings that trick the eye into seeing something that looks real. In this interview with Joanna Watt, we learn more about her and her art.

Unlike most artists, Sarah doesn't sign her work unless someone asks her to. She believes the art is more important than the artist. Sarah is very modest and almost makes it seem like her paintings create themselves. This attitude makes her a bit shy about interviews. She even gets embarrassed when asked to be photographed.

However, once she feels comfortable, the interview becomes lively and fun. Sarah has been a trompe-l'oeil artist for sixteen years. She studied drawing for two years at art school, got a degree in graphic illustration, and worked at a publishing house. But illustration didn't fulfill her, so she joined a decorator named Jim Smart. He asked her to create a trompe-l'oeil piece, and she found her passion.

Sarah's skills in observation and detail, developed through illustration, are crucial for trompe-l'oeil. She believes you can't be taught this art; it's about observing life. She insists she's still learning and says, ""The moment you think you've mastered a field, you might as well give up.""

Sarah is honest about her challenges, like struggling to paint bread or calculate measurements for a big project. She often questions her abilities and sometimes talks about herself in the third person, as if her talent is separate from her.

Her work is highly regarded, with many corporate and private commissions. Much of her art is inspired by architecture. For example, she created a dining room that looks like a Venetian palace and a painting that makes a corridor seem like it leads to more rooms.

Trompe-l'oeil must do two things: trick the viewer and engage their imagination. Sarah believes it should also be personal to the client. She enjoys working with clients to develop ideas and often becomes friends with them because she spends so much time on-site.

Sarah appreciates her clients, especially those who give her creative freedom. Despite her modesty, she is always busy because her clients love her work. She repeats that she doesn't like to boast about herself, preferring her work to speak quietly. But her art is anything but boring and deserves more recognition."
CAE_61,"**Emotional Intelligence - The Key to Success**

Daniel Goleman explores the 'people skills' that are crucial for reaching the top in your career.

**A** The way we are evaluated at work is changing. It's not just about how smart we are or our training, but also how well we manage ourselves and interact with others. This new way of judging is important for deciding who gets hired or promoted. It helps identify who might excel and who might not. These skills are important for future job opportunities, regardless of the field. They are not about doing well in exams, which we learned in school. Instead, they focus on social skills and personal qualities like initiative, empathy, adaptability, and persuasiveness. These are known as emotional intelligence.

**B** In today's world, where job security is uncertain, personal qualities are becoming more important at work. These have been called 'character', 'personality', or 'soft skills' in the past, but now we understand them better as 'emotional intelligence'. This means being able to understand and manage your own and others' emotions, and using them to guide your actions. Emotional intelligence includes self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills. It's not just about 'being nice'. Sometimes it means being honest, even if it's uncomfortable. It also doesn't mean expressing all your feelings freely. Instead, it involves managing emotions so they help people work together towards a common goal.

**C** More businesses are realizing that emotional intelligence is important for management. The more complex the job, the more these skills matter. A lack of emotional intelligence can limit the use of technical skills or intelligence. While some people succeed despite weaknesses in emotional intelligence, as work becomes more complex and team-oriented, companies that foster these skills have an advantage. In today's workplace, with a focus on teamwork and customer service, emotional intelligence is essential for success everywhere.

**D** Unlike IQ, which changes little, emotional intelligence can grow as we learn from life experiences. Studies show that people often get better at managing their emotions, motivating themselves, and improving their social skills over time. This growth in emotional intelligence is often called maturity. These skills can be learned and added to our personal toolkit, especially when job stability is uncertain. Emotional intelligence isn't a magic solution for struggling companies, but ignoring it can prevent other efforts from being as effective as they could be."
CAE_52,"Text: 'Should the media make money from content they don't own? Digital cameras and camera phones have made it easier to capture important events, but social media has changed citizen photography even more. News often breaks on social networks, so some journalists use them to find images during fast-moving events. Unfortunately, some reporters have used user-generated content (UGC) without asking for permission. Official guidelines say that images from social media can be used without permission only in exceptional cases or if there is a strong public interest, but there is still debate about whether this is ethical. Research shows that about one in ten people would film or photograph a news event, indicating that UGC will be important for the media's future. However, to keep a good relationship with the public, the media must ensure people are properly rewarded for their work and always ask for permission.'"
CAE_28,"**Ancient Chinese Medicine in the West**

**Acupuncture's Origins and Uses**

Acupuncture is a practice that is over two thousand years old, originating from traditional Chinese medicine. This system also includes herbal remedies, massage, diet, and exercise. Acupuncture is used to treat various conditions, but it is most recognized in the West for its role in pain relief. Some general practitioners, midwives, and physiotherapists use it regularly to help with pain.

**Understanding Acupuncture**

Traditional Chinese medicine views health as a balance of energy in the mind, body, and spirit. This energy, known as Qi (pronounced ""chee""), flows through the body along pathways called meridians. There are twelve main meridians, each connected to an internal organ, and many smaller ones that distribute Qi throughout the body. If the flow of Qi is disrupted, it can lead to illness or weakness. An acupuncturist will try to identify these imbalances by checking your pulse, examining your tongue, and asking about your health, lifestyle, and habits. They use fine needles inserted into the skin and may also use heat or pressure to stimulate Qi flow.

**Acupuncture Points**

The points used in acupuncture are related to meridians and may not be near the area of pain. Patients often feel a dull ache or tingling when the needle is manipulated, either by hand or with an electro-acupuncture machine. This sensation indicates that the needle has reached the Qi. There are over three hundred main acupuncture points, with many more used less frequently.

**Scientific Explanations**

While Western doctors may not fully accept traditional Chinese medicine principles, they acknowledge that acupuncture can relieve pain. Scientific explanations suggest that acupuncture might work by stimulating nerves to block pain signals or by releasing natural pain-relieving substances called endorphins.

**Types of Pain Treated**

Acupuncture is often a last resort for people with chronic pain. It is commonly used for back pain, sports injuries, arthritis, headaches, migraines, and post-surgery pain. Acupuncturists also claim to treat menstrual pain, facial nerve pain, and pain in terminally ill patients.

**Modern Use of Acupuncture**

Although acupuncture has been practiced in China for over 2,000 years, its use as an alternative to anesthesia in surgery began in the 1950s. This development helped convince some Western doctors of its effectiveness. In China, acupuncture is used in various surgeries, sometimes with electrical stimulation or drugs. It is said to eliminate pain without the side effects of conventional anesthetics, allowing quicker recovery.

**Effectiveness of Acupuncture**

Clinical trials for acupuncture are challenging to conduct, but some have shown that 50 to 80 percent of people find it effective for chronic pain. Acupuncturists agree with these success rates but acknowledge that it doesn't work for everyone. For chronic pain, noticeable relief usually occurs after six or seven sessions, with some improvement after two or three.

**Different Approaches to Pain**

Western and Chinese medicine have different views on pain. Acupuncturists take a holistic approach, considering the whole person rather than just symptoms. They spend time diagnosing underlying issues in Qi and consider external factors like weather conditions that might affect pain. This approach is different from that of a typical medical doctor.

**Choosing an Acupuncturist**

Some medical professionals have traditional acupuncture training, while others, including many general practitioners, prefer scientific explanations. Traditional acupuncturists believe that only by using traditional Chinese medicine can deep, lasting changes be achieved. When choosing an acupuncturist, ensure they are qualified and willing to refer you to a medical doctor if needed."
CAE_35,"P.D. James, whose full name is Phyllis Dorothy James, is a famous crime writer known for her complex and imaginative stories. Despite her calm and authoritative appearance, she is actually quite shy. She admits that her detective character, Adam Dalgliesh, is somewhat based on herself, imagining how she might have been if she were a man. Like Dalgliesh, she prefers to work alone, especially when writing, needing complete privacy to focus.

James is humble about her success, even though her 12 detective novels are loved by millions worldwide. She admires the works of her friend Ruth Rendell, especially those written under the name Barbara Vine. Her reading preferences include books by women authors like Iris Murdoch and Anita Brookner, but she also appreciates male authors such as Graham Greene and Evelyn Waugh.

James's success came later in life. She was 42 when her first novel, ""Cover Her Face,"" was published. Born in Oxford and raised in Cambridge, she met her husband, Connor Bantry White, there. Her life has had its challenges; her husband returned from World War II very ill, and she had to work hard to support him and their two daughters. Her husband's parents helped care for the children during these tough times.

While working full-time for the National Health Service and later at the Home Office, she used her strong organizational skills. Her work included managing psychiatric clinics and dealing with forensic science and juvenile crime. It was during this time that she became used to seeing corpses, but it was the structure of crime novels, not death itself, that interested her. She always wanted to be a writer and saw detective stories as a way to learn the craft of serious writing.

James didn't want to use her own life's difficult events in her fiction. Writing detective stories allowed her to explore human nature within the framework of a classic detective story. She believes that solving a crime in a story brings order to chaos and highlights the value of life, even if the life in question is not particularly lovable. She notes that nobody truly likes violence."
CAE_5,"Text: 'The pen is mightier than the psychoanalyst The study of handwriting to reveal a person's character is gaining support In some countries, if you apply for a job, you might be asked for a sample of your handwriting. Your handwriting could play a big role in deciding if you are right for the job. Handwriting analysis, or graphology, is seen as a real science in many places. Researchers say it can help identify certain illnesses, like heart disease and cancer, and can show psychological states and emotional issues. Handwriting analysis is being used more for career guidance and as a part of job interviews. Many large companies hire graphologists to look at the handwriting of people applying for important jobs. However, most doctors and psychiatrists are skeptical about graphology's value. Patricia Marne, a professional graphologist for over 20 years, argues that they should take it more seriously. She believes handwriting can show psychological traits and some medical conditions. She says: 'Handwriting is a strong indicator of social class and intelligence. But more than that, it can assess mental ability and potential, whether a person should focus on arts or sciences, and whether they have a devious or open character.' According to Ms. Marne, graphology can be especially useful in assessing possible criminal tendencies: 'Criminals often have disturbed handwriting, mostly illiterate and poorly-shaped. Most criminals come from deprived backgrounds and have arrested emotional development. This often shows up in unusually childish handwriting and in going over letters several times. The person behind the handwriting: examples analyzed by graphologist Patricia Marne. 'I can tell whether people are honest, manipulators, or reliable employees.' 'Young male offenders frequently have very high ascenders, indicating that they live in a world of fantasy and dream of making it big. Graphologists can tell whether violence is about to erupt, whether the writer is under unbearable pressure, and whether there are psychopathic tendencies. Handwriting can be used to predict would-be suicides.' Heart and lung problems can also show up, she says. 'You can't make a diagnosis from one sample, unless the writing is obviously shaky or disturbed. But if over a period of time it changes or becomes disjointed, if there's a break in the signature which did not exist previously, that could be a sign that something quite serious has occurred.' A severe emotional upset can also show up in a temporarily altered signature, she maintains. Ms. Marne says handwriting can be used to reveal other psychological characteristics. People with writing in which letters form 'threads' instead of being individually formed are, apparently, devious and clever. Those who write mainly in capitals are trying to hide their true selves from others. Very light pressure indicates sensitivity and lack of vitality. Originality in handwriting - how far the writer has deviated from copybook script - indicates confidence and artistic ability. Disconnected writing is the main sign of a loner. Very small signatures indicate inhibition and an inferiority complex; circles over the 'i' are a bid for attention, and crossing the 't' heavily over the whole word is a sign of intolerance and a patronizing attitude. Ms. Marne says it takes six years of study and experience to analyze handwriting accurately, and this has to be combined with empathy and intuition. She feels that more research is needed to put graphology on a proper scientific footing. This will happen soon, she believes. 'It's actually far more accurate than psychoanalysis, as you can tell the whole history of the person, including all their emotional crises, without asking them questions to which they may give wrong answers.' Interesting as all this may sound, there is little hard evidence to support such claims. Some psychiatrists are highly critical of them. Handwriting, they say, is a product of education, artistic ability, and the type of writing taught - and has no other significance.'"
CAE_41,"Text: 'Is your office working well? Fresh air and comfortable chairs are essential for a happy, healthy workforce, according to a new survey. We visited four different offices to see how healthy and happy they were as work environments. Our expert panel included a building health consultant, an ergonomist who studies people's working conditions, and an occupational psychologist. Here are their findings.

Office A: Advertising Agency
Building Health Consultant: This office is very simple; no central heating, no mechanical ventilation, and windows open directly to the street. It's hard to see why it works, but the small, dynamic team seems to have few complaints. They adapt to the seasons by opening doors and roof panels or using electric heaters, much like they would at home. This might be the key: a team of seven people has created a happy, homely work environment without external bureaucracy.

Ergonomist: The furniture here is mismatched and often creates bad working postures. Chairs are old, most aren't adjustable, and many are broken. Despite this, the staff have a varied work schedule, which they control—office work, meeting clients, making presentations, etc. This variety reduces the risk of fatigue, boredom, and muscle problems.

Occupational Psychologist: Staff enjoy the variety of work and the flexible office space. They said their office was 'just the right size'—small enough to know what colleagues are doing, large enough to focus on personal work. The office is attractive and fun, showing both efficiency and creativity.

Office B: News Service
Building Health Consultant: The office may not be exciting, but it is comfortable and not disliked by staff. Air quality and maintenance are good, helped by a No Smoking policy.

Ergonomist: The company has used an ergonomist before. Chairs are excellent, lighting and computer equipment are good. Space is adequate, though the layout could be better. However, the environment is impersonal and dull, with grey, bare walls.

Occupational Psychologist: Walls are bare except for year planners and a poster about maternity rights. Most staff have been there for over five years, and relationships are satisfactory. The office could improve by rearranging desks for easier information sharing. Success stories or project information could be displayed on the walls.

Office C: Bank
Building Health Consultant: This office gets mixed reactions. It feels like being in a glass case, viewing and being viewed by similar setups. Despite smokers and non-smokers in a small space, the air doesn't seem stale. Even 1.5 meters from a smoker, you can't smell the cigarette.

Ergonomist: The office is standard and uninspiring. Desks are just adequate. Not all chairs meet requirements, but this is user choice. Computer screens are on small desks with lowered keyboard shelves, which is outdated for modern equipment.

Occupational Psychologist: Staff support each other and are well-served by technology. Many communication awards are displayed. The wood-colored panels and brown carpet give a slightly serious feel. The office is busy with activity.

Office D: Newspaper
Building Health Consultant: It's hard to say anything positive about this building. The air-conditioning is poorly controlled, causing temperature changes. The space is cluttered, and most people have inadequate desk space. The office is dusty, with dust collecting on the shed-type roof, which falls on people below if disturbed.

Ergonomist: The furniture is more suited to a carpentry workshop than a high-tech industry. Most chairs are unsuitable for keyboard users, especially those shorter than 1.75 m. Many chairs are old, lack adjustment, and have armrests that prevent users from getting close to the desk.

Occupational Psychologist: Old brown chairs, dirty carpets, dust, and dirt everywhere. There's a lot of room for improvement—the place needs cleaning, individual success should be recognized more, and air conditioning needs immediate improvement due to many smokers. Few conversations were happening during our visit; everyone seemed stressed and driven by deadlines. The company needs to adopt team-working policies.'"
CAE_38,"Chewing Gum Culture

Chewing gum is popular and widely used, with Americans consuming 12 million sticks daily. It has evolved from an ancient practice into a major industry. Each stick of gum has fewer than ten calories and is considered a food, so it must meet the American Food and Drug Administration's standards. Modern gum is mostly synthetic, with added pine resins and softeners to enhance flavor and texture.

Historically, the ancient Greeks chewed a resin from the mastic tree, mainly found in Greece and Turkey, to clean their teeth and freshen their breath. In America, colonists learned from the Amero-Indians in New England to chew resin from spruce trees. This became the first commercial chewing gum in the U.S. in the early 1800s.

The modern chewing gum industry began in the late 1860s with the discovery of chicle, a milky substance from the sapodilla tree in Central America. Chicle made gum smoother and more elastic, leading to the growth of the industry. However, attempts to farm sapodilla have failed, so synthetic alternatives were developed as the market expanded.

Today, the few remaining chicle gatherers, known as chicleros, face tough and dangerous conditions. They travel long distances in humid environments, dealing with poisonous snakes and insects. The chicle fly, which lays eggs in the ears and nose, is particularly troublesome. Chicleros climb trees with just a rope and axe to collect the sap, which is then boiled into bricks at forest camps. Life in these camps is hard, with a basic maize diet and local alcohol.

Despite the harsh conditions, chicleros worry about their jobs. The U.S. once imported 7,000 tonnes of chicle annually from Central America, but last year only 200 tonnes were collected in Mexico's Yucatan peninsula. As gum sales have increased, manufacturers have turned to synthetic materials to cut costs and meet demand.

Gum producers are also finding creative ways to market their products. Gum is said to help with relaxation, energy, and tension relief. It was even given to soldiers during both world wars. One of gum's biggest benefits is reducing tooth decay by increasing saliva flow, which neutralizes plaque acid and provides minerals like calcium and fluoride. Research continues on new textures and flavors, with glycerine and vegetable oils used in the gum base. While most new flavors are artificial, some still require natural ingredients. Additionally, 137 square kilometers of the U.S. are dedicated to growing mint for the two most popular gum flavors."

Ghanerao Hotel is located at the edge of the Aravalli Hills in a small village known for its craftsmen. It combines the calm of an English country house with Indian cultural elements. The Ghanerao family has lived here for 400 years, and now Sajjan Singh and his wife welcome guests. The facilities are simple, with hot water provided in buckets, but this simplicity adds to the hotel's charm.

**B. NEW ZEALAND - HERMITAGE HOTEL, MOUNT COOK**  
The Hermitage Hotel on New Zealand's South Island is one of my favorites. I discovered it by accident while climbing. After a long descent from a glacier, I was surprised to find this hotel in such a beautiful, wild, and high-altitude location. It was amazing to arrive tired and find luxury, with someone playing Cole Porter on the piano.

**C. MAURITIUS - BEACHCOMBER PARADIS HOTEL**  
Located on a peninsula in the southwest of Mauritius, the Paradis Hotel is in a quiet area. The road to the hotel winds along the coast past empty beaches. The hotel is large and offers free watersports, but you can find solitude on its nine kilometers of private beach. In the evening, when everyone leaves, you can sit on the beach and feel far away from everything.

**D. ST LUCIA - LADERA HOTEL**  
The Ladera Hotel in St Lucia is set in a dramatic location. It is quiet and remote, standing 1,000 feet above sea level. The open rooms offer views between the Pitons peaks to the Caribbean Sea. The hotel has a colonial style with mahogany and greenheart wood furniture and four-poster beds with muslin netting.

**E. TURKEY - THE SPLENDID HOTEL, ISTANBUL**  
Located on Buyukada in the Princes Islands, this hotel is a great escape from Istanbul's noise. The islands are an hour away by boat and have no cars, only horse-drawn carriages and beautiful 1920s wooden architecture. The Splendid Hotel is a landmark, painted white with red domes, resembling a hotel from the French Riviera. Though a bit worn, it retains its charm.

**F. FRANCE - CHATEAU D'ETOGES, EPERNAY**  
In the small village of Etoges, in the Champagne region, is a beautiful 17th-century chateau. Surrounded by a moat with swans, the chateau was a family home until recently. It has 20 unique rooms, some with four-poster beds, and one with a billiard table. There are special weekend rates that include breakfast, dinner, and complimentary champagne.

**G. KENYA - THE FAIRVIEW HOTEL, NAIROBI**  
The Fairview Hotel in Nairobi is a comfortable place that avoids flashy luxury. It's a popular stop for travelers between safaris. Some guests decide to stay longer after seeing the gardens, rooms, and dining options. The hotel is on Nairobi Hill, away from the city's busy center. It's a great spot to watch the African sunset with a drink and enjoy a hearty dinner.

**H. ITALY - HOTEL SPLENDIDO, PORTOFINO**  
The Duke of Windsor was the first to sign the guest book at Hotel Splendido. Since then, many famous people have visited, including Lauren Bacall, Humphrey Bogart, Liz Taylor, and Richard Burton. Today, you might meet a billionaire or heiress. This former monastery-turned-hotel is still splendid, offering simple yet delicious food and luxurious decor."
CAE_47,"Text: 'The Hotel Inspector Sue Brown evaluates hotels for her job. Christopher Middleton observed her work. Just one minute into the annual inspection, the Globe Hotel is already making mistakes, though they don't realize it yet. The receptionist is busy quoting room rates over the phone and hasn't noticed the real guest she's ignoring—Sue Brown. 'Hasn't even acknowledged us,' Sue whispers. 'Very poor.' This is a common mistake during arrivals, one Sue has seen many times in her 11 years as an inspector. 'But this isn't just any three-star hotel,' she says. 'It has three red stars, so I expect better.' Having red stars means the Globe is among the top 130 of the 4,000 hotels listed in the guide by the organization she works for. Even before the cold welcome, there were issues. The entrance from the car park was through an unmanned door with a buzzer, leading to a long, empty corridor to the hotel entrance. 'Not what I expected,' Sue comments. Could it get worse? Yes. 'We have no record of your booking,' the receptionist says in a cheerful voice. Surprisingly, 12 of the hotel's 15 rooms are empty that night. One room on the top floor doesn't impress Sue: it's stuffy, and there's a large hole in the wall behind a wardrobe panel. Early in her career, Sue was known for being tough. 'They called me The Woman in Black,' she remembers, 'which was funny because I never wore black. And I was never too tough.' The next morning, after paying her bill, she reveals her identity to the Globe's general manager, Robin Greaves. He looks terrified. Before she says more, he apologizes for the bad smell in the main lounge. 'We think there's a blocked drain,' he says. 'We might have to take up the whole floor.' Sue suggests fixing the plumbing and not taking guests into that room. 'Better to guide them to the other lounge,' she advises. Greaves nods and takes notes. He's been at the Globe for only five months and struggles to believe Sue when she says her feedback will help the hotel in the long run. Not everything is negative. She praises Emma, the assistant manager, and Trudy, the young waitress, who shared notes about the building's 400-year history. Dinner was good enough to keep the hotel's two-rosette food rating, which encourages Greaves to ask, 'What do we need to get three rosettes?' Sue suggests, 'Don't serve a dessert that collapses.' The hope in Greaves' eyes fades. Sue's difficult job is to voice complaints that other guests are too afraid to mention. 'Sometimes it's a delicate situation. Once, a woman complained I got her son fired. All I could say was he served me apple pie with his fingers.' She often receives letters with false accusations, from having a superior attitude to asking for bribes. 'You get used to it, but it still hurts,' she says. Sue must not only tell the hotelier her findings but also send a full written report. They pay for her advice, as there's an annual fee to be in the guide. Being recognized with red stars makes it worthwhile. Greaves is relieved to hear Sue won't recommend removing the Globe's red stars. That's the good news. The bad news is another inspector will return in the next two months to check if everything is fixed. 'Good,' Greaves says, not very convincingly. 'We'll look forward to that.''"
CAE_48,"**Seven Up: Conquering the Seven Summits**

Mountaineer Doug Scott shares his experiences of climbing the highest peak on each continent, known as the Seven Summits. Here is a summary of his journey:

**A. Mt. Everest, Asia (8,848m)**
While in a snow cave near the summit, Doug and his partner Dougal Haston experienced strange conversations, likely due to lack of oxygen. Despite the cold affecting his feet, Doug felt confident with Dougal and managed to reach the summit by finding a better climbing rhythm.

**B. Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)**
Known as one of the most dangerous mountains, Doug and Dougal climbed it in April 1976. They carried all their equipment and food on their backs, a first for a new route on this mountain. The low air pressure made it feel like they were at a higher altitude. After a challenging climb, they reached the summit.

**C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,895m)**
In September 1976, Doug and Paul Braithwaite intended to climb Mt. Kenya but ended up on Kilimanjaro. They got lost in the jungle, but eventually found a trail leading to water. After a failed attempt on a difficult route, they chose a safer path to the summit.

**D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)**
In January 1992, Doug and his wife Sharu joined a group climbing via the Polish Glacier. Due to time constraints, they opted for the standard route instead. Despite strong winds, they reached the summit. This climb inspired Doug to consider completing all Seven Summits.

**E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)**
In November 1992, Doug's team traveled to Antarctica. Despite harsh weather, they reached the summit in eight hours. The experience was uplifting, even though visibility was poor due to a storm.

**F. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)**
In the summer of 1994, Doug's team climbed Elbrus. After acclimatizing, they used a cableway to reach 3,900m and then walked to a refuge. They faced strong winds and icy slopes but eventually reached the summit, only to find another ridge to climb. They returned safely the next day.

**G. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)**
Doug's team aimed to establish a new route and interact with the local Dani people. Despite warnings of danger, they proceeded with their climb. On May 12, they reached the summit, marking Doug's completion of the Seven Summits.

Doug Scott's journey across these peaks was filled with challenges and triumphs, culminating in the achievement of climbing the Seven Summits."
FCE_15,"**Style Merchants**

Style influences many aspects of our lives, from clothing to home decor and accessories. Jo Foley shares the latest fashion trends for this year.

**Ned Ingham: Dress Designer**

Ned Ingham creates beautiful, romantic wedding dresses. He suggests avoiding traditional, stiff dresses and the 'frilly' look, opting for simpler styles instead. Ingham has been designing wedding dresses since he was a schoolboy. At 16, he went to fashion school to learn how to cut and make clothes. Besides wedding dresses, he designs long, classic evening dresses with modern colors and fabrics. For those who prefer classic styles, he offers a navy-blue summer suit, a staple in English women's wardrobes throughout the 20th century, but with a fresh twist.

**Sally Quail: Jeweller**

Sally Quail, who once worked for an art dealer, has no formal jewelry training. She started designing jewelry when she couldn't find an engagement ring she liked. This led her to become a designer in 1990. Her pieces are popular among celebrities. Her style features large semi-precious stones set in gold, inspired by 18th-century jewelry. Recently, she started using diamonds, reflecting her personal taste as she reached 36. She says, ""Every woman reaches a point where she wants a diamond.""

**Lily Grimson: Handbag Designer**

Lily Grimson entered the competitive fashion industry four years ago with only a basic art and design course. Two of her handbags have been chosen for a major design exhibition. Her bags, whether made from fine calfskin or heavy silk, are always noticed. They combine elegance and craftsmanship, making them special.

**Peter Little: Hairdresser**

For over 20 years, Peter Little has styled the hair of many famous people. He believes most women want natural-looking hair that they can manage at home. His unique approach ensures clients don't look like they just left a salon. However, his services are expensive, costing £250 for the first appointment, with a three-month waiting list. He has also launched his own line of hairdryers and styling tools, allowing people to create their own styles at home.

**Penny Pratt: Florist**

Penny Pratt runs a small shop and works as a flower consultant for a supermarket chain and top restaurants. She left her teaching job 10 years ago to pursue something different, despite having no formal training in floristry. Her simple yet modern flower arrangements have won many design awards, helping her establish her own London Flower School. She has also given successful lectures in Japan and the USA. She advises keeping flower arrangements simple and strong, with minimal leaves. For wedding bouquets, she emphasizes using flowers of the same species."
FCE_19,"Text: 'Luxury and Modern Technology at the Merrion Hotel The Merrion Hotel, a new five-star hotel in Dublin, has opened after nearly two years of work. It was created by converting four large eighteenth-century houses. This allowed the hotel to include the latest technology for both staff and guests. The General Manager, Peter MacCann, wants his staff to know guests by name. For other details, like guest preferences, he uses the hotel's computer system. This system, which cost £250,000, helps treat returning guests in a special way, as expected in a five-star hotel. MacCann believes it will be worth the investment over time. He is very positive about its efficiency and features. For example, if a guest requests certain music CDs during their first stay, those CDs will be ready for them on their next visit. This is possible because of the guest-history feature, where staff can record many preferences. Room temperature is a common complaint among hotel guests. The Merrion has a high-tech system to control this. Guests can adjust the temperature within three degrees of the normal 18°C. Additionally, the front desk can set each room's temperature between 14°C and 25°C. Business travelers, who MacCann expects will make up 65% of the hotel's business, will appreciate the technology in the rooms. Each room has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that also works as a photocopier and printer, and a video-conferencing facility. The hotel has prepared for future technology changes by installing extra cables. TVs are rented, not bought, so they can be updated easily. DVD recorders can also be upgraded when needed. Despite all this technology, MacCann ensures that rooms are comfortable and welcoming. The hotel has 145 large, well-furnished bedrooms, a swimming pool, gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a beautiful garden. The food at the hotel must be excellent, as expected in luxury hotels. Chef Patrick Guilbaud, whose Dublin restaurant already had two Michelin stars, moved his restaurant to the Merrion. This move benefits both him and the hotel. He got to design a modern kitchen and enjoys better parking facilities. The hotel gains a popular restaurant without financial risks. With advanced technology and skilled staff, the Merrion is set to succeed.'"
FCE_24,"Susan Shepherd is an artist famous for her flower paintings. Her house is surrounded by a large garden, which provides many of her painting subjects. The garden is filled with her favorite flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some plants grow wildly and spread throughout the garden. The garden has a beautiful mix of colors, shapes, and structures, especially along the two long flower borders next to the path that goes from east to west. This beauty is partly thanks to the previous owners, who loved gardening and left behind plants that Susan liked. She also kept their gardener, Danny. Susan says, ""It was really his garden."" They got along well, and although Danny initially doubted some of her ideas, he understood her vision when she explained she wanted to paint them.

Susan prefers to paint detailed studies of individual plants rather than the whole garden. Sometimes she paints groups of plants in their natural setting, but usually, she picks them and takes them to her studio. She explains, ""I don't set everything up at once. I paint one flower, which might take a few days, then add another one, building the painting gradually. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish."" Her busiest time is spring and early summer when tulips and poppies bloom. She finds the process of flowers decaying fascinating. For example, tulips change shape and open up when left in water, becoming more interesting over time.

Susan has always been interested in plants. She studied botany in school and collected wildflowers from the countryside. She wasn't interested in gardening back then and didn't like garden flowers, thinking they looked artificial. She admired how wildflowers could grow in difficult places like rock cracks or cliff tops. Today, her garden includes plants from distant countries, but they thrive as if they belong there. Susan has a relaxed approach to gardening, similar to an aunt who lets children play freely as long as they don't cause harm. With two upcoming exhibitions and plenty of subjects to paint, she finds it hard to spend time gardening. She now has an extra gardener but believes that to stay connected to her work, ""you have to get your hands dirty."""
FCE_13,"In March, strong storms hit the Brackham area, knocking down many trees. In the town, two large lime trees were lost from the old market square, changing the town center's look, which upset some of the more traditional residents. Normally, Chief Inspector Douglas Pelham, who leads the local police, would have been among those upset. However, during the storm, he was too sick to notice because he had a serious case of bronchitis for the first time in his life. When he first felt a headache and chest tightness, his wife, Molly, urged him to see a doctor. But Pelham, believing the police needed him, ignored her and kept working. This only made him forgetful and irritable. Finally, his colleague, Sergeant Lloyd, took him to the doctor. By then, he was too weak to argue. She quickly got him his antibiotics and took him home to his wife, who sent him straight to bed. On Thursday morning, when Molly told him the walnut tree in their garden had fallen, Pelham couldn't process it. That evening, he weakly asked if the house was damaged, was relieved to hear it wasn't, and went back to sleep. It wasn't until Saturday, when he felt better, that he noticed the walnut tree's absence had changed the living room's look. The Pelhams' large house, which they bought for its private, leafy garden, now felt different. The walnut tree had provided nice light patterns that hid the worn furniture they brought from their old house. Without the tree, the room was very bright, showing the shabby furniture. The view was also worse, as the tall, unattractive house next door was now visible, with its purple bricks and many windows seeming to watch them. ""Doesn't it look terrible?"" Pelham said to Molly. But she, standing in the doorway, seemed more happy than upset. ""I've been telling you since we moved here. We need a new sofa, no matter the cost,"" she replied."
FCE_16,"Living in the Valley

We had been living in our valley for sixteen months when we first realized the dangers in the surrounding hills that could threaten our survival. It was the year when storms came early, even before November ended. Until then, we felt safe in our valley, protected by the hills. Soon, snow began to fall, and within a day, it was about 15 centimeters deep. It almost blocked our lane and made the path by the stream slippery and dangerous. On the nearby hills, the snow was much deeper and lasted longer. Up there, the wind was very strong. In our valley, we only felt sudden gusts of wind; trees swayed, but the branches stayed firm. Yet, we knew we had a reason to worry. The snow and wind were inconvenient, but they didn't trouble us much. It was the river, the Ryburn, which usually flowed gently, that threatened us the most. It reminded us of what could have happened if the water from the hills had not been controlled by dams many years ago.

Soon, the snow started to melt. Day after day, we watched dark clouds gather over the hills to the west. These grey clouds spread over the valleys, twisting and turning, warning us of what was to come. We had seen enough of the sky; now we began to watch the river, which was becoming fuller and wilder every day. The snow was gradually washed away as more rain fell from the clouds, but high in the hills, the reservoir was filling and nearing danger level. Then it happened - for the first time in years, the reservoir overflowed. Up in the hills, it was like Niagara Falls, as water surged over the dam and poured into the stream below. The river seemed wild as the waters rushed down to its lower parts. Just a couple of meters from our cottage, the stream was wild beneath the bridge. It was deeper than we'd ever seen it near our home, fiercely hitting its banks. For three days, we hoped it would stay below its wall. Fortunately, our hopes were answered as the dam held, and the waters began to go down.

In the past, before the dam was built, the river often flooded nearby villages in such a rage. Now, the dam controls the river's flow, and usually, everything is fine; the large amount of water from the hills, from snow and heavy rain, stays behind the dam with only occasional overflows. Because of this protection, we can enjoy the large clouds over the valley and be amazed by the river's power. Thanks to this, we feel our home in the valley is still secure and safe."
FCE_21,"Mark Adams, a film critic, reflects on his last ten years working for a newspaper called The Front Page. Writing about films for this newspaper was his first serious job. Before that, he had done some reviews for novels, films, and radio. He met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page, through radio and television work. Tom hired him, but he wasn't mainly a journalist, or he might have been more selective with his team. Initially, Tom wanted a group of critics to cover arts like books, TV, theatre, film, and radio, which didn't need specialized knowledge. They planned to have weekly lunches to choose what to review, with guests to keep things social. It felt like a dream to Mark, being part of a new newspaper in a crowded market. He even doubted it was real, thinking maybe a millionaire was just pretending to employ him. The first time he saw someone reading his review on the London Underground, he felt awkward.

Tom's idea for a team of critics didn't work out. It was a good plan, but they ended up working over the phone. The public preferred critics to focus on one area, so Mark chose film. Thanks to Tom's initial push, Mark now writes a detailed weekly piece on one film, which suits him well. He wouldn't have liked the usual film critic's job of reviewing every film, as it would quickly bore him. He enjoys having the space to expand his arguments or create something interesting even in a dull week.

Mark wonders about his role as a critic. He thinks people choose films based on stars, publicity, or directors, and rarely change their minds because of a review. For example, someone who dislikes westerns probably won't watch one just because of a review, and a fan of romantic films won't skip one because of a bad review. So, if reviews aren't really guides for consumers, what are they? Mark believes his job is to present an argument, not to be 'right' about a movie. He doesn't think there should be a set number of 'great' or 'bad' films each year. He sees himself as someone who shares his perspective, not as a judge."
FCE_46,"Why would a schoolgirl want to swim 1500m, cycle 40km, and then run 10km? Because she thinks it's fun. A teenager with a passion for endurance sports is looking for a training partner. Ideally, this person should be female and interested in becoming an Olympic champion. They should love distance running (regular 15km sessions), distance swimming (enjoy training in cold rivers), and distance cycling (enjoy 100km rides). They must be able to do all three activities without resting.

The triathlon is becoming one of the most popular Olympic sports. It attracts large crowds who are both fascinated and shocked by athletes swimming 1500m, cycling 40km, and running 10km without stopping. But what drives these athletes to push their bodies so hard? And why would a talented 17-year-old with excellent grades choose this challenging sport?

Melanie Sears hasn't yet learned the usual phrases about personal satisfaction and mental challenges that athletes often use. She says, ""You swim 1500m, then jump on your bike while still wet, which makes you cold. After cycling 40km, you have to run 10km, which feels long when you're tired. But it's great fun and worth it in the end.""

Melanie entered her first triathlon at 14 and won the junior section, although she was the only junior competing. Feeling confident, she entered the National Championships. Despite having the second-fastest swim and the fastest run, she didn't place well. She got lost during the cycling part and ended up riding 20km too far, crying through the run. But she didn't give up and is determined to keep going. ""Sometimes I wish I could stop to end the pain, but I'm afraid if I stop once, I'll be tempted to do it again.""

Her determination impresses Steve Trew, the sport's director of coaching. ""I tested her fitness, and she worked so hard on the running machine that it threw her off into a wall. She gave it everything, but unlike most people who stop when they can't go further, she kept going.""

Melanie was the top junior at this year's European Triathlon Championships, finishing 13th. ""I was almost as good as the top three in swimming and running, but slower at cycling. That's why I'm working hard on it."" She is trying to convince her parents, who are paying £1,300 for her trip to New Zealand for the World Championships, to buy her a £2,000 bike. This would help her compete in national 25 km and 100 km races later this year.

However, her intense training has made her a bit of a loner. ""I don't have a social life,"" she says. ""I'm not a party person. After two hours of hard swimming on Friday nights, I just want to sleep. But I keep in touch with the other girls on the team by phone and letters."" What do they talk about? Boys? Clothes? ""No, we talk about our race times.""

Where will all this focus lead? Melanie has tried other events, like the triathlon 'sprint', which involves swimming 750m, cycling 20km, and running 5km. She wants to try even tougher events than the triathlon. ""The big problem is, I have no one my age to train with,"" she says. It's surprising, isn't it?"
FCE_70,"Text: 'The Collectors Amanda Roy talks about her love for collecting and why many people share this hobby. Collecting is a popular activity, with one in three adults participating. It's a world full of passion and excitement. But remember, only collect things you truly love. People have been collecting since ancient times. Early humans collected pebbles for their beauty and wore them as necklaces. Today, children still collect stones and seashells for their shapes and colors. I've been a collector all my life, from flowers like tulips to pottery and paintings. My first collection was stones from my parents' garden. At six, I went to a school in a remote, windy part of England. My parents took me to a local museum filled with historical collections, which fascinated me. Many adults share this interest in collecting. Some people collect because it gives them a sense of control in their lives. For me, it's simply enjoyable. A famous collector was the Duc de Berry in France, who had a 'room of wonders' with items like coconut shell cups and Oriental china. Catherine the Great of Russia collected over 4,000 paintings. You don't need to be wealthy to collect. I've collected tulip bulbs and china cups with great determination. I once convinced another tulip collector to give me a bulb, only for it to be stolen later. I also collected 350 American rag dolls, searching across the USA for different designs. Unfortunately, this collection was lost in a house fire. Seeing the remains of my collection was heartbreaking. I'm fascinated by how collections change hands. A silver spoon once owned by a king or poet gains value in the market. As small items become popular, their prices rise. Toys from the 1950s are now valuable investments, especially if you kept the original boxes. (I, unfortunately, threw mine away along with the toys.)'"
FCE_3,"**My Line of Work: Four People Talk About Their Jobs**

**Lisa - Exhibition Programmes Organiser, Science Museum**

I organize temporary exhibitions. This means I plan and design the exhibition and promote it. I need to learn about the exhibition topic first and then talk to experts to decide on the main themes and goals. I plan what objects and pictures to show. It's important that visitors understand the exhibition, so I plan interactive displays, workshops, and theatre. I also work with engineers and electricians to ensure the exhibition is safe. Before it opens, I help create brochures and leaflets to advertise it.

**Janet - Teacher of London Taxi Drivers**

I start my day at 7.30 a.m. by checking the accounts. Then, I see what new maps and documents are needed for learning the routes for the London taxi-driver test. By midday, about 50 students are here, figuring out the best routes using the correct streets and turns. I help when there's a disagreement, like if a right turn is possible at a junction. When students are close to the test, I challenge them by asking them to find different routes, even if the first one they choose is correct. This helps them think critically.

**Sarah - Marine Conservationist**

I live by the coast and work from home. My job includes answering phone calls, creating educational materials, and setting up training courses. Sometimes, I go to our main office, but mostly I am by the coast. I work with schools and study centers and run courses for coastal managers and decision-makers about the sea. I take them out on a boat to help them understand marine life better. This often changes their perspective compared to just looking at a computer screen. I love my job because conservation is my passion, but working for a charity means we always need more money, so I can't do everything I want.

**Chris - Map and Atlas Publisher**

My job is quite varied. I ensure our publishing program meets market needs and manage the stock of about 300 books we publish. We maintain high standards for information and content. We get many letters from readers about issues like international boundaries, which need careful replies. I discuss future projects and current sales with co-publishers. I work with an enthusiastic team, which makes the job enjoyable. The downside is there is too much administration, leaving less time for interesting tasks like product development and design."
FCE_10,"We always went to Ireland in June. Since we started going on holidays together, the four of us spent the first two weeks of June at Glencorn Lodge in County Antrim. It's a big house by the sea, near the village of Ardbeag. The English couple who bought the house, the Malseeds, have expanded it, but they did it very carefully. Strafe found Glencorn for us. He saw an advertisement when the Malseeds still needed to advertise. ""How about this?"" he said one evening and read the details. The summer before, we had gone to a hotel recommended by friends, but it wasn't good because the food was terrible. The four of us have been playing cards together for a long time: Dekko, Strafe, Cynthia, and me. They call me Milly, though my real name is Dorothy Milson. Dekko got his nickname at school because Dekko Deacon sounds nice. He and Strafe went to school together, which is why we call Strafe by his last name, like the teachers did. We're all about the same age and live near the town where the Malseeds lived before moving from England to Ireland. We always think it's quite a coincidence. ""How very nice,"" Mrs. Malseed said, smiling to welcome us again this year. She seems to know when guests are about to arrive because she's usually waiting in the large hall that always smells of flowers. ""Arthur, take the luggage up,"" she told the old porter. ""Rose, Tulip, Lily, and Geranium."" These are the names of the rooms reserved for us. Mrs. Malseed painted flowers on the doors instead of using numbers. In winter, when not many people come to Glencorn Lodge, she takes care of details like that, while her husband handles redecoration and repairs. ""Well, well, well,"" Mr. Malseed said, entering the hall from the kitchen. ""A hundred thousand welcomes,"" he greeted us in the Irish way. He smiled with his dark brown eyes twinkling, making us feel special. Everyone smiled, and I felt the others thinking our holiday had truly begun. Nothing had changed at Glencorn; everything was good. Kitty from the dining room came out to greet us. ""You look younger every year, all four of you,"" she said, making everyone laugh. Arthur led us to the rooms, carrying as much luggage as he could and returning for the rest. After dinner, we played cards for a while but not too long because we were tired from the journey. In the lounge, there was a man alone and a French couple. There were other people at dinner, of course, because in June Glencorn Lodge is always full. From where we sat by the window, we could see some people walking on the lawns and others taking the cliff path to the seashore. In the morning, we'd do the same: walk along the sands to Ardbeag and have coffee at the hotel there, returning in time for lunch. In the afternoon, we'd drive somewhere. I knew this because over the years, this routine had developed. Since we first came here, we all fell in love with the beautiful landscape."
FCE_67,"Text: 'Keeping the holiday-makers happy A chalet girl's work is never done, Sarah Sutherland-Pilch tells Veronica Lee - in between making beds and delicious dinners. This is the second year as a chalet girl for Sarah Sutherland-Pilch, a 24-year-old from West Sussex. Known by her nickname, Pilch, Sarah works for a company in Val d'Isere, France, cooking and cleaning for visitors who come to ski and stay in the wooden houses, known as chalets, that are characteristic of the area. Sarah graduated in French and History of Art from Oxford Brookes University last summer. Being a chalet girl isn't a career, she says, but an enjoyable way to spend a year or two before settling down. 'It's a good way to make contacts. I meet successful people every week.' Sarah does not 'live in'. She gets up at 7a.m. to walk the mile or so to the chalet, which sleeps up to 18 guests each week. She has her own breakfast before preparing that of the guests. 'They get the works - porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit and croissants.' When the last of the guests has had breakfast, by about 9.30 a.m., Sarah clears up and either makes the afternoon tea, which is left for the guests to help themselves, or cleans the rooms - 'the worst part of the job,' she says. By about 11 a.m. she is ready to go on the slopes herself. She skis as much as possible. 'On a good day we can be up there until 4.30 p.m.' Sarah returns to the chalet in time to prepare dinner and takes a shower before doing so, but does not sleep. 'It's fatal if you do,' she says. Dinner, a three-course affair, is served at 8 p.m. and coffee is usually on the table by 10 p.m. Sarah clears away the dinner things and fills the dishwasher. 'There's nothing worse than coming in to a messy kitchen the next morning.' Sometimes she will stay and chat with the guests, other times they are content to be left alone. 'Good guests can make a week brilliant - breakfast this morning was great fun - but some weeks, for whatever reason, don't go quite so well.' Sarah meets her friends in the chalet where she lives - and they go out at about 11 p.m. 'We usually start off in Bananas, might go to G Jay's and perhaps Dick's T-Bar at the end of the evening,' she says. But Sarah never stays out too late on Saturday night as Sunday is her busiest time of the week. 'A frightful day,' she says, 'when you certainly don't want to be cooking breakfast with a terrible headache.' Work begins earlier than usual on Sunday, since breakfast for guests who are leaving has to be on the table by 7 a.m. As soon as the guests are gone, Sarah starts cleaning madly. 'We just blitz the place - clear the breakfast, strip the beds, get everything ready.' If she hasn't already done the week's shop on Saturday, Sarah does it now. At around 3 p.m., the cleaning work done, Sarah then prepares tea for the new guests. 'They get here at around 4.30 p.m.' Sometimes they are disorientated and full of questions. I'm sure it's the mountain air that does something to them.' Between tea and dinner, Sarah takes any guests needing boots or skis down to the ski shop and then gets a lift back to the chalet from one of the ski shop staff. It is soon time for dinner duty again and perhaps a drink later, but not always. 'Sometimes I'm so tired I just have an early night,' she says. '"
FCE_27,"Miss Rita Cohen, a small, pale-skinned girl who looked much younger than Seymour's daughter, Marie, but said she was about six years older, visited his factory one day. She wore overalls and big, unattractive shoes, and her pretty face was surrounded by a bush of wiry hair. She was so small and young-looking that Seymour found it hard to believe she was studying at the University of Pennsylvania, researching the leather industry in New Jersey for her Master's degree. A few times a year, someone would contact Seymour to ask if they could visit his factory, and sometimes he would help a student by answering questions over the phone or, if they seemed very serious, by giving them a short tour. Rita Cohen seemed almost as small as the children from Marie's third-year class, who had visited the factory years ago to see how Marie's father made gloves. They especially liked the laying-off table, where the men shaped and pressed each glove by pulling it over steam-heated brass hands. These hands were very hot, shiny, and stood straight up from the table, looking thin and flat. As a child, Marie was fascinated by them and called them the 'pancake hands'. Rita asked, 'How many pieces come in a shipment?' Seymour replied, 'Between twenty and twenty-five thousand.' She kept taking notes and asked, 'Do they come directly to your shipping department?' He was pleased that she was interested in every detail. 'They go to the tannery first. The tannery is a contractor. We buy the material, and they prepare it for us. My grandfather and father worked in the tannery here in town. I did too, for six months, when I started in the business. Have you ever been inside a tannery?' 'Not yet.' 'Well, you should visit one if you're going to write about leather. I can arrange that for you. They're old-fashioned places. Technology has improved things, but what you'll see isn't much different from hundreds of years ago. It's tough work. Tanning is said to be the oldest industry, with remains found from six thousand years ago in Turkey, I think. The first clothes were just skins tanned by smoking them. I told you it's an interesting subject once you get into it. My father is the leather expert; you should talk to him. He can talk about gloves for days. That's common: people in the glove trade love it. Have you ever seen anything being made, Miss Cohen?' 'I can't say I have.' 'Never seen anything made?' 'I saw my mother bake a cake when I was a child.' He laughed. She made him laugh. She was innocent but eager to learn. His daughter was at least 30 cm taller than Rita Cohen, fair where Rita was dark, but otherwise, Rita reminded him of Marie. The intelligent curiosity that filled the house when Marie came home from school, full of what she'd learned. How she remembered everything, neatly written in her notebook and memorized overnight.

Raquel Graham Raquel Graham calls from a taxi on her way to the airport. She can't meet me tomorrow because her boss needs her in Los Angeles. As a personal assistant to a pop star, she often has to travel at a moment's notice. Raquel loves her job and gets along well with her boss. However, she has one small issue - she hates flying. 'On a nine-hour flight to California, I usually take sleeping pills to calm down,' she says. Her worst flight was on Concorde. 'It felt so cramped with those tiny windows.' When she's not traveling, she works in offices in Manchester and London. Her tasks include organizing the diary, attending meetings with lawyers and accountants, planning schedules, and making more travel arrangements. She didn't apply for this job. She met a pop group's manager by chance, which led to a job offer. She also took secretarial classes in the evenings. Five years later, she was in the right place when her boss needed a PA. B. David Brown David Brown has worked as an accountant and a golf caddy, someone who carries a golfer's bags. He preferred being a caddy because he loves golf. But there are downsides. Caddies get a small flat fee plus a percentage of the winnings. They usually earn between £25,000 and £35,000, but much of that goes on travel and hotels. He started caddying for golfer Greg Norman at age 31. 'It's not just carrying bags. You give advice, use your knowledge of the weather, and try to understand the course.' His accounting skills were noticed by European Tour Productions, who made him a statistical data administrator. He collects and analyzes statistics from the caddies' scorecards. TV commentators, golf magazines, and golfers all want these results. C. Martin Fern Martin Fern edits the 'Food and Drink' section of a daily newspaper. One of his easier tasks is trying food at top restaurants. What does he think about expensive restaurants? 'If people can afford it, it's their choice,' he says. 'I'd rather spend £120 on a memorable meal than buy a microwave.' His cooking skills led to a food column offer from a friend who edited a Saturday Review. At the time, Martin was a creative director at an advertising agency, and the column was a good extra income. He was 42 when another newspaper offered him a full-time job. 'It meant a 50% pay cut,' he says. 'But it was a chance to turn my passion into a career.' He still cooks at home and tries to stay fit by cycling a few miles to the nearest tube station. D. Dick Prince 'I started writing children's stories about 20 years ago,' says Dick Prince, a popular children's author in Britain. 'Before that, I loved words and mostly wrote poetry. Then I had an idea for a story. I used to be a farmer and knew about the problem of foxes killing chickens. So I wrote a story called The Fox Busters, which was my first published children's book.' Where does he get his ideas? 'It's not easy, I have to work at them,' he says. 'I usually do this in the mornings. I'm not an early riser. After lunch, I spend a couple of hours typing out my morning notes - all with one finger on an old typewriter, not a laptop. I get 50 to 100 letters a week, and I enjoy that part of being a writer. I try to answer them all, but now I have some secretarial help.'"
FCE_66,"In the lumberyard by the lake, where trees were turned into boards for building, there was an old two-story brick building. Around it were big piles of soft sawdust, like golden mountains, reaching down to the blue lake. One afternoon, bored with nothing to do, Michael and his friends climbed a ladder to the roof of the building. They sat with their legs hanging over the edge, looking at the lake. Suddenly, Michael said, ""I dare you to jump down,"" and without thinking, he jumped off the roof into the sawdust, laughing. ""I dare you all!"" he shouted. ""You're all cowards,"" he teased, trying to get them to jump too. They hesitated, looking pale, but one by one, they jumped and laughed with relief. In the hot sun, they lay on the sawdust, telling jokes. Eventually, one of them said, ""Let's go back up and jump again."" They weren't very excited, but they climbed back up and jumped off again, determined, until only Michael was left on the roof. The others were below, calling, ""Come on, Mike. What's wrong?"" Michael wanted to join them but stayed on the edge, nervous and unsure why it seemed scarier this time. They thought he was joking, but then they saw him clenching his fists, trying to count to ten and jump. When that didn't work, he tried taking a deep breath and closing his eyes. The others got tired of waiting and started laughing at him. ""Come on, you're a coward. Do you think we'll wait all night?"" they shouted. When he didn't move, they began to leave, still shouting. ""Who started this? What's wrong with you?"" he called. But he stayed on the roof, staring at the ground, feeling unhappy. He was alone for nearly an hour as the sun set, a big orange ball in the sky. His clothes were wet from sweating nervously. Finally, he closed his eyes, slipped off the roof, and fell heavily onto the sawdust, lying there for a long time. The yard was quiet; the workers had gone home. As he lay there, he wondered why he couldn't jump earlier. Then he got up slowly and walked home, feeling ashamed and wanting to avoid everyone. He was so late for dinner that his stepmother said coldly, ""You're old enough to get home on time. If you can't, you should stay in tonight."" She was a strong woman with fair skin, a bit of grey in her hair, and a patient smile. She spoke with controlled sternness, but Michael, feeling gloomy and miserable, barely heard her. He was still thinking about his friends' grinning faces and their laughter."
FCE_44,"Text: 'Careers Advice Are you unhappy with your current job but unsure how to make a change? Kitty Doherty offers some helpful advice. Many people looking to change careers are turning to careers advisers for guidance. You'll need to write a brief history of yourself and take several tests called 'psychometrics'. These tests help identify your strengths and suggest possible career paths, along with any retraining you might need. I decided to try Career Analysts, a large career advice organization. Taking the careers test felt like being back in school exams. I was in a group of about ten people, answering questions quickly. It was important to remember that it wasn't about passing or failing. The psychometrics involved tasks like finding mistakes in lists of names and numbers and matching similar shapes. After the tests, I had a long conversation with an adviser. Based on this chat and the test results, the adviser wrote a report with observations and recommendations. I agreed with most of the conclusions, although I was a bit disappointed to learn I didn't do well in scientific, technical, and practical tests. It's probably a good thing I didn't become a nurse. However, it was reassuring to hear that I made the right choice in pursuing journalism. Changing your career doesn't always mean a big shift. Last March, after working as a marketing manager for a large insurance company for five years, 25-year-old Donna Laney lost her job. Her friends suggested she visit Career Analysts. 'Losing my job was a chance to step back and review my career,' says Donna. Some results surprised her. 'I didn't realize I had a talent for design. But I had to consider the cost of retraining in design against my financial responsibilities,' she says. Other suggestions included taking a year off to work in the Far East. 'I decided to use my existing skills and move into a field better suited to me than insurance. I'm now a Public Relations officer. I might have reached this point without Career Analysts, but they helped me see clearly what I wanted to do. I've recommended them to several friends, who are all happy with the service.' Some people feel they wouldn't have made such progress without help. A visit to Career Counselling Services led 26-year-old Juliet Greene to make life-changing decisions. 'After working for a major bank for six years, I found my job boring and needed a new challenge. I didn't know what I wanted, so I went to Career Counselling Services with an open mind. The tests showed I was interested in sciences,' she says. 'I had four sessions with an adviser. The third session was recorded, which was helpful because you forget many things you say. After the fourth meeting, I decided to study geology and plan to start a degree course later this year. The advice from Career Counselling Services was worth the fee. I'm much happier and more positive now.' However, careers advice doesn't work for everyone. Amanda Margetts, a 24-year-old sales representative, says: 'I was at a point in my career where I didn't know what to do next. I thought a careers adviser might suggest something new. Although I got many new ideas, I rejected them because they required a big salary cut or a lot of retraining. I didn't learn anything new about myself,' she says. 'You have to give the adviser a lot of personal information, and I felt that if I had told a friend the same things, they would have given me similar advice.'"
FCE_22,"Text: 'Fun at the Dentist's? When you enter W. Lloyd Jerome's dental office in Glasgow, you'll notice bright modern paintings on the walls and a stylish blue couch where patients sit during their check-ups. Jerome explains, 'Half of the people only visit the dentist when they're in pain instead of going for regular check-ups. They're scared.' To change this, he has created a space where people feel comfortable. That's why I decided not to wear a white coat. I think people link it with pain. My belief is that dental treatment should happen in a relaxed, interesting, and enjoyable setting.' This is surprising for many of us who think of dental visits as painful or at least formal and clinical. Jerome says, 'If people are relaxed, entertained, and treated well, they will forget their past negative experiences.' One of his new relaxation methods is virtual-reality headsets. 'We were the first in Britain to use them, and they're very popular. During the first check-up, the patient sits on the blue couch and watches a film about underwater wildlife while I examine their teeth. Then the headset shows a camera view, giving the patient a tour of their mouth.' Surprisingly, most patients enjoy this part of their visit. Another important aspect is that the office smells more like a perfume shop than a dentist's. Today, it smells like orange. Jerome says, 'When people come in, I want them to feel with all their senses that it's not like a typical dentist's visit. Smell is crucial. The usual dental smell can make people anxious if they're afraid of dentists.' I found the gentle smell in the office very pleasant. Although known as Glasgow's most fashionable dentist, Jerome emphasizes that he takes his work seriously. Relaxation techniques are important, but the quality of treatment is the most important. For example, Jerome uses a special tool that sprays warm water to clean teeth instead of scraping them. It feels a bit unusual at first, but if people are relaxed, it's not painful. Five years ago, Jerome went to the United States to study dental techniques. 'I learned that making it easier for the patient makes it easier for yourself,' he says. He sees his patient-focused approach as the beginning of a gradual shift towards less formality in British dentistry. Just then, a patient arrives. Jerome quickly goes over, offers him a cup of tea (herbal or regular), asks what video he'd like to watch, and gently leads him to the chair. The patient seems to enjoy this five-star treatment, and it's no surprise. The office feels more like an elegant beauty salon than a typical dental practice.'"
FCE_39,"Title: The Rise of Chocolate

Chocolate, originally from South America, is now a huge global business. In the UK, people spend over £230 million on chocolate during Easter, which is about 8% of all chocolate sales. Only at Christmas do people consume more chocolate. Although large-scale chocolate production started in the 19th century, the cacao plant was first grown by the Aztec, Toltec, and Mayan civilizations in Central America over 3,000 years ago.

The cacao tree is a tropical evergreen plant found in Africa, South and Central America, the West Indies, and Southeast Asia. Its fruit is the size of a melon and contains 20-40 seeds. When dried, these seeds become cacao beans, which are used to make chocolate. In English-speaking countries, they are often called cocoa beans due to a spelling mistake from the 17th century.

The Aztecs used cocoa beans as money and to make a drink called xocoatl, meaning 'bitter water' in their language, Nahuatl. This drink was flavored with spices and used in ceremonies and to welcome guests. The Spanish preferred it with cinnamon and sugar, but it took another century for the recipe to spread across Europe. In the late 17th century, chocolate houses opened in European capitals where people gathered to drink chocolate.

Until the 19th century, chocolate drinks were made from solid blocks of chocolate melted in hot water. In 1826, CJ van Houten from the Netherlands invented chocolate powder by removing most of the cocoa butter from the beans. The modern chocolate bar began in 1847 when Fry and Sons, a company in Bristol, combined cocoa butter with chocolate liquor and sugar to make a solid block. A Swiss company later added milk solids, creating milk chocolate.

At the start of the 20th century, French companies dominated the British chocolate market. In 1879, the English company Cadbury named their factory Bournville, hoping to add some French charm. However, Cadbury's Dairy Milk bar, launched as Dairymaid in 1905, became popular due to clever advertising linking it to the healthy qualities of English milk. This helped it compete with French brands.

Currently, chocolate consumption in Britain is stable at about four bars per week. This has led manufacturers to find new ways to attract customers, such as turning chocolate bars into ice creams, soft drinks, or desserts. Meanwhile, cacao farmers are still affected by a drop in cocoa bean prices from the late 1980s. Many small-scale farmers went out of business. So, next time you enjoy a chocolate bar, think about the farmers who grow the cacao."
FCE_18,"**THE SHELL ARTIST**

Peter Cooke, at 83 years old, has become an expert in his craft. Although he is interested in trying new things like paper-making and feather-work, he is currently focused on creating delicate and unique objects from shells, a skill he has honed over the past decade. As he shows me around his apartment, he worries about being boring, but his enthusiasm and the beauty of his creations are captivating.

Cooke points out a pair of shell-covered ornaments above his fireplace. He mentions that he wouldn't mind if they don't sell because he has grown fond of them. Initially, he didn't plan to sell his work, but friends encouraged him to hold an exhibition. This led to a successful show in London, where 70% of his pieces were sold. His second exhibition just opened, featuring 86 pieces with prices starting at £225 for a shell-flower in a crystal vase. Some pieces, like the ornaments, are priced around £2,000.

Cooke is open about the high prices, explaining that his work is unique. The gallery owner told him that once he stops creating, his pieces will become even more sought after. Cooke wishes he had started this art form earlier in life, as he feels he could have created even more impressive works. Despite physical limitations now, his creations are far from the typical shell crafts found in seaside shops.

He describes himself as having a ""miniature mind,"" which has led to intricate boxes covered in tiny shells, shaded pictures, and realistic flower baskets. Cooke has developed his own techniques, using materials he finds, like cardboard from laundered shirts for flower bases and a special glue from a sail-maker. He washes the shells with washing-up liquid and says his creations seem to come together naturally, though the detail and symmetry suggest otherwise.

Cooke's search for beautiful, especially small, shells has taken him to beaches in France, Thailand, Mexico, South Africa, and the Philippines. He only collects dead shells and defends himself against accusations of harming the environment. He argues that many shells are crushed by people or broken by the sea, and he only collects those that are already empty. His work transforms these shells into something greater than their natural state, making his argument quite convincing."
FCE_62,"Text: 'The Schoolgirl Model When 15-year-old Kira Langer isn't traveling to amazing places and appearing on magazine covers, she's probably studying for her school exams. Jane Laidlaw learns more. 'Kira might be a bit late,' the agency receptionist told me. 'That's okay,' I replied, trying to ignore the negative stereotypes about models being difficult, vain, and unintelligent. Now she was late. How late? An hour? Three hours? Maybe she wouldn't come at all. What if she decided going to the hairdresser was more fun than meeting me? If she was late, she might be in a bad mood and not want to answer my questions. But when Kira, the winner of the Looks magazine supermodel competition, arrived, she was smiling, relaxed, and apologetic, and she came with her mother. Kira wore a simple black dress and trainers, not expensive designer clothes. She didn't seem selfish at all; she was just a friendly, tall, and pretty girl. All models under 16 must have an adult with them when they work, she explained. Her mother looked like a normal mom, proud of her successful daughter. Kira seemed a bit surprised by her new fame, which makes sense since it was unexpected. Her older sister suggested she enter the model competition. 'She saw the competition and said I should try it,' Kira recalls. 'I said no, but she sent some photos in anyway.' When she got the call saying she was a finalist, she was at school. Being chosen for the final gave Kira the confidence to go through with it, and she did great. She won easily, and the Select model agency in London offered her work right away. Kira now finds it challenging to balance her two lives. But her friends and teachers are used to having a star among them. 'They're really proud of me,' she says. However, some people at her school are unkind about her success. 'They say I think too highly of myself.' This must be tough for Kira, as she's not arrogant. She says, 'They think that because I'm a model now, I can't stay the same. But the only thing that's changed is I'm more confident - not in a bad way, but I can stand up for myself more.' As a busy model, her social life is affected. The Select agency can call anytime and tell her she has a job the next day. 'If my friends are going out, I can't say I'll come because I don't know what I'm doing the next day. I can't really make plans, and if I do, they sometimes get canceled, but my friends understand. They don't say, ""Oh, you're always off modeling now, you never have time for us"".' Kira has the looks, talent, and support for a great career ahead. Not many people can say that before finishing their school exams. As I finish the interview with this successful girl, I ask what she would like to do if she wasn't a model. She pauses and says, 'I'd like to do what you're doing.'"
FCE_49,"Father and son, Terence and Chris Madden, have traveled from Canada's cold north to Africa's heat in search of valuable metals. They believe their mine on a Welsh mountain might have up to 10,000 ounces of gold. After ten years of digging, they think they are close to finding a gold vein worth five million dollars. Terence, 68, from Liverpool, says they are finding high levels of gold and need to dig a few more meters to reach the concentrated area.

Their gold search began when Terence read about gold worth millions in the 'Dolgellau gold belt' near the Welsh town of Dolgellau. After studying 19th-century mining journals and newspapers at the Welsh National Library, they picked the best area to explore. They spent ten years getting permission from landowners, taking earth samples, and clearing old cars and rubbish. They dug out 150 tonnes of greenstone rock to make a tunnel and a 10-meter shaft. Now, they are running out of money and need to find someone to invest £50,000 to dig a bit deeper to reach the gold. Chris Madden says finding a backer is uncertain, but they have some contacts.

As news of their dig spread, the idea of finding gold excited both locals and gold diggers. Dolgellau depends on tourists, and residents are hopeful. Peter Woolven, manager of the Royal Ship Hotel, said it would attract more visitors if the Maddens are right, but he hopes it won't lead to many people damaging the hillside.

The Welsh gold industry has declined since the late 1880s when many people worked in numerous mines. One of the last mines, Clogau-St David's, which made wedding rings for the Queen and the Princess of Wales, closed recently. However, individual gold diggers are returning. George Hall, another prospector, plans to dig a tunnel on the other side of the ridge from the Maddens. Hall, 70, says searching for gold is emotional, adventurous, and exciting, with the hope of finding hidden treasure. He hopes to be lucky this time."
FCE_31,"**IN HOT WATER**

Rachel Mills is a scientist who loves exploring the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She works at Southampton University as a lecturer and researcher in marine geochemistry, studying chemical processes in the sea. When she's not teaching, she dives three kilometers down into the Atlantic Ocean in a small steel vehicle, about the size of a car, to study underwater volcanoes. Inside the vehicle, space is so tight that she can touch the two pilots. They are used to these cramped conditions, where they can't stand or move, and must stay inside until someone opens the door from outside. A dive lasts 16 hours: three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours collecting rock and water samples, and three hours to return to the surface. If there's an emergency, they can press a panic button to release a small escape vessel that quickly rises to the surface, like a ping-pong ball in water. However, no one has tested it yet, and Rachel thinks it wouldn't be a pleasant ride.

Rachel remembers her first time in the vehicle on a ship's deck with an instructor, who explained emergency procedures, including what to do if the pilot had a heart attack. They wanted to see how she would handle being in such a small space. Now, Rachel has completed six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian crew to a site five days' sail west of the Canary Islands. There, on the ocean floor, is a large area of underwater volcanoes with chimneys blowing out black smoke. The Russian team was placing scientific equipment to study the effects of a project that would drill 150 meters into a volcano.

When not at sea, Rachel works in her office at the Oceanography Centre in Southampton. She spends two-thirds of her time teaching, which she enjoys, but she does it to support her research on ""black smokers,"" another name for underwater volcanoes. These volcanoes release water that looks like black smoke at a rate of one meter per second and a temperature of 350 degrees. The only time Rachel felt scared was during a dive with Americans when an explosion occurred. The shock waves hit their vehicle, and she thought she might die. They waited in silence, and when nothing happened, they were incredibly relieved to be alive.

Diving to the ocean's deepest parts is an adventure for Rachel. Every time she looks out of the porthole and sees the chimneys, she feels a sense of wonder. She is at the bottom of the sea, seeing something no one else has seen before. After studying the black smokers for three years for her PhD, seeing them in person was an amazing experience."
FCE_58,"I was dirty, smelly, hungry, and somewhere under all that, suntanned. It was the end of my Inter-Rail holiday. My body couldn't take any more stress. My mind was tired of dealing with foreign timetables, currencies, and languages. ""Never again,"" I said as I stepped back onto home ground. I said the same thing the next year. And the year after that. All I needed was one train ticket, and because I was under twenty-five, I could spend a whole month traveling anywhere in Europe. Once you've learned to sleep in a train corridor, regular beds never feel the same. The train's rhythm rocks you into a deep sleep. Carrying everything in a backpack makes you travel simply and can lead to throwing away things like socks that have become too smelly or books once you've finished them. This carefree attitude is part of the Inter-Rail spirit, where common sense and reasoning can be ignored, just like the socks and books. All you need is one of those tickets in your hand. Any system that lets young people travel through countries at a rate of more than one a day must be special. On our first trip, my friends and I didn't realize the potential of this train ticket. We thought it was just a cheap way to get to and from our campsite in southern France. But the idea of non-stop travel was too tempting. There was always one more country just over the border, always a little further to go. And what did the extra miles cost us? Nothing. We weren't completely uninterested in culture. But this was our first holiday without parents, like most other Inter-Railers, and we only included the most accessible sights in our schedule. This was our chance to escape guided tours and do something different. I was proud that in many places, all I saw was the view from the station. We were just there to get by and have a good time. In this, we were like most other Inter-Railers with whom we shared corridor floors, food, water, money, and music. The excitement of travel comes from seeing a place that was just a name before. It's as if the city never existed until the train arrives, and you see it with your own tired eyes for the first time. Only by seeing Europe, watching the changing landscapes, and noticing the differences in attitudes and lifestyles can you truly understand the continent. Everyone knows what's there, but it's meaningless until you see it yourself. This is why other people's holiday photos are often boring. While the train trip won't let you discover anything new in a global sense, it's a valuable personal experience. Europe is a big place, and Inter-Rail gives people the best chance to realize this, though for us, it didn't happen right away."
FCE_37,"Arriving at an airport in another country only to find out your luggage didn't make it is very frustrating. At best, you'll have to wear the same clothes for hours or days until the airline returns your bags. At worst, you might be in a completely different climate, far from home, and stuck with unsuitable clothing. Airlines don't often share how many bags they lose, but frequent travelers know that losing luggage is a common issue. Even top airlines make mistakes, and no airline can promise that your checked bags will always be on the same flight, especially if you have to change planes.

Here's how the system works: Airlines require you to check in early to give enough time for your bags to be processed and loaded onto the plane. Minimum connecting times (MCTs) are set to ensure there's enough time to transfer bags between flights. Usually, this system works well. However, extra security checks and air traffic issues can delay flights, causing the baggage system to fail. Human errors or accidents, like a torn-off destination label, can also cause problems. These issues are more common at large transfer airports, called 'hubs,' because they handle many bags. For example, last year, London's Heathrow airport managed over 41 million passengers, with nine million changing planes. British Airways alone had two million transfer passengers at Heathrow, mostly moving between Terminal 1 and Terminal 4. Even efficient airports like Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Singapore, and Zurich have bad days. The risk of losing luggage is higher at some airports. In the U.S., Miami airport is known for losing bags when passengers connect to Latin America.

To avoid losing your luggage, choose direct flights when possible and check in early. If you must change planes or want a cheaper flight, try to stick with the same airline. Allow more time for connections by taking an earlier flight to the transfer airport, and label your luggage inside and out with your home and holiday addresses, including flight numbers. If your luggage still goes missing, contact the airline's baggage office and fill out a property irregularity report (PIR) before leaving the airport."
FCE_2,"Charlie James is a wildlife photographer who specializes in kingfishers, which are beautiful blue-green birds that live near streams and rivers and eat fish. The environment where they live is full of soft colors like greens, browns, and yellows from the sunlight. The kingfisher moves quickly and brightly through this scene, leaving a strong impression even though it is small.

Charlie fell in love with kingfishers when he was young. He can't quite explain why he is so drawn to them, but they are part of many legends. In Greek mythology, a kingfisher was a moon goddess who became a bird. Another story says the kingfisher flew so high that its top turned blue like the sky, and its bottom was burned by the sun. Scientifically, kingfishers don't have blue pigment in their feathers. Instead, their feather structure reflects light, making them look blue or green depending on the light angle.

Many wildlife photographers are fascinated by kingfishers because of their colors and the fact that, while they avoid humans, they can be watched from a hidden spot. Charlie's first hideout was just an old blanket he used to cover himself while waiting for a kingfisher. The bird came close, but it took him four years to get a good picture. During this time, he spent as much time as possible by streams with kingfishers, even skipping school, which affected his studies.

Despite this, his passion for kingfishers was noticed, and at 16, he became an advisor for a nature magazine. He later worked as an assistant editor and then became a freelance wildlife film cameraman. Now, he dreams of making the perfect kingfisher film with just beautiful images and no words. He loves the simple approach and enjoys photographing parts of the kingfisher's wings. His photos show his deep feelings for the bird, but he knows there's more to his connection with kingfishers than his work can express."
FCE_68,"**Conducting an Orchestra: Insights from Five New Conductors**

**A. Anne Manson**
Anne Manson, 30, had an unexpected start in conducting when she filled in for an absent assistant during Claudio Abbado's practice sessions in Vienna. She wasn't nervous and felt confident leading an orchestra. Manson, originally from the U.S., works with a London opera company focused on modern music. She is gaining recognition in Europe, supported by the British Arts Council, and has assisted Abbado on several projects since her first opportunity.

**B. Andrew Constantine**
Andrew Constantine, 31, believes the hardest part of conducting is convincing people to give you opportunities. He won a major competition in 1991 after failing in two others. He feels the timing was perfect, as earlier success might have been overwhelming. The competition opened doors for him, including working with a famous conductor. However, he worries about being labeled as just a ""competition winner."" He hopes orchestras, like the English Chamber Orchestra, will continue to invite him back, as this is crucial for his career.

**C. Wasfi Kani**
Wasfi Kani, founder of Pimlico Opera, enjoys the long rehearsal periods in opera. She began conducting seriously in her late twenties, supporting herself with a job in London's business district until her opera company became professional. Lessons with Sian Edwards were pivotal for her, as she realized size didn't matter in conducting. Kani appreciates the complexity of opera, including managing singers' personalities and the inevitable disagreements.

**D. Roger Vignoles**
Roger Vignoles, 48, found conducting unexpectedly fascinating. He started as a resident musician in an opera house and worked with skilled conductors. Last year, he directed Handel's ""Agrippina"" from the piano at a festival, which was easier than he anticipated. Vignoles feels his broad musical experience benefits him in conducting. He is open to trying new things to discover what he enjoys most.

**E. Wayne Marshall**
Wayne Marshall's conducting career began in 1986 when Simon Rattle noticed him and recommended him to an agent. At 32, he conducted a musical in London on short notice, facing challenges like musicians reading newspapers during performances. He handled it by being firm and clear. Marshall hasn't formally studied conducting, but he is confident and knows what he wants. He believes showing confidence is key, as showing worry can make things worse."
FCE_23,"**Variations on a Theme**

If you're planning to take children to a theme park in Britain, there are many options. We asked five families to try out some of the best ones.

**Fun Island - The Burns Family**

Last year, we visited a large theme park in the US, so we thought Fun Island might not be as exciting. However, we were pleasantly surprised. The park is great for younger children, so our three-year-old felt included. The kids loved the Crocodile Ride and the Giant Wheel. There’s a special dodgems ride for very young kids, which was a big hit. For older children, there are more thrilling rides like Splash Out, where you end up in a pool! After five hours, Steve and I were ready to leave, but the kids wanted to stay because they were having so much fun. Our only complaint is that the park lacks a bit of atmosphere, and the scenery could be better. But the staff are very helpful, and the park is clean, well-organized, and focused on safety.

**Wonderland - The McMillan Family**

None of us had been to a theme park before, so we didn’t know what to expect. We thought Oscar might be too young, but he loved it. He enjoyed the Mountain Train and Little Land, which has small models of famous buildings at his height! The older kids liked the ferris wheel and driving toy cars on a real road layout. We spent six hours there and appreciated the places to rest. The landscaping is beautiful, and the staff are friendly and helpful. There’s something for everyone, including adults.

**Adventure World - The Jeffree Family**

After seven hours, we still had more to see. The kids loved the Big Top Circus with its amazing trapeze act. We went on the Terror Line, and although the girls were scared and kept their eyes shut, they said they enjoyed it. Their favorite ride was Running River, where you think you’ll get wet, but you don’t. Toy Land is great for younger children. The kids wanted to try the new ride, Fear Factor, but we were relieved they were too small for it! The park is well-designed, so even waiting in line isn’t too boring. It’s very clean, and the staff are excellent. On one ride, I couldn’t sit with both girls, so a staff member offered to go with one of them.

**The Great Park - The Langridge Family**

We arrived at 1 p.m. and were disappointed that the park closed at 5 p.m. This is a great park for younger children because the rides aren’t too scary. I’m usually scared, but I had fun. We all loved Exotic Travels, a boat ride that starts calmly and then gets exciting. We waited for half an hour for Lightning River, and it was over quickly! I didn’t go on the Big Leap, but it looked fun if you’re brave. If the kids were older, they might have found it a bit tame, but they were the right age and loved it.

**Fantasy World - The Break-all Family**

The park advertises 'No Limit to the Fun,' and we agree. Europe’s tallest roller-coaster, the Rocket, stands out, and Ben thought it was the scariest ride, although Jennie said the Hanger, where you hang upside-down 30 meters above the ground, was worse! There are about a dozen main rides, which the older kids went on several times. Sarah was too small for some, but she enjoyed the Long Slide. We found the staff attitudes varied. Some were great with younger kids, but not all were welcoming. You need a full day to enjoy Fantasy World. We wouldn’t have dared to tell the kids we were leaving early."
FCE_60,"**Running a Business in the Countryside: Five Women's Stories**

**A. Christine Hogan**  
Christine Hogan runs a computer-aided design business with a yearly turnover of over £200,000 and employs four full-time staff. She and her husband moved from London to the countryside when their children were young. Christine wanted a job she could do from home, so she started this business, having worked with computers before marriage. It required a lot of money initially, and the start was tough. She managed finances carefully, always informing the bank if she might overspend. Working from home saves money, and she can work in the evenings if needed. The business remains small, with local customers often picking up their orders.

**B. Maggy Sasanow**  
Maggy Sasanow designs greeting cards from home. She studied art at university and initially wanted to work in a museum, but after moving to the countryside, she started her own business. She creates 50 different greeting cards, selling them to museums. She works in a large room at home. The downside of working from home is the constant distraction of household chores. Her business grows through word of mouth, without advertising. Although she misses exchanging ideas with others, she finds more benefits than drawbacks in her work.

**C. Delia Turner**  
Delia Turner runs a curtain-making business that has experienced ups and downs. She started eight years ago, and initially, her business grew rapidly, with turnover increasing from £24,000 to £80,000 in two years. She once managed six full-time staff but had to let them go due to economic decline, which was difficult as jobs are scarce in her area. Now, she makes curtains at home with her husband's help and employs women who work from their homes. She adapts by lowering prices when needed and exploring new opportunities.

**D. Tessa Strickland**  
Tessa Strickland manages the editorial and production side of her children's book publishing business from her farmhouse. She moved to the countryside three years ago to save money and because she loves the rural life. She enjoys flexible working hours, though 80% of her income comes from international deals, requiring her to take calls at odd hours. The challenge is maintaining discipline to separate work from home life. Her business focuses on publishing children's books from various cultures, collaborating with authors and artists. Initially, she felt isolated, having worked in London before.

**E. Meg Rivers**  
Meg Rivers runs a cakes-by-post business and a shop, with a yearly turnover of £250,000, employing six people, some part-time. She started at home ten years ago, making fruit cakes with high-quality ingredients due to her interest in health. As demand grew, she began sending cakes nationwide. Seven years ago, she rented a small building for production, employing a baker, assistant, and professional cake decorator. Meg now focuses on the business side rather than baking. Her biggest challenge has been managing finances, as she started with limited funds."
FCE_1,"Title: Meet the Amazing Watkins Family

The Watkins family is unique because not only are the sons talented musicians and composers, but their father, John, also makes musical instruments. When John and Hetty Watkins, both schoolteachers from South Wales, needed a cello for their ten-year-old son Paul, they found the cost too high. John decided to learn how to make one himself. He attended evening classes at the Welsh School of Instrument Making for about three years. After practicing with violins and violas, he successfully made his first cello for Paul. Paul used this cello until recently, and John now makes up to twelve violins a year, even selling one to the famous American violinist Jaime Laredo.

Both Paul and his younger brother, Huw, were encouraged to play music from a young age. Paul started with the piano but soon switched to the cello, inspired by a cellist in his father's music group. Huw, on the other hand, chose the piano and composition, finding inspiration in Paul's success rather than feeling overshadowed by it.

Paul's talent with the cello led him to win the string final of the BBC Young Musician of the Year competition. At just 20, he became the principal cellist of the BBC Symphony Orchestra, using the cello his father made. Recently, he started playing a Francesco Rugeri cello, which is over 300 years old, on loan from the Royal Academy of Music. Paul will soon perform Elgar's Cello Concerto on television, but he won't be able to watch it because he has a concert at the Cheltenham Festival the same night. Huw also has a significant event that evening, with his String Quartet premiering in London.

John and Hetty Watkins will need to be both diplomatic and energetic to keep up with their sons' busy musical schedules in the coming weeks."
FCE_53,"Text: 'Caring for the Countryside THE NATIONAL TRUST The National Trust is an organization that aims to protect the British countryside. Gill Page visits the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales and talks to Gareth Roberts, a warden employed by the Trust to care for the beautiful areas it owns. According to Gareth, a National Trust Warden needs common sense. 'You also need to be good with people because you're always dealing with farmers, visitors, conservationists, and building companies.' Gareth grew up on the Lleyn Peninsula and worked on his parents' farm until he got married. About 80 people applied for the job of National Trust Warden for the Lleyn Peninsula. In the end, Gareth's local knowledge and farming experience got him the job, even though he didn't have formal training. 'It's helpful that I still farm with my parents, so I can relate to farmers and understand their problems. Plus, they can't fool me about anything!' he says. His farming background also helps him handle the physical work of the job, like building fences, planting trees, and constructing walls. Since joining the Trust, Gareth has learned more about nature conservation. 'When I was young,' he remembers, 'I used to pick and press flowers, collect butterfly larvae, and old birds' nests. Recently, I wondered where I would find all those flowers, nests, and grasshoppers now. It's clear to me that farming has changed the countryside. It's not the farmers' fault—they were just following government advice.' Gareth says that when he started, farmers and conservationists were often in conflict. Now, they are talking and understanding each other's views. 'We're close to bringing them together,' says Gareth. Conservation is a key part of Gareth's work, along with allowing public access to the Trust's land, planting and maintaining trees, and meeting with the Trust's tenant farmers. 'My job is to make sure tasks are completed efficiently and economically. I enjoy seeing projects finished, although I spend about half my time on paperwork and bills.' Gareth is passionate about his job and, despite being on duty all the time, he enjoys it, especially interacting with the public. Most of them, anyway. 'It's some people's attitude I dislike,' he admits. 'They come in, demand everything, and leave as if it's their right. Being polite to those people can be annoying!' But as Gareth says, it all comes down to common sense. So if you have plenty of that and like the idea of working outdoors, you might consider becoming a warden like Gareth—just don't expect a job to open up on the Lleyn Peninsula anytime soon!'"
FCE_55,"Text: 'The Netball Captain In our series on women in sport, Suzie Ellis met with England's netball captain. Kendra Slowinski leads England's netball team. When I met her, she was having a typical day leading up to next month's World Championships: teaching at a local school and then training in a supermarket car park. 'Don't people stare?' I asked. 'I'm too focused on my movements and my feet to notice,' she said. 'I might see cars slow down, but that's it.' 'My life is all about being at my best for the Championships,' Kendra says. 'I'm on a strict schedule to get as fit as possible.' This is her fourth World Championships, and they will be the biggest ever, with 27 countries participating. 'We'll have home support, which is special,' she says. 'It's important to improve netball's reputation in this country. Playing here means more pressure. A home crowd will have expectations and give more support. People expect us to start well.' Their first game is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. 'As far as I know, we've always beaten them, but they're exciting to play. They have a lot of skill.' England is currently ranked fourth in the world. But, as Kendra points out, the World Championships will be tough. 'You have to push yourself to play every day, there's no rest between games like in a series. You can still win a series if you lose the first game, but the Championships are different because there's only one chance.' In the fifteen years she's been playing at the top level, the sport has become harder and faster. On the court, players are more aggressive. 'You don't train so hard not to win,' says Kendra. 'But once the final whistle blows, you become a different person. We're all friendlier after the game.' Netball is also using a more scientific approach to fitness testing. 'We must think and train like world-class players,' says Kendra. 'As captain, I need a strong mental attitude and to lead by example. I see my role as supporting and encouraging the team.' 'From the start, my netball career has been carefully planned,' she says. 'I decided some time ago that this competition would be my last as a player.' She will likely coach young players in the future, but for now, she is focused on her last big event. As she leads her team in the opening candlelight ceremony, she might have a tear in her eye.'"
FCE_50,"**SPECIALIST MUSIC SCHOOLS**

How should parents handle a child with exceptional musical talent? It's not always easy to know the best way to nurture their gift. Some parents might not even notice their child's needs until the child becomes frustrated and difficult. While most schools can support children who excel in academic subjects, musically gifted children need special attention that regular schools might not provide, especially if music is not a priority there. These children, along with those encouraged by parents or teachers, might benefit from attending a specialist music school.

In Britain, there are five specialist music schools, which are relatively new. These schools offer a supportive environment for gifted children aged seven to eighteen to fully develop their musical skills with the help of professional musicians. Students at these schools spend about one-third to half of their day on music-related activities, such as individual lessons (up to three hours a week on their main and secondary instruments), playing in orchestras, chamber groups, voice training, conducting, and learning music theory. They also practice for several hours daily in well-equipped private rooms, sometimes with a teacher. The rest of their time is spent on a limited academic program focusing on essential subjects like English, math, basic sciences, and languages, though they can study more subjects if they wish.

All five British specialist schools are independent, with small classes and a high teacher-to-student ratio. Most students are boarders, meaning they live at the school full-time, which allows them to grow up with peers who share similar goals and interests.

What are the downsides? One major issue is the cost; boarding fees range from £12,000 to £17,000 a year. However, schools try to help parents of exceptionally talented children with scholarships and financial aid. Another concern is that not all parents want to send their children to boarding school, especially at a young age. Many school directors question whether it's wise to admit children as young as seven into such a demanding environment. They emphasize that their goal is to develop 'well-rounded and balanced individuals.'

Separating musically gifted children from an early age can be stressful. Musical talent might fade during teenage years, and the pressure to succeed can lead to feelings of failure. However, specialist schools closely monitor each student's progress and provide support if needed. While many former students feel they gained a lot from the high-quality music education, some are concerned about the limited academic program, which is secondary to music activities. Many musically talented young people are also very intelligent and can handle academic challenges, so they may feel frustrated if their intellectual needs aren't met.

For these reasons, it might be better to wait until the child is old enough to decide for themselves before considering a specialist education. Children who are also academically gifted might thrive in a less specialized environment, such as a school with an excellent music department or by combining regular schooling with music training at a junior department of a music college. These colleges offer Saturday morning lessons with excellent teachers and opportunities for orchestral and chamber music experience. However, this option may not be feasible for families living far from major cities like London."
FCE_25,"Susan Shepherd is an artist famous for her flower paintings. Her house is surrounded by a large garden, which provides many of her painting subjects. The garden is filled with her favorite flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some plants grow wildly and spread throughout the garden. The garden has a beautiful mix of colors, shapes, and structures, thanks to the previous owners who loved gardening and left plants that Susan liked. She also kept their gardener, Danny. Susan says, ""It was really his garden."" They got along well, and although Danny initially doubted some of her choices, he understood her vision when she explained she wanted to paint them.

Susan prefers to paint detailed studies of individual plants rather than the whole garden. Sometimes she paints groups of plants in the garden, but usually, she picks them and takes them to her studio. She explains, ""I don't set the whole thing up at once. I take one flower out and paint it, which might take a few days, and then I bring in another one and build up the painting that way. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish."" Her busiest time is spring and early summer when tulips and poppies bloom. She finds the process of flowers decaying fascinating. For example, with tulips, ""you bring them in and put them in water, then leave them for perhaps a day and they each form themselves into different shapes. They open out and are fantastic.""

Susan has always been interested in plants. She studied botany in school and collected wildflowers from the countryside. She wasn't interested in gardening back then and didn't like garden flowers, thinking they looked artificial. She was fascinated by how wildflowers could grow in difficult places like rock cracks or cliff tops. Today, her garden includes plants from distant countries, but they fit in well. She has a relaxed approach to gardening, like an aunt who lets children play freely as long as they don't cause harm. With two upcoming exhibitions and plenty of subjects to paint, she finds it hard to spend time gardening. She now has an extra gardener but believes that to stay connected to her work, ""you have to get your hands dirty."""
FCE_34,"Text: 'Keeping the holiday-makers happy A chalet girl's work is never done, Sarah Sutherland-Pilch tells Veronica Lee - in between making beds and delicious dinners. This is the second year as a chalet girl for Sarah Sutherland-Pilch, a 24-year-old from West Sussex. Known by her nickname, Pilch, Sarah works for a company in Val d'Isère, France, cooking and cleaning for visitors who come to ski and stay in the wooden houses, known as chalets, that are typical of the area. Sarah graduated in French and History of Art from Oxford Brookes University last summer. Being a chalet girl isn't a career, she says, but a fun way to spend a year or two before settling down. 'It's a good way to make contacts. I meet successful people every week.' Sarah does not live at the chalet. She gets up at 7 a.m. to walk about a mile to the chalet, which can host up to 18 guests each week. She has her own breakfast before preparing breakfast for the guests. 'They get everything - porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants.' When the last guest has finished breakfast, by about 9:30 a.m., Sarah cleans up and either prepares the afternoon tea, which is left for the guests to help themselves, or cleans the rooms - 'the worst part of the job,' she says. By about 11 a.m., she is ready to go skiing herself. She skis as much as possible. 'On a good day, we can be up there until 4:30 p.m.' Sarah returns to the chalet in time to prepare dinner and takes a shower before doing so, but does not sleep. 'It's fatal if you do,' she says. Dinner, a three-course meal, is served at 8 p.m., and coffee is usually on the table by 10 p.m. Sarah clears away the dinner things and fills the dishwasher. 'There's nothing worse than coming into a messy kitchen the next morning.' Sometimes she will stay and chat with the guests, other times they prefer to be left alone. 'Good guests can make a week brilliant - breakfast this morning was great fun - but some weeks, for whatever reason, don't go quite so well.' Sarah meets her friends in the chalet where she lives - and they go out at about 11 p.m. 'We usually start off in Bananas, might go to G Jay's and perhaps Dick's T-Bar at the end of the evening,' she says. But Sarah never stays out too late on Saturday night as Sunday is her busiest time of the week. 'A frightful day,' she says, 'when you certainly don't want to be cooking breakfast feeling exhausted.' Work begins earlier than usual on Sunday, since breakfast for guests has to be on the table by 7 a.m. As soon as the guests are gone, Sarah starts cleaning quickly. 'We just blitz the place - clear the breakfast, strip the beds, get everything ready.' If she hasn't already done the week's shopping on Saturday, Sarah does it now. At around 3 p.m., the cleaning work done, Sarah then prepares tea for the new guests. 'They get here at around 4:30 p.m. Sometimes they are disoriented and full of questions. I'm sure it's the mountain air that does something to them.' Between tea and dinner, Sarah takes any guests needing boots or skis down to the ski shop and then gets a lift back to the chalet from one of the ski shop staff. It is soon time for dinner duty again and perhaps a chat with friends, but not always. 'Sometimes I'm so tired I just have an early night,' she says.'"

Mandie Currie, a zoo-keeper, spent a day at the magazine Marie Claire. 'Choosing what to wear was difficult because I usually wear a uniform. First, I visited a photo studio, then went to press previews, all before lunch. The zoo is calm and peaceful, but here I was rushing around. Some of the fashion team seemed stressed, while my job is not very stressful. At a fashion shoot in the afternoon, I laughed thinking that I would usually be cleaning cages or handling rats. I find magazines interesting, but I love my job at the zoo, so I will stay there.'

Alice Cutler, a fashion assistant at Marie Claire, spent a day at London Zoo. 'I arrived in leather boots and dark blue trousers. The zoo gave me a green polo shirt to work in, which was good because I got very dirty. As I stroked an elephant, I thought Mandie was probably packing clothes. By five o'clock, I smelled bad, but I had a great day. When I retire from fashion, I might work with elephants, maybe in Africa.'

Karen Hodson, a nurse at Hammersmith Hospital, joined the TV gardening show Ground Force. 'I was excited to meet the team, and Alan Titchmarsh, the presenter, was really nice. I liked being in the fresh air because sometimes I don't see daylight due to my shifts. It was hard work but fun. I thought I was strong, but I felt weak compared to the team. My idea of gardening didn't include hard work or careful planning. I was more enthusiastic than effective, so I won't leave my nursing job.'

Charlie Dimmock, a landscape gardener from Ground Force, worked a shift at Hammersmith Hospital. 'I made beds and gave out tablets. I thought I might faint, but I was surprised that it didn't bother me. The friendship among the nurses is great, and it felt very 'girlie' compared to my usual male environment. I feel my job is less important compared to nursing. My day at the hospital wasn't exactly pleasant, but it was very satisfying.'

Lucy Harvey, a personal trainer, spent a day with Ryanair as cabin crew. 'I changed into the uniform, and it made me feel different—people respected me more. Before the flight, our supervisor talked about safety and what to do if someone had a heart attack, which I knew from my fitness training. When passengers boarded the flight to Paris, I gave out magazines. Everyone stared at me, and I felt self-conscious. On the return flight, we had 80 schoolchildren who wouldn't sit still. I wished I was back in the gym with one sensible adult.'

Sonia McDermott, an air hostess with Ryanair, spent a day as a personal trainer in a gym. 'I was nervous about this swap because I don't exercise. I was surprised by how much attention you give to one person. In my job, I meet 130 passengers four times a day. I was surprised at lunch to see that some trainers didn't eat very healthily, but they all drink lots of water. I wouldn't swap my job for this, but it has inspired me to join a gym and try to be healthier.'"

I fell in love with the south of France a long time ago and try to visit as often as I can. There's a local train from Cannes that travels along the coast and crosses into Italy. It offers some of the most stunning views of the sea. No matter the weather or season, it's always enchanting. From the other window, you can see some of the best gardens and homes in France, making you feel like you're peeking into the lives of the rich and famous. The passengers are always lively, a mix of tourists and locals, all enjoying the breathtaking journey.

**Raj Patel - Explorer**  
I've enjoyed many train journeys over the years, but my favorite is the Nile Valley Express, which travels across the desert in northern Sudan. Growing up in South Africa, I missed a family train trip from Cape Town to the Kruger National Park because I was considered too young and troublesome. When I moved to England as a teenager, I still hadn't traveled by train. London Waterloo was the first real station I saw, and its great glass dome amazed me.

**Betty Cooper - Novelist**  
I'm especially grateful to one train: the Blue Train, which took my husband and me on our honeymoon across France to catch a boat to Egypt. On the train, my husband gave me a pink dress, which I loved. Someone mentioned that pink is good for the brain, and I've worn the color ever since. What I remember most about the journey is how lovely it was to travel through France and then by boat up the Nile to Luxor. It was the perfect way to relax after all the wedding preparations.

**Martin Brown - Journalist**  
We were working on a series of articles about a round-the-world trip and had to cross a desert in an African country. There was no road, so we took the Desert Express. The schedule was unreliable—we were just given a day. We heard that the driver would often wait for days if he knew people were still coming. When the train appeared, hundreds of people rushed to climb in and on top of the carriages—some even traveled on the roof for free. During the night, the train crossed some of the most beautiful landscapes I've ever seen. It felt like a dream, like traveling across the moon.

**Arisu Mezuki - Actress**  
Most people form their favorite train memories as children, but not me. I grew up in Singapore and Cyprus, where I saw very few trains. It wasn't until I was a teenager that trains became important in my life. I made a film featuring a railway in Yorkshire. Most of the filming was on an old, unused part of the line, lovingly maintained by volunteers. That's where my love for steam trains began. When we weren't filming, we rode the train whenever we could. When I returned last year, it was as if time had stood still. Everything was still there, even the gas lights on the station platform!"
FCE_8,"Are you trying to get published? If you're wondering where to send your story, our expert Margaret Stubbs has the advice you need. Many readers ask us, ""I've written a story or book. Who should I send it to?"" The first thing to know is that you should research the market and learn about publishers while improving your writing skills. Selling your writing requires understanding the ""writing game."" No matter what you write, you need to know the markets you're targeting. The best way to do this is by reading everything relevant. Visit your local library, bookshops, and newsagents. Reading widely will help you understand what publishers are currently accepting. Keep updating this knowledge because new publications appear, editors change jobs, and magazines change direction. Publishers always look for new talent, so writers must provide what they want. 

If you're unsure what to write, start by exploring. For example, if you want to write short love stories, first find out which magazines publish them. Get recent copies and learn what kind of stories they buy, paying attention to their readers. Editors focus on meeting readers' needs. Writers often ask me, ""My story was rejected three times. Am I wasting my time?"" As a former teacher, I never discourage anyone, but the work might not be ready for publishing. Most new writers send their work too soon, often before they're ready for the market. If you've only written one story or article, it's unlikely to be published. Success stories usually involve people with years of experience in publishing or journalism. 

When you send your work for the first time, start on new projects while waiting for a reply. Write ten or even twenty more stories. Each one will improve, and you'll start seeing yourself as a writer. Your fluency and confidence will grow. Don't throw any work away—improve it instead. I also suggest not showing your work to others, especially early on. Remember, every successful writer faced many rejections before succeeding. Do everything you can to advance your writing career. Look for a creative writing course nearby or join a local writers' group to gain ideas and confidence from other aspiring writers. Think of yourself as a writer and practice writing every day if possible."
FCE_4,"Text: 'No Title On the last day of a difficult year, I was leaning against a pillar in the Baltimore railway station, waiting for the 10.10 train to Philadelphia. There were more people than I expected. The station, usually airy and clean, felt crowded. Elderly couples with matching luggage filled the benches, and groups of college students sat on the floor with their bags. A grey-haired man was walking around, talking to strangers one by one. He looked well-off: tanned skin, nice sweater, and a soft, beige coat. He approached a woman sitting alone and asked her something. Then he came to a girl standing near me. She had long blond hair, and I thought I might like to talk to her. The man asked, 'Are you traveling to Philadelphia by any chance?' 'Well, I'm going north,' she said. 'But to Philadelphia?' 'No, New York, but I'll be ...' 'Thanks, anyway,' he said, moving to the next bench. Now he had my full attention. 'Ma'am,' I heard him ask an older woman, 'are you traveling to Philadelphia?' When she said, 'Wilmington,' he didn't respond, just moved on to a couple with matching luggage. I straightened up and moved closer, pretending to look at the platform. I was going to Philadelphia. He could have asked me. I understood why he didn't; I probably seemed unreliable. He glanced at me quickly and then moved to the bench at the other end of the waiting area. He looked stressed. 'Please!' he said to a woman reading a book. 'Tell me you're going to Philadelphia!' She lowered her book. She was around thirty-five, older than me. She looked like a teacher. 'Philadelphia?' she said. 'Yes, I am.' 'Could I ask you a favor?' I stopped a few feet away and looked at my wrist as if checking a watch. (I don't own a watch.) Even without looking, I could tell she was cautious. The man must have noticed too, because he said, 'Nothing too difficult, I promise!' They announced my train. People started moving toward Gate E, the older couples pulling their wheeled bags like pets on leashes. I heard the man talking. 'My daughter is flying out this afternoon for a study year abroad, leaving from Philadelphia. I put her on a train this morning, stopped for groceries, and came home to find my wife upset. My daughter forgot her passport and called from the Philadelphia station, unsure what to do.' The woman made a sympathetic sound. I would have stayed quiet, waiting to see where this was going. 'I told her to stay put. I said I would find someone here to take her passport.' A likely story! Why didn't he go himself if it was so urgent? 'Why don't you go yourself?' the woman asked. 'I can't leave my wife alone for that long. She's in a wheelchair.' This seemed like a weak excuse, in my opinion. It was more bad luck than one family should have. I looked at them. The man was holding a packet, not a plain envelope, which would have made more sense, but a padded envelope the size of a paperback book. Aha! Padded! So you couldn't feel what was inside! And from where I stood, it looked stapled shut. Be careful, lady, I thought to myself.'"
FCE_30,"**Gary and Me**

John Moore, a restaurant owner, shares his story about his son Gary, who is now a famous TV chef. John believes everyone gets a chance in life. Gary's chance was cooking, and John's was running a restaurant. When John found the opportunity to start his restaurant, the place was in bad shape, but it was perfect for his plans. This reminded him of his childhood when his mother worked in a factory, and he felt lonely. He wanted to ensure his family had time together, so his wife took care of the children and managed the accounts while he ran the business. They lived above the restaurant and always prioritized family meals, which helped their children, Gary and Joe, become confident. From a young age, they interacted with customers, giving them a good start in life.

Gary was an energetic child. At seven, he once jumped into a corner bath like it was a pool and knocked himself out. As he grew, he worked for pocket money, starting with small jobs and then helping in the kitchen every weekend by age ten. He was disciplined, often waking up before his father. The family business was for the family, and it was nice to see Gary helping out. Although not very academic, Gary excelled in the kitchen. By 15, he was as skilled as the adults and sometimes even managed the kitchen, preparing over a hundred meals. John knew Gary would pursue catering because of his talent. When Gary needed work experience for school, John sent him to a friend's restaurant.

Recently, Gary started playing the drums and formed a band. John worries about what will happen to Gary's cooking if his music career takes off. He advises Gary to focus on one thing, saying, ""If you chase two hares, you catch neither."" John also told Gary, ""If you want to achieve something, do it by 30, or it might be too late."" At 17, Gary went to catering college. On his first day, he quickly finished a morning's work in an hour and helped others. This showed his dedication and skill.

Gary's TV cookery series has become very successful, and John is extremely proud. He always taught Gary that hard work is necessary because nothing is given for free. Gary seized his opportunity and succeeded. John reflects that if children remember even a small part of what parents teach them, it's a success. Seeing Gary's actions and words, John feels Gary must have listened sometimes."

Dublin felt like a big unknown to her, and she felt like she was stepping into the unknown when she took the train to work there. She didn't question why she was going; it was just assumed by everyone at her school that she would leave their small town. Everyone wanted to escape, experience life, and have a real existence. Some of her classmates moved to nearby towns like Ennis or Limerick, where they had family to help them settle in. But Jo was the only one from her year going to Dublin, and she was doing it alone.

Jo's mother thought it would be great if she stayed permanently in the hostel, which was run by nuns, so she would be safe. Her father hoped the hostel was warm, as they were known to be cold. Jo's sisters, who worked as waitresses in a hotel, thought she was crazy for staying in a hostel for a whole week. But Jo didn't know they were all still thinking and talking about her as she answered an ad for a flat in Ringsend. The ad said, ""Own room, own television, share kitchen, bathroom."" It was close to the post office where she worked and seemed too good to be true. She hoped it would be nice, that the people would like her, and that it wouldn't be too expensive. There wasn't a line for this flat because it was more like ""Third Girl Wanted"" than ""Flat to Let."" The mention of ""own television"" made Jo wonder if it was too fancy for her, but the house looked ordinary—a red-brick terraced house with a basement. The flat was upstairs, not in the basement. As Jo climbed the stairs, a cheerful girl with a college scarf, who was clearly a failed applicant, was coming down. ""Desperate place,"" she said to Jo. ""They're both awful. Common as dirt."" ""Oh,"" said Jo and continued climbing.

""Hello,"" said a girl with ""Nessa"" on her T-shirt. ""Did you see that snobby girl leaving? I can't stand her type."" ""What did she do?"" asked Jo. ""Do? She didn't have to do anything. She just looked around, made a face, giggled, and said, 'Is this all there is to it? Oh dear, oh dear,' in a posh accent. We wouldn't have her here, would we, Pauline?"" Pauline, wearing a very colorful psychedelic shirt, was a punk, which amazed Jo. She had seen punks on O'Connell Street but hadn't talked to one up close. ""I'm Jo, I work in the post office, and I called about the flat,"" she said. Nessa said they were about to have a mug of tea and brought out three mugs: one with ""Nessa,"" one with ""Pauline,"" and one with ""Other"" written on it. ""We'll get your name on it if you come to stay,"" she said kindly."
FCE_43,"Text: 'Behind the dolphin's smile People love dolphins. We enjoy watching them in marinas, movies, and TV shows. However, the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society says dolphins are in serious trouble. Mark Simmonds reports on their decline. Dolphins are special to us because they are very intelligent, sensitive to human feelings, and they inspire dreams of freedom in the wild seas. TV shows like Flipper and Seaquest have made us love them even more. But these happy images hide the truth about dolphins living in polluted and overfished seas today. The number of North Sea harbour porpoises, a type of dolphin, has dropped by up to 89,000. You might think such popular animals are protected by law and cared for in marine reserves, but this is not true. The lack of protection plans could become a major wildlife disaster. There are forty different kinds of dolphins worldwide. In northern Europe, the most common are the striped, common, bottlenose dolphins, and the smaller harbour porpoise. The first two usually live far out at sea and are seen only briefly near ships, so we know little about them. The larger bottlenoses and harbour porpoises used to be common near European coasts. Bottlenoses are very social and were found on the Channel coast and in British rivers like the Thames. Now, they are only found in places like the Moray Firth in Scotland and Cardigan Bay in Wales. The injuries on the few remaining dolphins show they are stressed. Dolphins' complex habits make it hard to pinpoint why their numbers are decreasing. Overfishing, which is reducing fish stocks and threatening local fishing industries, also threatens dolphins. Porpoises need to find food quickly, and if fish are overfished in one area, they may not survive long enough to find food elsewhere. They also risk getting caught in fishing nets, which they can't see. Modern fishing methods use large nets that float or are dragged quickly through the sea. Recently, many dead dolphins have washed up on French and Cornish beaches, showing marks and cuts from these nets. Waste and chemicals in the sea can accumulate in dolphins' bodies. For example, pesticides dissolve in fat, so dolphins can absorb them, and they build up in their bodies. Female dolphins then produce milk rich in pesticides, passing the poison to their young. There is a case of a young dolphin dying from its mother's milk. Another serious threat to dolphins is human disturbance. Dolphins live in groups and rely on sound to understand their world. In the sea, noise pollution from ships and oil wells travels four times better than in the air, which may disturb dolphins in unknown ways."
FCE_51,"Text: 'GETTING FIT Exercise is very important for your mind, body, and spirit. It's one of the best ways to keep balance in your life, especially when everything around you feels chaotic and fast-paced. You might be tired of hearing about fitness, but there are many reasons why it's really good for you. Exercise improves your muscle tone and quickly changes your body shape. It makes your muscles stronger and helps you stand or sit with good posture. It prevents muscle imbalances that can cause injuries. Exercise also quickly improves areas like your thighs, stomach, and upper arms. It benefits your heart, lungs, and blood circulation. You might have heard these reasons many times, so maybe you're not paying attention anymore. But here's something that might interest you: exercise can help reduce depression and tiredness, and it helps you sleep better. It also helps control stress and can relieve some medical conditions. By now, these reasons should convince you a little. If not, common sense should tell you that exercise is good for you. There are many types of exercise you can try, like aerobics, calisthenics, jogging, lifting free weights, or using weight machines. Remember, training too hard or with too much weight can cause injuries, so start slowly and carefully. If you're unsure, ask your doctor what is best for you. Good posture is important for improving your body shape. A stiff or sagging body doesn't look good, lacks energy, and is more likely to have minor health issues. If you tend to slouch, imagine a helium balloon pulling the top of your head up. This will help lift your chest for better breathing and make your abdomen look slimmer. When your chest is balanced while standing, you should be able to see your ankles. Stretching your muscles improves flexibility and movement, helps maintain good posture, and prevents muscle injuries. If you stretch four or five times a week, you'll have a more flexible and fit body. Stretching should be a key part of your exercise routine, done slowly and carefully. The best exercise routine includes a good warm-up, stretching exercises, an energetic workout, and a cool-down period.'"
FCE_11,"Text: 'IN THEIR NATURAL HABITAT What makes film-makers Amanda Barrett and Owen Newman leave their home comforts for months? It's the search for the perfect shot. In the jungles and plains of East Africa, two of the hardest people to find are producer Amanda Barrett and cameraman Owen Newman. They are currently in the Ngorongoro Crater, which has had six months of almost nonstop rain, causing many unexpected problems. Newman explained that they had to buy an expensive tool so that whenever one of their vehicles gets stuck in the mud, Amanda can pull him out. Their teamwork has created some of TV's best wildlife films, like their amazing film on leopards. Even while this film about Africa's shyest cats was being shown, they were already back in the wild, this time following the equally shy jackal. This is common in television partnerships. Travelling film-makers have been going around the world to film exotic wildlife since television began. I talked to Newman about their partnership while he was briefly meeting other people at a safari lodge. 'We do have occasional arguments but we get over them quickly,' he says about his colleague. Neither of them sees themselves as the leader, and he says they get along well because they both see the animals in a similar way. 'When we are moving, we have to set up our tents each night. But this time we have a more fixed camp, and since we start at 5 a.m. each morning, we make the tea the night before and keep it warm in a vacuum flask.' The rest of their daily meals are pre-packed and heated by whoever is available. 'It's not unusual for us to be out for up to eight weeks at a time, so food can be a bit of a worry,' says Newman. It can be a tough life, but being alone in such remote areas lets them get close to the animals and become part of their lives. Newman remembers filming a family of lions where one lioness would often go off on her own. When she returned, she would greet all the other lions and even their car as part of her routine. Newman first worked with Barrett in 1988 on a film called 'The Great Rift', and two years later they went to film Arctic foxes as a team. Since then, they have learned to spend four months on location to gather enough material for each half-hour film. Before they start, they have to submit a script for approval. 'Amanda and I had a good working relationship from the start,' says Newman, 'because we shared the same ideas and vision. We always aim to make a film that is rich in atmosphere, that brings to life the true spirit of the place and animals, and that will touch people's hearts. I believe if you can evoke an emotional response from people, that is better than just appealing to their minds.'"
FCE_14,"**The Netball Captain**

In our series on women in sport, Suzie Ellis met with England's netball captain, Kendra Slawinski. Kendra is preparing for next month's World Championships. Her typical day includes teaching at a local school and then training in a supermarket car park. I was surprised by her training location and asked if she gets strange looks. She replied, ""I'm too focused on my movements and my feet to notice anything else. I might see cars slow down, but that's all.""

Kendra's life is now all about being at her best for the Championships. She follows a strict schedule to reach peak fitness. This will be her fourth World Championships, and they are expected to be the largest ever, with 27 countries participating. ""We'll have home support, which is special,"" she says. ""It's important to improve netball's reputation in our country. Playing here means more pressure and expectations from the home crowd. People expect us to start strong.""

Their first game is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. ""As far as I know, we've always beaten them, but they are exciting to play. They have a lot of talent."" England is currently ranked fourth in the world. However, Kendra notes that the World Championships are challenging. ""You have to push yourself to play every day, with no rest between games. Unlike a series, you only have one chance in the Championships, so you must be ready.""

In her 15 years at the top level, netball has become tougher and faster. Players are more aggressive on the court. ""You don't train so hard not to win,"" says Kendra. ""But after the final whistle, we become different people. We're all friendlier after the game.""

Netball now uses a more scientific approach to fitness testing. ""We must think and train like world-class players,"" says Kendra. As captain, she believes in having a strong mental attitude and leading by example. She sees her role as supporting and encouraging her team.

Kendra's netball career has been carefully planned from the start. She decided that this competition would be her last as a player. She may coach young players in the future, but for now, she is focused on her final big event. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she might have a tear in her eye, with her loyal supporters cheering her on."
FCE_63,"Rachel Mills is a scientist who loves exploring the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She works at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University, where she teaches and researches marine geochemistry, studying chemical processes in the sea. When she's not teaching, she dives three kilometers into the Atlantic Ocean in a small steel vehicle, about the size of a car, to study underwater volcanoes. Inside the vehicle, space is tight, and she can easily touch the two pilots. They can't stand or move much and must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can last 16 hours: three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours collecting rock and water samples, and three hours to return to the surface.

If there's an emergency, they can press a panic button, which releases a small escape vessel that quickly rises to the surface, like a ping-pong ball in water. No one has tested it yet, and Rachel thinks it wouldn't be a pleasant experience. The first time she entered the vehicle, she was on a ship's deck with an instructor who explained emergency procedures, including what to do if the pilot had a heart attack. They wanted to see how she would handle being in such a small space.

Rachel has now made six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian crew to a site five days' sail west of the Canary Islands. There, on the ocean floor, is a large area of underwater volcanoes with chimneys releasing black smoke. The Russian team was placing scientific equipment to study the effects of a project that would drill a 150-meter hole through a volcano.

When not at sea, Rachel works in her office at the Oceanography Centre. She spends two-thirds of her time teaching, which she enjoys, but she does it to support her research on ""black smokers,"" another name for underwater volcanoes. These volcanoes release water that looks like black smoke at a rate of one meter per second and a temperature of 350 degrees.

The only time Rachel felt scared was during a dive with Americans. They were towing equipment on a 50-meter rope when there was a sudden explosion. The shock waves hit their vehicle, and Rachel thought she was going to die. They waited in silence, and when nothing happened, they were incredibly relieved to be alive.

Diving to the ocean's deepest parts is an adventure for Rachel. Every time she looks out and sees the chimneys, she feels a sense of wonder. She is on the ocean floor, seeing things no one else has seen. After studying black smokers for three years for her Ph.D., seeing them in person was an amazing experience."
FCE_56,"**Interview Tips**

First impressions are very important. Studies show that people form opinions about us within the first few minutes of meeting. They notice how we dress, our eye contact, body language, how fast or slow we talk, our volume and tone of voice, and the words we use.

Mary Pearce studied to be a teacher. She says, ""I worked hard to earn my degree. When I graduated, I was very confident."" She applied for a job at a nearby primary school and got an interview with the Head Teacher. ""I noticed a small hole in my jacket that morning,"" she recalls. ""I would have changed, but I knew it would make me late, and I always think it's important to be on time."" Mary didn't get the job. Her friend, who also teaches at the school, told her the Head Teacher said, ""If someone doesn't take the time to present her best image at an interview, what kind of teacher is she going to be?""

Simon Grant, a hotel manager, says, ""Interviewees who look like they care about themselves are more likely to care about their jobs. People think it's what's inside that counts, but in an interview, you should aim to present yourself in the best possible way."" Many people ignore the importance of having a professional image. For example, Janet Goodwood worked for ten years as an administrative assistant in a large accounting firm. When the office manager retired, she applied for the position but wasn't even given an interview. ""I thought it was a mistake, so I asked the Director of Personnel what had happened,"" she says. ""He told me I didn't fit the image of an office manager. He suggested I improve my wardrobe before applying again for promotion. I was shocked. I do a very good job, and the way I dress shouldn't make any difference.""

Movement and gestures also influence an interviewer's first impression. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian found that 7% of any message about our feelings and attitudes comes from the words we use, 38% from our voice, and a surprising 55% from our facial expressions. When our facial expressions and words send different messages, the listener will trust the non-verbal message more. So make sure your words match your body language. Mixed messages will only confuse the interviewer.

It's also important not to seem too desperate for the job or too eager to please. When Sheila Rice, a marketing specialist, applied for a promotion, her interview went so well she was offered the job on the spot. ""I was delighted,"" she recalls. ""But I reacted with too much enthusiasm. Once the boss sensed how excited I was, he knew I wasn't going to turn him down. Consequently, he offered me a lower salary than I'd hoped for. I'm sure I could have got more if I had managed to control my excitement.""

Finally, what we say and how we say it will contribute to the success of an interview. David Artesio, the manager of an employment agency, suggests that it's a good idea to learn about the company before you go for an interview. ""The annual report, for example, will tell you about areas of company involvement. Mention an area that interests you during the interview. This will give a positive note and convince others of your interest in the company."" Business consultant Marian Woodall suggests you have a few questions ready and avoid speaking in long, confused sentences. As she puts it, ""Poor communicators talk in paragraphs. Successful communicators talk in short sentences and even in highlighted points."""

**The Farmer**  
Matt Froggatt used to work as an insurance agent in London, but now he runs a sheep farm. ""After 14 years in business, the City went from being exciting to a grind—no one was having fun anymore. I hadn't planned to leave for another five or ten years, but then I was made redundant unexpectedly. The payout wasn't great, but it was enough to start the farm. My big break came when I met the head chef of a local hotel with one of the top 20 hotel restaurants in the country. By supplying them, my reputation grew, and now I also sell meat by mail order. I'm glad I'm not stuck in an office anymore, but it's surprising how little has changed: I still work 80- to 90-hour weeks and sell a product.""

**The Painter**  
Ron Ablewhite was a manager in advertising but now earns a living as an artist. ""Painting started as a hobby, but I found it more exciting than my job. Taking redundancy to become an artist seemed logical. The career counselor I spoke to was surprised because most people in their mid-forties need to get back to work quickly for financial reasons. But we married young, and our children didn't need our support. Moving to the north of England was a leap into the unknown. We left all our friends, but we've been lucky—our friendships have survived, and many visit us now.""

**The Hatmaker**  
Katherine Goodison worked as a company lawyer for five years before starting her own hat-making business in her London flat. ""Being a lawyer was fun and well-paid, but the hours were terrible. I didn't want to become a senior partner and work even more, so I left. People said I'd get bored, but that hasn't happened. The key is having deadlines. In fashion, there are always collections and seasons, so you need a strict schedule. I'm happier and less stressed now. I do miss socializing with colleagues, though. What I love about this job is being fully responsible for the product. If I do a bad job, it's on me. You care more when your name is on the promotional material.""

**The Masseur**  
Paul Drinkwater worked in finance for 16 years before becoming a masseur at the Life Centre in London. ""I started in financial markets at 22, setting up deals. I liked the adrenaline but never found the work rewarding. I almost got made redundant in 1989, but I resigned and traveled for a year to figure out what I wanted to do. I was interested in health, so I visited top gymnasiums and talked to the owners. I knew I needed qualifications to change careers, so I took massage courses. Then I got part-time work at the Life Centre. I have no regrets. I used to feel out of control, but now I have peace of mind and control over my future. That's the best part."""
FCE_6,"Text: 'Dedicated to their sports Four young sports stars talk about their lives. A Darius (runner) I've always loved sports. I tried many different ones, but I was best at football and athletics. When I was 14, I had a chance to join a professional football club, but I chose athletics instead. My biggest achievement was competing for my country in the youth team and winning a medal. Unfortunately, it didn't get much media attention, which was disappointing because I hoped for sponsorship to help with training costs. I train at home during winter and then go to Florida for three weeks before the season starts. It's fun because there are great facilities and nightlife, but I have to be disciplined. If friends invite me out before training, I have to say no. I wish I didn't have to, but dedication is important in this sport. My main goal is to compete in the next Olympics - that would be amazing. B Gabriel (surfer) The surfing community is small, so you meet the same people at competitions. Professional surfers are serious, and the best waves are often at dawn, so you have to avoid late-night parties. I don't mind that much, but I do miss sleeping in. However, it's worth it because without dedication, I wouldn't have won the National Championships last year. After a win, I celebrate with a big night out, and if there's prize money, I go somewhere nice. The sacrifices are worth it because winning the championship got me a TV show about surfing. I guess I'm a bit of a celebrity now. C Dieter (yacht racer) With five guys on a boat, we have a lot of fun. We're traditional and always celebrate a win in style. Some say we act childishly, but we don't seek media attention. Reporters often care more about our celebrations than our race results. I'm away for eight months a year, so it's nice to come home and hang out with friends who aren't in sailing. You can't focus on the sport all the time - it's not healthy. I'm known in sailing, but I've only been recognized in public a few times. I wouldn't want to be a big celebrity. I get nice letters asking for signed pictures, and I reply to all of them, even if it takes time. D Tomas (tennis player) It's great to feel the crowd's support when I walk on court. At the last tournament, it got a bit crazy with people crowding around. Still, I enjoy being recognized by fans when I'm out shopping. It has downsides, though. My last girlfriend didn't like it when I got too much attention from female fans. Tennis players travel a lot, and that's why we broke up. It was hard, but you have to make sacrifices in sports; you have to be serious and professional. It doesn't bother me much. I'm happy to focus on my game now and enjoy other things in life after I retire, which happens early in this sport.'"

FCE_20,"**Five-star luxury meets modern technology**

The five-star Merrion Hotel has just opened in Dublin. It took nearly two years to convert four large eighteenth-century houses into this hotel. This transformation allowed the hotel to install the latest technology for both staff and guests. 

General Manager Peter MacCann wants his staff to know guests by name. For other details, like guest preferences, he uses the hotel's computer system. This system, which cost £250,000, helps treat returning guests in a special way, as expected in a five-star hotel. MacCann believes the system will pay for itself over time. He is very positive about its efficiency and features. For example, if a guest requests certain music CDs during their first stay, those CDs will be ready for them on their next visit. This is possible because of the guest-history feature, where staff can record any number of preferences.

Room temperature is a common complaint among hotel guests worldwide. The Merrion has a high-tech system to control this. Guests can adjust the temperature themselves within three degrees of the normal 18°C. Additionally, the front desk can adjust each room's temperature between 14°C and 25°C.

For guests, especially business travelers, the in-room technology is very appealing. MacCann estimates that up to 65% of the hotel's business will come from this market. To meet their needs, the hotel has put a business center in each room. Each room has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that also works as a photocopier and printer, and a video-conferencing facility.

Technology changes quickly, so the hotel has prepared for future upgrades. Extra cables have been installed to handle new advancements. TVs are rented, not bought, so they can be easily replaced with newer models. DVD recorders can also be upgraded when needed.

Despite all this modern equipment, MacCann ensures that guests do not feel overwhelmed by technology. The 145 bedrooms are large, well-furnished, comfortable, and welcoming. The hotel also has a swimming pool, gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a beautiful garden.

As with all luxury hotels, the food must be excellent. Chef Patrick Guilbaud, whose Dublin restaurant already had two Michelin stars, moved his restaurant to the Merrion. This move benefits both him and the hotel. He designed a new, modern kitchen and enjoys better parking facilities. The hotel benefits by offering a popular and successful dining option without financial risks.

With advanced technology and a skilled staff, the Merrion is set to succeed."

Emma Marsden asked six women who live life to the fullest to share their secrets.

**A. Jeanette Kupfermann - Journalist and Author:**  
""I get energy from excitement and challenges. Learning new things gives me a lot of energy. Activities with rhythm, like flamenco dancing, are also energizing. Dance is expressive and uplifting. Feeling bored or that life is pointless can drain your energy. Being effective, even in small ways, boosts your energy.""

**B. Linda Kelsey - Magazine Editor:**  
""I have a lot of work, but I enjoy it, so it doesn't feel like a chore. Enjoying your work keeps you from feeling down, even if you're tired. I need a good amount of sleep to feel great. When I only get six hours, I feel sluggish. Exercise gives me energy, but finding the energy to start is hard! I do yoga once a week and try workout tapes at home. Exercise lifts my spirits. I feel low in the office between 3 and 5 PM, so I think it's good to eat something then.""

**C. Annie Nightingale - Disc Jockey:**  
""I don't rely on healthy eating for energy; it's my natural enthusiasm and positivity. I dislike negative attitudes. I believe in enjoying life and seizing the moment. Enjoyment is key. Achieving goals is important. My job is exciting, surrounded by lively young people. I love being busy and sociable. I enjoy taking photos and writing imaginary song lyrics for fun, which helps me relax during travel.""

**D. Floella Benjamin - Author and Children's TV Presenter:**  
""My energy comes from doing things I love. I believe in my work and family life, and being positive helps. Working with kids is great because they are resilient and give a lot. Energy is like a natural reaction from interacting with others. Smiling at people and getting a smile back is thrilling. I try to eat healthily and avoid smoking or drinking, but I don't have an exercise routine. My exercise is playing with kids.""

**E. Deborah Moggach - Author and Playwright:**  
""I love turning wasteland into a garden. I once transformed a concrete area by breaking it up and adding soil. It was more satisfying than workouts or tennis. Knowing someone wants to read my writing gives me energy. I find it hard to write without an audience. I also enjoy exploring private lands like a child, even if I get caught.""

**F. Katherine Monblot - Therapist:**  
""You need to respect and be interested in what you do. I like taking risks and get bored easily, which keeps me motivated. Doing things you dislike drains your energy. I used to be on committees and disliked the time they took. You have limited energy, so focus it on what matters most to you."""
FCE_45,"Ice skating has been around for thousands of years. Archaeologists found skates made from animal bones. These bone skates were used until iron was introduced in Scandinavia around 200 AD. In Scandinavia, the upper classes considered skating an important skill. In the early 1900s, skating was elegant and reserved. However, at the 1924 Winter Olympics, 11-year-old Sonja Henie brought a more athletic style, making skating more popular. Today, skating combines art and athletics, making it both graceful and physically challenging.

For beginners, balance and control are crucial, and speed comes with practice. Your body position is important for balance. Keep your legs slightly bent and knees bent to center your weight, leaning slightly forward. Relaxation is key in skating. To start, your heels should almost touch, and your feet should point outwards. Push forward with your back foot and make a small movement with the other foot. It seems simple, right? As you practice, you can gradually make longer movements.

Learning how to fall is one of the first skills for skaters. Even professionals fall. To avoid injury, try to stay relaxed when you fall, which reduces the impact. To get up, use your hands to kneel, then stand. Once you feel confident on the ice, you can try different styles like figure skating, freestyle, distance, speed, and pair skating. The best way to start is by learning figure skating and then basic freestyle. Most ice rinks offer guidance to help you learn basic figures, and soon you can try turns, jumps, and spins.

Good skaters look relaxed and move easily. To achieve this, you should regularly do exercises. Skating with a stiff body can be dangerous, so warm-up exercises for the legs, back, and shoulders are important, especially for the ankles and knees. After skating, do the same exercises to prevent stiffness. Skating improves balance, coordination, relaxation, and movement. It also benefits heart and lung health and strengthens the body. Combined with swimming or jogging, it offers a great fitness program."

Seeing a talented child win a medal can be very emotional. Julia Gregson spoke with three young stars and their mothers about the joys and challenges they face.

**A. Annika Reeder, 15,** won a gold medal in gymnastics at the Commonwealth Games. She dreams of becoming a physiotherapist and competing in the next Olympics. ""The work is really tough right now. I don't have time to watch TV, hang out with friends, or do much besides gymnastics and school. I try to focus on each day. When I'm extremely tired, my coach might give me a day off, but usually, I keep going. You can't take too many days off, or you'll get stiff.""

**B. Annika's mother** says, ""Annika showed great potential from a young age. I've seen parents push their kids, but it doesn't work. Performing at Annika's level requires a lot of time and energy, and you have to want it yourself. People often say we've sacrificed a lot, but they don't see what the sport has given us. We love it and what it's done for Annika. Before gymnastics, she was a shy girl who sucked her thumb and hid behind me. Now, she's met people worldwide and gained confidence from her success.""

**C. Sarah Stokes** started show-jumping at ten and has since won the British National Championship. ""It's good my parents like show-jumping because they train me and take me everywhere in the horse box. Shows last from one to five days. I never get tired of it—I love the excitement and fun. Even without my parents, I'd do it because I'm determined. I'm glad they're happy when I win, but I'm not doing it for them. My goal this year is to qualify for the British young riders (under-18) team. My big dream is to win an Olympic gold medal.""

**D. Sarah's mother** says, ""Sarah's passion for horses started when she was 1. At 5, she would get up early to exercise her pony. To qualify for major shows, you have to compete all over England. To save money, we sleep in the horse box's living area. Sarah is well-organized and happiest on a horse. Watching your child succeed at something they love is unbeatable.""

**E. Jane McShane, 10,** is Britain's Under-14 Chess Champion. ""Tournaments are really friendly. I know everyone, and it's fun. When I play, I don't concentrate much. I should, but I just look around and don't think too hard. I'm not worried about getting arrogant; I don't talk about my success at school. I don't like feeling embarrassed.""

FCE_29,"Text: 'It's true - we're all getting taller Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy after school. The teacher joked, 'What do you want to be, the flagpole on a ship?' because Chris was already almost two meters tall at that age. Today, at 228 cm, he is Britain's tallest man. Every decade, the average height of people in Europe increases by about a centimeter. More and more very tall people are being born each year. Interestingly, this doesn't mean we're creating a new super race. Instead, we're returning to our original size from the time of the cavemen. We're now overcoming the effects of generations of poor diets, which is having a big impact. 'We are only now beginning to reach our true potential,' says palaeontologist Professor Chris Stringer. 'We are becoming like the Cro-Magnons again - the people who lived on this planet 40,000 years ago.' For most of human history, our ancestors ate a wide variety of foods: women gathered herbs, fruits, and berries, while men hunted animals occasionally. This lifestyle is still followed by the few remaining hunter-gatherer tribes. One study found that they ate 85 different wild plants. Then, about 9,000 years ago, agriculture was invented, which had serious consequences. Most green areas on the planet were taken over by farmers, and now just three carbohydrate-rich plants - wheat, rice, and maize - provide more than half of the calories consumed by humans today. This poor diet has negatively affected human health and physique. Over the centuries, we have eaten soups, porridges, and breads that left us underfed and underdeveloped. In one study in Ohio, scientists found that when people started growing corn, healthy hunter-gatherers became sickly, underweight farmers. Tooth decay and diseases increased. Corn, once thought to be a blessing of the New World, was actually a public health disaster, according to some anthropologists. Despite this, agriculture spread because farmed land could support ten times more people than hunter-gatherer land. The fact that most people relying on this system are poorly nourished and stunted has only recently been addressed, even by wealthier nations. Only in Europe, the US, and Japan are diets now reflecting the variety of our ancestors' diets. As a result, the average man in the US is now 179 cm, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm. This is a positive trend, but it comes with its own challenges. Heights have increased, but the world hasn't adapted. Standard bed lengths have stayed at 190 cm since 1860. Even worse, legroom in planes and trains seems to have decreased, and clothing manufacturers constantly have to update their product ranges. The question is: where will it all end? We can't keep growing forever. There must be a natural limit. But what is it? According to Robert Fogel, from the University, it could be as much as 193 cm, and we might reach it this century. However, scientists add a note of caution. Individuals may be growing taller due to better nutrition, but as a species, we are actually getting smaller. During the last ice age, 10,000 years ago, humans were slightly rounder and taller as an evolutionary response to the cold. (Large, round bodies retain heat better.) Since the climate warmed, we have become slightly thinner and smaller, even with proper nutrition. As the planet continues to heat up, we may shrink even more. In other words, the growth of human beings could be countered by global warming.'"
FCE_57,"Text: 'Studio Audiences What's it like to be in the audience when a television show is being filmed? Cosmo Landesman found out. Like technical issues, studio audiences are a common part of TV life, yet they remain a mystery to many of us. Watching them get excited on game shows, we wonder - who are these people? Among all live entertainment audiences, studio audiences are often seen as the least prestigious. I've heard that even TV professionals look down on them - one cameraman even compared them to cattle. I used to think studio audiences were just people eager for a brief moment of fame. But there's no typical studio audience. They come from all walks of life, professions, and income levels. TV shows try to attract different types of people for different programs. Those of us who prefer watching TV at home can't understand why anyone would go to a studio. Why apply for tickets, travel far, and endure hours of boredom in an uncomfortable studio just to watch something you can see at home? One idea is that people hope to appear on TV for a moment. I didn't believe this until I spoke to Angela: 'Why did she come?' It was a chance to be on TV.' Another idea is that people are curious to see behind the scenes. But the most common reason I heard was simply 'a friend gave me a ticket'. Few of us have been in a studio audience, yet we think we know what it's like. You sit there, squeezed among strangers, while someone holds up signs saying APPLAUD or LAUGH - and you clap or laugh as instructed. This might be true for some shows, but not all. As one studio manager says, 'We always hope a show will be good enough not to need these signs.' But is there any real difference between being in a studio and watching TV at home? For Claire, sitting in a studio is 'more exciting', while Charlotte enjoyed feeling involved with live TV. 'Last year I saw my favorite comedian. When you watch him on TV at home, you miss a lot.' What I missed was seeing live actors - from my seat, all I saw was the back of someone's head. The opening scenes were filmed so far away that I ended up watching the show on a studio monitor. Going to a studio might be a bad way to watch TV, but that's not the point. For most of the audience, it was simply fun and a free night of entertainment.'"

I prefer places where nature and human elements mix. When I travel, I like visiting charming villages with old temples rather than empty deserts. At eight, I went to school in England and would cycle to the village of Lastingham on Saturdays. Cycling was my escape from school. I enjoyed exploring the hilltops, valleys, and old villages. Being from Scotland, the landscape felt both familiar and different to me, and I still visit today. I used to write about my adventures in a diary, which was my first step into travel writing, a field where I later became well-known.

**Sophia**  
There is a small railway from Hythe to Dungeness, run by enthusiasts. I always travel first class because it's only a little more expensive. The scenery isn't spectacular; the train goes through Romney Marsh with sheep and a canal. But I love when the train passes through back gardens. For a moment, we can see people in their daily lives, like making tea or doing dishes. I see myself as a woman in a tiny train, looking into others' homes. The ordinary landscape attracts me—just fields, sheep, and a distant grey sea. It makes me look closer to find something that opens my eyes.

The Hartland Peninsula is a beautiful, remote coast. The beaches are hard to reach and rocky, so there aren't many people. Some brave surfers come, but most visitors enjoy the sea's majesty. The coast faces the Atlantic and is known for shipwrecks. There are coastal walks you can combine with trips inland through valleys full of oak trees, ferns, and wildflowers. We stay in simple self-catering accommodation with a family in the village of Southole.

My favorite place in England is the Trough of Bowland, a wide-open moorland perfect for hiking. There aren't many people living or visiting there. It's a hidden, empty, and remote area, and I love the feeling of space. I found it by chance as a student and have visited every year since, sometimes alone, with my boyfriend, and now with my son. It hasn't changed much since my first visit. Having a child makes these visits more special. It saddens me that he's growing up in a city.

I bought Glenthorne, my favorite house in Britain, to find peace and reconnect with my English roots. I grew up in Sri Lanka but went to school in Devon, England, at twelve. I used to cycle around the moors and village backstreets. We had a story about a place we never cycled past: if you went down the driveway, you'd never return. That place was Glenthorne. It's my dream place—a magical, secluded, romantic house where you only hear the sea, wind, and birds."
FCE_42,"Title: A Day of Animal Chaos

We're a family that loves animals and enjoys having them around. One afternoon, my daughter called me at work, excited because she found a pine snake. She asked if we could keep it, and I agreed, but only for one night. We had a special tank for temporary animal guests, and we liked to admire them and learn about them from our natural history book.

I got home late and started cooking when I heard my sons shouting for help from their bedroom. I rushed in to find our cat, Domino, with a white mouse in his mouth. The mouse was a Mother's Day gift for me. Domino was running around the room, trying to escape with his catch, while the kids were waving their arms to stop him. I joined the chaos and accidentally tripped, landing on the floor.

As I lay there, I noticed the snake was escaping from its tank. It was slithering off the table and onto the floor. The room was a mess of screaming kids, a barking dog, and the snake striking at everything. I quickly turned off the boiling pot in the kitchen and returned to the chaos. I managed to grab Domino by the tail and rescued the mouse, which was unharmed. Interestingly, this mouse was caught by Domino three more times but lived to old age.

Feeling confident after saving the mouse, I turned my attention to the snake. It didn't have any obvious weak points, so I sat on the floor like a snake charmer, trying to calm it down. Eventually, the snake relaxed, and I carefully picked it up. I took it to the end of the garden, hoping it would choose to live in the garden shed. But when I let go of its head, it wrapped around my shoulders like a shawl, seeming to settle in for the winter.

We stood there, my four children, the snake, and I, in the evening light. My eldest, DJ, explained why the snake stayed with me: ""You're nice and warm, and the shed isn't."" We gently encouraged the snake to move on, and it slowly climbed up the wall and disappeared over the roof. As the last bit of its tail vanished, my three-year-old, Clay, summed it up for all of us: ""Boy, that was one big snake!"""

However, for me, receiving a letter is special in a way that no other form of communication can match. There's the excitement when it arrives, the pleasure of seeing who it's from, and finally, the enjoyment of reading it. Letter writing has been part of my life for as long as I can remember. It probably started with the little notes I would write to my mother. She always made sure I wrote my own thank-you letters for Christmas and birthday presents. It didn't matter how short or messy they were, as long as they were letters. When I left home at 18 to study medicine in London, I would write once a week, and so would my mother. Sometimes my father would write, and it was always a joy to receive his long, funny letters. Most letters from home were about everyday events involving my parents and their friends. Of course, we also made phone calls, but it's the letters I remember most. There were also letters from my boyfriends. When I was young, I often dated people who had to work or study far away, so we stayed in touch by writing letters. Instead of hurting the relationships, letter writing seemed to make them better. I found that I could often express myself more easily in writing than by talking. I love the letters that come with birthday or Christmas cards. Notes are nice, but it's even better to have a year's worth of news! And it's even more exciting when it's an airmail envelope with beautiful stamps. My overseas letters come from Mangala in Sri Lanka, someone I trained with over 20 years ago. I also have a penfriend in Australia and another in Vancouver. Then there's the lady who writes to me from France. If we hadn't started talking in a restaurant on the way home from holiday, if my husband hadn't taken her photo, and if I hadn't asked for her address, I would never have been able to write to her. More importantly, if she hadn't replied, we would have missed out on a great friendship. Now, we regularly write to each other. I can improve my French (she doesn't speak English); we have stayed at her home twice, and she has stayed with us. My biggest letter-writing success came this summer when my family and I stayed with my American penfriend in Texas. We had been writing to each other for 29 years but had never met. Everyone was amazed that a correspondence could last so long. The local newspaper even thought it was worth reporting on the front page. I am happy that my children are continuing the tradition. Like my mother, I insist they write their own thank-you letters. My daughter writes me little letters, just as I did to my mother. She and my son have penfriends of their own in Texas, arranged by my penfriend. I strongly encourage readers not to let letter writing become a 'lost art'.'"
FCE_54,"Title: 'Careless Tourists Damage Ancient Alpine Rock Art'

In the French Alps, at Mont Bego, there are tens of thousands of ancient rock carvings that are being damaged. These 36,000 drawings, which are about 4,000 years old, include images of cows, fields, and gods. The site was once a place for prayer and worship. However, as more tourists visit, the carvings are being harmed by graffiti and careless actions.

Jean Clottes, who leads the International Committee on Rock Art, warns that if the damage continues, the drawings might not last another 50 years. He has seen tourists walking on the carvings, which wears them down, and some even take pieces home as souvenirs. When visitors can't take clear photos, they rub the drawings to make them more visible, which further damages them. Some people even scratch their own drawings or names into the rocks.

Experts disagree on how to protect the site. Henry de Lumley, from the Museum of Natural History in Paris, suggests closing the mountain to the public, except for guided tours. He believes this is the only way to save the site and allow research to continue. However, Clottes thinks this approach is too extreme and would upset local residents. He emphasizes the importance of preserving the site, which is classified as a historic monument.

David Lavergne, a regional architect, also opposes closing the site. He suggests allowing people to visit but acknowledges the challenge of preventing damage due to the site's large size. He mentions the lack of funds to hire enough guards and considers charging an entry fee as a possible solution, since government funding is unlikely.

Annie Echassoux, a researcher in Nice, is concerned that easier access to the mountain, such as by hiring vehicles, will lead to more damage. She believes the area should be roped off and guided tours provided. She insists that financial constraints should not stop efforts to protect the site, as it is a historic area. If no action is taken, future generations may lose these valuable drawings."
FCE_32,"Shopping with children can be very challenging for parents. One mother describes it as ""absolute murder"" because her kids want everything they see, like sugary cereals, Disney videos, or comics. She can't afford all these things and feels guilty when she gives in to their demands. She also feels bad for saying no all the time and gets stressed before even leaving the house. She tries to avoid taking them shopping but worries they won't learn how to make their own choices. 

Research shows that children ask for something every two minutes during a supermarket trip. Over £150 million is spent each year on advertising aimed directly at children, mostly on TV. This amount is expected to grow, and supermarkets are where this advertising is most effective. Kids often don't understand why their parents can't buy everything they want, and arguments about health don't seem convincing compared to the appealing ads they see.

Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says most parents care about what their kids eat and have ideas about healthy food, though these ideas aren't always correct. It's good for parents and children to talk about food because if kids only learn from TV ads, they get a biased view. Parents feel frustrated because they have to compete with advertisers and often end up disappointing their children.

The Independent Television Commission, which oversees TV ads, doesn't allow advertisers to tell kids to ask their parents to buy things. However, as Dibb notes, the goal of advertising is to persuade people to buy, so the effect is the same.

Deciding which of their children's requests to agree to or refuse is a major source of stress for parents. One mother says she discusses food with her kids and has taught her son to be critical of ads. They now have fewer conflicts in the supermarket because her children don't ask for things she won't buy.

Parents admit they are sometimes inconsistent in their responses. Mike, a father of two, says he refuses to buy sweets for his kids because they're unhealthy, even while buying treats for himself. He finds it hard to be consistent and says his decisions depend on his mood.

Supermarkets could help reduce conflicts by removing sweets from checkout areas or offering supervised play areas for kids. Although parents might spend less without their children, the idea of shopping without their demands could attract more customers."
FCE_65,"Text: 'Climbing Walls: A New Era Once, climbers only went to mountains. Now, challenging climbs can happen anywhere, indoors or outdoors. The crowd watches closely. High above them on the climbing wall, hanging upside down by just two fingers, is French climber Francois Lombard. He is competing in the World Cup Climbing Championships at Birmingham's National Indoor Arena. This arena is more known for the TV show Gladiators, but both events have one thing in common - The Wall. This is possible because of new and fast-developing technology. Before the mid-1960s, climbers practiced on cliffs where there were good climbing spots. In winter, they either braved the cold, went walking, or climbed snow and ice in Scotland. As climbing grew, it became important for top climbers to stay fit. With cliffs unusable for much of the year, they used brick edges or stone buildings to train. This kept their fingers strong and helped them avoid boredom. Soon, many sports centers started building walls for climbing, using bricks with special edges to grip. Many of these early walls were inspired by Don Robinson, a physical education teacher who, in the mid-1960s, built a climbing wall in a corridor at Leeds University. Robinson had the idea of setting natural rock in concrete blocks, which could be part of a wall. Many climbing walls like this were built in sports halls across the country in the 1970s, but they had design issues. Walls could only be vertical, while real cliffs have features like overhangs and angled slabs. Another problem was that once built, the walls couldn't be changed, and climbers would get bored with the same holds. In 1985, a Frenchman, Francois Savigny, created a material that he shaped into forms like those on cliffs. These could be attached to any wall and removed when climbers wanted a new challenge. French companies also started using panels on steel frames. Concrete was too heavy for overhanging walls without major construction, but steel frames could be set up anywhere as free-standing structures. A system of interchangeable fixtures gave climbers endless new holds.'"

There are more actors than there are jobs for them. When you decide to become an actor, some friends might say you're crazy, while others might react differently. Everyone will give you different advice. But it's a personal choice, and only you can take responsibility for your dream. There are no easy paths - no exams to pass, and no guarantee that after training, you will succeed. It's about luck and talent. However, there is a need for new faces and talent, and acting can be exciting and glamorous, with the chance of big rewards. People often ask what talent is. I think it's natural skill plus imagination, which is hard to measure. It also involves courage and belief in what you're doing. Why do people want to act? It's hard to explain. In theatre, it's about the moment of connection between the actor and the audience. This connection is what drives actors. If you ask successful actors how they made it, they might just shrug. They know some things about themselves and their techniques, but they don't take success for granted. They know they are only as good as their current job, and fame might not last. Disappointment is an actor's biggest enemy. Last month, you might have been out of work, doing other jobs. Then suddenly, you get an audition, but you might not get the part, no matter how much you want it. So, actors often don't talk about their chances. They find ways to handle the stress of auditions and possible rejection. Nobody likes being rejected. And remember, rejection is possible from the moment you start auditioning. You are saying you are available, willing, and hopefully talented enough for the job. It's up to you, because if you don't care enough, no one else will.'"

FCE_5,"Two brothers are turning their childhood game into a successful business. Dave and Norm Lagasse, both in their forties, are sitting in their home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, playing pichenotte, a game they learned from their grandfather, Lucien Rajotte. Lucien, originally from Quebec, Canada, brought the game to the USA. The family played it often, especially on weekends and holidays, and continued to do so after moving to New Mexico. The game was unknown in the southern USA, so visitors were often intrigued by it.

Three years ago, Dave noticed their old pichenotte board was worn out and decided to make a new one. The new board was impressive, and soon relatives and friends wanted their own. Curious about the game's appeal, the brothers took a board to a sports bar in Santa Fe. At first, people were hesitant to play, but once they tried it, they couldn't stop. This sparked interest in the game's origins, and Dave discovered it likely started in India as 'carroms', evolved into 'squails' in Britain, and was brought to Canada by British immigrants. The French-Canadian version is called pichenotte.

Pichenotte is a skill-based game for two to four players. Each player has 12 pieces, or 'pucks', which they flick across a board using their fingers. Points are scored by flicking pucks into a hole or onto concentric rings around it. The game is quick, usually lasting two minutes.

Seeing the game's popularity at the bar, the Lagasse brothers made more boards and sold them at markets and craft fairs. The game became so popular that championships were organized, and a trophy called the 'Lord Pichenotte Cup' was created. As demand grew, the brothers decided to make pichenotte boards full-time. They set up a workshop in their garage and have made over 450 boards so far. Each board is made of birchwood and mahogany, weighs 12kg, and is 1cm thick. They sell for $595 on the brothers' website.

There are no professional pichenotte players or TV coverage yet, but the brothers hope their business will continue to grow. They dream of one day replacing their workshop with a luxury car, but for now, they enjoy playing the game that might make them rich."
FCE_41,"**WELCOME TO THE MODEL VILLAGE**

When you first enter the Model Village, it's hard to believe that just a few years ago, this area was a piece of unused land, flat and covered with brambles. For years, it was seen as worthless. However, with careful planning and hard work, one man, with the constant support of his wife, transformed this land into the beautiful place you see today. During the construction, many thousands of tons of soil and clay were moved to create the landscape. Bulldozers and digging machines helped, but a lot of hard work was also needed. Once the land was shaped, about 1,000 tonnes of topsoil were added to create the lawns, flower beds, and rock gardens.

Hundreds of trees and shrubs were planted in the Model Village. These plants had to be chosen carefully because they needed to survive the salty air near the sea and the strong winter winds. Most plants came from local garden centers, but some were brought from as far as Canada and New Zealand.

The whole village was the idea of Colin Sims, who made over 100 models by himself over nine years, starting from when the village first opened in 1972. The models are made from different materials like stone, concrete, specially treated wood, and plastics to withstand all kinds of weather. At first, Colin needed help from experts to understand how different materials would last in changing weather, but he soon became an expert himself. You will notice that the models are all made to the same scale, with great attention to detail. This was achieved through patience and unique construction techniques.

The Model Village is a popular attraction, known for its high-quality workmanship and maintenance. The techniques used here have been applied in other model villages in England and are even taught in some college courses. The model buildings show traditional British architectural styles but are not based on any specific place or structure. One of the most impressive buildings is the Manor House, a typical 13th-century stone structure with a brick tower and stone walls, inspired by manor houses in the West Country. As you walk around, you will also see the Castle, St Mary's Church, a zoo, and a mini golf course, which is the newest addition.

We ask you to stay on the paths during your visit and not to touch the models, as any damage can take hours to repair. Photography is allowed from the paths only. Dogs are welcome if they are on a short lead. To enhance your experience, you will find buttons in front of some working models. Press these to see the models in action.

At the end of your visit, we would love to hear your feedback. We are always planning new models, and your ideas can help us create a more varied and interesting display. We also want to know if any models did not meet the high standards of the rest of the village, as we are constantly updating and replacing them. We hope you enjoy your visit and look forward to seeing you again. Don't forget to tell your friends about us."
FCE_69,"Week after week, British tabloid newspapers publish photos that invade people's privacy and break the editors' code of practice. Although pop stars sometimes pose for paparazzi, this is not common. Usually, these photos cause great harm to public figures when their private moments appear on the front page. However, very few people use the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), an organization set up to handle such issues. These pictures are rarely in the public interest. Do intimate photos of pop stars help solve crimes? How did a picture of a famous actress on a hotel balcony protect public health and safety? The actress has previously complained about long-lens photos, and since she was in a hotel, where privacy is expected, she had a good reason to complain, but she didn't take action. It's scandalous that the PCC didn't investigate on its own. It should also look into the recent outrageous story about a pop star's love life. Like the actress, the pop star hasn't made a formal complaint. Shouldn't the PCC take the lead on these and other shameful attacks? Initially, this seems like a good idea. It would likely result in many decisions against newspapers, reported by their competitors and on TV and radio. The public wouldn't support the newspapers, and editors would have to stop publishing such material. Even photographers would be affected, as it wouldn't be financially viable to wait for unsuspecting celebrities. If the PCC decided to act as a 'police officer', which it technically could, there would be several challenges. How would it decide to start an inquiry? Should it encourage the victim to complain? And if the person still refused, should it continue anyway? Celebrities and royalty might expect any story about them to be investigated and be upset if it wasn't. Above all, the role is too large. How could the PCC realistically monitor all British press: national, regional, and magazines? Then there's the embarrassment factor. No matter how seriously someone's privacy is invaded, would they want the further embarrassment of an investigation? Most people likely want to move on with their lives. Some may have other reasons for staying quiet. A worse story might exist that they have kept from the press, and they fear it could become public if they complain. In other words, even the PCC might become the enemy. A British comedian also suffered from the press when he and his wife were secretly photographed on their honeymoon in the Caribbean. He didn't complain then, nor recently, when his family was again photographed during a holiday. He feared that the newspaper, News of the World, would re-run the pictures with a new story about his 'anger', claiming it was just a joke and that, as a comedian, he should have a sense of humor. This fear is understandable. People believe they will become targets again if they challenge the tabloids. It's hard to find an easy solution to this serious problem."
FCE_38,"Many people give advice to college graduates starting their first job. This article focuses on moving to a second job. We are not talking about those looking for another temporary job while searching for a permanent one, or those leaving a bad job after just a few weeks. Instead, we are discussing those who are taking a significant step in their career, choosing a job that matches their goals now that they have some experience, skills, and a clearer idea of their career path. 

What kind of job should you look for? It depends on your long-term goals. Ask yourself if you want to specialize in a specific area, move up to higher responsibilities, or switch to a broader field. Whatever you decide, choose your second job carefully. Plan to stay in it for two to three years. This job will be important when you apply for your next one. It should show that you are serious about your career. Most importantly, it should challenge you, help you grow, and give you more responsibility.

If you feel like traveling, now is a good time to do it. You can do temporary work when you return and then find your second job. Future employers will be glad to see that you have traveled and are ready to focus on your career.

Juliette Davidson spent her first year after leaving St. Aldate's College working for three lawyers. It was a great first job because they were supportive, and she learned office skills and improved her word processing. However, there was no room for growth. So, she quit, bought a plane ticket, and traveled for a year. Now, Juliette works as a Personal Assistant to Brenda Cleverdon, the Chief Executive of Business in the Community. In two and a half years, she has become more capable, and her job has expanded. Her boss wanted to help her develop from the start. Although her job title is the same, her duties have changed. She has moved from mainly typing and phone work to handling most of the correspondence and budgets. She also deals with various inquiries, from company chairmen to people wanting to start their own business.

FCE_17,"Confident people: What's their secret? Confident people might seem like they were always confident, but most of them have learned this skill because they needed to. Nina Hathway talks to five people about how they became confident.

A. Jenny: When I finished school, I was very shy and thought I would always be that way. At 25, I was asked to help at my daughter's school. I didn't think I could do it, but I did well. Someone suggested I take a university course. I was very nervous on my first day, but my confidence grew, and I became more outgoing. Working at the school was a turning point in my life.

B. Michaela: Four years ago, my father got sick, and I had to take over the family business. I was scared and became too aggressive, thinking that's how confident people acted. But I learned that confidence is about believing in yourself. If work gets too hard, I don't feel guilty about leaving some tasks for the next day. When faced with something difficult, I remind myself I have nothing to lose. Fear makes you lose confidence, so I talk to myself to overcome those fears.

C. Lisa: People think I'm confident, but the calmer I look, the more scared I am. In TV, looking confident is crucial. Interviewing people taught me that everyone gets nervous in important situations, and we feel better when talking to someone friendly. My mom once told me, 'Who's looking at you? Everyone's worried about themselves.' That's good advice. You gain confidence by facing your fears. I was nervous during my driving test, but I passed. After that, I felt I wouldn't be that scared again.

D. Barbara: My confidence comes from enjoying my work, but I've built it over the years. By doing my job and learning from mistakes, I become more confident. I'm popular at the restaurant, but not everyone likes me, and that's okay. You have to like yourself for who you are. My company offers training courses that boost my self-esteem. They also encourage setting achievable goals. It's better to see real progress than aim too high and achieve nothing.

E. Kim: After college, I worked as a secretary and was too scared to speak up in meetings. Eventually, I found the confidence to share my opinions. When I started in politics, I had never spoken in public and was very nervous. I told myself, 'People do this every day, so you can too.' Writing down a few notes helped me feel more secure. Everyone gets nervous about public speaking. The key to confidence is telling yourself, 'Nothing is impossible.'"
FCE_47,"Text: 'Visit to Malaysia Paul Forster attends a kite-flying festival and spends a night in the forest. Adnan Ali smiled widely when I gave him his torn kite. 'You should keep it,' he said, 'it's a tradition - if the line breaks, the finder keeps it ... and I have many more.' He pointed to a pile of beautifully decorated kites at his feet. Each kite was exactly 120cm wide and long, made of tissue paper and split bamboo. We sat next to them under the shade of the whispering conifer trees behind the Beach of the Seven Lagoons in Kelantan, and watched Malaysia's biggest and most serious kite festival. In the middle of the beach were 10 platforms, where helpers held up the kites, and a line of nervous competitors held their kite strings, waiting for the countdown. When the whistle blew, the crowd cheered and the kites shot up into the sky like rockets. Over 500 men and boys had signed up for the competition, which lasts five days every year. Each participant entered four different kite designs, judged on decoration, stability in the air, and flying efficiency. 'Flying kites isn't hard,' said Adnan, 'but making them requires real skill. Visit me at home and I'll show you how it's done.' I received five such invitations that day and decided to accept his. At his house, I drank cold milky tea and ate fish crackers in a large polished room. As night approached, he invited me to return the next day to help rebuild his kite, but my plans didn't allow it. Instead, I explored the southern part of the state, driving towards Kuala Lumpur, into granite mountains covered with lush rainforest. I took a wrong turn, and the smooth road suddenly ended at a river. A narrow boat was there to ferry people across. Nearby, a small sign caught my attention. It pointed up a path into the forest and read: 'Jelawang Jungle 3 km.' It would have been helpful to know that most of this distance was uphill, steep, and slippery. When I reached the path, I found a man waiting with a flask of tea. This was Baba, who managed a tented kitchen and several bamboo huts. I decided to stay there, trying not to think about insects crawling under my thin foam mattress. The night was completely dark, filled with various sounds. A waterfall roared nearby, and thousands of creatures moved and squeaked. In the morning, there was an amazing view over five ranges of green mountains. In the afternoon, it rained. First, the wind blew, then lightning struck the treetops. Seconds later, I was soaked. Sliding downhill, I wondered how the giant butterflies avoided the huge raindrops. I also worried about my car being swept away (it sometimes happens) and the risk of drowning if I opened my mouth. Luckily, the car was still there, covered in mud, at the bottom of the path. In Kota Bahru, Kelantan's capital, everyone asked me questions: 'Where are you from?' 'How old are you?' But they were only being friendly. Kelantan might be famous for its kites, but I remember it more for its people's kindness.'"

Abby Edwards asked some people ... A. Melanie, 22, dancer I'm a shopping addict - I can't spend enough money! When I have cash, I'm out shopping, and it keeps me happy. I find it hard to ignore sale signs. My boyfriend is just like me, so we often shop together. We're an addicted couple! B. Brenda, 40, office manager I'm a reluctant shopper. My husband does most of the food shopping because he cooks and knows what he wants. I don't spend much time shopping for clothes. I take my 6-year-old son and 14-year-old daughter to buy clothes, but I don't enjoy it because we all have different tastes. I don't spend money on myself often, so when I do, I feel guilty and rarely tell my husband the real amount - I always say it cost less! The real price always sounds too high. C. Juliet, 28, personnel manager I only shop for essentials. I hate shopping and only go when I really have to. When I do, I know exactly what I want and won't settle for anything else. I find shopping tiring and there's always something else I'd rather do. D. Anita, 35, TV producer I like to look around sometimes, but I usually know what I want and where to find it. I don't waste time and get in and out quickly. I do have some mistakes hidden in my wardrobe, so maybe I'm a careful shopper who sometimes makes wrong choices! E. Lizzie, 41, secretary I don't enjoy shopping at all. I really dislike shopping for clothes because I can never find what I want or anyone to help me. The shops are too noisy and disorganized, and I find it a nightmare. Luckily, I rarely have to shop for clothes because most of my clothes are gifts. For food shopping, I go to the local supermarket once a week and finish it quickly! F. Lisa, 22, actress I'm probably a happy shopper. Sometimes I go out to look around the shops with my friends, and we often end up buying things. I don't usually have a specific item in mind, but if something catches my eye, I'll buy it. G. Suki, 26, art gallery assistant I'm a careful shopper - I like going, but I don't buy much. I usually know what I want and rarely go overboard. Sometimes I shop to cheer myself up, but I often feel worse because I've spent too much! H. Ann-Marie, 29, nursery worker I love shopping, but only on certain days and never on Saturdays because it's too busy. I'd say I'm a careful shopper. I always have a good idea of what I want and never buy things immediately. I check other shops to find a better deal - it takes me a long time! I. Linda, 32, restaurant manager I'm an unwilling shopper. Maybe because I work in the city center, the shops have lost their appeal for me. When I have to shop, I drag myself out, but I don't try things on because it's too much trouble. Clothes I buy don't always fit, but I don't mind too much.

**Easter Quiz for Children**  
During the Easter holidays, young visitors can join a quiz about ""Surprises."" You can get the free quiz sheets at the Orange Street entrance. Children will explore 14 surprising paintings and answer questions about them. The quiz is available during normal gallery hours from 25 March to 9 April.

**New Picture**  
The Gallery has a new still life painting by Dutch 18th-century artist Jan van Os. This large painting (89.1 cm x 71 cm) shows flowers and fruit in bright colors on wood. It is one of the first of its kind in the Gallery. The painting is signed and dated 1777 and 1778 because the artist painted flowers as they bloomed in different seasons. Miss Violet Churchman donated it in memory of her sister Ida Nancy. You can see it in Room 25.

**Special Exhibition**  
The exhibition ""Painting in Spain during the late 18th century"" started in the Sunley Room on 15 March. The Gallery recently bought works by three Spanish painters from this time: Paret, Melendez, and Francisco Bayeu. The exhibition also features Francisco's brother Ramon, Antonio Gonzalez, and two Italians who worked in Spain, Corrado Giaquinto and Giovanni Battista Tiepolo. The exhibition runs until 31 May.

**Lecture News**  
A series of lectures related to the special exhibition happens every Wednesday. On 5 April, Lizzie Barker will discuss Melendez's work. On 12 April, Sarah Symmons will talk about Luis Paret. On 19 and 26 April, Juliet Wilson will focus on Francisco Bayeu. On Tuesdays in April, Erika Langmuir will explain how artists tell stories through their paintings.

The teachers make us laugh, especially when we sit down with them to eat the food we've made.' Flora, who is twelve, is having trouble with onions. 'I love cooking. I made a meal for ten friends, and they really liked it. Then my mum suggested I take up a hobby instead of doing nothing at weekends. I was happy staying at home, so I wasn't too interested at first. But I'm really glad I decided to come.' Their teacher, Philippe, says, 'It's great fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, although the kitchen isn't always tidy when they're cooking! As adults, we're always learning more about food. If parents get their children interested in cooking while they are young, they'll have enough skills to cook for themselves when they leave home.''"

PET_21,"Text: 'MONEY What is money? The pound, the dollar, or the franc are like units of measurement, such as a gram or a kilometre. The difference is that you can use money to buy things. For example, a five-pound note can buy a book, a big bag of sweets, or a couple of cinema tickets. But the note itself is just a piece of paper that costs very little to produce. Thousands of years ago, people didn't have money like we do now. There were no banks or shops. Back then, a farmer like Mr. Green would trade the corn he grew for Mr. Hive's honey. This was a direct exchange between two people, each having something the other wanted. Over time, most societies created their own 'currencies' to make trading easier. These different currencies started to connect, which is why today everyone uses a national currency.'"

PET_27,"Grass is one of the most successful plants in the world. There are over 9,000 different types of grass, and they can be found everywhere on Earth. Grass is the only flowering plant that can survive in the cold environments of the Arctic and Antarctic. Grasslands are home to many animals, from small insects and birds to large animals like cows and lions. All these animals rely on grass in some way. Grass can quickly recover after being cut or damaged. Unlike other plants, new grass leaves grow from below the soil, not from the top. This allows large groups of animals to live in one area because, after they eat the grass, it starts to grow back quickly, providing a fresh meal."

Since she was a child, she enjoyed drawing clothes and creating patterns. However, she never told her parents, who own a supermarket, that she wanted to make fashion her career. She thought they wanted her to choose a more traditional job, so she studied management at university. After graduating, she moved to London and worked at an advertising agency. She had to attend industry events but couldn't afford the designer clothes she liked, so she started making her own skirts and tops. Her friends loved her clothes and asked her to make some for them too. She then found a small shop in London that agreed to sell her designs on a sale-or-return basis. Her clothes sold well, and nothing was returned. This success encouraged her to leave her advertising job, take out a £20,000 loan, and start her own womenswear label. Kal's parents were supportive of her career change, which made her happy. Now, her clothes are sold in over 70 stores, and her business earns over £500,000.

PET_49,"Text: 'The Ghan Train Mark Ottaway traveled by train from Darwin, in the north of Australia, to Adelaide, in the south. The Ghan train crosses Australia from the warm northern coast through endless desert to the colder Southern Ocean. It is often called the 'famous Ghan', but it is mostly known for being late. The idea of a rail link between Darwin and Adelaide started in the 1920s with a line from Adelaide to Alice Springs, but flooding often made it hard for trains to pass. A new line was finished a few months before my trip. The railway was built for speeds up to 115 kph, but the Ghan is not a high-speed train. There are few stops, and most passengers are on holiday. The Ghan does not offer luxury like the Orient Express, although the food on board is excellent. The railway was originally built to carry goods, not passengers. It was thought that sending goods from Europe to Australia's south via Darwin and the train, instead of by ship around the continent, would save time and money. A transcontinental railway is rare, and the Ghan claims to be the world's first north-south one. As I waited to board the Ghan, I saw that everyone was excited about the journey. Most of my fellow travelers were Australian pensioners eager to board. Our first stop, where the Ghan waited four hours, was at Katherine. Some passengers got off here for a boat trip up the gorge. I didn't leave the train until Alice Springs, where I went on a two-day trip to Uluru (Ayers Rock) with a small group and a guide. Climbing the rock is not encouraged now, and few people do it. Our group walked around the rock and stayed to watch the beautiful sunset. From Alice Springs, there are two trains a week heading south, so many passengers stop their journey here. The view from the train after Alice Springs isn't very interesting. There is a lot of flat land with only cattle to see. But at dawn on the third day, we reached the foothills near the Southern Ocean. My journey was over, and although the train might not have delivered on everything the advertisements promised, it took me to some of the most amazing sights in Australia.'"
PET_31,"Each year, thousands of people climb Ben Nevis in Scotland. Because it is so far north, the weather can be very cold. Climber Keith Hewitt talks about his first time climbing Ben Nevis. It was February, and it was my first big winter climb. We planned to climb the north side of the mountain to Tower Ridge. This climb is 600 meters high and is probably the longest in Britain. We planned to camp for three days in the 'Carries', which are like big bowls in the mountain walls halfway up. We carried tents, sleeping bags, and metal spikes for our boots. You need these spikes because the snow can be so hard that it feels like ice. Even though some of us were very experienced, we packed a lot of safety equipment, like lights to attract attention, hard hats, and extra clothing. The weather forecast was perfect, with no strong winds, but we still felt nervous when we started. Climbing Ben Nevis in winter is always a challenge. The path soon got steep, and my legs felt tired. I was the weakest in the group, so I had to rest more often. The others sometimes stopped to let me catch up, but as soon as I reached them, they started again. I promised myself that I would always train properly before a climb in the future. After 200 meters, we reached the start of Tower Ridge, the path to the top of Ben Nevis. It is only one and a half meters wide, and the mountain drops hundreds of meters on each side. We knew we had to stay calm and focus on every step as we moved slowly. After seven hours of climbing, we reached the top. On a clear day, you can see the sea and the island of Skye, 48 kilometers away. But we weren't so lucky because a mist came down. On Ben Nevis, going back down to camp can be as challenging as climbing up. You need to read a map well because a wrong turn could lead to dangerous slopes in winter. I was glad we decided to take turns reading the map. That first time, I only really enjoyed the experience when I was safe in the tent. But at least I made it to the top."
PET_58,"Anna's New School

This week has been very exciting because we've just moved into our new school building! It's an amazing place made entirely of wood, just like our old school. However, this new building is one of the first in our country to be really environmentally friendly. It took months to build, and we watched the whole process. It was exciting to see the builders clear the land, although it meant losing some lovely open space. The noise from the machines was very loud, and the builders often had to stop because of heavy rain. We started to think it would never be finished.

Now, we have five very large classrooms, much bigger than those in our old, very old school next door. We share one room with the town for meetings and other events. There's also a nursery, a nice dining room, and big changing rooms that we can't wait to use once our new sports field is ready.

When you enter the school, you'll notice there are no heaters! Instead, the heat comes from us—the students, teachers, and computers. The building is designed to keep all the heat inside, and it also keeps the sound in. When we sing in our classrooms, it feels like we're in a concert hall!

Another interesting thing is the tree on the school roof. The builders put it there because it's a tradition in Austria, where the roof was made. Our electricity comes from a wind turbine on a hill behind the school. We visited it with our teacher yesterday, and it spins really fast. It's so big that you can see it from miles away! We took pictures to put on our website.

Even though we're already using the new building, some parts are still being added. For example, we're putting on a play for parents, but we have to go back to our old school hall for it. The new hall will be ready next year. We're very happy with our new school, and our teachers say we'll learn much faster here!"

As I looked down at the river far below, I understood why people love rock climbing. My friend Matt and I arrived at the Activity Centre on Friday evening. The accommodation wasn't great, but we had everything we needed: beds, blankets, and food. We were happy to be away from the city and in the fresh air. On Saturday morning, we met the other ten people in our group. Cameron was there with his two friends, Kevin and Simon, while sisters Carole and Lynn came with Amanda. We all came from different places and didn't know the area. We knew we would spend the weekend outdoors, but we weren't sure exactly what we would do. Half of us went caving in the morning while the others went rock climbing, and then we switched activities at lunchtime. Matt and I went to the caves first. Climbing out was harder than going in, but after a lot of effort, we finally got out. We were covered in mud but felt happy and excited about what we had done.'"

Inside were my cheque book, address book, and purse, which had about £50 in cash and some credit cards. When I realized my mistake, it was too late.

It was the manager of CityBus, the company that owned the bus. He told me they had found my handbag and offered to bring it back to me. I got my handbag back, with everything still inside.

PET_60,"Sharks are some of the most feared animals in the ocean. They are excellent hunters because they have good eyesight and can sense movement with special lines on their bodies. This makes them very dangerous to smaller sea animals, which they eat. While sharks are similar to other fish in some ways, their bodies are different. For instance, most sharks need to keep swimming to breathe and stay alive, so they rarely sleep. Additionally, if sharks are flipped onto their backs, they can stop moving entirely. This is helpful for researchers who need to study sharks, as it allows them to learn more about these interesting creatures."

PET_53,"Text: 'Joining the Kirov Ballet I'm Nathalie. Last year, I became one of the youngest foreign students to join the Kirov Ballet School in St Petersburg, Russia. At my first ballet class, I was nervous because I didn't know anyone. Everyone gathered around and asked me questions in Russian. I tried to speak some Russian, and then they started speaking English, so we could communicate. Now, six months later, everyone is really nice to me, my Russian has improved a lot, and I understand my teachers. For the first two weeks after I arrived, my mum stayed with me, and when she left, I felt a bit sad. I even called home late at night once to talk to her because I felt a little lonely. Compared to my ballet school in England, the classes in Russia are really hard, and I eat a lot to keep my energy up. That makes me confident I can meet the school's high standards. In the evenings, I watch my favorite films on my computer, but sometimes I fall asleep before the movie ends. Now that I've settled in, I feel really at home here. I enjoy walking around the city and visiting different shops, even in December when I couldn't believe how cold it was. I decided to buy a fur hat because it was minus 10°C, but the Russians said it was mild for that time of year! At least my room was warm and cozy. Right now, we are preparing for a new production, and there's also a competition for young dancers that I'm going to enter. I feel so lucky to be here.'"
PET_55,"Text: 'THE ICEHOTEL For many years, the Arctic was a popular place to visit in the summer to see the midnight sun. However, in winter, only a few people lived there, enjoying the snow and ice alone. By the late 1980s, people decided that the dark and cold winter could be a good thing. In the winter of 1990, a French artist named Jannot Derit was invited to open an exhibition in a specially built igloo (a building made of snow) in the small town of Jukkasjarvi on the frozen Torne River. This building, called Arctic Hall, attracted many visitors. One night, a group of foreign guests thought it would be interesting to sleep in the Arctic Hall. The next morning, they were very happy with their experience, and the idea of an ice hotel was born. Today, it is famous worldwide. When winter starts, a team of snow builders, architects, and artists from around the world come to Jukkasjarvi to build the hotel for that year. As each part is finished, it opens to visitors and overnight guests, while other parts are still being built. The first part is ready in December, and each week a new part opens until January 7th, when the hotel is complete. Since the ICEHOTEL is built outside using natural winter materials, the completion date can change depending on the weather. In spring, when it gets warmer, the hotel melts. Inside the hotel, the temperature is always between -5°C and -8°C, no matter how cold it is outside. Warm winter clothes like overalls, hats, and gloves are included in the cost of staying at the hotel. Guests are also advised to bring sweaters, a scarf, and plenty of wool socks, and to wear shoes that are larger than usual to fit thick socks. If you plan to visit the hotel, you can buy warm sweaters, wool socks, and more on the ICEHOTEL website. You can order these items and the equipment you need when you book your visit, and they will be delivered to your room when you check in. The hotel is located in the village of Jukkasjarvi, 200 km above the Arctic Circle, but only 15 km from Kiruna airport and 17 km from Kiruna train station. Bus transport can be arranged from the airport or train station to the ICEHOTEL.'"

Normally, the store will be open from 9 am to 9 pm every day, but Homestyle had announced it would stay open for 24 hours straight on its first day. However, it had to close just half an hour after opening. A police officer at the scene said: 'We were told a big crowd was expected, but people were not patient. The store filled up quickly, and the managers wisely decided to close the doors. People outside got angry because they thought everything would be sold out before they could get in, and they refused to wait quietly for space inside. Another issue was the long line of cars trying to reach the parking lot. I was surprised that many people left their cars in the middle of the road and walked the last few meters to the store, which completely blocked the road.' One customer, Jenny Smith, who got into the store, said: 'I waited in line for three hours and didn't have time to buy what I wanted. But the staff were very calm and explained the situation. They had no choice, as it wasn't safe. I'll come back when they reopen, but I won't wait in line again.'"

In 2003, Tanya Streeter made history by diving 120 meters into the ocean and returning to the surface without assistance. She had gone deeper the previous year but used a balloon to help her ascend. This time, she held her breath for over three and a half minutes, becoming the first woman in any sport to break a man's world record. A team of fourteen safety divers monitored her dive at various depths. Despite reports of serious accidents involving other divers, some people argue that free-diving is too dangerous. However, Tanya disagrees, emphasizing that safety and training are the most important aspects. Most free-divers focus on one or two types of events, but Tanya's training routine remains consistent. She spends two-thirds of her time on land-based training at the gym, with the rest split between the pool and the ocean. She uses an exercise bike to improve her heart fitness but avoids running to protect her knees, preferring fast walking to build fitness. When she starts practice dives, she usually travels away from home, aiming for fourteen dives over four weeks, with rest days in between to avoid fatigue. When not preparing for an event, Tanya often makes public appearances to promote sports products and supports environmental organizations through research projects or films. Growing up on the Caribbean island of Grand Cayman, she spent her childhood swimming and exploring rock pools to observe sea life. Tanya says her life now is like living her childhood dreams. She believes her fame in some countries helps people listen to her on environmental issues. Looking ahead, Tanya, now in her thirties, plans to continue breaking her own world records. Since she started free-diving at twenty-five, she emphasizes that she doesn't plan to retire from the sport anytime soon.'"

Cartoon films have very few limits. If you can draw something, you can make it move on the cinema screen. With new ideas and advanced computer programs, cartoons are becoming exciting again for people of all ages. By the end of the 1970s, people in the cinema industry thought cartoons were only for children. But soon after, a few directors came up with original new ideas. They showed that it was possible to make films that both adults and children could enjoy. However, not every cartoon film was a success. For example, The Black Cauldron did not do well because it was too scary for children and too childish for adults. Directors learned from this mistake, and film companies started making a lot of money again."

Honey is a sweet liquid made by bees. It contains water and sugars. Bees can travel up to 75,000 kilometers and visit over two million flowers to make just half a kilo of honey. The color and taste of honey depend on the type of flower the bees visit. There are more than 300 types of honey. Lighter-colored honey usually has a milder taste than darker honey. In ancient times, honey was the main sweetener because sugar was very rare. It was very valuable to the ancient Egyptians, who even used it as a form of payment. Today, honey is made and eaten all over the world. Research shows that it can help prevent tiredness and improve athletic performance. But honey is not just food; it can also be used for sore throats and is an ingredient in many skin and hair-care products."
PET_7,"Norwich, the capital of East Anglia in Britain, has been a place to live for over two thousand years. It started as a small village by the River Wensum. By the time of the Norman invasion in 1066, it had grown into one of England's largest towns. Norwich has been a religious center for a long time, with two cathedrals and a mosque. The first cathedral was built in 1095 and recently celebrated its 900th anniversary. In 1994, Norwich celebrated the 800th anniversary of receiving a Royal Charter, which allowed it to be called a city and govern itself independently.

Today, Norwich is smaller compared to cities like London or Manchester, with a population of about 150,000. However, in the 16th century, it was the second-largest city in England. It continued to grow and became wealthy, known for having as many churches as weeks in the year and as many pubs as days in the year. Now, there are fewer churches and pubs, but in 1964, the University of East Anglia was established in Norwich. With a growing student population and success as a commercial center, especially in insurance services, Norwich offers a variety of entertainment options: theatres, cinemas, nightclubs, busy cafes, excellent restaurants, and arts and leisure centers. The city also has a football team called 'The Canaries,' with green and yellow colors, though the reason for the name is unclear.

One of the city's attractions is a modern shopping center called 'The Castle Mall.' For over two years, the people of Norwich lived with a large hole in the city center as builders worked on the main car park. Nearly a million tons of earth were moved to create a city center park on the Mall's roof, with water pools and trees. The local people are happy that the old open market remains next to the new development. Both areas are successful, showing that Norwich has managed to combine the best of the old and the new."
PET_43,"The Albuquerque Balloon Festival

Every autumn, the sky above Albuquerque, a desert city in the southwestern United States, fills with bright colors. This is because of the Albuquerque Balloon Festival, a nine-day event held every year. The first festival took place in 1972 to celebrate the 50th birthday of a local radio station. Back then, about a dozen hot-air balloons launched from a car park in the middle of Albuquerque. Since then, the festival has grown a lot. This year, at least a thousand balloons from over a third of the countries in the world are expected at the current site outside the city.

What to See

The balloon pilots stay in radio contact and light up their burners at the same time. These are called 'balloon glows' and are great for taking photos. To see these 'glows,' you need to arrive just after nightfall or before 5:30 am as the balloons rise into the dark sky. During the day, you can walk among the balloons and talk to the pilots as they get ready for take-off. The balloons come in all sizes and colors, some shaped like animals, cartoon characters, or famous products like soft drinks and fast food. Kids will love it.

In the afternoon, you can take a balloon flight over the desert with one of the many companies offering rides. Another option is to take the cable car from the desert floor to the top of the nearby mountains. This is the longest cable car ride anywhere and offers a bird's-eye view of the festival. There are many other attractions for visitors of all ages, including balloon races and fireworks on the opening night and the last three nights of the festival.

The Albuquerque Box

This is a local wind pattern that is perfect for balloonists. The Sandia Mountains protect the balloons from strong winds and create gentle wind currents at different heights. This allows skilled pilots to control the direction of their balloons by rising or descending.

Practical Advice

Buy your tickets in advance online to avoid long waits at the festival site. Wear several layers of thin clothing. It can be cool at night and in the early morning, but during the day, sunglasses and sunscreen are essential. Bring a flashlight for night events and, of course, your camera. If you use film, you'll need high-speed film for evening and night pictures."

Each group has about twelve students, and each lesson lasts an hour, happening once every two weeks. Additionally, each student has one individual lesson with her every week. Parents must also attend the classes. It is important for parents to be actively involved in the lessons. From the very first lessons, students learn to play by ear. They do not try to read music until they have been playing for several years, and for a long time, there is a big difference between their playing and their music reading skills. Margaret says her method is not meant to create great violinists, and she often suggests that students who do very well should leave and study the violin using more traditional methods."
PET_56,"Moonshine, the band, released their third CD last week called 'Here Again', which follows their previous album 'The Waves'. There have been some changes since the last CD. Tom Wilcott is now playing bass guitar, replacing Simon McVee who left the band last year, and Tom Simpson has joined as the drummer. From the first song, which is a dance track, it's clear that the band is moving away from focusing only on slow songs. The second track is also a dance tune and is even louder and heavier. Most of the later tracks are in the band's usual slow style. These two dance tracks will surprise many fans, but they are excellent and could easily become hit singles. Singer Rob Letchford performs exceptionally well, hitting every note perfectly. Fans should be thankful he recorded the songs before he had throat problems, which have caused the band to cancel their next tour. (Anyone who bought tickets shouldn't worry as all the concerts will be rescheduled once Rob recovers.) On this CD, Moonshine shows they can create great music in different styles, from the slow ones we know to the upbeat ones that make you want to dance. However, I felt that the best songs were at the beginning, and the last few tracks weren't as strong. Despite this, 'Here Again' is sure to be a big hit and bring more success to the band."
PET_36,"San Francisco is located on the coast of northern California. The first Europeans to find the area were led by a Spanish explorer named Gaspar de Portola, who saw it in 1769. Interestingly, even though San Francisco Bay is a great natural harbor, it was discovered from land, not from the sea. In 1849, thousands of people came to San Francisco hoping to find gold. However, it wasn't the gold seekers who became wealthy. The richest people made their money by owning banks and law firms, and they built large houses on a hill called Nob Hill. Today, tourists visit San Francisco to see famous places like Chinatown and the Golden Gate Bridge. Many also take a short boat trip to Alcatraz Island to see the former prison."

Pepys writes about important events of the time, such as disease outbreaks, an enemy navy sailing up the River Thames, and the Great Fire of London. He also writes about himself, including his flaws - he often fell asleep in church or admired pretty girls. He describes his home life, like arguments with his wife and how they made up, and his worries about her illness. Besides books, he enjoyed music, the theatre, card games, and parties with good food and lots of fun. Pepys was a busy man with many important roles - he was a Member of Parliament and President of the Royal Society. He is also remembered for his work with the British Navy.'"
PET_33,"Text: 'The History of Shoes In the past, shoes were not made to be comfortable or stylish. Early shoes were likely made from animal skins that people wrapped around their ankles in cold weather. Today, we still use leather, but materials like silk, plastic, and cotton are also popular, depending on fashion trends. It was only about 150 years ago that people started wearing different shoes on each foot. Before that, both shoes were straight and could be worn on either foot. All shoes used to be handmade, but now, although some shoemakers still use traditional methods, most shoes are made by machines in large factories. The invention of sewing machines allowed the shoe industry to produce many cheaper shoes for more people.'"

I wanted to help more women discover the sport, to show them how enjoyable it can be and to boost their confidence to start running. So, I decided to create a women's running club in my area because I was frustrated with many race organizers. They often complain about the lack of women in the sport but use it as an excuse not to provide separate changing rooms. I put up posters, and 40 women joined, ranging from young to old, fit to unfit. They were mainly interested in losing weight, but I don't think they had considered running before. If they did, they imagined it as painful training. They didn't think about chatting and smiling while running in beautiful places, like along a river. Initially, they could only run for a minute, but now they can run for thirty minutes. They've also learned from other runners about diet and general fitness. I wanted to contribute to women's running, and I've enjoyed watching their progress almost as much as they have.'"
PET_40,"The History of the Iditarod - The Last Great Race on Earth

In the 1880s, gold was found in Alaska, the northernmost state of the USA. Many people moved there, hoping to become rich. New towns were quickly built, including one called Iditarod, which means 'far, distant place'. In 1909, Iditarod grew so fast that it briefly became the largest city in Alaska. During the summer, supplies could be delivered by boat, but in winter, the rivers and ocean froze, making it impossible to reach these towns. So, in 1910, a winter trail was created for dog sled teams to deliver mail, food, and clothes to the gold miners. This trail was called the Iditarod Trail. It took about three weeks for a dog team to travel across Alaska. They stopped at 'roadhouses' where the drivers and dogs could rest and eat. The trail was used every winter until the 1920s when airplanes replaced steam boats and dog teams as the main transport method.

However, in 1925, the dogs were needed again when a disease called diphtheria broke out in Nome. The medicine to cure it was in Anchorage, on the other side of Alaska. Airplanes were still new, and it was uncertain if they could fly in such cold weather. Also, the only skilled pilot, Carl Eielson, was away. So, it was decided to use dog teams to transport the medicine. The journey was over 1,000 kilometers, mostly along the Iditarod Trail. It took twenty teams just six days to complete the trip. Leonhard Seppala, a Norwegian who came to Alaska for gold, traveled the first 400 kilometers. He relied on his dog Togo to guide him through the snow, and Togo proved to be a reliable leader. The last part of the journey was completed by Gunnar Kaasen, who had been driving dog teams in Alaska for 21 years. His lead dog was Balto. At one point, Balto refused to move forward, saving the team from falling into icy water. The diphtheria outbreak was stopped, and Balto became a hero.

Today, a dog sled race is held every year from Anchorage to Nome, following the route of the 1925 journey. It is called the Iditarod and is known as 'The Last Great Race on Earth'."

You can even have a wedding there if you wish. The bar is also made of ice, so it's not a good idea to put hot drinks on it! The bedrooms are kept at around -4°C, but guests receive special sleeping bags to stay warm. If needed, suitable outdoor clothing is also available. The hotel is rebuilt every winter because it melts in the summer. Building it requires 10,000 tonnes of ice and 30,000 tonnes of snow.'"

""At first, no one minded that I was a girl, but then the team we beat complained."" This story was published in a local newspaper, and Jose Craveirinha, who supported African athletes, heard about Maria. He went to see her and found her playing football outside the club. He quickly noticed she was very fast. ""He talked to me about athletics, but I didn't know what he meant. The only sport I knew was football. Then he bought me running shoes and started training me. It was really hard, and my legs hurt a lot."" Jose visited her parents and convinced them that Maria could succeed in athletics and help lift them out of poverty. They agreed to let him take her for training. In 1991, she finally accepted an offer to train in the United States. She had refused before because she would miss her family. Her life was very different from the girls she met in the US. She says, ""They were good athletes, but while I worried about my parents having enough to eat, they worried about dresses and make-up. They knew little about me and even less about my problems. But I knew I was lucky to be there. The trainers were excellent, and I learned a lot.""

Today, most cities have a zoo or wildlife park. However, not everyone agrees with the idea of zoos. Supporters of zoos argue that they allow us to learn about nature and see wild animals up close, which wouldn't be possible otherwise. On the other hand, critics believe it is wrong to keep animals in cages. They also point out that in poorly managed zoos, animals may live in dirty conditions and eat inappropriate food.'"

Each band wore different costumes, from black school uniforms like ours to bright T-shirts. We didn't look like adult professional bands, but we were all used to performing in competitions, so the quality of playing was amazing, especially since everyone was so young. Players from each band even made up new tunes right there on stage. It was exciting to watch, but even better when my band played! We have a great jazz band at my school, but not everyone who wants to join gets in—only about half do. But anyone who is eager to play comes to jazz practice before school, and we often spend time together after school, listening to jazz and learning about it. There are also trips to jazz summer camps across the country. I've been to a couple and learned a lot. Adults are often surprised that young people are interested in jazz. My music teacher thinks it's because pop music isn't challenging enough for people like me who are serious about music. I find jazz exciting because it's both new and old at the same time—you can create your own music, but you also feel part of its history, playing on stage like the great jazz performers before you. My school is really lucky because we have great teachers and parents who support us. Without them, we wouldn't get far with our music!'"

PET_52,"Eight-eighteen News

Eight-eighteen News is a news agency for young people aged 8-18. We gather news and write reports, stories, and articles. We send these to major newspapers, magazines, TV, radio, and websites for publication. You can read or listen to the stories accepted by these media on the Eight-eighteen website. We have three centers across the country where young people can meet and join projects, and we plan to open more centers nationwide. Since we started in 1994, when we were called 'Young News', over 2,500 young people have been members. 

Sophie, a former member, says: 'I first heard about Eight-eighteen when they interviewed me for an article on young people's views on hip hop music. I was impressed by the young journalists and the opportunities they had. Age didn't matter; they were trusted to handle stories on their own. I joined the Eight-eighteen center in my city, received training, and stayed a member until I was 18. Eight-eighteen helped me achieve more than I imagined. With the skills I learned, I got a job at 19 and am now the youngest employee at a major news website, checking articles before they go online.'

Get involved at every level

When you join Eight-eighteen, you'll receive training and attend monthly meetings to decide who will write each news story. Eight-eighteen promotes skill-sharing among members. 'Peer trainers' are experienced members aged 12 and over who train new members in basic journalism skills. As they gain experience, some members present sessions to young people and adults outside Eight-eighteen, often in youth clubs and summer camps. These young trainers are supported by older staff during these trips. Eight-eighteen News holds training sessions for new members three times a year. Our next training is in February. If you or someone you know is interested in joining, call Director Den Ley at 01622 657874 for more information.

PET_28,"**Antarctica Sightseeing Flights Website**

Welcome to our website. Here is what you need to know before booking a flight.

**About the Flights**

During the short Antarctic summer, we offer sightseeing flights from Sydney, Australia, over Antarctica and back. We use a full-size passenger plane, a Boeing 747. Flight dates for next year are not confirmed yet, but if you book now, your deposit can be transferred if we need to change the date.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**How long is the flight?**

The flight lasts about 12 hours. After four hours, we usually see the first sea ice and icebergs. We spend four hours flying over Antarctica and the rest of the time returning home. During the flight, experts who have lived on Antarctic research stations give talks about the environment and history and answer questions. A camera near the pilot shows you a pilot's view from take-off to landing.

**Will I get a window seat?**

All passengers receive two boarding passes. Halfway through the flight, you will move to the seat on your second pass. Business and first-class passengers have a window seat for half the flight and a seat next to the window for the other half. Economy passengers have a window or next-to-window seat for half the flight and an aisle seat for the other half. Over Antarctica, we encourage passengers to move around the plane to share the views. The pilot flies in long 'figure 8s' so everyone can see the sights from both sides of the plane.

**What if the weather is bad?**

We have 17 approved flight plans. On the morning of the flight, the captain checks the satellite cloud images and chooses the route with the clearest views.

**Will I see penguins and other wildlife?**

Most Antarctic wildlife is at sea level, over 3,000 meters below the plane, so we can't see them clearly. We do not land in Antarctica for environmental reasons. To see wildlife, you would need to join a boat tour.

**Can I take photographs?**

Yes, you can take photos. All cameras are welcome. We also offer some fun photo opportunities on board where you can try on Antarctic cold weather clothes."

I made a meal for ten friends, and they really enjoyed it. Then my mum suggested I take up a hobby instead of doing nothing at weekends. I was happy staying at home, so I wasn't too interested at first. But I'm really glad I decided to come.' Their teacher, Philippe, says, 'It's great fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, although the kitchen isn't always tidy when they're cooking! As adults, we're always learning more about food. If parents get their children interested in cooking while they are young, they'll have enough skills to cook for themselves when they leave home.''"
PET_5,"Winter Driving

Winter driving is dangerous because it's hard to predict what will happen, and accidents can occur easily. Fog might appear suddenly over a hill. Ice can be hidden under melting snow, ready to make you lose control. A car coming towards you might unexpectedly slide across the road. 

Rule Number One for driving on icy roads is to drive smoothly. Sudden movements can make your car hard to control. So, when you turn the wheel, use the brakes, or speed up, do it gently and slowly. Imagine you have a full cup of hot coffee on the seat next to you. Drive in a way that you wouldn't spill it.

Rule Number Two is to be aware of what might happen. The more ice there is, the further ahead you need to look. Test how long it takes to stop by gently braking. Remember, you might be driving faster than you think. Generally, allow double your normal stopping distance on wet roads, three times on snow, and even more on ice. 

Try to keep control of your car at all times to avoid trouble."
PET_41,"Craigie Aitchison was a painter from Scotland. He moved to London planning to study law but ended up going to art school. He found traditional drawing classes hard but continued painting. In his late twenties, he received a grant from the Italian government to study art. This experience made him interested in early Italian artists, which influenced some of his work. He loved the greens and browns of the Italian countryside and the clear light there, and he wanted to capture this light in his paintings. To achieve this, he painted colors in thin layers from light to dark, but he says he never knows exactly how it will turn out. He explains, 'It's a secret - because I don't know myself. I don't start by painting yellow, knowing I'm going to put anything on top.' Aitchison makes it sound simple, saying, 'Anyone can do the colors - you can buy them. I just notice what you put the colors next to.' Unlike some artists, he doesn't make sketches before starting a painting because he thinks he might get bored and not finish the painting. Instead, he changes his paintings many times before they are done. This is why he prefers models who don't ask to see their portraits while he's working. 'If I feel they're worried and want to look at the painting, I can't do it.' Since moving to London, he hasn't felt connected to the Scottish art scene. He says he doesn't follow any tradition and just paints in his own way. However, his work still influences young British painters."
PET_38,"Text: 'Rock Band Two years ago, our 14-year-old son, Ben, asked us for a drum set for his birthday. At first, we didn't like the idea because of the noise. Ben argued, 'It's better than watching TV or playing computer games in my free time, and it'll keep me out of trouble.' In the end, we agreed. 'Okay,' we said, 'but you must think about the rest of the family and the neighbors when you play.' That was just the start. Since drums are hard to move, the other members of Ben's band began coming to our house with their guitars and other electric equipment. So, for several hours a week, the house shakes with the sound of their instruments and their teenage singing. At least Ben's hobby has been good for our health: whenever the band starts practicing, my husband and I go out for a long walk. I must admit that, even though their music sounds a bit strange, they are a friendly and polite group of young men. I can't judge their musical skill—after all, I didn't expect my parents' generation to like the same music I did when I was a teenager—but they do play regularly in local clubs for young people. Our main worry is that they won't spend enough time on their schoolwork because of their music, though this hasn't happened yet. I always tell Ben how important his studies are. But one thing is certain—Ben was right: it has kept him out of trouble, and he is never bored.'"
PET_17,"Atlantic College

Last week, I visited Atlantic College, a top private school in Wales. This school is special because it gives students important life experiences outside the classroom, along with preparing them for exams. The students, aged 16 to 18, come from all over the world. They study in the morning and spend the afternoon doing useful activities like helping on a farm, assisting people with learning difficulties, or checking rivers for pollution.

One of the best things about Atlantic College is its diverse student body, with students from various social backgrounds and countries. Since the fees are PS20,000 for two years, many students receive grants to help pay. A quarter of the students are British, and many of them attend thanks to government support.

Barbara Molenkamp, a student from the Netherlands, said, ""I really admire the college for promoting international understanding among young people. You learn to live with and respect others, even those you don't like. During the summer holidays, my mother noticed I argued less with my sister.""

In conclusion, Atlantic College provides an excellent education with methods that truly work."

I felt stuck and became more and more unhappy. I envied the students at the local university because they seemed happy, carefree, and hopeful. I wanted to be part of that. However, now that I'm a student, I find it hard to connect with younger classmates. They often mistake me for a lecturer and ask questions I can't answer. I also feel distant from the lecturers because, even though we are the same age, they know much more than I do. Still, I am grateful for the chance to study because I know a qualification is important for getting a fulfilling job, which matters a lot to me. Unlike most eighteen-year-olds, I prefer spending weekends with my books rather than going out partying. There are also typical student perks like long holidays and discounts at theatres and cinemas. I sometimes worry about what I'll do after university, but I hope that continuing my education at this stage in life has been a good decision.'"

KET_10,"Text: 'BURGLARS LOVE THE AFTERNOON Most house burglaries occur between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m., according to the police. Inspector Ian Saunders informed our newspaper that house burglaries have increased by more than 30% compared to last year. He mentioned that 67% of burglaries happen when people leave and forget to close a door or window. He also noted that night-time burglaries are rare because families are usually home then. However, he explained that winter afternoons are ideal for burglars because it is dark, making it easier for them to go unnoticed. Additionally, many houses are empty during this time as people are often still at work. Inspector Saunders suggested leaving lights on in living rooms and bedrooms when you go on holiday to deter burglars. He also encouraged neighbors to keep an eye on each other's houses when people are away and to contact the police if they notice anything unusual. 'We can also advise you on how to make your house secure,' Inspector Saunders said. 'This kind of assistance is free.''"

I just wanted to say thank you for letting me stay at your lovely home for two nights. It was great to see you both again. I've attached the photos of your children that you wanted. They turned out well, don't you think? I hope you like them. I'm really enjoying my new camera.

Next week, I'm going to visit my sister in New York. I plan to take many photos there as well. It's been a long time since I last saw her.

Thanks again.

KET_44,"Text: 'The History of Farming Before farming, people gathered plants and fruit from forests to eat. This meant they had to move constantly to find food. However, around 12,000 years ago in the Middle East, people started to grow their own food. These were the first farmers. Farming allowed people to settle in one place, and their villages gradually expanded. Some villagers could focus on other tasks, like making clothes, because farmers provided food for everyone. Unfortunately, farming was challenging when the weather was bad, and some people didn't have enough to eat. Today, farmers can produce more food, and it is transported thousands of kilometers to reach our homes.'"

After nine months, she joined Saudi Arabian Airlines and later became an air hostess with British Airways. Four years later, she became a manager. Here’s what she says about her job: ""My office is at Heathrow Airport, but I spend 60% of my time flying. I teach air hostesses and help them with any issues. I also attend many meetings. My work hours are usually from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., but sometimes I work from 1 p.m. to 9 p.m. The first thing I do at work is check flight times on my computer and then talk to some of the air hostesses. Sometimes, I go on long flights to see how the air hostesses are doing. That's my favorite part of the job, but I also enjoy office work. Traveling can be tiring. After a long trip, all I want to do is eat and sleep! I don't earn a lot of money, but I'm happy with British Airways and want to stay and keep traveling."""

KET_62,"Text: People are interested in the weather for many reasons, and it is important for various jobs. For instance, the weather greatly affects farmers. In the past, farmers would spend a lot of time observing the sky, animals, and plants to understand the weather better. Nowadays, there are many computer programs that help us learn about the weather, and people can even access weather information on their mobile phones. Despite modern technology, many people still believe in traditional weather sayings. For example, they say that if the sky is red in the evening, the next day will be sunny. Some also believe that when cows lie down in the fields, it will rain soon."
KET_49,"Frazer and Peter are two 14-year-old boys from a small town in Canada. They have been friends and classmates for a long time. Like their other friends, they usually enjoy fishing or swimming on weekends. However, for the past few months, they have been spending their weekends in Peter's room working on his laptop. This isn't because they have a lot of homework. Instead, they have created a new computer word game. The idea for the game came from Frazer's younger brother, Kevin, who has difficulty with reading. Kevin finds it easier to learn words by seeing pictures and hearing information rather than just reading. Frazer wanted to help him. So, Frazer and Peter worked together for over 200 hours to develop a computer game, and now it's ready to use. The game involves speaking and pictures. For example, when you see the word 'hat', there is a drawing of a hat next to it, and you can hear Peter saying 'Hat! Hat!' at the same time. The two boys have won many prizes for their computer game, and it will soon be available for sale worldwide. Many schools are interested in buying it."

KET_58,"Bollywood, the film industry in Mumbai, India, produces nearly 1,000 films each year. Since its first film in 1913, Bollywood has made over 29,000 films, making it the largest film industry in the world, even bigger than the USA's. Watching films is the favorite pastime for most Indians, with ten million people going to the cinema daily. Bollywood films often feature romantic love stories, with singing and dancing as key elements. These films are also popular outside India, earning Bollywood over $500 million last year from international sales. Indian actors make more films annually than Hollywood actors, but they earn less money. As a result, most Bollywood films cost about $2 million to produce, while Hollywood films usually cost at least $5 million. Most Bollywood actors are young and work hard but only for a few years. However, Amitabh Bachchan, considered by some as India's greatest actor, is an exception. He has starred in over 140 films during a career spanning almost 40 years."

I like Britain and want to go back, but my daughter, Felicity, will start college here soon, so we will stay for another four years. I recently spent six weeks in England to work on a radio program about the English language and to discuss my new book. Most writers don't enjoy traveling around to promote their books, but I don't mind. I like visiting new places and meeting people. It's very different from my life in the U.S. when I'm writing.

Most smaller Schnauzers are grey, while the Giant Schnauzer is usually black.

KET_1,"New Books This Month

The Long Night  
This is the first book by David Reilly. David started writing after teaching English for several years. The story is about Maha, a nurse in northern Australia. She works in a small hospital. One day, a baby is very sick, and Maha has to drive all night to take the baby to the nearest big city. They face many challenges on their journey.

Hard Work  
This is the twentieth book by Joanna Jones. Hard Work tells the story of Sombat, who works with his father, a carpenter, in Thailand. They work long hours making tables and chairs, but they don't have much money. One day, a man dressed in black buys the most beautiful table in their shop.

Hospital or Cinema?  
Marcie Jacome, who studies English in London, wrote this story earlier this year. The story is about Tina, a young Brazilian woman who dreams of becoming a doctor. She goes to London to study English and medicine. However, one day she meets a man who invites her to go to the USA with him to become a film star. What will Tina decide to do?"
KET_53,"Horse racing has been an important sport throughout history. It began in Central Asia around 4,500 years ago and was popular in ancient Greece and Rome. Modern horse racing started when Arab horses were brought to Europe in the 12th century. Initially, races were long and involved only two horses. However, in the early 18th century, races became shorter and included several horses competing at once. Today, horse racing is one of the most-watched sports in the USA, second only to baseball, and it is also popular in many other countries."
KET_55,"Nick Barlow is a British actor who loves his job. He travels around the world making TV shows.

On his trips, Nick is accompanied by a team that brings cameras and other filming equipment. He doesn't pack much for himself, just a few shirts and trousers, but he always includes some books in his suitcase. Nick's wife, Helen, is okay with his travels for work. She has many friends and stays busy. When Nick comes back, she enjoys hearing his travel stories. However, there can be challenges. Once, while Nick was in the Malaysian rainforest, he learned that Helen was sick in the hospital. ""I felt awful because I couldn't help, but she didn't want me to come home. I was so relieved when I heard she was better,"" he recalls."
KET_50,"Parrots are beautiful birds with bright colors and long tails. You might have seen them in forests or zoos. They live in countries like Brazil, Australia, and India. Parrots usually stay in large groups and love eating fruit, which can sometimes cause problems for farmers.

This is because he has written for French magazines about almost all the best restaurants in that country. He is only 29 years old. When Howard was a teenager, he often went to restaurants with his parents. He enjoyed this so much that he decided not to spend money on clothes and CDs; instead, he used his money to visit France and eat in good restaurants. He also bought many French and English cookbooks - he says he has more than two hundred and fifty! So why did he decide to open a restaurant? Simply because he loves cooking. Has it been easy? He says it's expensive to start your own restaurant and much more difficult to cook for fifty people than for your family, but he is sure he has made the right choice.'"
KET_34,"John Pickering works in a park in a small town in central England, where he cuts the grass and waters the flowers. However, last week he was in Tokyo, where millions of Japanese people watched him on television. This is because John, who is 35 years old, is currently the top singer in Japan. He visited Japan a few months ago to perform in dance clubs in Osaka and Nagoya. A disc jockey heard his songs and played them on the radio. Many young people called the radio station to request his songs again. In Japan, John uses the stage name Jon Otis, but he plans to continue working in the park in England. He is unsure how much money he will make from his music. ""I need to keep my job in the park,"" he says. ""I still have bills to pay!"" The other gardeners are unaware of his fame in Japan and have never heard him sing. John's wife, Denise, who works in a hospital, says, ""This won't change our lives.

KET_26,"Line Dancing

Thousands of people in Britain have taken up a new hobby: line dancing. You can find clubs and classes for this activity in almost every town. According to Fiona Lever, a teacher, ""Line dancing is easy to learn. If you can walk, you can do it!"" You don't need a partner because you dance in groups, making it a great way to meet new friends. In my classes, there are both young and old people. Boys enjoy it because they can make a lot of noise with their feet during the dances!

When did line dancing start? Most people believe it began about fifteen years ago when American country music became popular in Britain."

KET_4,"Text: 'THE HISTORY OF THE LONDON POLICE Today, there are policemen everywhere, but in 1700, London had no police at all. A few old men used to guard the city streets at night, and they were not paid much. About 300 years ago, London began to grow. The city was very dirty, and many people were poor. There were so many thieves stealing money in the streets that people stayed home as much as possible. In 1750, Henry Fielding started paying a group of people to catch thieves. They were like policemen and were called 'Bow Street Runners' because they worked near Bow Street. Fifty years later, there were 120 Bow Street Runners, but London had become very large and needed more police. So, in 1829, the first Metropolitan (or London) Police Force was created with 3000 officers. Most of the men worked on foot, but a few rode horses. Until 1920, all the police in London were men. Today, London police are quite well paid, and for the few officers who still ride horses, the pay is even better than for the others.'"

KET_7,"Visit the Edinburgh Festival! Every year, thousands of people visit Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland, to join the Edinburgh Festival. For three weeks in August and September, the city is full of actors and artists from around the world. They come for the largest arts festival in Britain. During this time, the streets are lively with music and dance from morning until night. You can even watch artists painting on the streets. One of the highlights of the Festival is the 'Fringe', where students perform comedy shows in small venues like halls and cafes. Many tourists come to see new films, plays, and listen to music by famous musicians. This year, there are over five hundred performances with actors from more than forty countries. Tickets for these shows are quite affordable, and it's often easier to see your favorite star in Edinburgh than in London. So, plan to visit Edinburgh next summer, but remember that finding a room can be hard, so consider booking your hotel now!"
KET_43,"ICE-FISHING

If you drive north from Toronto for three hours, you will reach Lake Nipissing. In winter, the lake freezes, and thousands of Canadian fishermen go there every weekend. They build small wooden houses on the ice and paint them in bright colors. Inside these houses, they fish for the fish swimming under the ice.

Bob Marvisch has been coming here every year for twenty-five years. ""You need clothes that are light but warm: two pairs of socks and gloves, several thin sweaters, and a snow suit on top. Catching the fish is easy,"" he says. ""First, you break the ice and make a small round hole in it. Next, you take a fishing line and put some bread on it. Then, you put the line through the hole and into the water. You pull the line up when the fish eat the bread. They are between ten and twenty centimeters long. Some people like to eat them, but when I have caught three or four fish, I prefer to have some chocolate or another snack! Today I have caught twenty-five! It's a great sport, and you can meet some nice people here!"""

One very popular tourist attraction in London is Madame Tussaud's museum. At this museum, visitors can see wax figures of famous people. Madame Tussaud was born in France in 1761. Her uncle, who was a doctor, created wax figures of people and opened a museum for them in Paris. Marie helped her uncle with his work. In 1789, during the French Revolution, Marie was put in prison. While there, she had to make wax copies of the heads of famous people who had died, including Queen Marie Antoinette. In 1795, Marie married Francois Tussaud, and in 1802, she moved to London with her wax figures. She opened a museum there, and her wax figures are still on display today."

Initially, bicycles were costly, so only wealthy people could afford them. These early bicycles looked very different from the ones we see today. As bicycles became more affordable, many people started buying them. People began using bicycles to commute to work and for leisure activities. Nowadays, cars are used more often than bicycles because they are faster and protect you from the rain. However, some people still prefer cycling to work. They argue that there are too many cars in city centers and it's hard to find parking spaces.'"
KET_63,"Last summer, I went to Thailand with my family for a beach holiday. One day, we visited a park near our hotel. The park had beautiful flower gardens, but we were mainly interested in the elephant show. We went to a large area with seats on three sides. Three elephants came in with their keepers and stood in front of big white cards. Each elephant got a paintbrush and started painting on its card. The keepers helped by giving them new brushes with paint and taking away the old ones. Slowly, the elephants followed their keepers' instructions and drew pictures. I was amazed! One picture showed a river, another a tree, and the third a bunch of flowers. When the keepers showed the paintings, everyone wanted to buy one. We gave the elephants the bananas we had brought for our lunch. Twenty years ago, elephants worked in the forest. Now, they don't work there anymore, but the smartest ones live in special centers where visitors can watch them."
KET_56,"Text: 'Big Cats There are many different types of big cats, and they vary in size, appearance, and behavior. Tigers are the largest of the big cats, reaching up to 3.7 meters in length from head to tail. Unlike most cats, tigers enjoy water and often cool off in pools when it's hot. Lions are unique among big cats because they live in large family groups called prides. In these groups, several lions work together to hunt and provide food. Lions typically inhabit flat, open areas where they have a clear view to track other animals. All big cats need excellent eyesight to hunt smaller animals for food. They also need to be fast and very strong.'"

The Marangu route, which is five kilometers long, is considered the easiest. It usually takes about five days to complete and is very popular with tourists. However, only half of the climbers manage to reach the top. This is often because the weather can change quickly. At the start, it might be hot and wet, but at the top, there is ice and snow, and temperatures can drop below 20 degrees Celsius. Climbers need to bring both sunglasses and warm clothes!"

Otters can close their ears and nose, allowing them to stay underwater for several minutes. Twenty years ago, there were not many otters in Great Britain because the rivers were very polluted. The dirty water killed many fish and insects, leaving otters with little to eat. Today, the rivers are clean again, and there is plenty of food for otters.'"

Engineers ensure the building will be strong and safe. Then, workers carefully construct it. The Sydney Opera House is a well-known modern building with a beautiful roof. However, the building is attractive from every angle, not just from above. The Olympic Stadium in Munich also has a famous roof. This unique building resembles a tent made of glass.'"

The problem is I don't have anything to wear. I've grown a lot, and now all my trousers are too short! I want to buy some new ones and maybe a pair of boots.

KET_32,"Text: 'The Cerne Giant Sherborne and Dorchester are two towns in the south of England that are close to each other. Between them, there are many green hills and fields. On one of these hills, there is a large figure of a man. This figure is known as the Cerne Giant because it is near the village of Cerne. No one is sure when the Cerne Giant was created, but it is believed to be very old. You can walk from Cerne to get closer to the figure. If you visit on the first of May at sunrise, you will see the villagers dancing around the giant on the hill.'"
KET_61,"Gail Rollins is one of the top runners in Edinburgh. This summer, she aims to compete in the 10,000 meters and possibly the 5,000 meters at the European Championships. In the past, Gail was famous for finishing second in major competitions. However, she was always cheerful and smiling, which made her popular in her hometown. Everything changed in 2004 when she participated in her first half-marathon, a long road race. She won with an impressive time, the fastest of the year for any British woman. Gail's manager and husband, Mike Rollins, used to race when he was younger, but he had to stop due to an injury to his right leg. He can still run a bit and sometimes trains with Gail, but it's tough for him when she overtakes him and he can't keep up. Gail trains hard, doing a long run in the morning and fast runs in the afternoon. She always takes a break from running on Sundays. ""I am with her all the time,"" says Mike. ""Sometimes I ask, 'Are you sure you should be eating that?' It's usually about cakes, but she can eat almost anything."""
KET_52,"Text: 'Piano players - when they were young

Ivan Petrov

Ivan was born on a farm in Russia. From age twelve to eighteen, he studied in Poland. His first music teacher couldn't play the piano but taught him and his sister opera songs. Ivan's mother started teaching him piano when he was six. By ten, he wanted to write music and soon composed his first song.

Oleg Gagarin

Oleg was the youngest of five children. At four, his father, who enjoyed playing the piano, taught him traditional Russian music. When Oleg was six, he began lessons with a piano teacher in his city. He quickly started winning prizes for his piano skills. At fourteen, he attended a music college in Austria for two years before returning to Russia.

Josef Heptmann

Josef's father was German and taught music in Poland, where Josef was born. The family moved to Germany when Josef was two, and he began playing the piano a year later. He gave his first concert at six. At ten, he performed fifty-two concerts in two months during a trip to England! Josef always loved music but was also interested in physics and languages. He is very busy now, but he hopes to write his own music one day.'"
KET_28,"Bill Prince-Smith was a farmer, teacher, and dentist before he started writing children's books at 60. Now, 13 years later, he has written over 80 books. Every day, he writes in his office and in the evening, he gives his work to his wife to read. ""She tells me if she doesn't like something,"" Bill says. His ten grandchildren, who don't live nearby, also read his stories and give their opinions. This feedback helps Bill understand what young children enjoy reading. 

Bill writes about life in his village and the nearby farms. His favorite book is his fifth one, ""The Sheepdog,"" which is about a farmer and his helpful dog. ""I have always liked animals,"" Bill says, ""and dogs are very smart; they learn quickly."" Last year, ""The Sheepdog"" was made into a film using real animals and actors. The filmmakers used the latest computer technology to make it look like the animals are talking. Bill was very happy with the film. ""Sometimes filmmakers change books, but they didn't change mine, and I love the film,"" he says."
KET_35,"Text: 'POSTCARDS Today, people enjoy sending postcards to their friends and family. These postcards usually have pictures of beaches, mountains, or castles, and you can write a message on the back. Many people send postcards while on holiday because they are inexpensive, and the pictures are often better than their own photos. The first postcard was sent at the end of the nineteenth century, featuring a picture of a seaside town. Later, postcards showed pictures of current news events, like accidents or visits from important people. People liked these because newspapers didn't have pictures at that time.'"
KET_5,"Text: 'Dinosaurs No one has ever seen a dinosaur because they died out about 60 million years ago, long before humans existed. We don't know exactly why they became extinct. Birds are the closest living relatives to dinosaurs. Dinosaurs varied in appearance. There were over 5000 different types. Some were very small, while others were enormous. The largest dinosaurs were bigger than any other land animals that have ever lived. For instance, the Brontosaurus was twenty meters long and ate plants. The Tyrannosaurus Rex wasn't as large, but it was more powerful. It had sharp teeth for eating meat and could run fast due to its long back legs.'"
KET_41,"Text: 'BEARS Bears can be dangerous animals. Adult bears are very strong and can kill a person. They are good at climbing trees and can run very fast. However, they do not see well and, like most animals, they use their noses to find food. There are seven types of bears. The largest is the white polar bear, which can be almost three meters tall. There are two types of black bears: one lives in the forests of North America, and the other lives in Southeast Asia. Not all black bears are actually black; they can be dark brown or reddish brown. The black and white panda bear, which everyone loves, comes from China. Today, not many pandas live in the forest because it is hard for them to find food.'"
KET_38,"CROCODILES

Crocodiles live in tropical areas around the world, such as Africa, South America, and Northern Australia. They usually stay in slow-moving water but can move quickly both in water and on land. You often see crocodiles in large groups. They eat anything they can catch, including fish, birds, and small animals. Sometimes, they even eat large animals or people. There are more than ten different types of crocodiles, and all of them have very sharp teeth. They often lose their teeth, but new ones grow back quickly. Crocodiles are usually about 3.5 meters long, but some can be much larger. They can live for a long time; the oldest crocodile in a zoo lived to be 66 years old."
KET_17,"**A History of Air Travel**

In 1783, two French brothers created the first hot air balloon that could carry people. Then, 120 years later, in 1903, the Wright brothers in the United States built the first airplane with an engine and flew it. By 1918, the US Post Office started the first airmail service. Over the next thirty years, airplanes underwent significant changes. In the 1950s, they became much faster due to the introduction of jet engines. In 1976, the Concorde was developed in the UK and France. It is the fastest passenger plane in the world, capable of flying at 2500 kilometers per hour, making the trip from London to New York just four hours long. Today, millions of people travel by airplane, and it's hard to imagine a world without them."
KET_47,"Text: 'The Globe Theatre Visiting the theatre in London 400 years ago was very different from today. The Globe Theatre was a round building without a roof, so people got cold and wet if it rained. The queen enjoyed going to the Globe Theatre by the River Thames to watch plays by William Shakespeare. At that time, all the actors were men. Visitors would eat, talk to friends, walk around during the show, and some even threw things at the actors! Today, you can still visit the Globe Theatre. A new theatre is in the same area near the river. You can watch a Shakespeare play there or learn about life in the seventeenth century.'"
KET_48,"Dear Jeff,

I'm having a great holiday in Australia. When we arrived two weeks ago, the weather was bad and it was cold. Now the weather is better, and we go to the beach every day. This week, we are staying in Sydney, but last week we visited the Great Barrier Reef. The water was so warm, and I loved swimming there. The fish were all different colors: red, yellow, purple! Australia is very beautiful. We don't want to come home!

See you at the end of September.

Sue"
