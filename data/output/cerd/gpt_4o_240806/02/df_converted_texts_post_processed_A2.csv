CPE_15,C2,"Title: Paying for Rubbish: Does It Work?
In many places, families do not pay directly for the rubbish they throw away. They pay through local taxes, but a family that throws away a lot of rubbish pays the same as a family that throws away a little. This can be a problem because more rubbish means more work and costs for the city.
One idea is to make families pay for each bag of rubbish. This might make them throw away less and recycle more. Some cities in America tried this. They sold stickers for rubbish bags, and only bags with stickers were collected.
In Charlottesville, Virginia, people had to pay 80 cents for each bag. The number of bags went down by 37%, but people just put more rubbish in each bag. The weight of rubbish only went down by 14%. Some people even dumped rubbish illegally to avoid paying.
Recycling went up by 15%, but many people were already recycling before the new rule. The study found that raising the price of stickers did not reduce rubbish by much. A 10% increase in price only reduced rubbish by 0.3%.
The study suggests that other things, like income and education, might affect how much rubbish people throw away. Richer towns throw away more rubbish and recycle less because people have less time.
Charging for rubbish is not a bad idea, but it is complicated. Simple solutions can have unexpected results, and sometimes we need detailed studies to understand them."
CPE_19,C2,"Theodore Zeldin talks about how our work life might change. Do you feel respected and appreciated at work? Just having a successful career is not enough anymore. Many people feel their jobs are not valued or understood. Even famous people can feel unhappy. Loving your job used to be special, but now you need to think about how your job affects you as a person. Does it help your mind, character, and relationships? This is important. If your job makes you boring or too busy to learn new things, then no amount of money or status can make up for that. 
Zeldin wants to find out how work can help us grow as people, not just be a way to make money. Work should be a good part of life, helping us find new talents and meet different people. But this doesn't mean getting rid of unemployment is the only goal. As people get more educated, they want jobs that are interesting and useful. Work should be like a piece of art, with a happy person at the center.
Many jobs, like doctors and accountants, are not as appealing as they used to be. Doctors are often stressed, and accountants worry about their job's ethics. Architects can't always be creative, and managers are stuck in bureaucracy. Many workers feel their values don't match their company's values.
Zeldin is studying different jobs to see how they affect people. He looks at what makes people happy and respected. He wants to find better ways for people to earn a living. It's not just about making money; it's about finding the right people to work with and feeling alive at work.
For example, hotel workers often have low pay and long hours, but they have a lot of potential. Hotels could be more than just places to sleep; they could be cultural centers where people from different countries meet and learn from each other. Hotel staff could use their skills and knowledge more, but they are often limited by the focus on profit.
Zeldin believes work is about relationships. People want to be independent and choose their jobs and colleagues. They need to communicate well with others, even if they are from different fields. Good conversation is important because it helps people understand each other and creates respect. Every time we have a meaningful conversation, the world changes a little bit."
CPE_24,C2,"**Broadcasting: The Social Shaping of a Technology**
The word 'broadcasting' originally meant spreading seeds by hand. It is a metaphor for planned growth and success. Broadcasting involves central resources that spread information. This text explores why new technology, like TV, was organized in a way that fits this metaphor. 
TV is similar to other communication tools like the telegraph and telephone. But, unlike them, TV was seen as a one-way, mass medium from the start. This fit the way modern societies were organized. Some people tried different ways to use TV, but these were just experiments.
In the 1930s, some people in Britain tried to use TV like a telephone. Magazines showed how to build TV equipment. But big companies set standards that stopped these small experiments. So, TV did not become a two-way communication tool.
In the USA, TV was first used in theaters and was seen as a competitor to movies. In Britain and Germany, people watched TV in public places. The idea of two-way TV was not popular, and public TV viewing was more common.
Manufacturers wanted to sell TVs for home use. As people earned more money, they could buy TVs for entertainment at home. This happened in many Western countries and is now happening worldwide.
Broadcasting became important for governments to share information with everyone. It helped create a sense of community in countries. Broadcasting was seen as a way to give people equal access to information and participate in society.
Today, TV is changing, and the idea of broadcasting might change too. Broadcasting might be seen as a way of using technology during a certain time in history."
CPE_13,C2,"**Clutter**
Sometimes, it feels like no matter how many things you have, you never feel safe. It's normal to want a home that meets your needs, but sometimes wanting more things can get out of control. Modern ads are made to make us feel insecure. They tell us, ""If you don't have this, you are not good enough."" To see how much ads affect you, try not to read any billboards next time you walk down the street. These expensive ads make us want to buy things without us even knowing it. We see them everywhere - on TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, t-shirts, the internet - all telling us to buy more.
**Caves**
Scientists and researchers around the world study caves. They want to know how caves started, how water moves in them, and what lives inside them. Caves are a small but interesting part of nature. They make us curious and we want to learn more about them. Many people have studied caves for a long time, especially in places where caves are important to our lives. But visiting caves can be hard because you need to be fit. So, both scientists and people who like to explore caves for fun study them together.
**Weather Watch**
A long time ago, people watched the weather with just their eyes and senses. This helped start the science of weather, called meteorology. Today, we use satellites and computers to get weather information quickly. Computers can solve hard math problems very fast. Meteorology uses big words that are hard to understand for most people. But simple weather knowledge is still important. Human experience helps turn computer data into weather forecasts. People can still notice things about the weather that help scientists understand it better."
CPE_16,C2,"**Music and Theatre**
Not long ago, I thought opera was mostly about theatre. But after working at an opera house, I learned that music is the most important part of opera. In theatre, the words and the actors are the main focus. The actors and the audience usually speak the same language. 
At a music concert or opera, many people, like me, might not know much about music. Some might feel embarrassed about this, but most are amazed by the performers' skills. Watching a great musician is like watching athletes; we see how much better they are than us. 
Theatre audiences have different expectations. They might not understand an actor's skill and often think they could do it too. They are not usually impressed by long speeches, though they often ask actors, ""How do you remember all those lines?"" 
This doesn't mean theatre audiences are easier to please. Many people go to both theatre and music events. In theatre, audiences and performers are more equal, no matter how difficult the play is. 
Can music learn from theatre? I think so. Music performances are full of emotion and can be like theatre. But music events often feel formal, with strict dress codes and a focus on conductors and soloists. This can make the audience feel less important. 
Sometimes, music audiences clap at the wrong times, which can interrupt the performance. But many things are being done to make music more welcoming. For example, Jonathan Dove's opera ""In Search of Angels"" was performed in different places, making it a special experience for the audience. 
I wish music had more of the excitement and risk that theatre can have. Sometimes, performing in unusual places can surprise both the audience and performers. It might be uncomfortable, but theatre audiences are used to following artists to new places. 
Most plays are performed in a traditional way, like music concerts. But I believe music events can change. I love both theatre and music and want more people to enjoy them as much as I do."
CPE_21,C2,"**Sand**
I think sand is amazing because it can become things like glass and concrete. But, I don't like sand when it's just sand. For me, it's a problem between the car park and the sea. It blows in your face, gets in your food, and hides things like keys and coins. When you are wet, sand sticks to you and is hard to remove. But when you step on a towel, get in a car, or walk on a clean carpet, it falls off. For days, you find sand on the floor when you take off your shoes and socks. Sand stays with you for a long time. I don't like sand.
**Lock and Key**
People have always wanted safe homes. Long ago, they used a beam to lock the door. Now, we have electronic locks with many combinations. But people still like using a key. Some companies tried using smart cards for locks, but people prefer keys at home. One company made an electronic lock with a real key because people like it.
**Modern Art**
I was worried about visiting the new Tate Modern gallery because I don't understand modern art. I like some things, like furry art, neon lights, and big photos. Maybe if I knew more, I would have more opinions. Art is not about understanding but feeling it. This idea is nice, but it doesn't work for me. The new gallery helps visitors understand art better. They have labels that explain the art and what it means. This helped me understand the art better."
CPE_46,C2,"**Every Picture Tells a Story**
When books are made into movies, a lot of the story is cut or changed. This can be hard for the writer, but it can also be interesting. When I worked on a movie script, I saw that I could remove a lot of the talking and details from the book and still tell the same story. This doesn't mean the book's words were not needed. It's about how each type of story, book or movie, needs different things. In books, we often see repeated details about characters and who is speaking. This helps us understand better. In plays, which are mostly talking, the extra words make it feel like real speech. Some modern plays use a lot of extra words that don't add much to the story, just to show people are talking.
**Watching Movies**
When we watch movies, we can feel like we are part of the movie world. It's like we leave our real life for a while. But when the movie ends, we come back to the real world. Some people used to think movies were just for fun, not art. They liked watching movies but didn't think they were important.
**The Film Studios**
The Leiper Film Company studios had many different buildings. It was hard to find your way around because everything looked the same. There were three main entrances, but only one took you where you wanted to go. It was confusing for new people, but the people who worked there knew their way. The studio made movies that helped people escape from their everyday problems for a few hours.
**Film-makers**
Many people want to make movies. There are many books and courses about how to write scripts and make films. Some people, like Robert Rodriguez, became famous by making a movie with a small budget. He made his first big movie when he was young. In the past, filmmakers took more time to learn their skills. They worked on small projects before making big movies. Now, without big studios to help, new filmmakers have to be more independent."
CPE_3,C2,"In those days, many council houses were on the west side of the city. They were small and not very nice, made of orange bricks or white stucco. In summer, a factory two miles away made the air smell bad, like sulphur. In the morning, you could see paperboys holding their noses because of the smell.
I don't remember much from my early life. But I do remember sitting near a window and looking at the houses. I also remember faces I can't name, my mother ironing towels in a house that might not have been ours, and snow falling on a big mansion.
My mother was a small, often angry woman. I didn't understand why she was angry, so I couldn't make her happy. Even as a child, I knew she was different. She was very lonely, even in a room full of people. She liked things to be proper and clean, which was not common where we lived. She often told me to 'behave properly'. This meant not going into neighbors' gardens, sitting quietly for a long time, and listening to radio shows she liked.
My mother had some friends. There was Mrs. Buddery, who liked the Royal Family, Mrs. Winall, who didn't talk much, and Mrs. Laband, who was more lively. They often talked about things like bad legs, cold weather, and ungrateful children. I often felt like they were talking about me.
Growing up in West Earlham was the same for everyone. Until you were five, you stayed at home. I remember playing on a rug while my mother sat in a chair. After your fifth birthday, you went to Avenue Road infants school. Some kids had a mother with a bike to take them. My mother let other kids take me to school.
I remember the summer holidays. Sometimes, I saw the world outside West Earlham. There was an old man who told stories about the Merchant Navy. Once, I went to a charity event where a woman gave out lemonade and talked about a group called the League of Pity. My mother didn't like it because she thought they just wanted money.
My mother didn't like politicians. She thought they were greedy. But she cared about my education. Sometimes, she took me to the Norwich Castle Museum. We looked at paintings, and she even made a joke once about a painting of a Roman soldier."
CPE_10,C2,"**Philadelphia Avenue**
I walked down Philadelphia Avenue on one side of the street. It was getting dark, and the air was wet and sticky. I felt like I was sneaking around. I knew this street well because I grew up here. My neighbors were the Matzes and the Pritchards, and there was Han Kieffer's grocery store. My first friends lived in the houses of the Krings and the Pottses. I didn't know everyone by name, but each house was special to me. As I moved down the street, I noticed the houses changed. The porches were lower, and the front yards were smaller. Over time, some houses became stores, and some stores became homes again. I wondered how people lived in these places that used to be shops.
**Bachelor Fads**
Rick Gilbert is a furniture designer. He lives in a flat that used to be a curtain warehouse. The flat has big brick walls and large doors. Rick didn't want an open space, so he used a big plastic sheet to make a hallway and hide his office. This way, the kitchen is in the middle, and he can use it for cooking or meeting clients. He used light wood for the floors and mixed modern furniture with old pieces from his family.
**Bruce Chatwin**
Bruce Chatwin was a writer who loved to travel. His life was full of secrets and stories. His first book, ""In Patagonia,"" was published in 1977. It was a travel book that was very exciting and different. Chatwin sometimes changed facts to make his stories more interesting. He believed that traveling could help people discover amazing stories from the past.
**Swimming**
One summer, it rained a lot, and I went swimming in the pool behind my house. The rain made bubbles on the water, and it was very peaceful. During this time, I thought about swimming across Britain. I wanted to follow the rain to the sea and explore new places. Swimming, like walking and cycling, helps us see the world in a different way. It lets us find places that are still wild and mysterious."
CPE_67,C2,"'CRYING Charles Darwin thought that crying did not have a clear purpose for humans. He was probably wrong. Scientists now say crying is important for social reasons. Psychiatrist John Bowlby said crying helps mothers and children become close. Many people think children cry because they feel helpless. But why adults cry is harder to understand. The sound of crying is less important than seeing someone cry. In early human groups, crying might have helped people trust each other and feel connected. We can cry for other reasons too. We might cry to show we care about people who are treated unfairly. Sometimes, we cry without wanting to, like when we hear beautiful music or speeches. We might cry during a sad movie, especially when we are with others. Crying seems to have a social purpose, but scientists are still studying it.'"
CPE_27,C2,"**The Heat is On**
We all know about global warming, but how much warmer will the Earth get, and how will it change our lives? Many people have an idea of what global warming is, but we are not sure about what will happen because of it. A warmer climate will probably change the weather everywhere in the world. Since the air is connected to everything on Earth, changes in climate will affect plants, animals, water, and soil. Humans use these natural resources to grow food, build cities, and support many people. So, changes to these resources are important.
The problem is knowing how the world will change and what is causing these changes. In the last 100 years, human actions have increased some gases in the air, which are related to global temperature. These gases are likely affecting the climate now and will continue to do so. We know that greenhouse gases and global temperatures have changed together over the past 40,000 years. This shows they are probably connected. Evidence suggests the Earth's surface has warmed by about 6°C in the last century. Most scientists think this is not natural and is partly due to human pollution.
Scientists use computer programs called general circulation models (GCMs) to predict what will happen with higher global temperatures. These programs use physics and chemistry to study temperature, pressure, and other climate factors. However, they are not perfect and are expensive to use. We do not fully understand all climate processes, but we know it is complex. Despite these challenges, most people agree that climate change will happen faster than before.
GCMs predict that by 2100, the average global temperature will rise by 1°C to 3.5°C, sea levels will rise by 15-95 cm, and rainfall patterns will change. Extreme weather like heatwaves, floods, and droughts may become more common. These changes will affect the environment and humans. Climate change can change where forests and grasslands are, the species they have, and their benefits to us. This includes food, water, and where we live. Some effects may be bad, but not all. Some changes might be good. For example, in Australia, warmer temperatures have helped wheat grow better since 1952.
However, many future effects of climate warming are not good. Small climate changes can affect water availability, especially in dry areas. Problems may start in places where there is already little water. The Mediterranean Basin is one example, where less rain has been seen in some areas. Rain is now more in autumn and winter, less in spring.
Another problem is changes to glaciers. This will affect ice, plants, animals, and human structures. The Arctic ice might melt completely, which could help marine transport but also increase iceberg dangers. The most visible effect of global warming might be rising sea levels. Warmer water takes up more space, and melting ice adds more water. Many people live near coasts, so rising sea levels could cause big problems. Cities like London, New York, and Tokyo might face flooding. Many people could lose their homes and become environmental refugees. Small island countries could disappear if the worst happens, affecting their people and culture."
CPE_66,C2,"'Mission to Mars Wanted: a middle-aged, married couple for a 501-day trip to Mars and back. Applicants must be strong and healthy. This is the plan of millionaire Dennis Tito, who wants to send a spaceship on 5 January 2018. The spaceship will go about 160 km above Mars. It will use Mars's gravity to come back to Earth without using more fuel. This is important because the next chance to go to Mars after 2018 is in 2031. New technology is needed for this mission. If everything is ready in time, the spaceship might go. Even if it doesn't, the work will help future space missions.'"
CPE_44,C2,"**Aesthetics**
Sometimes, art can make it hard to understand what art really means. Art is often seen as just a building, book, painting, or statue, separate from our everyday life. But real art is about what it does to our experiences. Some art is so admired that it becomes hard to see it in new ways. When art becomes famous, it can feel separate from the people and times that created it. This makes it hard to understand its true meaning.
Art is often put in a special place, away from other human activities. People who study art need to connect art with everyday life. Just like mountains are part of the earth, art is part of our experiences. To understand art, we need to look at everyday things, not just the art itself. 
We can enjoy flowers without knowing how they grow, but to understand them, we need to learn about soil, air, water, and sunlight. The same goes for art. We should start with simple experiences that catch our attention and make us happy.
Many people enjoy things like movies, jazz, and comics without thinking of them as art. When art is only in museums, people find joy in everyday things around them. Some people think art is only in special places, but real art is also in our daily lives. When art is connected to everyday work and life, people appreciate it more."
CPE_22,C2,"**Observing Lions**
People often think of lions as amazing hunters. They imagine lions working together like a team to catch their food. In the evening, lions quietly come out of the shadows and surround their prey. Lions seem to be very social animals, working together for a common goal, which is to get their next meal. But after watching lions for many years, we have learned something different. We started studying lions in 1978. We wanted to know why lions hunt together, take care of their cubs, and scare away other animals with loud roars. If an animal's success is measured by how many babies it has that survive, then working together might not always be good. If an animal is too nice, others might take advantage of it. So, why do lions work together? We thought we would find the answer in two to three years. But lions are very good at doing nothing. It took us a long time to learn about their behavior. Wild lions can live up to 18 years, so we are only now starting to understand them.
**Pop Music Review**
Bedrock's third album was very important for the band. The album, called ""New Life,"" changed rock music in the country for the next ten years. The old style of rock music was serious and had loud guitars. The new style was lighter and mixed different sounds. The album had songs about everyday life and feelings. It also had fun sounds like fairground organs and brass bands. The band used humor and did not hide where they came from. The album showed that Bedrock was good at writing songs and mixing different styles. Some songs were about simple things like sunbathing and Sunday afternoons. But the best songs were deeper and more emotional, like ""So Low"" and ""To the Brink."" The album had 16 great songs with no bad ones, which was rare for long CDs.
**Extract from an Autobiography**
As a child, I loved stories about ""The Sibyl,"" wise women from ancient times. My mother told me a story about one Sibyl. She offered nine books to the King of Rome for 300 gold pieces. He said no, so she burned three books and offered six for the same price. He said no again, so she burned three more. He finally bought the last three books for 300 gold pieces. I learned a lesson from this story about selling and life. I was often a lonely child. I wanted to play with other kids, but they said no. My mother told me to do something fun so other kids would want to join me. It worked, and I never forgot that lesson. When I got a chance to write a travel book, I wanted to find something interesting to write about. I don't like traveling much, so I told my editor where I didn't want to go. I like to visit old places because I enjoy thinking about the past.
**What Becomes of Your Manuscript?**
When you send your book to a publisher, it goes into a big pile called the ""slush pile."" A junior editor or an experienced person who works part-time will look at it. They want to find something new and interesting. If they like your book, they will show it to a senior editor. Then, it will be discussed in a meeting. The editor will need to explain why your book is good and if it can sell well. They will also think about if you, as an author, can write more books in the future. They might want to meet you before deciding to publish your book."
CPE_39,C2,"**Advertising Challenges in the Early 1990s**
If you worked in advertising in the early 1990s, it was a tough time. The economy was bad, and it was worse than expected. In Britain, in 1991, the economy shrank, interest rates were high, people spent less money, many lost their jobs, and many homes were taken back by banks. Every business was affected, especially car and building companies, which lost 30% of their business. Many people and companies in different countries suffered.
Advertising people were not the only ones losing jobs, but those who kept their jobs felt a lot of pressure. They had to help companies make money with less money for advertising. They were told to do more with less. At the same time, marketing became more important. Companies started to focus on making products that customers wanted, not just what was easy to make. This change made marketing more respected but also more challenging.
Marketing was seen as a solution to many problems, and a lot of money was spent on advertising. But in the 1990s, the advertising industry faced its worst time in years. The bad economy made companies look closely at how much they spent on advertising. They wanted to know if it was worth the money. Many companies were not sure if advertising was giving them good results.
Companies wanted better advertising strategies and creativity. They wanted the best people working hard for them. Advertising people had to find ways to do more with less money. This was hard because of the recession and other changes like new laws, changing customer needs, and advertising in other countries.
The pressure was on to make advertising work better. But help was not easy to find. Companies and advertising agencies were busy dealing with these problems and did not share their secrets. Books and seminars did not always provide useful information. They often made advertising seem better than it was, which did not help those responsible for it."
CPE_18,C2,"**The Lure of the Kitchen**
When I was at university, I wanted to be a chef. This was not a common choice among my friends. Cooking is not an easy job. Chefs work long hours, have a lot of pressure, and do not earn much money. But I still wanted to be a chef. I was not happy at university. The work was hard, and the social life was not fun. Being a chef seemed like a good change. It felt more real and honest than my life at college. My love for cooking also came from a special meal I had at a famous restaurant in London. The food was amazing, and I wanted to learn how to cook like that. I started reading cookbooks, visiting markets, and making fancy meals. My history degree was not important to me anymore.
**The Swimming Lesson**
The swimming teacher at my school was a small, strong man with tattoos. He used to be a drill sergeant. I asked him to teach me how to dive. He told me to sit at the edge of the pool, put my hands above my head, and roll forward. I practiced this for an hour. Next time, he taught me to dive standing up. He was very strict and always told me to keep my legs straight and point my toes. The next week, I tried diving from the high board. It was very high, and I was scared. I tried to remember what he taught me and jumped. For a moment, I felt like I was flying. When I hit the water, my dive was not good, but I felt very happy. I understood what it means to feel 'free as a bird.'
**The Traveller**
Some people love adventure and do not care about comfort. They climb dangerous mountains, sail alone in the sea, and eat strange foods. These people are different from most of us. We like our comfortable beds and safe lives. We think these adventurers are strange, but they live in a world we do not understand. We are happy with our microwaves and phones, and the only danger we face is crossing a busy street.
**Sailing**
Jonathan Raban is a writer who is afraid of the sea, but he spends a lot of time sailing. He is not the best sailor, but he is good enough. He sails because he likes to write about it. Sailing gives him exciting stories to tell. His boat has a device that shows his exact location on the sea. He likes this device, but he thinks other sailing tools, like the compass, have changed how people connect with the sea. Before the compass, sailors had to watch the waves and feel the sea. Now, they just follow the compass, and the sea is just a big space. This is why Raban has time to look at the waves carefully."
CPE_62,C2,"**Holiday Reading**
Summer gives us two great joys: leaving home and reading books. These joys are connected. Books help us feel at home in the world. We can see our own experiences in stories from long ago or far away. In books, we find our own thoughts and feelings. Authors can describe things we feel but cannot say. They write clearly about things we find confusing. This is amazing, especially if the book is from a different place or time. We feel thankful to these writers for helping us understand ourselves. 
Reading and travel help us see new things. When we go to a new place, everything is interesting. The same happens when we read a great book. It shows us things we did not notice before. We start to see the colors of the sky, changes in a friend's face, or feelings we did not know we had.
**Author's Note**
These travel stories were first in the Observer newspaper over seven years. I made some small changes, but not many. I fixed a few mistakes. In one story about China, I thought the Hong Kong dollar would stay strong, but it fell later. I did not change the story because it was written at that time. Like other travelers, I was there, not knowing what would happen next. This is the story of travel: seeing the world with just a ticket. I believe travelers can see things clearly. Even a postcard can have a purpose.
**Ecotourism**
The word 'ecotourism' is often used wrongly. It started in the 1980s when people cared more about the environment. Travelers wanted to know their trips did not harm nature. Now, 'ecotourism' can mean many things, like living with tribes or a short boat trip. It includes cultural visits, nature, wildlife, or adventure. The original idea was good, helping people make smart choices. But without clear rules, travelers can get confused about what is true ecotourism.
**Transylvanian Journey**
I lost my notebook from my trip to Transylvania for 50 years. I found it again by luck. It helped me remember that time, but not perfectly. In Transylvania, I stayed in friendly homes for weeks. When I stopped moving, I stopped writing. I thought there was nothing to write about. When I traveled again, I wrote only short notes. I worried about the order of events when writing this book. But then I decided it was okay to let the story tell itself."
CPE_49,C2,"**Fashion**
Fashion is not just a new thing. It did not start only in the 1800s and 1900s with big businesses. Fashion, like style and design, has been around for a long time. Many people who study fashion say it started in the 1500s and 1600s when people began trading more. As societies grew and more clothes and accessories were made, the meanings of clothes also became more complicated. Today, it is hard to say exactly what any piece of clothing means. For example, a man's suit can mean different things to different people and in different situations.
**Writer**
People often think that all writers are very successful because of stories about big deals for new books. But for most writers, life is not like that. Many writers have other jobs during the day and write in the evenings. This way, they have a steady job even if their book does not sell well. Some writers, like me, do different small jobs, like teaching or writing articles, to make money. I have heard about writing jobs at a chocolate factory, but I have never had one. By doing different jobs and with help from friends, I can still write my book.
**Sudden Fame**
Our small shows around the country started to sell out, and we needed more security to handle the many excited fans. We had to use secret ways to enter the places we played to avoid being surrounded by fans. On nights when we were not performing, it was hard to go out without being followed by fans. In just a few days, we became famous. Our fans watched everything we did, and our managers took care of all our needs. Even though I was always shy, I started to feel very confident, which is a strange feeling for shy people in such situations. In short, I felt very overwhelmed."
CPE_31,C2,"**Music - The Future Ahead**
Technology is changing how we live, work, and enjoy our free time. Susan Hallam talks about how this affects music in Britain. In the late 20th century, we had more ways to listen to music, like radio, TV, records, tapes, CDs, and videos. But, there were fewer live music shows and jobs for musicians. More people can listen to music now, and this will probably continue because music is important to us. Music is part of big events in the country and gives people many ways to enjoy it, both formally and informally. A world without music is hard to imagine. The question is not if there will be music in the 21st century, but what kind of music it will be and if people will still want to learn to play instruments. I think people will still want to learn. The music industry makes a lot of money in Britain, and musical skills will still be important for jobs, especially in media. Playing an instrument can also help develop skills early on. Research in the USA shows that music can help with spatial reasoning, a part of intelligence. In Europe, group music lessons have shown to help with social skills and focus in children. Playing an instrument might also help with skills like good study habits and being organized. Because of these reasons, people will still want to learn instruments in the short term. 
What about the future? Will things change, and how? I think two things might happen. First, people will listen to more types of music. New styles will mix different kinds of music. Second, technology will be used more to make and play music. This will make it easier for people to create music without needing a lot of technical skill, but it might also mean fewer live performances. More people of all ages might want to make music together in their communities, reflecting their local music traditions. 
To prepare for this future, music teaching needs to change. More people should be able to learn different instruments throughout their lives. This means the way we teach and measure progress in music will need to change to include more musical skills. Musicians will need to learn how to inspire and teach people of all ages, work with large groups, and have skills for community work. This is a big change from how things are done now. It will also mean showing the public the value of music education. 
Finally, we need to make music more important in our lives. Music is crucial, but often we don't notice it. Everyone in the music profession should work together to change this."
CPE_58,C2,"**The Actor's Craft**
Sometimes people make fun of actors. This happens because actors often talk about their work in interviews. They should be like the dancer Pavlova, who said, ""If I could tell you, I wouldn't dance it."" But instead, actors often say things that sound silly or are just gossip. Paul Scofield, a famous actor, said that acting is interesting only when you do it. Talking about it makes it seem less real. Every time an actor starts a new play, they learn everything again. When the play ends, they feel empty until the next one.
**A Review of Hamlet**
Adrian Lester plays Hamlet, a young man between being a boy and a man. His acting is simple and confident. He uses the words and his body very well. Lester's Hamlet is a young man who is angry but also funny and kind. His acting is very good. You can see how he uses his body, like his arms, to show his feelings. Another actor, Handy, also shows this in his role as Horatio. Acting makes us ask: What is acting? What is real behavior? Who makes these characters come alive?
**One Director's Approach to Rehearsal**
This director starts rehearsals with a method called ""dropping in."" The stage manager shows the script on a screen. Actors listen quietly when others speak. When it's their turn, they read the line, think about it, and then speak. For example, if the line is ""Queuing all night, the rain, do you remember?"" they breathe, imagine the scene, and then speak. The director says not to plan too much. Just be open and trust that something will happen.
**The Perfect Theatre**
The perfect theatre makes you feel like you matter. Going to the theatre is special, and the staff should know that too. The theatre should connect the actors and the audience. Everyone should be able to see and hear well. The size of the theatre is important. It should fit the human voice and body. Many old theatres did this well. They feel like they have history, like old church steps. You can't please everyone with a play. People want to see something new and surprising."
CPE_37,C2,"**Paul Simon and Rock and Roll**
In the 1950s, rock and roll was very popular with young people. But it also changed the lives of older people and the middle class. It helped create new rock stars. These young people listened to rock and roll and knew it would be important for their future. Paul Simon, like many young people in the US, heard this exciting new music on Alan Freed's radio show, Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party. This show was very important for young people who wanted to become rock stars. Just like John Lennon in Liverpool, who listened to Radio Luxembourg, Paul Simon loved the music from Freed's show. He wanted to stop just listening and start making his own music.
**Snow Adventure**
There was no clear path, but I thought I could walk safely if I was careful. The wind was strong and pushed me down as I slipped on the ice. Suddenly, the snow under me broke, and I fell into a hole about four feet deep. The snow had covered a gap between two rocks, and I fell through a thin layer of snow. I climbed out, feeling scared and thinking about what I would do if the hole was deeper. I sat against a pine tree sticking out of the snow to think about my situation. In one hour, I had only walked half a mile. I knew I had to change my plan.
**Qualitative Research**
There are many books that help researchers with qualitative research. These books talk a lot about collecting data, but not much about how to analyze it. Many people find data analysis confusing. So, we asked different social scientists to talk about how they analyze data. The goal was to share ideas and understanding about data analysis, not to make a guidebook. We wanted to make the process clearer. This is not easy, so we let our contributors share their work in different ways, like personal stories or more formal writing."
CPE_2,C2,"**Screen Learning**
A few days ago, I saw my six-year-old eating noodles in a funny way. He was pulling them up with his teeth and trying to look like a dinosaur. He said, ""I'm a little dinosaur."" He was copying a scene from a TV show. I asked him what he remembered about dinosaurs, but he didn't remember much. Many people like using the internet and computers for learning, but is it a good way to learn? One father tried an interactive program with his son. The father read the words, but the son only played with the pictures. The father thought, ""If he had spent ten minutes with a book, he might have learned something."" TV, like my son and his noodles show, gives ideas but not always learning. Research says learning happens best with teachers or parents talking with children. New technology can help teach, but schools are still important.
**Hollywood**
By 1918, most of the world's film-making moved to Hollywood. People living there didn't like it at first. They thought the new people were not polite. But they accepted it because Hollywood became successful. Success in Hollywood means making a lot of money from movies. Hollywood knows a good movie when it sees one. In less than 100 years, Hollywood became as famous as New York, Rome, or Paris. It changed a lot. A long time ago, there were orange trees and a small store. Now, it is a big place, but still feels like a small town. People in Hollywood talk about movies, who is dating who, and who is working on what project. Successful people often want to leave, but many people in show-business still come to Hollywood.
**Photography**
Photography was created by artists in the 1800s. They wanted to keep a real record of what they saw. They used light, lenses, and chemicals to make pictures. These pictures were more real and detailed than paintings. Some artists didn't like this and said photography wasn't art. They thought it was too real and not creative. But photographers knew they found a new way to show the world. They used cameras like other artists use brushes and pencils. They wanted to show nature and people in a new way.
**Book Illustration**
In the past, every children's book had pictures. This was also true for many novels for older kids. But over time, there were fewer pictures in books. Children's publishing was busy, but it didn't have a lot of money. This meant some work was not very good, but the best artists always did their best. The old black-and-white pictures are like a mix of junk and treasure. They are great for research or just looking at. Some of these treasures are coming back. They might be reprinted or shown in exhibitions. Soon, a smart publisher might make a series of classic children's book pictures from this time."
CPE_68,C2,"**Blogging: Sharing with the World**
Some time ago, a website talked about the dangers of telling everyone where you are online. The website said that when you say, ""Hey, I'm at this place,"" you are also telling everyone, even people you don't know, that you are not at home. This made people think about the problems of sharing too much online. The internet lets us share everything about our lives with many people. This can be exciting because it might bring us money or fame. So, we start sharing our secrets, photos, and stories online. But later, we might find out that it can be dangerous and confusing.
This might sound sad, but don't worry. Some people have already explored this online world before us. They were the first bloggers. They lost jobs, made and lost friends, and dealt with being famous, all before social media was popular. These bloggers have learned lessons that we can learn from too.
In January 1994, a 19-year-old student named Justin Hall started sharing his life on the internet. Back then, the internet was mostly used by students and scientists. Hall saw it as a way to share his life story. He wrote about everything, and people loved reading about his adventures. But one day, he had to stop because his girlfriend said, ""Either the blog goes, or I do."" He learned that sharing too much online can make people not trust you.
In 2002, Heather Armstrong, who worked in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She wrote about her job sometimes. One day, someone at her job shared her blog with her bosses, and she lost her job. This shows that what we say online can affect our real lives. But Armstrong's story ended well. She got married, started blogging again about her family, and now her blog helps support her family. She learned that just because we can say anything online, it doesn't mean we should."
CPE_23,C2,"'Enough Sleep? Many people today feel tired all the time. In busy and rich countries, people often have trouble sleeping and feel anxious. In the USA, 40 million people have sleep problems. Some books in Britain talk about people who can't sleep or about places where people study sleep. People are interested in sleep, how it works, and why we have problems with it. A sleep expert says, 'People need more sleep. They wake up early to avoid traffic.' A researcher did an experiment. He let people sleep up to 14 hours a night for a month. After three weeks, they slept about eight hours a night. This shows they needed more sleep before. In Europe, a university in England studies sleep. They look at how tiredness affects sailors, how noise affects sleep, and how tired drivers are dangerous. They find people to study by advertising in student newspapers. These people get paid and change their sleep for the study. Dr. Louise Reyner says some people worry because they put things on their heads to study them, but they can't see dreams. The lab is more interested in physical things. They have a car simulator to study tired drivers. People come in the afternoon after little sleep. They drive while answering questions. The road looks endless, and the sun is bright. Many say they won't fall asleep, but they do. A video shows a driver trying to stay awake. He blinks and nods off, and the car goes off the road. Coffee can help. Dr. Reyner says two cups can make you a safe driver for a short time. She suggests using tablets, energy drinks, and caffeinated gum. Shift workers might need them. We know some things about sleep. Humans sleep in cycles like other animals. There are four stages of sleep, from light to deep. Dreams happen in light sleep, and the brain stops the body from moving. Scientists think sleep helps repair the body, but they are not sure. Women sleep a bit longer than men, and older people need less sleep, but we don't know why. Some researchers say sleep helps us pass time safely. In the past, people had different sleep patterns. A professor found that between 1500 and 1850 in Britain, people slept in two parts. They went to bed early, woke up after midnight, stayed awake for an hour, and then slept again. This time was quiet and good for thinking. Poor people liked this time because they were free from work. By the 17th century, with more light, rich people started sleeping like we do now. The industrial revolution made people work longer, changing sleep for everyone. In some places outside Europe and America, people still sleep in parts. They sleep for a few hours, wake up, and then sleep again. In some tribal societies, noise and danger make it hard to sleep all night. It seems people everywhere need more sleep.'"
CPE_60,C2,"'I was wearing very expensive cowboy boots, standing on rocks in the Arizona desert. I had a full cowboy outfit, but I was not a real cowboy. I looked at the Arizona mountains and knew I did not belong there. I flew in from Denver and thought I might look like a cowboy, but that feeling went away when I saw a real cowboy at the Phoenix airport. He wore a dirty shirt, needed a shave, and carried a dirty bag. He looked at my new boots and walked away.
I used to be a racing driver, and I loved it. But I don't race anymore. I wondered what I should do now. I thought I could talk about races on TV, but many other drivers wanted to do that too. I tried to sell classic cars, but nobody was buying. Being an 'ex' racing driver is hard. People don't want to hear about how I almost became a champion. Even if I was a champion, people would only listen for a short time.
I miss racing cars. I miss the speed and the excitement. I miss the people and the reporters who cared about what I said. Being a little famous was nice. Now, I have a lot of free time. The phone doesn't ring much. I looked at the sky and saw some birds. They seemed to tell me to leave their nest alone. I realized I had a lot to learn about being in the desert.'"
CPE_1,C2,"**Vancouver**
In the last ten years, many people from all over the world have moved to Vancouver, in western Canada. In the evening, people like to walk in the city, and if you walk with them, you might hear many different languages. People come to Vancouver because it has a mild climate, beautiful views of the ocean and mountains, a clean and safe environment, and good schools and jobs. Some people complain about the new buildings, but the new people and tourists have helped the city grow. Vancouver was once called 'Terminal City' because it was a gateway to other places. Now, it is more of a gateway than ever.
**Writing Letters**
Journalists like me are usually not good at writing letters. Some say it's because we don't like writing for free, but I don't think that's true. It's more likely because we try hard to make our writing have a big impact, so writing a simple letter is difficult for us. Real artists, who don't think about the effect of their words, don't have this problem. I think a real artist knows how to use words well. When Shakespeare wrote his famous lines, he probably didn't think about why they were so good, but they showed he was a great writer.
**Supermarket Opening**
In the past, opening a new supermarket in Britain was a big event. A soap star, a disc jockey, or a minor royal would come to cut the ribbon. Now, new supermarkets open so often that famous people are not needed. Why pay a celebrity when anyone can open it for free? Last week, people waiting to enter a new Superbuy store didn't care who opened it, as long as they were first in line. One customer heard that the first five men would get a bottle of aftershave, and the first five women would get flowers. This news spread quickly, making those at the front feel happy and those at the back feel jealous."
CPE_53,C2,"**Citizen Kane**
The movie *Citizen Kane* came out in 1941. There was a lot of talk about it because people thought it was about William Randolph Hearst, a famous newspaper owner. The movie did not make a lot of money at first, even though many people liked it. Later, television made it popular again. Many people who make movies today say it inspired them. This is surprising because it was the first movie made by Orson Welles. Welles said he did not know what he could or could not do, so he just did what he wanted. He had a great team, including cameraman Gregg Toland, writer Herman J. Mankiewicz, and special-effects expert Linwood Dunn. Welles and Mankiewicz decided to make a movie about a newspaper owner like Hearst. Welles thought this was a great chance for him to be both the director and the actor.
**Dermot and Carmel**
Dermot thought Carmel was acting a bit strange that morning. He told her twice that he might be late and might stop at the golf club on his way home. He needed to talk to someone, and the golf club was the best place. Carmel nodded but seemed like she didn't really hear him. Dermot asked, ""Will you be okay? What are you going to do today?"" Carmel smiled and said, ""It's funny you ask. I was just thinking I have nothing to do today, so I might walk downtown and look at the shops. It feels a bit lazy to just enjoy the day."" Dermot smiled back and said, ""You should enjoy yourself. And if I'm late, I won't need dinner, so don't worry about cooking."" Carmel replied, ""No, that's fine.""
**Title Race**
A recent study shows that job titles can make people feel jealous and unhappy at work. A survey found that 90% of bosses and 70% of workers agree that titles can cause problems between coworkers. Surprisingly, 70% of office workers would rather have a better job title than a pay raise. This shows that people care a lot about their job titles. Today, nobody wants to be seen as less important. The new job titles focus on skills (like specialist or coordinator) but are really just nicer ways to say the same thing."
CPE_55,C2,"I was in Vienna to take photos. Taking photos was my job and my passion. I loved how light looked on things and how one photo could show the feeling of a place or person. I always hoped to take the perfect photo. I had a lucky moment once when a photo I took of smoke from a burning oil well was wanted by newspapers everywhere. After that, I worked for myself, but things didn't go as planned. That's why I was in Vienna, not somewhere more exciting. But I was still taking photos and getting paid, which was good.
I got the Vienna job by chance. I had taken photos of London for a book called ""Four Cities in Four Seasons."" The book also included Paris, Rome, and Vienna. The Austrian photographer, Rudi Schussner, left the job in Vienna, so they asked me to do it. I was free, and they liked my work. Things at home weren't great, so I was happy to go to Vienna.
They put me in a hotel in the old city. I had been to Vienna before with my wife, but it was busy and hot, and I didn't take many photos. This time, in January, it was cold and different. I knew I would enjoy it and take great photos.
The first day, I didn't take any photos. I rode the trams around the city to feel its mood. The weather was cold and set. I wanted to make this my Vienna, not like Schussner's photos. I waited for the right moment to take photos.
The next morning, I went out early. Snow had fallen, and the city was quiet. I wanted to take a photo of the cathedral, but it was hard to fit it all in one shot. Still, it could be magical. Photography has always felt magical to me. Watching a photo develop is like seeing a mystery unfold. That's why what happened that morning didn't surprise me."
CPE_50,C2,"Kinetic Art Exhibition
Something amazing has happened at London's Hayward Gallery. It has become a place full of wonder. This change is not because of a big, expensive show. Instead, it is because of a special exhibition about kinetic art. Kinetic art is art that moves or shows movement. This exhibition looks at the history of kinetic art in the 20th century. It shows that making art that moves has been important for many years, even if not many people noticed it before. The exhibition has many paintings, drawings, documents, and films. Guy Brett, who knows a lot about kinetic art, put it all together. There are not many explanations, so visitors can enjoy finding out things on their own.
David Hockney
David Hockney is an artist that many people like, even if they do not usually like art. People might like his work because it is easy to understand or because it shows fun things. Some people might like him because he is a nice person and funny. Some critics think Hockney is not a great artist. But maybe he seems less important because he is very popular. Hockney knows he is not the best artist and thinks it is okay if his work is not seen as great. Only time will tell how important his art is.
Window-shopping - an Art Exhibition
I have seen many art exhibitions. Some are great, and some are not. Sometimes exhibitions try to show that many artists think the same way. This can be interesting, but sometimes it feels forced. I wanted to do something different. I worked with seven artists in an empty warehouse. We called it 'Window-shopping.' Each artwork was different, but they were all art. For example, Sam Cole's knitted cats moved around on a toy train track. Matthew Crawley broke a video camera, and it flickered on a screen. These artworks were very different, but they worked well together. I did not try to make a big statement about art. Art is personal, and each artist decides what they want to do.
Art History
Some people love looking at paintings but do not want to think too much about them. They worry it will ruin their enjoyment. Some art historians focus on theory and not on the pleasure of looking at art. This is like thinking that knowing how a dish is made will make it taste less good. But knowing more about art can make it more enjoyable. Our enjoyment of art is not just about our personal taste. It is also about what our society values. So, while enjoying art is important, thinking about it can also be interesting. In the past, people thought art was different from thinking, but now we know they can go together."
CPE_25,C2,"**Metals**
A long time ago, people in the Stone Age might have wanted to make themselves look nice. They could have found shiny yellow stones, like gold, by the river. These stones were not like normal rocks; they were special and pretty. Gold was soft and easy to shape, so people liked it a lot. Copper might have been found by accident too. When people saw how useful copper tools were, they looked for more copper and learned how to get it from rocks. This is how people started working with metals.
**St Ives**
We walked down a small, winding street with our bags. The wind was very strong, and the waves were cold and big, hitting the walkway. No one was outside, and all the houses by the water had their windows closed tight. We saw the weather get worse as we arrived in St Ives on a small train. The sky was dark and grey. Visiting Cornwall without a car in bad weather did not seem like a good idea anymore. I told my friend we would have nice walks by the sea and warm evenings by the fire.
**Computer Modelling**
Studying the past is hard because it is gone. The people who lived in good and bad times are not here anymore. We do not know exactly why they lived in certain places or how they formed families and villages. Archaeology gives us some ideas, but we cannot test them like we do with science experiments. But maybe we can use computers to help. Computer modelling lets us create old landscapes and fill them with digital people. These virtual people can act like real people. We can change things like rain or the number of people and see how they react."
CPE_34,C2,"**Vervet Monkeys**
Cheney and Seyfarth studied vervet monkeys. One day, the leader male monkey saw a new male monkey near their trees. The new monkey wanted to join the group. If he joined, the leader might lose his position. The leader monkey had a clever idea to keep the new monkey away. When the new monkey tried to come closer, the leader made a sound that means a leopard is near. The new monkey got scared and went back to his trees. This happened many times. But then, the leader made a mistake. He made the leopard sound while he was walking calmly on the ground.
**What Cats Catch**
In a village in England, people counted what their cats caught. In one year, 70 cats caught over 1,000 animals. An American professor saw this and thought all cats in Britain might catch 100 million birds and small animals each year. But this is not true. Most cats live in towns and catch fewer animals. The important question is: are there still enough birds? The answer is yes. In winter, people feed birds, and gardens have places for birds to live. The survey showed cats catch many birds, but they are not destroying the bird population.
**Buffalo's Day**
Buffaloes are very important to marsh people. Every morning, buffaloes leave their sleeping place slowly. They make tired sounds as they go to the reed beds. They stand at the edge of the water, making noises about how tired they are. Then, the leader buffalo goes into the water. In the water, they move slowly and make quiet sounds. They swim with just their noses above the water, looking very tired. They spend the day in the reeds, eating green plants.
**PICASSO, Pablo**
In 1940, Picasso painted fish while he was in a fishing town. The painting shows a fish seller's table with a crab and some fish. The fish look like they are still alive. The painting is hard to understand because Picasso used flat shapes and soft colors. It looks calm, like underwater. But there is a feeling of a fight coming between the fish and the crab. The sharp shapes in the painting make it feel a bit dangerous."
CPE_12,C2,"Photography
For the last 150 years, photography has been used to capture all parts of human life. In this short time, photography has grown to show moments in time and space. It lets us see quick moments and both big and small things. Photography has shown us pictures from faraway places on Earth and in space, as well as the complex and difficult parts of modern life. It is a very important way to show human life.
But, using pictures to record events is much older. The first pictures go back to about 35,000 years ago. We do not know exactly why early people made cave paintings. They might show real hunting events, be used for magic to help with hunting, be religious symbols, or just to make life more colorful. Pictures are a big part of human culture.
People have always asked if pictures show the truth and what their role in society is. Many people believe that ""seeing is believing,"" so pictures have always been important. When photography was invented in the 1800s, it was a big deal. People thought it could show the truth automatically. The camera was seen as a machine like the human eye, making images that looked like what we see. The camera could capture real images, which artists had tried to do for a long time.
Some people thought everyone could understand photos, no matter where they were from. In 1933, a photographer named August Sander said even people far away could understand a photo of the sky. But as the world became more connected, we started to ask if photos can be understood the same way by everyone. Is photography like language, which is different in each culture?
Photography is often seen as showing real evidence, making it seem clear and easy to understand. People often show photos to share their lives, like saying ""this is my grandson."" Since its invention in 1839, photography and how people use it have changed a lot. Photos have become historical documents, showing us about the people and times they were made in.
I want to show that the camera is not just a tool that records events. Photography can also help bring social and political change. For example, the Italian Renaissance in the 1400s changed how people saw the world with new ways of showing images. Photography has helped create the media culture we have today and shows the hard truths of the world."
CPE_26,C2,"**How to Write Poetry**
Writing poetry can be tricky. There are no strict rules, but you need to read a lot, write often, and let your imagination be free. Some people need to feel safe to write, while others write when they are sad. Some write on a schedule, and others wait for inspiration. All ways are okay if you are true to yourself. Listen to your inner voice and let it grow.
**The Short Story**
In a short story, you can't have too many characters or long descriptions. Flashbacks should be short and only used if needed. A memory in the main character's mind can help move the story forward. Dialogue, or talking between characters, can show different sides of a story quickly. Every word in a short story is important, so make them count.
**Screenplays**
Writing a screenplay is like playing chess. At first, you might not know what will happen next, but with practice, you see the whole picture. In chess, you learn about openings, middle games, and end games. The more you play, the better you understand. The same goes for writing screenplays.
**Looking at Writing**
Speaking is natural for humans, but writing is not. All children learn to speak without lessons, but writing systems were created by a few advanced societies. Writing has improved over time, but it is not easy for everyone. Children are naturally good at speaking, but writing is something they must learn with effort. We need to understand how writing works and how children learn it."
CPE_8,C2,"I have never started writing a book with more worry. I call it a novel because I don't know what else to call it. I don't have much story to tell, and I don't end with a death or a marriage. Instead, I leave the reader wondering. This book is about my memories of a man I met only sometimes, and I don't know much about what happened to him in between. I could make up things to fill the gaps and make the story clearer, but I don't want to do that. I just want to write what I know. To avoid embarrassing people who are still alive, I have changed the names of the people in this story, and I have made sure no one can recognize them. The man I am writing about is not famous. Maybe he never will be. When he dies, he might not leave any mark on the world, like a stone thrown into a river leaves no mark on the water. Then my book, if anyone reads it, will be read only for its own interest. But maybe the way he lived and his strong and kind character will influence others, and people will realize he was special. Then it will be clear who I am writing about, and those who want to know about his early life might find something useful in my book. I think my book will be helpful to people who want to write about my friend. I don't claim that the conversations I wrote are exactly what was said. I never took notes, but I remember well what matters to me, and I believe I have written them truthfully. I said earlier that I have not made up anything, but I have done what historians do by adding speeches I did not hear to make the story more lively. I want people to read my book, and I think it's okay to make it interesting. Smart readers will know where I have done this, and they can choose to ignore it. Another reason I am worried about writing this book is that the people I write about are from another culture. It is hard to know people, and I think you can only really know people from your own country. People are not just themselves; they are also where they were born, the games they played, the food they ate, the schools they went to, and the books they read. These things make them who they are, and you can't know them just by hearing about them; you have to live them. You can only know if you are them. Because you can't really know people from another country, it's hard to make them believable in a book. I have only written about people from my own country before, and if I have written about others in short stories, it's because you can describe them briefly. You give the reader a general idea and let them imagine the rest. In this book, I don't pretend my characters see themselves as I see them; they are seen through my eyes."
CPE_4,C2,"**Poetry Recitals**
Today, poetry can be confusing because there are many different styles and ideas about poetry. Some poets write poems to be read in books, while others like to perform their poems in front of people. This has created two groups: the ""literary"" poets and the ""popular"" poets. 
The ""literary"" poets focus on writing poems that are deep and complex. These poems are best enjoyed when read on a page. On the other hand, ""popular"" poets write simple poems that are easy to understand when heard. They enjoy performing their poems for an audience.
In the last twenty years, public poetry readings have become more common. These events happen in small towns, schools, colleges, and arts festivals. Poets read their work to people, and sometimes music is included in the event. 
For ""popular"" poets, performing is good because their poems are made for live audiences. But for ""literary"" poets, it can be hard because their poems are complex and might not be understood right away. 
Listening to poets read their work can be fun and helpful. It shows how the poet wants the poem to sound. However, it is still important to read poetry on the page to fully understand it. 
The main reason for poetry recitals is to make people enjoy poetry and see it as something fun, not just for experts."
CPE_30,C2,"**Oral History**
Historians are using more oral stories, but this has problems. When someone tells their story, it is not always a clear picture of the past. The historian chooses who to talk to and what to talk about. Even if the historian just listens, their presence can change how the person remembers and talks about the past. The final story is influenced by the historian's background and how they understand history. Historians help create new evidence, but the person telling the story is also not directly connected to the past. Their memories can be mixed with things they heard from other places, like TV. They might remember the past as better than it was or feel sad about things that happened later. Feelings make the story seem real, but they might come from later events, not the past.
**Animal Science**
There are two main ways to study animals: looking at how their bodies work and looking at their behavior. Physiologists study how nerves, muscles, and senses work together. People who study the whole animal look at how animals behave and what affects them. In this group, psychologists study how animals learn, often in labs with animals like rats and pigeons. Ethologists study natural behavior in wild animals. These two groups are now working more together. Physiologists think their methods are very important, but even if we know how every nerve works, we still need to study behavior. Behavior has its own patterns that we need to understand. Trying to explain a bird building a nest by looking at nerve cells is like trying to read a book with a microscope.
**The Social Sciences**
When students start studying social sciences, they need to learn two things at the same time. They need to know the content of the subject and how to study it. This means learning the facts and research in textbooks and understanding how this knowledge is found and organized. Social sciences are not just common sense. Each social science looks at a different part of social life, uses different study methods, and has its own ideas. These basic ideas help social scientists go beyond everyday understanding and make each subject different.
**Classical Architecture**
In Ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was more than just building. The Roman architect Vitruvius said architecture is about order, arrangement, proportion, symmetry, and distribution. He used some Greek words for these ideas, which came from earlier Greek writings we don't have now. Vitruvius did not include utility and function in his main definition, but he did talk about the best ways to build for different uses. The focus was on architecture as an art. Classical architecture has complex origins. Before, there were simple huts in Greece and Italy that did not meet Vitruvius' artistic standards. These simple forms were important and continued into more advanced architecture. Even if a classical temple looks fancy, it is basically a simple, single-room hut."
CPE_7,C2,"The two sisters, Lily and Mui, kept Lily's driving a secret from Chen for a while. Lily would drive around the area, going over a small bridge with a bump. Chen found out but was amused instead of angry. He was happy that Lily could drive and started planning a trip with her. They decided to go on a Monday morning next month, so they wouldn't lose any customers. Lily practiced driving in the meantime. Mui bought a road map and got a discount, which impressed Chen, but Lily felt Mui didn't trust her driving skills.
On the day of the trip, they left home and soon reached the English Channel. Lily drove very well, and even Mui, who was ready to give directions, had to admit it. Lily overtook some slow cars, and Chen applauded her. They arrived at a seaside town and parked the car. Lily was careful about parking rules and paid a fee to avoid problems. She locked the van doors carefully. Chen joked that no one would steal the van, which upset the sisters.
Chen took their son, Man Kee, to see the sea. He thought about Man Kee's future and wanted him to have a good education and own many restaurants. The sea made Chen feel thoughtful. He saw a ship in the distance and showed it to Man Kee, saying it was special and would take them home one day. Lily and Mui joined them, and Chen let Man Kee look through a telescope. When Lily tried to look, the ship was gone, and she only saw seagulls."
CPE_43,C2,"Title: The Well
I read that if you look from a deep hole, you can see stars during the day. I asked you to help me try this. You watched as I pulled up the well bucket and climbed in. I told you to lower me down. I didn't think about how heavy the bucket would be or that you might not be strong enough. You held the handle, but when I moved the bucket, I fell into the well. I hit my head and saw strange lights. Later, I realized they looked like stars in cartoons when someone gets hit.
At first, I was confused, then scared, then angry at you for letting me fall. I was also worried about what Mother would say. You called down to ask if I was okay. I didn't answer at first, but when you called again, I stayed quiet. You ran to get help. I quickly climbed out of the well and hid. I heard voices from the castle. Mother and Father came with you and Arthur. Mother was very upset. Father told Arthur to use the winch. You looked shocked.
I was hiding, feeling excited but then saw the wet spots I left on the ground. I was scared they would see them. Father was looking into the well with a flashlight. Mother was screaming, and I felt guilty. I wanted to get back at you, but now I was in trouble. I didn't think it would get this serious. I needed a plan.
I came out of hiding, pretending to be hurt. I told them I found a secret tunnel from the well to the moat and escaped. I thought they believed me until Father asked me to repeat the story. I added that the tunnel collapsed, so no one could check. Father didn't believe me. He looked at me like he saw me for the first time. He told me not to be ridiculous and walked away.
Arthur looked at me sadly. He knew I was lying and worried about what kind of person I would become. His look made me feel worse than Father's words. I realized they both saw through my lie, and it made me think about how I should act in the future."
CPE_51,C2,"**Moving Day**
Susan is a widow, and her children are grown up. She has to leave her family home. A van with ""Removers of Distinction"" written on it is there to help. Fred, the removal man, and his team are packing everything. Fred is careful with the breakable things. The house is beautiful, with four floors and a view of a small harbor. Susan remembers the years spent there with her children.
When they bought the house, her son Robert, who was five then, asked how they would bring the house home. Now, Robert is an adult and is helping with the move. He is making sure Susan doesn't talk about the piano. Francesca, her daughter, is also helping. She is very careful with the Steinway piano.
Fred, the removal man, says people often cry when they move. Susan understands why. She remembers when they first moved in. The piano was a problem because it got stuck on the stairs. Her husband Peter, who has passed away, solved the problem by using a crane to bring the piano through a window.
Now, Susan is older, and the stairs are hard for her. She worries about the piano again. Fred tells her they are almost done, just the piano is left. Susan feels emotional but doesn't cry. When the piano is safely moved, Robert and Francesca start laughing, and Susan joins them. They are happy and relieved. As they leave the house for the last time, they are laughing together."
CPE_11,C2,"'Online Book Reviews for Everyone
Writing your own book reviews online: is it just for fun? From the start, the Internet was meant to be open to everyone. In theory, anyone could write or share things online. But in the early days, you needed some technical skills. However, one area that became open to everyone was book reviews. On Amazon.com, the first big online bookstore, anyone could write a book review. Amazon's idea was simple: anyone could say what they thought about a book and give it up to five stars. Each book had its own page, and new reviews appeared automatically. This way, Amazon got free reviews, and people could see what other readers thought about a book, not just what the publisher or professional critics said. Other online bookstores did the same, but Amazon was the biggest, with over 80% of the online market. Because of this, Amazon had the most reviews and also some problems. Many reviews were submitted every day, so it was hard to check them all. Amazon had a team to make sure reviews followed their rules. For example, reviews with only one word, personal attacks, or spoilers were not allowed. But reviewers were anonymous, so some bad reviews were only removed if Amazon found them. This allowed for some tricks. For example, some writers gave their own books great reviews. One writer, Lev Grossman, wrote fake good reviews for his book after getting bad ones. He was caught when he wrote about his trick. Authors could also comment on their own books through a special link. Most authors used this to encourage people to buy their books. Some even shared their email addresses to talk directly with readers. However, Amazon did not always check if the comments really came from the author, except for famous writers. For example, a fake comment pretending to be from John Updike was removed. Problems mostly came from readers, not writers. When James McElroy's book about a cheerleading team was published, it got good reviews from the press. But people in the book felt upset and wrote angry reviews on Amazon. These reviews disappeared after a few days. Despite this, Amazon thought having many reviews was good for business. Reviews were meant to be a place to talk about books, not a chat room. So, Amazon watched popular books closely to make sure reviews followed the rules. Funny reviews were often found on less popular books. For example, a children's book called The Story about Ping inspired jokes because 'ping' is also a computer term. One review compared the book's story to the Internet and said it explained networking concepts. But most reviews on Amazon were serious. They gave a good idea of whether a book was worth buying. The writer George Orwell once said that reviewing too many books meant pretending to have feelings about them. This is why letting everyone review books is a good thing.'"
CPE_14,C2,"**Art in Modern Times**
In the last 200 years, people think artists must be different from others. We like art that is new and surprising. We admire artists whose work was not liked 100 years ago. But today, we sometimes say an artist has gone too far and it is not art anymore. The media often say this, and we agree. We expect art to be new, so we do not see the old ideas in it. We think artists are special and different from us. In the past, people asked artists to make art for specific reasons. Now, artists work alone, and we get upset if they try to be like everyone else.
**Picture This**
I will describe a situation and ask a question. An artist picks a text from an art book. The text talks about different pictures and says, ""There is no end to the number of different kinds of pictures."" The artist asks someone to make a canvas and take it to a sign painter. The sign painter writes the text on the canvas in simple black letters. My question is: Is this a painting?
**Underground Encounters**
At the Mercury Gallery, London until 26th June
Artists usually stick to one style if it sells well. People like to see the same kind of art from an artist. But some artists try new things. Picasso and Hockney did this. Eric Rimmington is another artist trying something new. He is known for still life paintings but now paints the London Underground. He made drawings of railways in the 1980s and now paints the underground world. His show has 40 paintings and drawings of this hidden world.
**Extract from a Novel**
I have come to this island with a few books. The villagers say only a sick person would come here to rebuild. I am here to heal myself. Only an old woman from the village comes to clean the house. I am alone. I am not happy or sad. I think about memories. Art is not useless. It helps us see the important parts of life. Art is a way to deal with things that hurt us. It helps us use our imagination to understand life better. Otherwise, why do we hurt each other?"
CPE_63,C2,"'Family Business'
""Look here, it's no good!"" said my Dad. We were in the car going back to London. My father and my brother Maurice had just picked me up from my school. I had won two prizes: one for Latin and one for doing well in my exams. My father talked with my headteacher, and now we were going home for the holidays.
""What isn't good?"" I asked, but I knew what he was thinking. My father usually talked a lot. ""You can't fool me. You'll do what you want now,"" he said. ""With all those certificates, I heard you will get a scholarship to Oxford.""
""So?"" I said, trying to be brave. ""Mightn't that be useful?""
""I also heard,"" he continued, ""that you want to be a barrister. A barrister of all things!"" My father knew a lot about barristers and the law.
""I just said that,"" I replied. ""I couldn't think of anything else to say!""
""And apparently,"" he went on, ""you have the right personality - you can understand things quickly, you like talking, and you enjoy performing.""
""I don't know about that,"" I said. ""I only know what I see on TV.""
""Anyway,"" he said, ""I feel you won't want to join the family business now. You'll go to Oxford, and after that, I can't see you wanting it.""
Like many children, I felt trapped by family expectations. I wanted to explore other jobs, but I didn't want to upset my father. I wasn't as scared of him as Maurice was - I was the favorite - but I found him strong.
""It's too soon to know,"" I said weakly.
""I tell you, you're not going to want to join us,"" my father said. ""It's a pity because you have the gifts - the brains, the nerves, the vision.""
""There's still Maurice,"" I said, unhappy. My father snorted. We both knew Maurice hated the business.
""You could always use me as a consultant,"" I added. My mother wasn't around to help - she died when I was young, and my father raised me and Maurice. Maurice was two years younger, and I often took care of him. I loved Maurice.
Because the business was successful, we lived well - a big house in London, good schools, nice clothes, parties, theatres, operas. My father knew many people - politicians, actors, businessmen - and our house was always lively.
""You can help us during holidays until you leave Oxford,"" my father said. ""Then, if you decide to leave, you can. It will give you some pocket money and help me.""
""OK,"" I said, happy to avoid making a decision now. My father would get upset if I opposed him. This was how he controlled us.
So it happened. In my last term at school and during university vacations, I helped out, never more than twice a year, and always on easy tasks. I became a smart student, with a little house, a small car, designer clothes, and a special dress for my final exams.
In my last term, my father visited me. He took me to a village for a meal and a chat. There were only a few weeks left. My tutor said I might get a First Class degree in Law. I felt confident and focused.
But my father told me he needed me for one last job. It was the most important work the family business had ever done, and he promised it would be worth it.
""But Dad,"" I said, ""I have my final exams soon. I need to focus on them. It's really important.""
I could tell my father didn't understand my pressure. Maybe he was jealous of my life away from him. He would see a refusal as a betrayal.
As he explained the job, I saw how focused and smart my father was. He was a kind of genius, and I respected that. It made my own plans seem less important.
""All right,"" I said. ""I'll do it."""
CPE_56,C2,"Simon Costello realized that buying the house in Pembroke Square was a mistake after living there for a year with his wife, Lois. They could only afford it by being very careful with money, which was not a good idea. At first, it seemed like a good decision because Simon had many successful cases, and Lois got a raise at her advertising job, making thirty-five thousand. Lois wanted to move because their flat was too small for a family, and they needed more space, a garden, and a place for an au pair. They could have found this in a cheaper area, but Lois wanted a better address for their careers. 
Lois decided that one of them should use public transport to save money. Since her job was far, Simon had to take the crowded tube, which made him unhappy. He often thought about his grandfather's house in Hampstead, where he was treated well after a long day. But times had changed, and Lois made it clear that her career was as important as his. They needed both their salaries to maintain their lifestyle.
Now, their life was at risk because of Venetia. She came to their office very upset after court. Someone had made her very angry. Simon wished he had left his room earlier to avoid her. Venetia accused him of knowing that a client, Brian Cartwright, bribed the jury four years ago and did nothing. She also said Cartwright gave shares to Simon's fiancée before the trial. Simon denied it, but he felt guilty and knew his denial was weak. He wished he had said something different. Venetia's anger confused him. He wondered why she cared so much and if she was right to threaten his career. If people heard about this, even as a rumor, it could ruin him."
CPE_36,C2,"I chose this place to live because I thought I could be anonymous. I believed people here wouldn't care if the houses were old and the gardens were messy. But I was wrong. People in the shops soon started to recognize me. The roses next door remind me that the gardens were once loved. Usually, I stay inside, but tonight I am watching birds fly between the trees and roofs. I cut back some plants to make space for a chair, and my arms are scratched. It is a small London garden where plants grow tall. 
My neighbor, Jaz, leans out of her window. She writes books that are not published, and sometimes I have to talk about them because I am an English teacher. I have her latest book now. ""How's the work going, Jaz?"" I ask. ""In no other job do people ask you about your work all the time,"" she says. Then she offers to bring a drink. I don't want Jaz in the garden, and I see it looks messy. The only way to the garden is through my flat, and Jaz is knocking on my door. ""You're on holiday now,"" she says. She sits on a chair while I put a cushion on the grass. ""Cheers,"" she says. ""I should have been a teacher. Writers don't have holidays. They say, those who can, do, those who can't, teach."" 
She asks about my holiday plans. I feel worried about the school year ending. Empty days, hot streets, and loneliness. ""I'm going to Stonebridge tomorrow. Can you feed the cats?"" I ask. My heart races. ""Of course,"" Jaz says. ""If I'm around,"" knowing she will be. ""Where will you stay?"" she asks. ""With my friend Ruby at the Rising Sun,"" I say. It's not true, but I often deal with fiction. ""Going back to your roots. What do you think of my book?"" Jaz asks. Her book, The Cruelty of Red Vans, is on my desk. I like the title and tell her. I decide to be honest. ""Try writing about nice people,"" I suggest. ""Teachers!"" Jaz says, upset. ""I keep a journal,"" I say. ""I write something good about each day."" ""Keep a journal! Nice people! Get a life, Ann,"" Jaz replies. 
I have a life. I have my work, and I go out sometimes. When we go inside, my kitchen feels calm. Then I remember my school geography teacher, Miss Tarrantine, who would wink and say, ""I've had my moments."" We almost died laughing."
CPE_6,C2,"Heritage Heritage is important because it helps people feel connected to the past. We often know about our grandparents and their stories. But we also need to learn about our past to understand our future. Heritage gives us a sense of belonging and continuity. It is like inheriting genes; we also inherit culture from our ancestors. Even if there are parts of our heritage we don't like, it is still ours. Heritage teaches us a lot and is important for our well-being. It affects our customs and the things we use. In the past, we learned about our history through stories from our ancestors. But now, because of changes in society, many of these stories are lost. Instead, we learn from places and buildings. It is important to keep these links to remember our ancestors. The Fens I wrote a book called Waterland, which is set in a part of England called the Fens. People ask why I, a person from London, wrote about a place I don't know well. I chose the Fens because they seemed simple and empty, a good place for my story. But I found out that the Fens are not empty. They are very English but also strange. Many English people find the Fens foreign, even though they are in the middle of England. The Fens are both empty and full, wild and cultivated, open and mysterious. I did not visit many places in the Fens while writing my book. I like to imagine places rather than just describe them. The Fens are not just a place; they are a way of thinking. Museums Museums should make their collections easy to see and understand. In the past, museums just put things in cases with long labels. Now, they should make displays interesting and use techniques to catch people's attention. Museums should also reach out to the community. For example, they can lend objects to schools or use them to help elderly people with memory loss. Museums show real objects, not copies. They help people see and understand things from the past. This is what makes them different from theme parks or books. Museums that make their displays exciting and accessible will find that people want to see the real things they offer. Architecture and Environment People have always wanted to keep things from the past. But now, towns change quickly, and this affects everyone. Some people want to preserve everything, while others think about how towns should look in the future. People who have lived through big events, like wars, often want to keep things stable. If people need to preserve things, planners should consider this. Change is not bad if we know how to manage it. Changes in our towns show changes in our society, like how many people live there and what they need."
CPE_33,C2,"**Einstein**  
If you ask someone to name a scientist, they will probably say Albert Einstein. His face is used in ads for smart things like computers and encyclopedias. Many people don't know much about what Einstein did, except that he made some difficult theories called 'relativity'. These theories are famous for being hard to understand and for having strange ideas that are different from what we see every day. Einstein was part of a big change in science in the 20th century. Scientists were trying to understand the universe better by studying matter and forces. Einstein helped by looking at time, space, matter, and energy in a new way. Before, people thought like Isaac Newton, who said stars and planets moved in a fixed space and time. Einstein said time and space are not fixed but change depending on other things.
**Young Readers**  
When we were kids, Lydia and I didn't like books that won prizes because we thought they would be boring. Our mom didn't like that we thought this way, but our dad would give us small amounts of money to read these books. He would also give us some of these books as gifts, saying they were not just for learning. We thought most of these books were for boys, but sometimes we found some good short stories and poems.
**Language**  
In 1851, Jacob Grimm said that the start of human language is a big mystery. Many strange ideas have come from this mystery. In 1928, Charles Caller said early humans made sounds like ""meuh"" when they were scared. These sounds were sad, and languages kept some of these sounds, like the word ""malaria"" for fever or ""mors"" in Latin for death. Because of these strange ideas, many people didn't want to talk about how language started. But now, it is an important area of study. Language probably started in East Africa about 100,000 years ago. It was mainly used for friendly talking and was important in power struggles. Sharing information was not the main reason for language, even though philosopher John Locke thought language was for sharing knowledge."
CPE_20,C2,"'Writing Reviews Frank Kermode talks about how to write reviews. Most reviews are written quickly and do not last long. They have deadlines and are usually short. Once published, they are only read for a short time, like a day or a week. People often think reviews are not very important. Many writers do reviews because they need money or because they cannot work on big projects all the time. But writing reviews is a skill. It is different to write a short review for a newspaper than a long one for a journal. Reviewers must think about who will read their review. Some readers just skim, while others are very interested in the topic. A reviewer needs to know a lot about many things and write clearly. Reviewers often write other things too. For example, the American writer John Updike writes reviews between writing his novels. He collects his reviews in books. Some people think only famous writers should keep their reviews, but others believe anyone can if they want to. I feel this way about my own work. I am a professor, and my main job is academic writing. But in English-speaking countries, it is normal for professors to write reviews too. In the past, some people thought professors should not write reviews, but now it is common. There is more reviewing work now, so many people can do it. I think this is good for readers because they know the reviewer understands the topic. It is also good for professors because it helps them communicate better with people who are not professors. Writing reviews is a secondary job. You can only do it well if you are also doing something else well.'"
CPE_40,C2,"Ralph opened the door to his apartment. It was dark and quiet inside. Even after three years, he sometimes felt unsure about owning it. When he first bought the apartment, he was excited to come home. He wondered what the apartment was like when he was not there. It felt like a safe place for him. He thought he should worry about things like burglars or broken pipes, but the apartment was always there waiting for him. Sometimes it was tidy, and sometimes it was messy.
Ralph started to see the apartment as part of himself. He wanted it to change, but it stayed the same. Sometimes there were letters by the door or messages on the answering machine. He was glad the windows were not broken and nothing was stolen. From his boring office on Holloway Road, Ralph looked forward to spending time alone at home. After leaving work, he felt more like himself on the bus ride home. But once he was home, he felt empty and lonely. He thought his job, which he did not like, had changed him.
Ralph often read or listened to music at night. But he wondered why he did these things. He felt lost and confused. He remembered a time when he felt stronger and thought he could have done something different with his life. After university, he wanted to improve himself but only wanted to survive quietly. He applied for jobs his friends talked about and followed their paths. He went to one job interview for a local newspaper. He was happy to have a nice conversation with Neil, his boss, and did not think much about the job itself. Neil offered him the job because Ralph was the only graduate who applied. Ralph took this as a compliment."
CPE_45,C2,"**Goat Racing**
I was going to see goat racing. It was Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. There were many ice-cream vans, lots of people, food stalls, and loud music. Everyone was moving towards the racecourse. I pushed through the crowd to find a good spot. They made a special area for the race. It was not like big racecourses, but people stood on both sides to watch. They tried to keep the goats in order. It was not easy because goats like to eat everything.
**Canoe Trip**
As the day ended, I thought about the night. I was scared. The canoe was too wet to sleep in, and there was no place to stop. We did not see any villages or huts since morning. In the moonlight, we used a torch to see the cliffs. The torch batteries were low, so we put in new ones, but they did not work. We could not find a camping place. A few miles later, Lesley saw a light, and we were happy. But it was just moonlight on the waves. We heard loud water, but we could not see it. Time felt slow, and we kept moving.
**How to be Good at Presentations**
I am not good at making presentations. But as a managing director, I have to present to my colleagues and big shareholders. How can I get better and feel more confident? 
You are not alone. Presenting is different from running a company. Many senior executives need to be good at it. If you want to convince people, you must believe in what you say. Show your passion and enthusiasm. Do your homework. Test your ideas before the presentation. Ask colleagues to think of tough questions the audience might ask. Start with something everyone agrees on and slowly build to your main point."
CPE_64,C2,"Some things take time and cannot be rushed. For example, if you add oil too quickly when making mayonnaise, it will not turn out right. If you pull too hard on a tangled fishing line, the knot will get tighter. Our minds also work at different speeds. Some things we can do quickly, like solving puzzles, but other things need more time. If we rush them, they might not work well.
There are three speeds at which our mind works. The first is very fast, faster than thinking. This is when we react quickly without thinking, like when a motorbike skids and we automatically know what to do to stay safe. This quick reaction is called our 'wits'.
The second speed is thinking itself. This is when we solve problems by thinking carefully, like a mechanic fixing an engine or a student doing homework. We call this 'intellect'. People who are good at this are often called 'bright' or 'clever'.
The third speed is slower and more relaxed. This is when we think in a dreamy or playful way, like when we are sitting by the sea and listening to the waves. This slow thinking is important too. It helps us understand complex problems that are not clear. Sometimes, when we have a difficult decision to make, like changing jobs, it is better to think slowly and carefully.
Scientists are now studying this slow way of thinking. They find that it can help us learn new things and solve difficult problems. This slow thinking is linked to creativity and wisdom. Poets and philosophers have always known about this way of thinking, and now scientists are learning more about it too."
CPE_29,C2,"**Surviving in a Foreign Land**
I am in a friendly place, but it is very far away from other places. There are about forty people here, like scientists and students. Everyone helps each other. I can speak a little French, but not very well. I cannot understand jokes or small talk. I feel nervous at mealtimes because I am not sure where to sit or what to say. I smile a lot and sometimes feel sad because I cannot talk like I used to. I miss being able to talk easily with people.
**Elliot**
When I first met Elliot, I was a new writer, and he did not pay much attention to me. He remembered faces, though, and would shake my hand when we met. If he was with important people, he sometimes pretended not to see me. But when I became a successful playwright, Elliot started to like me more. He invited me to lunch, and I thought he wanted to know me better. After my success, I saw him more often.
**Alfred Hitchcock**
Alfred Hitchcock was a famous film director. He said he did not care much about the story or acting in his films. He cared about the pictures and sounds. He believed that if a film was made well, people from different countries would feel the same emotions. Hitchcock was very smart and knew how to make people feel scared or excited. He focused on making films that made people react, no matter where they were from."
CPE_57,C2,"**Amateur Astronomy**
Astronomy has changed a lot in the last 50 years. About 30 years ago, there were not many charts or books about astronomy. Telescopes were not very good. Now, you can buy many different telescopes and equipment. Computers help make charts and analyze observations. This is a great time for amateur astronomers. But, some things are not as good. You might need to travel 80 km to see a clear sky, like in cities 50 years ago. Airplanes leave trails in the sky that can turn into clouds, making it hard to see the sun or stars.
**Too Much Choice**
Today, there are too many choices. There are many things to do and buy. New products come out very fast. This can make people feel tired and stressed. More choices mean more stress and less time. People are looking for simple things that make life better. But, it is hard to make life simple when there are so many things to choose from. There are more types of soap and cereal than we need, and many software updates and phone plans.
**McAndrews Hotel**
Every summer, we stay for two weeks at McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. It is a family tradition started by my grandmother. We do not let anything change this tradition. The people who stay at McAndrews are like us: old-fashioned and maybe a bit snobbish. I do not like rude shop assistants or waiters who act too friendly. I know most of the guests because they have been coming here since they were children. We greet each other politely but do not talk much. It is nice to have privacy and respect, which is hard to find in hotels today."
CPE_9,C2,"**Othello**
A special play called ""Othello"" by Shakespeare moved from Stratford to London. I want to say sorry for a bad review I wrote when the play first started last spring. I said Ray Fearon, who plays Othello, was too young. I was wrong about his acting. He is very good. The whole cast is great. There are many memorable scenes. One is when Cassio plays games with other officers, and it gets dangerous. Another is when Iago starts to lose control. A very moving scene is when Emilia helps Desdemona get ready for bed. The play is exciting and full of tension. You should see it.
**Lake Vostok**
In the middle of Antarctica, it is very quiet. There are many penguins, seals, and birds at the edges. But in the center, there is no life. Except for a big lake called Lake Vostok under 4 kilometers of ice. It is the coldest place on earth. The water has been without air and sunlight for up to 25 million years. Scientists are excited to explore it and find new organisms. Geologists and glaciologists also want to study it. For two years, researchers have been planning to uncover the lake's secrets. In the next few years, we will learn a lot about Lake Vostok.
**Scientists**
There was something interesting on the radio last week. Scientists are talking about why they want to be scientists. They want to know why we want to learn about everything, like atoms and black holes. They wonder why science cannot explain why we want to know things. It is important to know if what scientists do is right. Science is a tool, and we should decide how to use it."
CPE_42,C2,"**Food**
Food is very important and makes us happy. Many people like cooking and buy cookbooks. Sometimes, we think we need a special occasion to cook something nice, but that's not true. You can make a tasty soup by putting some chopped carrots, a leek, celery, and herbs in water. This is better than buying soup from a packet or a can. Instead of buying a chocolate mousse with many chemicals, you can make a delicious one in five minutes that everyone will love. Cooking is a way to show care and love. We often celebrate special events like birthdays and weddings with food. We don't usually have takeaway food for these events. Sharing food is important for people.
**In the Elevator**
This morning, Alistair tried to clean his office, but there was still a lot of paper everywhere. He had tax forms and other papers in drawers and boxes. He also had many books and journals near the new bookshelves. As he went up in the elevator, he knew Mallory would be on time for their meeting. She was always on time and liked things to be neat. He wondered what she would think of the mess. Maybe she would think someone had made a mess on purpose. Mrs. Wilson, the cleaning lady, came while he was trying to clean. He smiled at her, hoping she would help, but she didn't want to clean his office. She only cleaned his apartment.
**KAREN**
Karen wanted to be different from her mother. She made her own story about being strong. When she was twelve, her brother accidentally hit her in the eye with a golf club. She thought she was blind, but the doctor said she was okay. She only needed a few stitches. When she saw her mother in the doctor's office, she felt she was saved for a reason.
**Miss Fogerty**
Miss Fogerty was walking across the village green. She felt both happy and sad about what she had just seen. In a small village, it is exciting to know something first. But she was very sad about Dr. Bailey's condition. He had been her doctor for many years and helped her with her throat problems. Dr. Bailey was very kind and always listened to his patients. The village loved him because he gave his time, knowledge, and humor. People were very loyal and cared for him."
CPE_59,C2,"Joanna's Lessons
Joanna MacGregor is a busy concert pianist. She also writes books for young children learning the piano. Joanna is very talented and plays many types of music like classical, jazz, and blues. At a concert for kids, a boy asked her to play ""Match of the Day."" Joanna found it funny and played it, making the boy happy.
Joanna cares about how children learn the piano. She wrote a book called ""Joanna MacGregor's Piano World"" for beginners. Even though she is very busy, she thinks the first piano lessons are very important. She believes music should be for everyone, not just for those who want to be stars.
When Joanna was young, she saw many children learning piano at her home because her mother was a piano teacher. She learned that music should be fun and for everyone. Some kids learn fast, but others take their time. Joanna is interested in helping all children enjoy music.
Joanna thinks some parents push their kids too hard in music, like in sports. She wants kids to enjoy music without pressure. Her books have stories and CDs to make learning fun. She believes practice is important, but it should be enjoyable. Joanna says it's okay to make mistakes and mix easy and hard pieces when practicing."
CPE_54,C2,"**Writing by Hand and on Screen**
Dr. Johnson said that writing without effort is not enjoyable to read. This means good writing is hard to do. When I look at my old school essays, I see few mistakes. Today, I would rewrite them many times. I think this is because writing by hand is slow and makes you think carefully. It is hard to change or erase, so you write with care. But with computers, it is easy to be careless. Many writers spend as much time fixing computer drafts as they did writing by hand. Emails, unlike handwritten letters, can feel heavy with emotion. People say emails have brought back the love letter. Many love emails are sent now, which is good. But words on a screen can feel boring. Writers may not know the power of words and can exaggerate. Quick writing on a computer lacks the care of handwriting.
**The CD**
I put down my cup and looked at the CD. The case was not special, but the shiny disc was interesting. ""Wonderful little things, aren't they?"" Mr. Warriston said. I agreed and gave him the disc. ""Amazing they hold seventy minutes of music,"" he said, turning on the music player. Lights came on, and he put the disc in. ""Some say they sound sterile, but I think they..."" ""Do you have to turn them over, like records?"" I asked. ""No,"" he said. ""You only play one side."" ""Why?"" I asked. He didn't know. ""You could have two lasers or turn it over by hand,"" he said. He smiled. ""Good point."" He showed me the best place to sit for the stereo sound. I was happy to ask a question he couldn't answer.
**Books versus Electronic Text**
Malcolm Bradbury said if matches came after lighters, we would think they are better. People say electronic text is like the invention of printing. But changes in how we think take a long time. In 1979, a book said books would disappear in the 1980s. That was wrong. Reading long texts on a screen is not fun, so people don't do it. Computers make people read bits of text. Some say this leads to new ways of storytelling. But reading parts of a book is not new. Many books, like religious texts and dictionaries, are not read from start to finish. Computers don't encourage reading everything in one go.
**The Office**
Charles walked into the office. It was neat and tidy. The carpet was clear, and the desk was dark wood. Files were in drawers, and journals were on shelves. Kathleen said, ""You need to use computers, Charles. This is too much."" ""Hello, Kathleen. This is amazing,"" he said, looking at the room. He didn't think about computers. They had talked about this many times. She didn't understand why he didn't like technology, even though he was good with computers and wrote a paper about it. She inspired that paper. She could use software in creative ways."
CPE_32,C2,"""You don't take sugar, do you?"" shouted his secretary. She wasn't really asking because she had been making Lancelot coffee for many months. She sometimes forgot because he wasn't supposed to be there often. But now, he was there all the time. He found out that if he stayed away, things would go wrong. He thought about how he went from being an important advisor, meeting authors and playwrights for lunch, to being very busy with no time to park his car in the morning. ""This came,"" she yelled, waving a folder and putting it in front of him. ""From that guy in Los Angeles. You said you wanted to see it."" The label said: ""A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert."" It also said ""An Expanded Synopsis."" Lancelot did not want to see another synopsis. He wanted to see a ""First Draft."" Ian Cuthbert had been given a lot of money for this book when Lancelot bought the company. Ian was an old friend, but he was not easy to work with. Lancelot read the synopsis and saw nothing new. He closed the folder and put it aside. Ian's manuscript seemed like it would never come. The synopsis was not brilliant, and it felt like Ian had lost interest. Lancelot remembered a story about a famous author who was paid little by little for his book. But Ian had already been paid a lot. Lancelot studied modern languages at Oxford and remembered when Ian was a promising talent at Cambridge. Ian's friends took over British theatre quickly, but Ian was even more talented. He wore his coat like a cape and talked about famous writers as if he knew them. But Ian's talent stayed hidden. While others succeeded, Ian became more difficult. He was supposed to edit an arts magazine, but it never came out. He had a contract with a fashion magazine, but he didn't produce much. At meetings, he was clever but critical. Ten years later, he was unreliable. Lancelot was starting to think that ""A World History of the Short"" was a mistake from the beginning."
CPE_65,C2,"'Breakfast in England
Health experts say breakfast is very important. But in history, breakfast is quite new in England. In medieval times, people did not talk much about breakfast. Sometimes, travelers ate early before long trips, and sick people had breakfast for health reasons. But most people did not eat breakfast unless they were kings or nobles.
In the sixteenth century, breakfast became normal for everyone. Some people think this is because there was more food available. But there were also big social changes. For example, people started working fixed hours and often began work very early. So, eating in the morning became necessary, not just for rich people.'"
CPE_61,C2,"Photography When a photographer takes a picture, they choose what to show based on their skills, personal ideas, and experiences. They also think about what society and culture expect. In this book, we will learn how these things change the style and meaning of a photo. We will also see how people look at and feel about these photos. For example, when someone reads a newspaper, they might think they understand the photos. But we can ask if the photo shows the scene exactly as it was. Or does it show what the photographer thinks? Is the exact moment in the photo important, or is the photo a symbol of something bigger in the world?
More than a game Sport is more than just a game for me. The best people in sport believe in themselves completely. You need to focus only on your goal to be the best. Sport is tough, and no one will do it for you. You have to succeed or fail on your own. Sport has taught me to be disciplined and determined. It also shows how to work well in a team. My sport lets you be great alone, but it is also a team game. You have to balance these two things. It's like life - you can do well alone, but you must remember others are around you. Sport has given me a lot, not just money. It has opened new opportunities for me and let me see things around the world. But you also have to give up a lot for these benefits.
Tuning in Some experiences stay in our memory very clearly. For me, one special moment happened one night in California many years ago. I was awake, listening to a bird singing beautifully in a tree. I don't usually have trouble sleeping, but the bird's song was so amazing that I stayed awake. The bird's music reminded me of jazz and Indian classical music. It felt like the bird was giving a special performance with many surprising changes. I listened and enjoyed the music until I finally fell asleep."
CPE_52,C2,"People have always had strong feelings about birds. But what do these feelings say about us? Paul Evans writes about this. 
There is a noise coming from the greenhouse. A small brown bird is hitting the glass. It is a wren. Some people think wrens bring messages or signs. Is the wren trying to tell me something? Or is it just stuck in the greenhouse? Maybe both are true. 
Wrens have been part of British culture for a long time. In the past, people watched wrens to see if they would have good or bad luck. Today, we still see wrens in pictures and decorations in British homes. Even if old beliefs are forgotten, people still like wrens. A forest without wrens feels empty. 
Many birds are part of our stories and traditions. In the past, people needed to understand nature to survive. They created stories about birds to explain their importance. These stories can change over time. 
For example, the red kite was once common in London. People liked them because they cleaned the streets. But later, people thought they were pests, and they disappeared from most places except Wales. Now, red kites are protected and are a symbol of nature conservation in Britain. 
Our connection with birds is very old. Early humans watched birds to know about danger, weather, and food. Birds also connected them to their dreams. Birds are important to us because they represent things like flight, song, and freedom. 
Some people think our feelings about birds are old and not needed now. But losing these feelings is hard. Birds show us how the environment is changing. In Britain, 30 bird species are in danger. This is sad because we lose not only the birds but also their cultural stories. 
For example, the skylark, turtle dove, and lapwing are linked to love and magic in stories and poems. Losing these birds is a big loss. But birds not in stories are often ignored. 
Stories and legends about birds are important. They connect us to birds in a way that science cannot. These stories help us feel and understand birds better. 
Whether we watch birds on TV or in our gardens, the joy we feel is hard to explain with science. Birds are special, and the stories we tell about them help us understand their messages. The wren in the greenhouse is like a puzzle, connecting the past, present, and future."
CPE_28,C2,"'Maps A map shows how places and features on the earth are related to each other. This is shown by distance and direction. In the past, people often measured distance by time, like 'a few hours' walk' or 'a day's journey by river'. This told more about how easy it was to travel the land than the real distance. Direction was also important, but for most travelers, the main questions were 'Where do I go from here?' and 'How far is it?'. Because of this, written travel guides were popular for a long time. Even today, some maps, like train maps, do not show true directions. Early maps used signs to show important landmarks along a route. These signs could be realistic or simple and were different sizes to show their importance. The way maps were made changed depending on their purpose and where they were made. To understand old maps, it is important to know the map's style. The history of making maps is about making distance and direction more accurate and adding more information to maps. Map making has used other sciences to help. For example, instead of using shadows or stars to find direction, people used the magnetic compass. New tools helped measure angles accurately. As people learned more about the world, they tried to map it. Astronomers found out that the earth is not a perfect sphere but is slightly flat at the poles. This changed how large areas were mapped. Over time, different people needed maps for different reasons. Soldiers needed accurate maps for planning battles. Archaeologists, historians, and geographers also needed special maps. Today, map makers create maps showing many things, like weather, land use, and more. Maps are now important for understanding many sciences. The development of maps has not always been smooth. Sometimes, old ideas stayed even when new ones came. Map makers often knew how to improve maps but had to wait for better tools. Since it is easy to copy old maps, some map makers did not want to change. So, maps should not always be seen as perfect evidence of what people knew at the time. Many maps we have today show a lot of human work and thought. They are important for learning about the past. This makes studying old maps interesting and educational.'"
CPE_35,C2,"'TIM RICE I was invited into a young man's living room. It was a nice and calm place, different from the messy rooms around it. Moving from the kitchen to his room felt like going from economy to business class on a plane. He had the largest collection of records I had ever seen and the first stereo record player I had come across. He also had Georgian wine glasses, pictures, and furniture. His name was Andrew Lloyd Webber. He had won a scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford, to study history, and he had nine months before starting. During this time, he wanted to become England's answer to the composer Richard Rodgers. I also had big dreams. I wanted to be a pop star for reasons like women, money, and fame. The difference between Andrew and me was that my dreams were not as serious to me. But when Andrew suggested I try to become a famous lyricist like Oscar Hammerstein, I decided to give it a try. Andrew played me three tunes he had composed, and I could tell he was very good. He played more music from shows he had written at school, and it reminded me of the best show albums from my parents' collection. He needed a new lyricist for the outside world. I didn't have much to impress him with, except for praising his music and a single song I had written that an unknown pop group had recorded. We promised to meet again and write something together. I was still more interested in pop music than in theater, but I thought I had met someone with rare talent and determination. I didn't want to miss the chance to work with him. Even if we didn't succeed in musical theater, we could try to compete with famous bands like the Beatles and Rolling Stones later. The next day, back at my desk where I was training to become a lawyer, my excitement about a life in show business with Andrew had faded a bit. I would still look for groups needing a vocalist and write simple songs that suited my voice. But it seemed likely I would become a lawyer by the time I was twenty-five. My father thought I would stop liking pop music by the time I was twenty-one, which worried me. But I felt I had nothing to lose by seeing Andrew again. It would be fun to write musical lyrics instead of pop songs. Andrew was interesting and talked about good food and Victorian architecture. He also supported Leyton Orient football team. I wasn't sure about the musical idea he was working on, about Dr. Thomas Barnardo, who founded orphanages. The story was good but didn't excite me. It was too similar to the show Oliver. However, Andrew believed in his music, and his confidence was contagious. I didn't know much about musicals, but I thought we could be successful. I started writing lyrics with enthusiasm, especially for the funny songs. Andrew told me the plot, played the tunes, and sometimes gave me the title. I skipped a day at the office, pretending to be sick, to write my first theatrical lyrics. I didn't know it then, but I had changed my career.'"
CPE_5,C2,"**Language**
Humans have a special ability. We can use language to share ideas with each other. Language is very important in our lives. It is hard to think about life without it. If you see two or more people together, they will probably start talking. When people are alone, they might talk to themselves, their pets, or even their plants. I think of language as an 'instinct'. This means people know how to talk naturally, like spiders know how to make webs. Spiders did not learn to make webs from school or special training.
**Climate and Weather**
Climate and weather are made by the air around us. They are very important for animals and plants. Climate can change how a place looks. For example, warm and wet places can have tropical jungles with many different plants and animals. Cold and windy places have fewer living things. Weather changes every day, and over time, it becomes the climate. Air moves because the earth spins, and the sun also makes the air move.
**Coffee**
I worked as a bar-person, serving drinks and making coffee. In Lygon Street, Melbourne, coffee is very important for restaurants. I had to learn a lot about making coffee and taking care of the espresso machine. I learned how to make a good cappuccino. At first, I thought making coffee was hard, and I might have to do easier jobs like cleaning ashtrays. But my boss was patient. He said, ""Making coffee is both an art and a science, and you need time to learn it."""
CPE_41,C2,"**Art on TV**
Why does TV often not do well with shows about art? Painting and sculpture should be easy for TV because the camera can show a whole artwork and then zoom in on details. But there are not many TV series that show both the fun and the complexity of looking at art. A good example is Robert Hughes's series about American art, called ""American Visions."" Hughes is a critic you can trust, and he has a strong personality. He had almost eight hours to show British viewers American art, which British galleries often ignore. I thought the series would focus on great artworks. Instead, it was about how American history and culture are shown in its art and buildings.
**Dealing in Metals**
For 20 years, I worked as a metals dealer and became known for taking risks. Metals are less controlled than other markets. With some luck, a willingness to take risks, and a good understanding of the market, you can make a lot of money. Risk-taking is a big part of this industry. This fits well with a free-market global economy. But now, the free-trade economists who said the market would keep metal prices high have found the opposite. More minerals are being taken out, and the cost of raw materials is going down. Considering inflation, most metal prices are about half of what they were 20 years ago. Recently, I was asked to look into claims against a big company that benefits from these cheap raw materials.
**Extract from a Holiday Brochure**
Abaco and its small islands are part of the 700 islands of the Bahamas. They stretch from Florida to Cuba. Each island is different and has something special. To get around Abaco and its islands, you need a boat. If your room doesn't come with a boat, don't worry. There are many ferries and water-taxis. You can also rent a boat if you want to go by yourself. Sailing is very popular here. Abaco is called 'The Sailing Capital of the World' because of its calm waters. These waters are great for fishing, diving, snorkeling, and swimming. The islands and their beaches stretch for 200 miles like a string of pearls. At night, the lights of the restaurants and cafes in Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay shine brightly."
CPE_69,C2,"Title: Build Your Own Bamboo Bike in the UK
At the Bamboo Bike Club in London, you can join a course to build your own bamboo bike. The club is run by engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan. On a Saturday morning in Hackney Wick, east London, you can hear the sound of machines working at the Bamboo Bike Club. This is the only place in the UK where you can learn to build a bamboo bike.
Bamboo bikes are becoming popular again. Companies like Calfee Design in California and Bamboo Bikes in Yorkshire are making them. But these bikes are expensive, costing about $2,995 or £1,868. James and Ian wanted to make bamboo bikes cheaper and more fun to build. They spent years working on this idea in a shed in Wales.
Instead of just selling bikes, James and Ian wanted to share the joy of making them. So, they started the Bamboo Bike Club. They both have other jobs—James works with wind turbines and Ian is a civil engineer. But they love teaching people how to build bikes.
In the course, you learn how to choose strong bamboo and make strong joints. You start by building the front part of the bike with bamboo tubes. Metal tubes are used for parts that need extra strength, like the handlebars and wheel forks. James and Ian help you with every step, making sure everything is done right.
Most people who join the course enjoy building their own bike. Even if you make a mistake, you can try again with a new piece of bamboo. On the second day, you wrap the joints with hemp and glue them to make them strong. After adding a waterproof coating, the bike is ready for wheels, brakes, and other parts.
Bamboo bikes are strong and can last a long time. Ian has used his bike for over a year, and James has tested one off-road for three months. The bikes may look a bit different from professional ones, but they are unique. They are also light and smooth to ride.
The cost of building your own bamboo bike at the club is less than £500."
CPE_38,C2,"**Self-help Books**
Dione Reverend was an editor at Random House in New York. She found a book by Dr. John Gray, a pop psychologist. She thought the book would be a big hit, and she was right. Dr. Gray is now very rich, and Dione Reverend has her own company. Dr. Gray's book helps people understand how men and women can talk better to each other. This book is part of a big self-help industry in America. Many people want to improve their lives, and these books try to help them. The self-help industry is also important for book publishers in New York. In Britain, many self-help books are published, but not all are good. Many books are not published because they are too similar to others. When looking for new books, editors think about how well they can sell. They ask questions like, ""Is the author interesting? Is the book idea good for many people?"" Dione Reverend says a good title is very important.
**Autobiographies**
When someone writes an autobiography, they make a promise to tell the truth. But often, writers do not tell everything. They might feel too embarrassed to share some things. Or they might think some details are not important. Sometimes, writers change the truth to make their story better. They might even call their book an autobiography to make readers believe it is true, even if it is not. This is not always done to trick people.
**Dashiell Hammett's Detective Stories**
Detective stories became popular in the late 1800s and early 1900s. These stories show the problems in society. A crime in the story shows human desires like greed. Solving the crime helps society work well again. In Hammett's stories, society is not perfect. The detective and the criminal are similar. The detective understands the criminal. He is both a good guy and a bit of a bad guy. The detective's job is sometimes hard because he feels close to the criminal.
**Science Writing**
Stephen Jay Gould is a famous science writer. I met him at a hotel to talk about writing. We both felt a bit out of place there. Gould says that to write well, you need to understand the culture you are writing about. Science is like its own world, and only scientists can explain it well. Gould believes you should not make things too simple for readers. You can use simple words, but the ideas should stay strong. If readers feel you are talking down to them, they will not like your writing."
CPE_17,C2,"**Air-conditioning**
At Cannons Gym in London, it feels very cold because they use a lot of air-conditioning. This summer is very hot, so the gym uses air-conditioning to keep cool. Sometimes, it feels as cold as the Arctic inside. Many places use air-conditioning too much. Instead, they could use other ways to stay cool. For example, they could use natural light and air, and have thicker walls to keep the heat out during the day and let it go at night. These ideas can help reduce the need for air-conditioning.
**Sundials**
Sundials are tools that tell time by the sun's position. People are interested in them again as we start a new millennium. A hundred years ago, sundials were important for keeping time. But when clocks and watches got better, sundials became just garden decorations. Now, people are using them again. David Harber, who makes sundials, says they are special because they connect us to the planets. When a sundial starts working, it feels magical. They are calm and remind us of our place in the universe.
**Paint Your Own China**
I once saw older women painting china at an arts and crafts show. They painted flowers on teacups with perfect brushstrokes. Their hands were steady, and the paint was perfect. I thought only very skilled people could do this. But when I visited a china-painting class, I found it was not scary. The students were there to have fun, and even the teacher did not want to paint quickly like a machine."
CPE_47,C2,"Title: The Wrong Country
Uncle found a holiday for Keith and Dawne. It was a good price. They would fly from Gatwick Airport and stay twelve nights in Venice at the Pensione Concordia. When they went to book the trip, the travel agent said they would be with a school group learning Italian. But something went wrong. Instead of Venice, Keith and Dawne ended up in Switzerland at the Edelweiss Hotel, Room 212.
At Gatwick, they gave their tickets to a girl in a yellow-and-red uniform. She checked their tickets and said everything was fine. On the plane, they heard people speaking with North of England accents. Keith thought maybe the Italian class was on another plane. They ordered drinks and relaxed.
When they arrived, a woman with glasses told everyone to stay together. Keith thought it was just an overnight stop. But the next morning, they realized they were staying there for the whole holiday. The receptionist said they could enjoy the lake and take a boat to Interlaken. Keith told the receptionist there was a mistake. They were supposed to be in Venice. The receptionist said their group was booked for twelve nights in Switzerland.
Dawne described the travel agent who booked their trip. A woman named Mrs. Franks, who they saw at Gatwick, said there are many holidays with similar tickets. She laughed and said they couldn't end up in a wildlife park by mistake. Keith insisted they were not meant to be in Switzerland. Mrs. Franks left to check, and the receptionist was gone too.
An old couple, Mr. and Mrs. Nottage, talked to Keith and Dawne. They said they slept well because of the fresh air. Keith and Dawne realized they were on a holiday with elderly people. They wanted to escape the needs of the elderly, but now they were on a trip with them."
CPE_48,C2,"'HE WAS A PEOPLE PERSON American business leaders are learning from the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton. Eluned Price reports. Many people in Britain know who Sir Ernest Shackleton was and what he did. In America, he is becoming popular now. The Wall Street Journal called Shackleton 'an Antarctic explorer whose achievements were mostly unnoticed for most of the 20th century.' But now, Americans are very interested in him. Books about Shackleton's journey on the Endurance are being written, and they are expected to sell quickly. The American Museum of Natural History is having a big exhibition, and Columbia Tristar is making a movie about Shackleton's life. Some American managers see Shackleton as a role model. They talk about his actions with admiration and learn lessons in leadership and communication from him. They even say they are 'speaking Shackleton.' Shackleton, who was determined and resourceful, is now a model for modern management consultants. Jim MacGregor, a manager in New York, has used Shackleton as a role model for years. His company helps with communication during business problems. For example, if a company's factory explodes or if many workers lose their jobs. Shackleton worked in public relations for a Glasgow steel company, but it might be hard to see how surviving in cold weather relates to managing a business crisis. 'Even if a company handles its problems well, it can still cause harm by not communicating well,' says MacGregor. 'Shackleton is a model for management because he was a good leader and communicator. He had strong values and was at his best when he and his team had a lot to lose, like their lives. One of Shackleton's most important decisions was to turn back when he was only 97 miles from the South Pole. This decision showed his credibility for the next expedition: the lives of his men were most important.' This refers to Shackleton's 1908 expedition to the South Pole. He was 97 miles away from the goal, but with delays and low supplies, he decided to turn back. In a crisis, people want to know someone is in charge. Today, managers often avoid responsibility, but Shackleton was ready to take it. His 1914 expedition became legendary. His ship, the Endurance, was stuck in ice for nine months and then crushed. When the ship sank, Shackleton told his men, 'We will all be safe if you keep doing your best and trust me.' From diaries and accounts, it is clear that Shackleton was always in charge. 'Shackleton thought everything through, planned for every situation, kept his men informed, and asked for their opinions,' says MacGregor. 'He was adaptable and ready to start fresh when needed. We have created a set of principles that Shackleton shows. Clients can relate to his story without feeling criticized.' Shackleton believed an explorer needs optimism, physical endurance, and patience. 'One of the hardest things to do in difficult times is to do nothing, especially in America, where people want quick solutions,' says MacGregor. 'If you buy bonds and the interest rates are wrong, you wait, and eventually, you'll get your money back. To ""fix it"" and sell would mean a big loss. Also, don't be afraid to change plans if they aren't working. If a new product is bad, don't keep selling it.' Shackleton led by example. On the way back from the Endurance, he saw Hurley, the expedition photographer, without gloves. He gave Hurley his own gloves, saying he would throw them overboard if Hurley didn't wear them. Someone else remembered him doing the same with a biscuit when they were starving in 1905: 'He said he'd leave it in the snow. Millions of pounds couldn't have bought that biscuit.' As Caroline Alexander, author of Endurance, says: 'People want to hear about heroic actions more and more. Shackleton shows that there is nothing heroic happening now. Everything else fades away, and he stands as the true example of the ideals we miss today.'"
CAE_15,C1,"'Finding Food in Madagascar Forests
In the forests of Madagascar, there is a special animal called the aye-aye. It lives like a woodpecker. Both the woodpecker and the aye-aye look for insect larvae inside wood. The woodpecker uses its beak to make holes and its long tongue to get the insects. The aye-aye uses its sharp teeth to make holes and its long, thin third finger to reach and scoop the insects.
Scientists have known about the aye-aye's way of eating for over a hundred years. But they only recently learned how it finds insects inside the wood. Dr. Carl Erickson from Duke University studied the aye-aye's hunting skills. He worked with two male aye-ayes, Nosferatu and Poe, a female named Samantha, and her baby, Annabelle.
Dr. Erickson tested if the aye-ayes found insects by looking for signs on the wood. He gave them logs with small holes. Some holes had mealworms, and others were empty. The aye-ayes went straight to the holes with food, without needing to see the holes.
Maybe the aye-ayes used smell or sound to find the insects. But tests showed they did not use these clues. They could find mealworms even when they couldn't smell or hear them. Dr. Erickson found that aye-ayes could sense empty spaces in the wood. They tap the wood with their middle finger and listen with their big ears. This helps them find hollow spaces where insects might be.
The idea that aye-ayes are like woodpeckers in Madagascar is interesting. But there are also birds there that look for insects in wood. So, the aye-aye is not the only one doing this job. The aye-aye is special because it is like a woodpecker, a bat, and a squirrel. Its teeth grow like a squirrel's, and it can open nuts with its long finger to eat the inside.'"
CAE_19,C1,"'Ordinary people, ordinary lives Many of us have photos of our grandparents, but do we know what their lives were like when they were young? Old diaries and family stories don't tell us everything. And what will our grandchildren know about us? We often want to write things down but never do it. We might leave videos, but they are still just pictures. Hannah Renier has an idea: she writes books about other people's lives. These books are not about famous people, but about ordinary people. She started this because she talked to her family and saw that many stories from the past were disappearing. ""At first, I didn't take it very seriously,"" she says. ""But then I met people with interesting lives. They do it for their children or the future, but they also enjoy it."" People feel safe to be honest with her. A 62-year-old man shared his life story, including painful parts like his divorce. He did it for his family, hoping they could learn something. But he hasn't let his children read it yet because some details might hurt them. He thinks they should read it after he is gone. He also saw patterns from his childhood that made him repeat mistakes. Ms. Renier noticed this in others too. ""Many people are influenced by their parents,"" she says. ""Things from childhood affect them all their lives. They marry people their parents liked or do the opposite to rebel."" ""Many people still feel sad about things with their parents, even 60 years later. They try to impress a parent who wasn't impressed."" Ms. Renier listens and writes their stories. ""It's not for everyone to read, and I'm not nosy. People sometimes tell me things and then say, 'I'm not sure if that should be in.' I include it, but they can remove it later. People want to be honest."" ""It's not about showing off. Life is moving fast, and we forget the past. This gives us a connection to our ancestors. People want to be remembered."" Each book takes about 30 hours of interviews. Ms. Renier writes the life story, organizes it, and makes it look nice. The book is not cheap, costing nearly £3,000, with extra copies at £25 each. She gets about 10 inquiries a week, but the cost stops many people. ""I thought it would be cheaper,"" she says. ""But the people I've worked with are usually wealthy, like readers of Harpers & Queen magazine. They are the kind of people who used to have their portraits painted for their family.""'"

The photos show the landscape and human activity from prehistoric times to now. There is a small display in the entrance hall, and the library staff can help with questions. You cannot borrow the photos, but you can buy copies, which usually take about a month to make.
**E. Cambridge Medieval Brass Rubbing Centre**
The Cambridge Brass Rubbing Centre is a unique tourist attraction. You can make wall hangings by rubbing one of over a hundred brass plates from medieval tombs. The centre makes resin copies to protect the originals, so everyone can enjoy brass rubbing. Brass plates were used as memorials on tombs and spread from Germany across medieval Europe and Scandinavia. Many were destroyed in revolutions, but most of the remaining ones are in Britain, and you can see many examples at the Cambridge Centre."

I have had small children in my life for 35 years, and I love it. This morning, I fed the baby, and that is what being a father means to me. My children and I enjoy the same things: opera, theatre, books, and music. This makes us close, especially now that they are older. I try to be there for them if they need me, but I let them call me first. I don't want them to feel guilty for not calling. My parents did that to me, and I don't want to do it to my children.
**B. The Advertising Executive**
I was about 25 when my children were born. It was hard to handle the responsibilities, but it also kept me young. As they grew up, they showed me new music and fashion, which helped me in my job.

**D. The Writer**
My first marriage ended when my children, Kate and Bonnie, were young. I tried hard to stay close to them. My ex-wife and I even lived next to each other for a while, but it was confusing for the kids. Kate says I was always there for her, but I think I treated them like adults too soon. I wish I had been more organized. I still worry about my children, even the older ones.
**E. The TV Presenter**
I was ready to have kids at 30. My wife and I had a nice house, and we decided to have a child instead of buying more things. Having my daughter Betty made me think about who I am. Being a parent is special, but it also makes you like other parents. Sometimes it is hard, but one smile from her makes everything better. A baby's smile is very powerful."

CAE_46,C1,"Title: 'Flying Without Gravity'
Journalist Tom Mumford joins students testing ideas in weightlessness. From the outside, the aircraft looked normal. The pilot told the young passengers it was a Boeing KC-135, built in 1964. But inside, it was different. It was a long white tunnel with lights on the walls. Most seats were gone, except a few at the back. The 13 students from Europe and America sat there, looking nervous. They had worked hard for a year to be on this flight. The European Space Agency asked students to suggest creative experiments for weightless conditions. The best ideas won a place on this special flight, like a wild roller-coaster ride.
For two hours, the Boeing flew like a big bird, going up and down. At the top of each curve, the pilot cut the engines at 3,000 meters. The plane went higher by itself before falling back to Earth. In those few seconds, everything inside became weightless. The students felt like they were closer to the moon than Earth.
The plane took off smoothly, but soon it climbed at a 45-degree angle for 20 seconds. The engines were loud, and we felt the blood leave our heads. Then the engines stopped, and we were weightless. For 20 seconds, we floated in silence. The floor felt like a trampoline, and one step sent us towards the ceiling. We floated without direction. Up, down, left, or right no longer mattered.
After ten seconds of falling, the pilot pulled the plane out of the dive. Gravity returned, and some students landed hard. We completed one curve, with 29 more to go. This meant ten minutes of 'space time' for experiments. Dutch students studied their robotic cat, Leonardo, to see how cats always land on their feet. They used a device to turn it belly-down with a remote control. But during one curve, a student accidentally landed on it.
Nearby, a German team studied how metal joins are affected by no gravity, thinking about future space stations. Another team from Utah State University tried to make solar sails from thin films in sunlight. They hoped these sails could use the sun's radiation like a yacht uses the wind.
After two hours of flying up and down, we felt a bit sick, but mostly excited. It was an experience we would remember for a long time. One student said, 'It was unforgettable. I wanted to be an astronaut before, but now I want it even more.'"
CAE_3,C1,"**With the Trees, I Made a Connection to New Zealand**
Jonathon Porritt is the author of ""Seeing Green - The Politics of Ecology.""
I had a strange time in my life when I didn't have any summers. I went to New Zealand every summer from here, which is winter in New Zealand. So, I had nine winters in a row. I liked it because I enjoy winter. My parents had an idea to buy a small piece of land for my brother, sister, and me to take care of. My mother said, ""If you plant trees on it, you can have it."" This way, we would always have a connection to New Zealand, which was nice because my father grew up there. They found land about 20 miles north of Auckland in a place called Rangitoupuni. The land wasn't very good, but it was okay for planting trees.
I have always liked land. I spent a year in Australia working on sheep farms and doing different farming jobs. So, planting trees sounded nice, and I was excited. My family got excited too as we started. I began planting in 1968, and by the end of 1972, we had planted all 70 acres.
In 1968, it rained a lot in New Zealand. It rained almost every day we were planting. I was often wet and cold, but it was a happy time. Every morning, I got ready for planting. I came out of the Land Rover warm and dry, but it was raining, and my raincoat was still wet from the day before. My boots were wet, and my hands were cold.
In the first year, I worked with a man who knew how to plant trees. He helped me because I had never planted trees seriously before. You carry a bag with trees around your neck. When the bag is full, it's heavy, but it gets easier as it gets lighter. The hardest part was making straight lines. You decide how far apart to plant the trees, then use three poles to make a straight line. You plant along the line, turn around, and come back.
I like hard work, and it made me fit. After a while, you get used to planting, and it becomes easy. You dig a hole, put the tree in, cover it, and move on. While working, I thought a lot about life and nature. Many ideas that are important to me now started then.
I've been back to New Zealand four times to see the trees grow. It's nice to see them because I planted them. I worry when I read about bad weather in New Zealand, but the trees are now 20 years old and doing well.
In 1984, I took time off from teaching and went back to New Zealand alone for three months. I wrote my first book, ""Seeing Green,"" there. I stayed in a small cabin with just a bed, table, and chair. I wrote in the mornings, pruned trees in the afternoons, and did research in the evenings. I still feel a strong connection to that place. It's where I feel most connected to the earth."
CAE_10,C1,"Title: Taking Care of Badgers
One day, a helper gave me a cardboard box. My husband Derek and I have a farm in Somerset. We take care of orphaned animals. Inside the box, I found three small badger cubs. They were grey, with black-and-white stripes on their heads. Their eyes were milky-colored. I had never seen badger cubs before. Usually, they stay underground when they are young. If they lose their mother, they often die because they cannot find food.
These cubs were found by builders. They accidentally destroyed the badger's home. The mother was dead, and the cubs were still with her. The cubs were healthy but cold and crying. I cleaned them and put them by the stove to keep warm. There were two females, Primrose and Bluebell, and one male, Willow. I fed them with a syringe at first. I also wiped them with a warm cloth to help them go to the bathroom. After a few days, they started drinking from a bottle.
After three weeks, Willow seemed tired. I did not know it was serious, and the next morning, he was dead. The vet said he had a lung infection. When feeding animals, it is important not to let them drink too fast. Willow drank too fast, and liquid went into his lungs, causing the infection.
I was sad but continued to care for the other cubs. Then, a local farmer brought me another male cub. He was cold and hungry. We named him Willow II. He was hard to feed, but eventually, he learned to drink from the bottle.
By the end of April, the females started eating solid food. Willow II was slower to learn but eventually ate sausages. At five months old, they all ate cereals, meat, vegetables, fruit, nuts, cheese, eggs, and seeds. Badgers usually eat earthworms, beetles, bugs, and small animals.
By August, the cubs became more active at night. We took them for walks in the evening. They played and chased each other. Sometimes they would nip us playfully. We had to be careful not to get bitten.
We saw other badgers in our field. Badgers are very territorial and can be aggressive. We were worried they might harm our cubs, so we made their pen safe.
The local press took pictures of us with the badgers. Many people wanted to help. We decided to build a home for the badgers on our farm. Our son Daniel made the plans. The new home had tunnels and chambers. It was expensive, but a local bus company and other businesses helped us.
The badgers moved into their new home. They were happy and settled in quickly. Now, I do not walk with them as often because they are active at night. Primrose has joined another group of badgers, but Bluebell and Willow II still come to say hello before going off into the night. This is their home now, and they are happy here."
CAE_67,C1,"'Looking for True North - and the Man Behind Halley's Comet
Dr. Toby Clark is a researcher at the British Geological Survey. He wants to follow the journey of Sir Edmund Halley, who studied compass directions. Anjana Ahuja reports.
Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) is famous for the comet named after him. But he also did important work on compass directions. He traveled on a ship called the Paramore to study 'compass variations'. This is now called 'declination', which is the angle between magnetic north and true north. Sailors needed this to navigate the oceans correctly.
Halley was one of the few people paid to do scientific research at that time. He sailed to the Cape Verde Islands to study declination in the Atlantic Ocean. The first trip stopped because the crew did not follow orders, but Halley tried again. He traveled to places like Rio de Janeiro and Newfoundland. In 1701, he published a map showing compass variations in the oceans. This map helped sailors for over a hundred years.
Dr. Clark, who likes sailing, wants to celebrate Halley's work by following his route. He needs to raise £70,000 for the trip. Sir Vivian Fuchs, who led an expedition in Antarctica, is helping him. Dr. Clark became interested in Halley while working in Antarctica. He read about Halley's life and found it amazing. Halley was not only an astronomer but also did other scientific work. He even helped Sir Isaac Newton with his famous book, Principia Mathematica.
Dr. Clark's trip will also have scientific value. He will take new measurements of the magnetic field with better tools. This is important because the Earth's magnetic field is always changing. The British Geological Survey and the United States Navy will provide instruments. A Danish satellite will also take similar measurements, and Dr. Clark's data will help fill any gaps.
Halley's journey was the first scientific sea expedition. He was the first civilian to be a naval captain for science. Dr. Clark has experience for this trip. He worked in Antarctica and has sailed from Rio de Janeiro to England. He plans to complete the trip in four parts with different crews.
Dr. Clark is very dedicated to this project. He says, 'I am ready to spend eight months on this trip. Halley and his life give me a real sense of purpose.'"
CAE_27,C1,"**Peacocks and Their Beautiful Tails**
Every summer, peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire show off their beautiful tails to the female peacocks, called hens. This display is a mystery that puzzled Charles Darwin. He wondered why peacocks have such big, fancy tails in a world where animals need to be strong and fast to survive.
Darwin thought animals change over time through evolution. He said the strongest and smartest animals survive and have babies. But the peacock's tail seemed to be a problem because it is big and heavy. Darwin suggested another idea called ""sexual selection."" He thought females liked beauty, so they chose males with beautiful tails.
Darwin's friend, Alfred Russel Wallace, had a different idea. He believed that if hens chose peacocks with fancy tails, those peacocks must have something special that helps them survive. Wallace thought the tail was a sign of this special quality.
Today, scientists like Marion Petrie study peacocks at Whipsnade to find answers. They want to know if hens really choose males with the best tails and if these males have other good qualities. They found that hens like peacocks with many eye-spots on their tails. These peacocks get more mates.
Another scientist, William Hamilton, thinks that showy male birds might be healthier and have fewer parasites. But Petrie and her team have not tested this idea yet. They are now looking at the children of attractive and unattractive peacocks to see if the attractive ones have healthier babies.
There is another idea called ""Fisher's Runaway."" It suggests that if a female picks a male with a slightly better tail, their children will inherit these traits. Over time, this can lead to peacocks with very long tails. This idea supports Darwin's thought that females might choose beauty just for beauty's sake."
CAE_66,C1,"**THE BOAT OF MY DREAMS**
Tom Cunliffe believes the best boat design should mix old and new ideas. He did this with his boat, 'The Westerman'. This week, the Summer Boat Show in London is full of modern yachts with new technology. Most of these boats are from a design change that happened 25 years ago. My boat, however, is on a quiet creek on the south coast. It was designed last year, but it looks like it is 100 years old. Some people might think I am a romantic person because of this. Maybe I am, but I think my boat is better because it uses both old and new boat design ideas.
Modern technology is important for building boats today, but it can sometimes make sailing too easy. Many people go to sea to experience the challenges of sailing. I think it is important for a boat to have some comforts, like a stove for warmth and a good place to sleep. But if everything on the boat is automatic, it takes away from the real experience of sailing. For example, setting and taking down sails should be part of a sailor's life.
When I bought my old boat, Hirta, I sailed around Britain for a TV show. The previous owner said she had every comfort but no luxury. Hirta had heavy sails and no modern conveniences like electricity or a fridge, but she was the best boat I ever sailed. However, old boats need a lot of care. After I hurt my back, I had to sell Hirta. I couldn't find a new boat I liked, so I decided to build one myself.
The Westerman, my new boat, has been great. The designer, Nigel Irens, first drew the boat on a napkin before using a computer. We made a model of the boat, like in the old days, and then used the computer to make changes. The final design was perfect. The Westerman has crossed the North Atlantic and won many races. She looks timeless and is very comfortable at sea. Her inside is made from old wood, which gives a peaceful feeling. She was designed as a sailing boat first, not as a place to live. This shows that you don't need to follow new trends to be happy. The Westerman is made from wood treated with a special glue, so she is waterproof like a modern boat but feels like a traditional one."

CAE_22,C1,"**Natural Talents**
Humans and chimpanzees are very similar. We are more than 98% the same in our genes. This means that the things that make us different from animals are new in our history. Our ability to make art and do other human things comes from a small part of our genes.
Scientists have found that many things we thought only humans could do, animals can do too. For example, chimpanzees use sticks as tools, and sea otters use rocks to open clams. Monkeys have simple language with different sounds for different dangers like 'leopard' or 'snake'.
Art is one thing that seems to be special to humans. But our ancestors did not make art for a long time. The first clear human art, like cave paintings and statues, appeared about 35,000 years ago with the Cro-Magnons.
People say human art is different because it is not useful, it is made for beauty, and it is learned, not instinctive. Let's look at these ideas:
1. **Not Useful**: Human art does not help us survive or have children. For example, birds sing to find a mate or protect their home, which helps them pass on their genes. Human art is different because it is not for survival.
2. **Made for Beauty**: Humans make art for pleasure. We cannot ask birds if they sing for beauty, but they mostly sing during mating season, so it might not be just for fun. This makes human art seem special.
3. **Learned, Not Instinctive**: Human art styles are learned. People in different places have different art styles, like songs in Tokyo and Paris. These styles are not in our genes. Birds, however, are born knowing their songs.
Human art changes quickly. For example, paintings from the 20th century look different from older ones like the Mona Lisa. Experts can often tell when and who painted a piece of art.
Interestingly, chimpanzees like Congo and Betsy have made paintings that look like human abstract art. Congo even got upset when his pencil was taken away. Their art was shown in a London gallery in 1957, and many paintings were sold.
These chimpanzee paintings show that the line between human art and animal activities is not always clear. Like human art, the chimpanzee art was not for survival or communication but for their own satisfaction. Some human art, too, was made for personal pleasure and not to communicate with others."
CAE_39,C1,"Title: A Big Adventure
The Taklamakan Desert in western China is one of the last places on earth that people have not explored. It is also very dangerous. Charles Blackmore crossed it and survived to tell his story.
There are not many big adventures left and not many heroes. In the past, children's stories were about brave explorers with sunburnt skin and eyes looking far into the distance. Today, you don't find such people in stories or real life. But then I met Charles Blackmore.
Blackmore's big adventure was leading a team across the Taklamakan Desert in western China. The name means 'once entered you never come out', but local people call it the Desert of Death. He talked about the dangers and excitement of the journey at his home.
The team had four Britons (one was a doctor), an American photographer, four Chinese experts, 30 camels, and six camel handlers. The camel handlers had never worked with camels before; they were truck drivers. This mistake could have been very dangerous.
The team wanted to cross 1,200 kilometers of the desert. Charles Blackmore wrote about their journey. At that time, he was leaving the Army after 14 years. He started the expedition for fun and to learn more about himself. 'I thought I would stay in the Army forever. I wanted to see who I was outside of it. It was a big risk. My wife, Tina, was worried because nobody had done that route before. We went into it without knowing what would happen. It took 59 days to cross, and the desert was kind to us.'
The team faced many problems: illness, hot and cold temperatures, thirst, and losing some of their water. 'But', Blackmore says, 'when we were very tired and the camels had no water for seven days, we found some. We didn't have the desert's big sandstorms. And we didn't face the very cold weather that could have stopped us. But we had many challenges. The sand got into everything, especially blisters and wounds. The high dunes were hard to climb for us and the camels, which sometimes fell on us.'
'What kept me going was the need to survive. We had no backup plan. No planes flew over us. Once we were in the desert, we were alone. I knew I was mentally strong, but I was scared about my physical strength. On the first day, we sat at the edge of the desert, and it was so hot you couldn't breathe. I thought, ""We have to do it now!"" I was very scared.'
How did they feel at the end? 'After walking 1,000 kilometers, you don't give up. We were very thin but strong. My body was fit, and my legs were strong. I could walk over anything.'
In the book, Blackmore talks about lying in the desert, looking at the moon, and thinking of his family. He says, 'Inside me, there's someone trying to find peace. When I doubt myself, I think of the desert and how we did it. I am proud of that expedition. But my family and our happiness are more important.'
Has Charles Blackmore found peace? 'I miss the challenge and the open spaces. We had a purpose. Now, I find it hard to be part of modern life.'"
CAE_18,C1,"Life was becoming too busy for Susan Harr, so she decided to stop using some of her gadgets and enjoy doing things by hand. Many people love technology because it gives us gadgets that make life easier and give us more free time. But Susan started to think that maybe we rely too much on technology. She had a bad experience with her broken word processor, which cost a lot to fix. This made her wonder if gadgets are really worth the trouble and money.
Susan began to let her household gadgets stop working as they got old. She questioned what ""extra time"" technology really gives us. Is it just time to buy more gadgets? She thinks that maybe we are being tricked by marketing experts. When her sewing machine started making strange noises, she decided to stop using it. Now, she sews by hand and enjoys it. She can take her sewing with her anywhere, and she doesn't have to worry about a noisy machine.
There are some gadgets Susan still likes, like the washing machine. But she found happiness in losing others. She returned her rented color TV and went back to a small black-and-white one. This made her family spend more time walking the dog, reading, talking, and doing hobbies. Susan enjoys sewing by hand now. Her old sewing machine is just a plant table. She finds sewing by hand relaxing and satisfying. She can listen to the radio or talk with family while sewing.
Susan realized that doing things by hand is not as bad as she thought. It is calming and gives her a sense of accomplishment. She doesn't have to rush from one activity to another. She also enjoys washing dishes by hand and daydreaming. Now, she looks around her house and wonders if she really needs things like the freezer, microwave, or electric lights. She thinks she could save a lot of money without them."
CAE_62,C1,"'The Cabinet-Maker Charles Hurst makes a living from making very good furniture. Joanna Watt meets him. Charles Hurst seems like a busy man. I visit his workshop in East London, under a railway arch. He greets me quickly and says, 'Well, let's start!' It's not clear if he is really in a hurry or just a bit shy. His workshop is full of half-made furniture and many pieces of wood in different colors. Hurst has been making furniture for ten years and is well-known for his work. He always has many orders, even though he doesn't advertise. People know that if you want a good cupboard, table, bookcase, or kitchen units, Hurst is the person to go to. There are many furniture-makers, but finding one who makes simple and beautiful furniture is harder. 'There are few real cabinet-makers now. People call themselves furniture-makers,' Hurst says. He is not happy with some modern furniture. 'I am surprised by what some furniture-makers do, and sad about what people accept.' He doesn't like cheap, badly made furniture. Hurst wants everything to be perfect, and he is very talented. He is confident about his skills. 'I have a huge natural ability,' he says. 'I have always been good at making things.' Hurst learned by himself. How did he learn? 'I asked the right questions and learned,' he says. Most of his work is for private people. 'I used to work for companies, but it was not fun.' Some clients come back many times. 'You end up doing the whole of their house. That is very satisfying.' But he admits that working with clients is not always easy. 'The most annoying clients are those who don't know what they want, and then decide they do when it's too late ... my favorite clients are the ones who know exactly what they want.' Hurst is happy with his work, but he also praises others. 'There are people far better than me. I can admire other people. After all, I wasn't trained at Parnham' (a top furniture design school). He is critical of craftsmen who 'try to be artists and take a year to make one piece.' He also doesn't like degree shows where students try to make fashion statements. 'A piece of furniture is not about making a statement. It has to be something that people really can use.' Hurst is confident and sometimes seems a bit rude, but he is not pretentious. As I leave, he says, 'After all, I am only making furniture,' showing he is humble about his work.'"
CAE_49,C1,"'Why do we sleep? People spend about one-third of their lives sleeping. This means sleep is very important. But scientists are not sure why we need sleep. There are three main ideas. The first idea is that sleep helps our body stay healthy. When we sleep, our body fixes any problems and makes us strong again. The second idea is that sleep helps us learn. It says that when we sleep, our brain organizes the information we learned during the day. Without sleep, we might not learn well. The third idea is about energy. It says we need sleep to get more energy for the next day, like recharging a battery.'"
CAE_31,C1,"**Eccentrics**
An eccentric is a person who acts differently from most people. They do not follow the usual rules of society. This makes us ask, ""What is normal?"" Many of us have small, unusual habits. For example, some people love entering newspaper contests, collecting beer mats, or writing letters to newspapers about many topics. Eccentricity means showing our unique self.
Inside us, there are two forces. One is called individualism, which means being different. The other is conformity, which means being like everyone else. Most people want to be accepted and loved, so they choose conformity. But some people have unusual hobbies or strong opinions. They like to meet others who share their interests. They form clubs and have meetings to talk about their hobbies. Being with others who understand them makes them feel better.
We all feel a pull between being different and being the same as others. Sometimes, we want to show we are unique. For example, a person might say, ""I say what I think,"" or ""You must take me as you find me."" We can choose to be more individualistic and show our personality. Many successful people have done this, like Bob Dylan, an American singer. He said, ""When you know what you are doing and keep doing it, people might not understand you.""
But being different on purpose is not the same as being eccentric. For example, a pop singer might wear strange clothes to get attention. If they keep doing this until it becomes normal for them, they might be eccentric. Eccentrics do not try to be odd; they just are. They do not care about what others think. They do things because it is who they are.
Eccentrics are different from people who want to impress others or escape from society. These people are aware of the world around them. Eccentrics, however, just live their lives without worrying about what others think."
CAE_58,C1,"**Natural Books**
We asked four nature experts to tell us about the wildlife book that influenced them the most.
**A. Geoffrey Lean**
Choosing the author was easy for me. As an environmental journalist, I have met many important people in this field. Barbara Ward, a small and frail woman, is the most important. She was at the center of environmental issues in Europe after the war. She combined her experiences into a strong philosophy. As a young journalist, she helped me understand everything. Choosing the book was harder. It could have been ""Only One Earth"" or ""Progress for a Small Planet."" But ""The Home of Man"" is her most important book for me. It talks about the fast growth of cities and the big themes she cared about. It is a strong message for what we now call 'sustainable human development.' I have not found a book like it since.
**B. Linda Bennett**
When I read ""Signals for Survival"" by Niko Tinbergen, I can hear the calls of herring gulls and remember the smell of the colony. This book explains animal communication very well with words and pictures. After reading it, watching a gull colony changes from chaos to an organized social structure. You can see which birds are partners and recognize families. Niko Tinbergen was a great behaviorist who wanted to share his findings with everyone. He worked with Eric Ennion, a talented wildlife artist, to create this book. Ennion's paintings show how one gull is aggressive and another is calm. This is the art of a true field naturalist.
**C. Lee Durrell**
""My Family and Other Animals"" by Gerald Durrell is the book that influenced my life the most. It led me to a wonderful husband and a career in conservation. This book made me love the natural world. I was researching animal sounds in Madagascar when I first read it. I was having a hard time, but reading this book made me happy. It shows animals, people, joy, and beauty together. Many people say humans are bad because of what we do to other species. But I think of Gerald as a boy in the book, seeing the world as a family. We need to understand this idea.
**D. Bruce Pearson**
I found ""The Shell Bird Book"" by James Fisher in my school library in 1966. I loved the 48 color plates of birds by Eric Ennion. I already had other bird books and learned to identify birds during holidays. This book encouraged me to start sketching birds. It had more than just paintings; it had chapters on bird migration, history, and birds in music, literature, and art. This book helped me appreciate birds and nature in a broader way. It showed me that my emotional and creative response to nature is as important as a scientific one. Since I was better at art than math or physics, this book opened a new path for me."
CAE_37,C1,"Title: Do Reviews Help Sell Books?
We asked five important British publishers if book reviews help sell books. Here is what they said:
Publisher A: Reviews are very important for publishers. Many people buy books because of reviews more than ads or word of mouth. Authors and publishers both feel bad if there are no reviews. Publishers think any review, good or bad, can help sell books because people want to decide for themselves. Publishers like reviews that agree with their own thoughts about the book.
Publisher B: Publishers and newspapers both care about book reviews, but they want different things. Newspapers want to entertain readers, while publishers want their books reviewed positively. Book reviews are better now than 40 years ago, but paperbacks are often ignored. Reviews help make books and authors known. A good review from a trusted person can increase sales.
Publisher C: Reviews are very important for us because we publish books by less famous authors. We don't advertise much, so we need reviews. Good reviews are better than ads because they are honest. Reviews can help sell books, but they need help from other things like word of mouth and good marketing.
Publisher D: In the US, a review in the New York Times can make a book popular. In Britain, reviews don't always have the same effect. Sometimes, books with bad reviews sell well. It's hard to predict what will happen. Non-fiction reviews often talk more about the subject than the book.
Publisher E: Publishers and writers want good reviews, but do they sell books? I published a biography with great reviews, but it didn't sell well because people felt they didn't need to buy it after reading the reviews. The reviewer's name used to matter more, but now it's about the review's style and surprise."
CAE_2,C1,"'WEATHERVANE MAKER Making weathervanes is a very old skill, starting in ancient Egypt. Today, Graham Smith keeps this craft alive in his workshop. He is one of the few people in the country who make weathervanes by hand. Graham makes special designs for each customer. 'This way, I can make a unique item,' he says. 'Many of my customers are women buying gifts for their husbands. They want a special gift that shows the man's job or hobbies.' This is different from the usual cockerel design. Graham's first weathervane was not a cockerel but a witch on a broomstick. He made it as a surprise for his wife. Friends liked it and asked him to make weathervanes for them. 'I saw that I could make many different designs,' he says. Graham decided to start a weathervane business. He was a precision engineer for 15 years. Then, he and his wife, Liz, changed roles. She went to work as an architectural assistant, and he stayed home to care for the children and grow the business. That was five years ago, and he is happy with his choice. 'My old job was not artistic, but this is fun and creative,' he says. 'I love designing.' Graham has made over 100 original designs. He works with great detail and always asks the customer to approve the design before cutting it by hand. Graham also keeps many traditional designs because they are popular. 'People like handmade things,' Graham says. 'They want something a little different.' Graham does not want to expand his business. He wants to keep it as a small craft. 'I have found my place in the market. People love the unique designs, and I enjoy turning a simple shape into something almost real,' he says. 'For many years, weathervanes have helped people know the weather by showing wind direction,' he explains. 'Now, more people are moving to the countryside, and they want a special touch for their homes. This helps crafts like mine.' Graham is very busy, sending flat-packed weathervanes to clients around the world. American and Danish buyers are especially interested. 'The price,' he says, 'depends on how detailed the design is.' His latest request was for a curly-coated dog. Whatever the occasion, Graham can make a special gift.'"
CAE_68,C1,"Title: Beginner's Luck
Before it was published, ""The Horse Whisperer"" was already a very popular book. It is the first novel by British writer Nicholas Evans. He earned a lot of money from it. Here, he talks about his inspiration and success.
At the start of the year, things were not going well for Nicholas Evans. He is a screenwriter and producer. A movie he was working on, called ""Life and Limb,"" was canceled suddenly. He was worried because he had not made money for two years, and the movie was his only hope to pay the bank.
Instead of finding a job, Evans made a surprising decision. He bought a ticket to America to research his first novel. He got the idea for the story from a man he met on Dartmoor. The man told him about a horse that became wild, but a gypsy calmed it by talking to it. These people are called ""horse whisperers.""
Evans wanted to write a screenplay about this, but after his movie project failed, he decided to write a book instead. He traveled across the US, learning about horses and the people who work with them. He felt alone and worried about his future.
By August, he had written half of the book. He showed it to a friend who was a literary agent. The agent thought Evans might get $30,000 for it, but Evans needed more money. He wrote a summary of the rest of the book and sent it to publishers.
In October, his agent called with good news. Publishers were very interested in the book. It was sold for a lot of money in the UK and the US. Hollywood studios also wanted to make a movie from it.
Evans was surprised by the success. He decided not to write the screenplay for ""The Horse Whisperer"" because he wanted to keep control of his work. He also got offers to work on ""Life and Limb"" again, but he thought it was better to write another novel."
CAE_23,C1,"'Young Chess Players
Bobby Fischer is trying to become a top chess player again, but he is older now. Chess is a game for young people. After 20 years away, Bobby Fischer is playing chess again against Boris Spassky. Bobby won the first game, and it was very good. But Bobby is not the same as in 1972. He is 49 years old and not in practice. Boris Spassky is even older. Chess has changed a lot in 20 years. Bobby Fischer made chess popular, and now it is more professional. Today, winning is the most important thing in chess. Players need strong nerves and stamina, not just intelligence. The game is very intense. Players use a chess clock to make sure they play in time. If they don't, they lose the game. Games are longer now, and there are no breaks. Young players have an advantage. In the last 30 years, each new world champion is younger than the last one. Eight of the top ten players in the world are under 30. 
Chess is also different because of computers. Players prepare a lot before a match. Computers can store many chess games and help players study their opponents. In some matches, players have teams to help them find mistakes in the other player's games. The start of a chess game is very important. Being well-prepared can help win the game. There are many good chess players today. Many grandmasters play for small prize money around the world. Chess needs both physical and mental effort. A game can last up to eight hours. Players must concentrate all the time. A small mistake can be very bad. The chess clock makes the game more tense. At the end of the game, players have to move quickly. They have only seconds to make moves. This is very stressful. Winning feels great, but losing is very hard. One win is not enough to win a tournament. Chess competitions last 9-11 days, with games every day. There are tournaments all year. World championship matches are even harder. In 1984, a match between Anatoli Karpov and Gary Kasparov in Moscow stopped because they were too tired. Karpov lost a lot of weight.
Can Bobby Fischer win again? He once said, ""All I want to do is play chess."" This made his leaving chess in 1972 surprising. But it made him famous. If he came back for money, he will earn a lot. If he came back to prove he is the best, losing could be very sad for him.'"

Nick Grosso is in his early 30s and has written three successful plays. He is now turning his first play, ""Peaches,"" into a movie script. Nick had never seen or read a play before writing ""Peaches."" He left school at 16 but returned a year later. After finishing school, he joined the Young People's Theatre. He wanted to write for actors because he liked the sound of words being spoken.
**B. Simon Pegg**
Simon Pegg, 28, studied drama at Bristol University. He is writing a TV comedy series and recently toured with comedy star Steve Coogan. Simon always liked comedy more than acting. He started performing in comedy clubs while at university. He believes making people laugh is wonderful if you have courage and good material.

But she always has hope, which helps her and others in the story. The book is fun and exciting, like an old silent movie. 
B. This story is about a local radio station in America. A smart child named Francis works there. The station was started by Roy and Ray Soderbjerg to help their sandwich shop. The radio plays music, talks, and shows. The story is funny and takes us back to the 1940s and 1950s, with old cars and radios.
C. In this story, a professor named Richard Vaisey falls in love with a Russian poet. He talks about it with his wife's first husband. The poet writes bad poems and wants Richard to help her brother, who is in jail. The story is funny and looks at relationships closely.
D. Two women and two men are best friends in London during the 1960s. One of them, James Hudson, starts a newspaper with his friend Richard Blake. They both loved a woman who died years ago.

CAE_53,C1,"**Volunteer Tourism**
Four writers talk about international volunteer work.
**A.** Volunteer tourists often help build homes or schools. They pay a lot of money to do this work. If they gave this money directly to the local community, it could pay for more work than one volunteer can do. This is true for gap year students who do not need special skills. Some studies question if these volunteers really want to help or if they just want to improve their careers. But, these projects can help volunteers learn to act kindly in their future jobs and lives.
**B.** Volunteering can help people from different countries understand each other better. It can help solve problems and create global friendships. This is good for both volunteers and the communities they visit. But, if only rich people can volunteer, it helps them more than the communities. These volunteers might use the experience to get ahead in their careers.
**C.** Sometimes, international volunteering can be seen as charity from rich countries. It can also be a way for volunteers to gain skills and experience. At its best, volunteering helps both the volunteers and the communities. It can teach skills and create cultural exchanges. Volunteering can also make people aware of poverty and injustice, and encourage them to fight these problems.
**D.** Volunteer tourism is about helping others. It is a simple way to make a difference and does not involve big governments or businesses. But, it can also ignore the bigger problems of poor communities. Volunteering is a good act, but when it is seen as a big solution to development, it can miss the real issues of global poverty."
CAE_55,C1,"'Choosing a Clock Radio Stuart Harris reports Many people listen to the radio in the morning and need an alarm to wake up. That's why we have clock radios. But how do you choose a good one? Our team, including me, inventor Tom Granger, and broadcaster Paul Bridges, tested five clock radios. One model has a 'dual alarm function'. This means you can set two different wake-up times, one for weekdays and one for weekends. But not everyone needs this. This model also has a cassette player, which is nice because you can listen to your own music. The radio quality is good, but the clock radio is big. Paul Bridges said he needs space on his bedside table for his keys, wallet, glasses, and phone. He also books a wake-up call just in case the alarm doesn't work. This model was the best-looking and the overall winner. Paul Bridges loved it, but the clock sometimes got stuck at 16.00. I liked the digital display with grey numbers on a green background. The snooze button is easy to find. The clock has a backup power, so you don't have to reset it if the power goes out. But it was hard to set up. Tom Granger didn't like the model with a built-in lamp. The lamp was hard to use, and the clock was difficult to set. The radio was also hard to tune. The buzzer was very loud. This model is popular with young people because of its bright colors. Tom Granger and I liked it because it was easy to set up without reading the instructions. But the alarm can be 10 minutes early or late. Paul Bridges thought it was too complicated and not useful. The simplest and cheapest model was liked by Tom Granger because it was small and easy to use. It has old-fashioned dial tuning, which is easy to set up. But the tuning was not very precise. The buzzer worked well and woke me up quickly.'"
CAE_50,C1,"Hedgehogs
A hedgehog is a small animal with sharp spines on its body. Hedgehogs live in many places around the world, but not in America or Australia. All hedgehogs can roll into a tight ball when they are scared. This helps protect them because their spines stick out. How well this works depends on how many spines the hedgehog has. Some hedgehogs that live in the desert have fewer spines. They might try to run away from danger first and roll into a ball only if they have to. Hedgehogs are mostly active at night and sleep during the day. They sleep under bushes or in holes in the ground. All hedgehogs can hibernate, which means they sleep for a long time in winter. But not all hedgehogs hibernate; some stay awake all year if the weather is good."

**D. Ffyona, 24, Long Distance Walker**
Ffyona dreamed of walking around the world when she was 13. She walked across Australia, which was very hard. She walked 50 miles a day with little sleep. She did it to get a record and because she needed the money from sponsors.
**E. Lisa, 26, Saloon Car Racer**

Alison trains a lot, getting up early to swim. She sometimes falls asleep at work because of her training. She likes racing because it keeps her fit and is social. Men and women often race together, but the men's events get more attention. She is part of a group working to change this."
CAE_34,C1,"Title: The Day I Met Picasso
Richard Cork remembers meeting the famous artist Picasso when he was 18 years old. Richard was traveling around Europe and Morocco before starting university. He had run out of money and found a job painting boats in Cannes, France. One day, while eating at a restaurant, he saw Picasso having lunch with his wife and friends. Richard was surprised because Picasso was known to be a private person.
Richard's friend encouraged him to ask Picasso for his autograph. Nervously, Richard approached Picasso and offered his sketchbook. Picasso kindly signed his name and drew a little picture on the page. Richard was very happy and started a conversation with Picasso, even though they needed help from an American woman to translate.
After showing his friend the autograph, Richard's friend suggested he go back and draw Picasso's portrait. Richard returned to Picasso's table and started drawing him. Picasso made funny faces and gestures, making it hard for Richard to draw. But eventually, Picasso sat still, allowing Richard to finish the portrait.
When Richard showed Picasso the drawing, Picasso smiled and decided to draw Richard in return. In a few quick strokes, Picasso drew a playful picture of Richard. Richard was amazed and thanked Picasso, asking if he could sign the drawing. Picasso, through the American woman, said Richard already had his signature.
Richard felt very lucky to have met Picasso and to have received his attention. It was a special moment that meant a lot to him."
CAE_12,C1,"**Shopping Tricks**
Have you ever gone to a store and bought more than you planned? Stores use tricks to make you spend more money. Here are some of them:
A. **Fresh Look**
Supermarkets know people like fresh food. They put fruits and vegetables at the entrance to look fresh. They might also have a bakery with the smell of fresh bread. The store might use green colors because it makes people think of fresh things.
B. **Smart Display**
Where products are placed in the store is very important. Supermarkets use computers to know where people buy the most. They put expensive or fast-selling items there. Shelves at eye level are popular because people see them first. Special offers are put in big bins to attract people who love deals. Sometimes, they put things that go together, like salad dressing near salads.
C. **Staples Spread Out**
Supermarkets put basic items like bread and sugar far from the entrance. This way, you see other things you might want to buy. Stores put popular items far away too, so you walk past other products.
D. **Less is More**
Some stores show fewer items to make them look special. Next stores do this with clothes. They look like boutiques, even though the clothes are not unique. This makes people think the clothes are special.
E. **Price Tricks**
People care more about the total bill than each item's price. Supermarkets mix cheap and expensive items. They might sell some things very cheap to get you in the store. They buy in large amounts to get discounts.
F. **Price Tags**
In chain stores, people notice prices more. Pricing something at $14.99 instead of $15 makes a difference. It also helps reduce theft because staff must ring up the sale to give change.
G. **Lighting**
Stores use special lighting. Chain stores want natural light so clothes look the same outside. Supermarkets use lights to make food look better.
H. **Walking Paths**
Stores use different carpets to guide you. One type is for walking paths, and another is for sales areas. Some stores use wood or marble for paths to make you walk on the carpet in sales areas.
I. **In-Store Ads**
When you enter a supermarket, you see big pictures of tasty food. In the U.S., some supermarkets use video screens on shopping carts. These show ads for products as you shop. They are for people who buy on impulse and can increase sales by 30%."
CAE_26,C1,"Chris Bonnington, a 58-year-old mountaineer, is famous for climbing Mount Everest in 1985. He has also created new climbing paths in Britain and the Alps and written books like ""Quest for Adventure"" and ""Everest the Hard Way."" Robin Knox-Johnston, 53, started his sea career in the Merchant Navy. In 1968-9, he was the first person to sail around the world alone in his yacht, Sunhaili. He also set a record by sailing from New York to the Lizard in 10 days. Chris and Robin worked together to sail and climb in Greenland, and they wrote about it in their book ""Sea, Ice and Rock.""
In 1979, Chris was working on a book about adventure after the war. He called Robin for an interview, and Robin invited him to sail. Chris could teach Robin some climbing, and Robin could teach Chris about sailing. It was Chris's first time on a yacht. They sailed, anchored, and then went to shore to climb. Chris was impressed by Robin's calmness while climbing. Robin had never climbed before, so Chris showed him how. Robin wanted to climb down using his arms, like on his boat, but Chris wanted him to use his legs. Robin managed to climb down safely.
During their trip to Skye, Chris and Robin became good friends. Robin suggested they combine their skills for a trip to Greenland. Chris admired Robin as a leader because he asked for everyone's opinion before making decisions. Chris found sailing boring and difficult because he preferred being on land. Robin, however, enjoyed fixing things on the boat. Chris sometimes felt useless because Robin didn't need much help.
The yacht was small, with six people on board, but it was only meant for four. In Greenland, Chris led the climbing part of the trip. He was worried about Robin's safety because if Robin fell, he could pull Chris down too. Climbing Greenland's highest mountain, the Cathedral, was harder than Chris expected. Robin wasn't a natural climber, but he did well. They tried to reach the top for 24 hours but had to turn back. Robin trusted Chris and followed his lead.
On the way home, there was a small problem. Chris was supposed to take a turn watching the boat at 4 am, but Robin didn't wake him up. Chris felt Robin didn't trust him, but Robin reassured him it was a misunderstanding. By the end of the Greenland trip, Chris learned that Robin was a kind and sensitive person."
CAE_8,C1,"**A History of the Apple**
**Early Apples (8,000 BC)**
People have been eating apples for a very long time. In ancient times, people in Britain and around Swiss and Italian lakes ate wild apples. These apples were small and not like the ones we eat today. In Switzerland, people even saved apple halves for winter.
**Apples in Britain (1000 AD)**
The French learned how to grow fruit from the Romans. They brought this knowledge to Britain. The Normans, who came after the Romans, introduced new apple types that grew better in Britain. Monks in Britain worked on creating new apple varieties, which are the ancestors of many apples we have today.
**Popular Apples (1200)**
In the 1200s, some apples became very popular in Britain. The Old English Pearmain was a favorite dessert apple. The Costard was used for cooking. However, during hard times like droughts and wars, fewer apples were grown, and more were imported. In the 1500s, King Henry VIII sent Richard Harris to France to learn more about growing apples. Harris brought back new apple types and started a modern orchard in Kent.
**Apples Around the World (1750)**
By the 1600s, apples were so loved in Britain that settlers took them to new places like Canada, Australia, the US, South Africa, and New Zealand. Captain Bligh took apples to Australia, and the Pilgrim Fathers took them to America. In America, Johnny Appleseed was famous for planting apple trees.
**Modern Apples (1850)**
In Iowa, a farmer named Jesse Hiatt found a new apple tree. The apple was so tasty that it was named 'Delicious' and became very popular. In Australia, Maria Anne Smith found a new green apple tree. This apple became known as the 'Granny Smith' and is famous worldwide.
**Today's Apples (1950)**
Today, apples are grown everywhere, from India to Africa. Most apples come from just a few types, chosen for their looks and ability to travel well, not for taste. Many old apple varieties have been lost, especially in the US. People now want more variety in apples. It's important to protect different types of apples for the future."

CAE_30,C1,"Richard Nerurkar is a long-distance runner from Britain. He is one of the top 10,000-meter runners. Richard visited a special training camp in Kenya. This camp is in a place called Nanyuki, near Mount Kenya. Mount Kenya is a very high mountain with snow on top. Richard has been coming to this place for three years to train in the winter. But he never trained with Kenyan runners before. On his fourth trip, he decided to change that. He ran his first race in Kenya and stayed at the national team training camp. This camp is where the best Kenyan runners get ready for big races. Richard was invited by the Kenyan coach because he did well in a big race, finishing fifth.
Training at high places like this camp helps runners because it makes their bodies better at using oxygen. Many Kenyan runners have been very successful because of this. Richard's first race in Africa was in Nairobi. It was the first international cross-country race in Africa. Richard found it very challenging. Many Kenyan runners finished before him, but he still felt he did well.
Kenyan runners are known for their simple way of running and living. They enjoy running and competing. Richard wanted to know how they train. At the camp, he found out. The camp is at St Mark's College, high up on Mount Kenya. It is a simple place with not many comforts. The runners live with college students, six people in one room. They train three times a day: an easy run in the morning, harder training in the middle of the day, and another run in the afternoon. They run about 40 kilometers every day, except on Sundays when they run 20 kilometers.
Life at the camp is simple. In the morning, they wash their face and brush their teeth. Breakfast is tea, bread, and boiled eggs. Lunch and dinner are similar: a maize dish called ugali, stew, cabbage or spinach, and tea. After running, they go to a stream to wash.
Richard learned a lot from his time at the camp. He thinks Kenyan runners are successful not just because of their genes or the high altitude. He believes their simple lifestyle, hard training, and love for running are the real reasons for their success."
CAE_7,C1,"**Hit and Miss of Mass Marketing**
Advertising is having problems. It's not just because of the recession. Advertising started to go down in 1989, before the recession got bad. The problem is bigger and affects the whole world. Advertising has not changed with the economy. Advertisers think about big markets and big media, but now there are many brands and media, and markets are smaller. Big brands should focus on small groups, but they often don't. This is where advertising is going wrong.
Think about your shopping. When you go to a supermarket, you might buy 30 to 50 items. Many of these are not advertised brands. You might buy a few advertised brands from the 15,000 items in the store. In a year, you probably buy only a few hundred brands. For things like cars, you might buy one every three years. You don't buy many clothes either, and most are not advertised brands. Even with candy, medicine, and other services, you probably buy less than 400 different brands a year.
There are 32,500 branded goods and services advertised. Let's focus on the 9,500 brands that spend more on advertising. Mr. and Mrs. Average buy 400 of these, and not all because of ads. That's about 4%. So, 96% of advertising might be wasted, but nobody knows which part. When you watch TV, count how many ads are for brands you buy or might buy. For most people, it's about 1 in 16 (6%). The other 15 (94%) are wasted.
You might think ads don't affect you, but they do. Most people don't buy most brands they see advertised. Waste is part of advertising. Not everyone who sees an ad will buy the product. People notice only a few ads and ignore the rest. But advertising can still be cost-effective. It reaches many people to find the few who will buy. Even with smart targeting, advertisers can't know exactly who will respond.
Face-to-face selling is different. A salesperson might succeed with every client. This can't happen with media. If advertisers knew who would respond, they wouldn't need media. They could talk to people directly. This is true for all ads, from soft drinks to important notices. If an ad gets one million new customers (2% of adults), it's doing well. For soap powder, the top brands would be happy with a million new customers. Any ad campaign that wins over 2% of people is very successful. To succeed, advertising needs to target its message better."
CAE_43,C1,"'Charles Clover visits Britain's most environmentally-friendly home. Southwell in Nottinghamshire has two surprises. The first is Southwell Minster, an old cathedral with 'green' men carved into it. The second is the 'autonomous house', built by Robert and Brenda Vale. The Vales use rainwater for washing and drinking, recycle their waste into garden compost, and heat their house with heat from electrical appliances and their own body heat, along with their three children and two cats, Edison and Faraday. The house looks traditional with a clay roof and is 300 yards from the Minster. It matches the town's old buildings and was approved by planners even though it is in a protected area. The house is very quiet because it is super-insulated with special windows. Inside, you must take off your shoes. The house is very quiet and still. On a sunny day, the conservatory warms the air before it goes into the house. Robert opens windows to let in air because the house is very airtight. Even the cats have their own small door. The Vales, who teach architecture, cared about the environment before it was popular. They wrote a book on green architecture in the 1970s. They designed a house that does not use carbon dioxide and does not need mains water. They use composting toilets, rainwater tanks, and copper gutters to keep the water clean. Water from washing goes into the garden. They do not have a dishwasher because they do not want to use strong detergents. They wanted to show that it is possible to have an environmentally-friendly house without living in the dark. The house looks old in style, but it is modern. The Vales do not pay water bills. Last winter, they used only a small amount of electricity, costing about 70p a day. Soon, they will use even less with new solar panels. The house will make extra electricity, enough to charge an electric car. The only heating is a small wood stove, used only in very cold weather. In winter, the house is warm enough without extra heating. The house is low-tech and easy to fix. Most materials came from local builders, making it cheap to build. Commercial builders do not like this idea.'"
CAE_51,C1,"'The camera never lies Arthur Conan Doyle, who created the Sherlock Holmes stories, thought he was a logical man, like a scientist. But in 1920, when he saw photos of fairies in a garden, he believed they were real. He published the photos with an article he wrote, saying fairies were amazing supernatural things. In 1939, the two women who took the photos said they were fake. They had cut out pictures of fairies from a book and put them among flowers. The photos are very pretty. But this simple trick shows that the camera can lie. Today, we know we can change our digital photos with computer software. It is not true that photography was always honest. From the start, photos could be changed.'"
CAE_11,C1,"**Blacksmiths**
Iron has always been important to people, and blacksmiths, the people who work with iron, have been seen as special. Before machines were common, blacksmiths were as important as doctors because they made weapons, armor, and farming tools. They were also seen as artists. In the 1700s, blacksmiths made beautiful ironwork for places like St Paul's Cathedral. The fancy metalwork in French and Belgian buildings was also made by skilled blacksmiths.
By the late 1960s, there were not many blacksmiths left in Britain. Big factories did not need them anymore, and new buildings did not use pretty ironwork. But in the last 10 years, blacksmithing has become popular again because people are more interested in decorative buildings and new interior designs. Still, many ironworks look old-fashioned, like 'classical' or 'Victorian-style' gates and balconies. In many design stores, you see rusty candlesticks with decorations.
Luckily, there are new ideas, and some events are happening to show blacksmiths' work. One event is an exhibition by the British Artist Blacksmiths Association (BABA) at the Fire & Iron gallery in Leatherhead, Surrey. Alan Dawson, the secretary of BABA, says we might be starting a new Iron Age. Power tools help blacksmiths work more easily, allowing them to create art with metal.
About 250 pieces are in the show, from bookends to a spiral staircase. Prices start at £90 and go much higher. Most money goes to the makers, but some helps promote good ironwork. Dawson made an eight-foot gate and a lamp with a glass shade. He says his style is like drawing with metal.
Many artists love working with iron. Unlike other metals, iron is hard to shape when cold but soft when hot. Susan May, a jeweler, says it's magical because it changes from soft to hard. Ann Catrin Evans makes door-knockers and handles inspired by castles in horror films. She likes that steel feels strong and lasting.
Iron has given people visual pleasure and a feeling of safety. It will likely be used decoratively for many years, as long as we avoid more rusty candlesticks."
CAE_14,C1,"Title: The Day I Stopped Smoking
I thought everyone would be happy when I stopped smoking, but one of my coworkers was very angry. She said, ""If it was so easy, why didn't you stop years ago?"" I couldn't really explain how I went from smoking a pack a day to not smoking at all in just four hours. It was strange to me too.
I went to a stop-smoking session that was a mix of group therapy and hypnotherapy. This happened two months and three weeks ago. I didn't plan to stop smoking, and I didn't really want to. I didn't like the pressure from people who wanted everyone to stop smoking. Also, I was healthy and didn't feel sick from smoking. I didn't cough and got over colds quickly, unlike some of my healthier friends.
On a normal Thursday afternoon, I went to a session called ""The Easy Way to Stop Smoking"" in Birmingham. I was there to write an article about other people trying to quit smoking. I told them, ""I won't try to stop myself because I'm here to write, not to quit."" I thought I was being fair. I actually enjoyed smoking; it made me happy.
The counselor seemed to understand something I didn't. We were allowed to smoke as much as we wanted, and the room was full of smoke. But when they told us to smoke, I didn't really want to, and neither did the others. The messages about stopping smoking made sense to me. The idea of not smoking started to feel good. It was a personal feeling, just for me.
Stopping smoking was easier than I thought. The cravings for nicotine, which felt like hunger, went away after a minute or two. I only felt them for four or five days. I thought working without cigarettes would be hard, but it wasn't a problem at all. I was surprised that being at home on weekend mornings was the hardest part, and it still is. I think smoking was something I did when I was bored.
I do miss smoking, but not too much. I have to get used to doing things without smoking, like eating out, waiting for a plane, checking into a hotel, or during a theater break. These were times when I used to smoke."

CAE_56,C1,"Margaret and Her Special Talent
Margaret Wilkins has a special talent. She can find water underground using a simple tool called a fork of hazel wood. Many farmers ask for her help when their wells dry up. Margaret and her husband have a business that drills wells. They use machines like drilling rigs and hammers. But to find water, Margaret only needs her special stick.
People say Margaret has a ""sixth sense."" This means she can do something that seems like magic. She can find water, minerals, and lost things underground. Some people think this is because everything on Earth vibrates, and water vibrates more than other things. Margaret can feel these vibrations. She says she can even smell water.
In recent years, there has been less rain, so Margaret has been very busy. Many farmers need her help because their wells are dry. She also helps people who have holiday homes far from water pipes. Some golf course builders also need her help to find water.
Margaret looks for water that is deep underground, between 50 and 70 meters. She makes sure the water is clean and not mixed with waste. The water is in small cracks in hard rock. It is important to have electricity nearby to pump the water up.
To find water, Margaret starts with a map and a pendulum. She moves the pendulum over the map, and it swings when there is water. Then, she walks on the land with her special stick. When she is over water, she feels something strange and uses the stick to find the exact spot to drill. The stick moves up when it is over water.
Margaret's husband also checks the spot. They must agree on where to drill. If they don't agree, they keep looking.
Many people are interested in how Margaret finds water. She calls it ""feeling the environment."" This is how she and her family make a living with their well-drilling business. Without her special talent, they could not do this work."
CAE_36,C1,"**We changed lives for a day!**
Have you ever thought about living someone else's life for a day? Maybe you think it would be fun to try something different. We helped four people do this. Here is what happened.
**Amanda's Story**
Amanda is 23 years old and has two daughters. She swapped lives with her friend Cindy, who is 30 and works as a waitress in a busy London restaurant.
Amanda had never been in a place like the restaurant before. It was dark, noisy, and full of people. She had to learn how to carry a tray of drinks with one hand. It was hard, and she dropped the drinks on the floor. The other waitresses laughed and said everyone makes mistakes at first.
By 11:30 am, there was a line of people waiting to come in. Amanda was nervous about remembering orders, but everything was done by computer. After a few hours, her feet hurt, and the loud music was hard to get used to. She had to ask customers to repeat themselves, which was embarrassing. By 5 pm, she was very tired and wanted to rest her feet. She was surprised to hear it was a ""quiet"" day. Amanda realized waitressing is hard work and not well-paid. She was happy to go back to her children.
**Cindy's Story**
Cindy was nervous but excited to be a ""mum"" for the day. She thought she could handle Amanda's cheeky daughters, but it was harder than she expected. After taking Sophie to school and Katie to nursery, Cindy thought she would have some free time. But Amanda left a note with chores to do.
In the afternoon, Cindy picked up the girls. They were full of energy, jumping on the sofa and screaming. Cindy tried to stay calm, thinking they would get tired, but they didn't. She finally got them to bed by 8 pm, but they kept asking for water to stay up and watch TV. Cindy found it tiring to look after two small children. She didn't have time for herself and felt a big sense of responsibility. Still, she enjoyed the day.
**Rosemary's Story**
Rosemary is 42 and runs a dairy farm. She swapped with Hilary, a 30-year-old primary school teacher.
On the farm, Rosemary wakes up at 5:30 am, so sleeping until 7 am felt like a treat. She was nervous about what to wear to school. At assembly, she saw about 400 students and hoped she blended in.
Rosemary helped with a math class and a nature project about snails. By lunchtime, she was tired but found out teachers only have a short break. She attended a meeting and helped with sports trials. After lunch, there was a reading lesson and a French lesson. The children wanted to practice French with her, which was fun but showed her rusty skills. By the end of the day, she was exhausted. Rosemary found teaching hard, especially speaking in front of the class. She decided she preferred farming.
**Hilary's Story**
Hilary arrived at the farm at 8:30 am and found out Rosemary had been working for three hours already. The farm has 100 cows, 15 calves, and about 800 sheep. Rosemary also makes ice cream, yogurt, and cream.
Hilary spent the morning in the ice cream shop, bottling milk and packing ice cream. At lunchtime, she checked the sheep and helped a fallen ewe. She learned that sheep need to be checked every day. After feeding the calves, she started milking the cows, which took two and a half hours. Rosemary does this twice a day, every day of the year.
Hilary found the farm work lonely and missed the children from school. She realized farming is hard because you can't take time off. Rosemary only gets about three days of holiday a year. Hilary thought farming seemed romantic, but the reality is different. The income is not steady, and the weather can be a big problem."
CAE_6,C1,"'A trumpet isn't just for Christmas... Many musicians come from homes without music. Hakan Hardenberger is one of them. He is from southern Sweden and is now a famous trumpet player. He is 30 years old. His parents did not play music, but they gave him a trumpet as a Christmas present when he was eight. His father liked Louis Armstrong and wanted to give his son a real trumpet, not a toy. Hakan loved the gift and played it all the time. His mother found a teacher for him, Bo Nilsson, who was a trumpet player in the Malmo Symphony Orchestra. Bo saw that Hakan had talent and helped him a lot. Hakan learned to work with the trumpet's imperfections and developed his own sound. He always wanted to be a solo artist, not play in an orchestra. He admired Maurice Andre, a French trumpeter, and listened to all his records. Hakan's parents supported his dream to be a trumpet player. At 16, he went to Paris to study with Pierre Thibaud. Thibaud also thought playing in an orchestra was not for Hakan. At 17, Hakan entered a competition in Paris. He did not win first prize, but he realized he could connect with people through his music. Hakan does not like to explain why he can communicate so well with music because he thinks it might ruin the magic. He believes music can always move people.'"

CAE_45,C1,"**Career Power: How to Be a Good Leader**
A. **What is a Good Leader?**
A good leader is someone who inspires others and helps them change. A leader shows the way forward. Leadership is not about being tall or very smart. Pat Dixon, who wrote a book about men and women at work, says leadership is about making things happen with people who are as excited as you are. A good leader should speak clearly and with confidence. They should say ""I believe"" instead of ""I think.""
B. **Can Anyone Be a Leader?**
John van Maurik, who teaches about leadership, says many people can be leaders, but they don't know it. We all have some leadership skills. We just need the right time and place to use them. We often see leaders like Mahatma Gandhi or Richard Branson, but leadership is also important in our own jobs.
C. **Think About Your Bosses**
Think about the best and worst boss you had. Both might have been good at setting goals and meeting deadlines. But the best boss motivated you and supported you. The worst boss made you feel unimportant and blamed you when things went wrong. The first boss was a good leader; the second was not.
D. **Leaders vs. Managers**
Leaders and managers are different. Managers like to work within rules. Leaders create new ideas. A good manager can keep a company running. A good leader can change a company for the better.
E. **Improve Your Leadership Skills**
Whether you are the boss or not, you can learn to be a better leader. Here are some tips:
- Find out what you are passionate about and use that energy to lead.
- Think of yourself as a leader. Believe in your ability to lead.
- Sometimes you need to be firm. Try different ways to lead and see what works best.
- Set goals and try to beat them. Look at your job and see where you can be a leader.
F. **Keep Learning**
- Leadership takes practice. You need to take risks and learn from mistakes.
- Learn how to motivate and organize people. Praise them when they do well.
- Your way of leading might not work for everyone. Keep improving your communication skills.
- Be visible and easy to talk to. But remember, you don't have to lead all the time. Know when your help is needed and help others become leaders too."

**A. Abyss**  
Before making Titanic, director James Cameron created this exciting Cold War movie. It is about oil workers and navy experts trying to save a submarine deep underwater. The main character, Bud, and his team are brave and funny. The special effects are very good, but the story is simple.
**B. The Thin Red Line**  
This movie is based on a book about the battle for Guadalcanal. It is directed by Andrew Marton. The movie focuses on one soldier and his tough sergeant.

This is a new version of the classic movie. The sound is very clear, and the music is exciting. The story is about three men, the good (Clint Eastwood), the bad (Lee van Cleef), and the ugly (Eli Wallach), who are all looking for treasure. They are all tough and not very nice.
**F. The Longest Day**

CAE_42,C1,"'Using Technology at Home
Georgina McGuiness took a long break from her job in journalism. She felt she didn't know much about new technology. Here, she tells how she changed her home into a good place to work.
Two Christmases ago, I turned 37. I realized I needed to restart my career in journalism. My skills were old. I used to work with a typewriter and carbon paper. Now, jobs wanted people with computer skills, like desktop publishing, which I didn't know. I was afraid of technology. Even simple things like calculators were hard for me. I didn't know how to use the video timer. I needed to learn quickly.
I entered a competition in a local newspaper. My family and I won a computer package. We got a laptop for my husband and a personal computer for the family. We started learning about the Internet and new words like cyberspace and surfing. We talked to people around the world online. The children stopped watching TV. I made a small office in the kitchen with a phone, fax machine, CD-ROM, and modem. I could work from home and still take the kids to school.
The children were good with computers because they learned at school. I was scared I would lose my work if I pressed the wrong button. But I learned the basic skills. It was easy and logical. I learned more every day. Now, I write two articles a month for a magazine. I feel happy because I can work and be with my family.
The computer helped me be organized. I used to lose important papers. Now, I use spreadsheets to track money and invoices. The Internet helps me research stories and talk to other journalists. But working from home can be lonely. There are distractions, like house chores, and the kids want to use the computer too.
Many people now buy computers for education and fun. In my neighborhood, people work from home to avoid traveling to the city. A report says the average computer user is 38 years old and well-educated. Most have a personal computer, and many have a CD-ROM and modem. I am ahead of this trend. Maybe one day, I will send my work to a newspaper in Melbourne or start my own magazine from home. The possibilities are endless.'"
CAE_59,C1,"**The Tartan Museum**
The new Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh looks very different from the old buildings around it. It has big, yellow stone towers and buildings shaped like cheese wedges. Some people like the modern design, while others do not. Inside, the museum is almost ready to open, and the displays are interesting.
The museum tells many stories about Scotland's history. It has important things like Mary Queen of Scots' jewels. The museum is not just for experts; it is for everyone, even if they do not know much about history. Dr. David Clarke, who is in charge of the exhibitions, wants visitors to have a good experience. He believes in showing the truth about history, not just imagined scenes.
The museum uses explanation panels and some computers to tell the stories of the objects. When you walk inside, you see many different rooms with pale walls and big display cases. There is a lot of light coming in, and you can take your time to look at everything.
There is also a Discovery Centre for children, thanks to a group of kids from all over Scotland. They wanted to ride through the displays, but instead, they got a special hands-on area for kids.
On the top floor, there is a gallery about the twentieth century. It has things chosen by Scottish people that were important in the last century, like an electric guitar and televisions. This part will change every three years.
Dr. Clarke believes that objects help us understand the past. The modern building looks good from the inside, but some people are not sure if it fits with the old city around it."
CAE_54,C1,"'The end of print may take some time Peter Preston Transition. Transition means change. Change can be scary for some people. But transition is moving from now to the future. Newspapers are trying to move to the online world. This is not easy. Many people think it will happen because print newspaper sales are going down, and visits to newspaper websites are going up. For example, The Daily Telegraph and The Guardian have fewer print sales, but more people visit their websites. However, this is not true everywhere. In some places, print sales are still strong. The World Association of Newspapers says global newspaper sales went up by 1.1% last year. Sales in the West went down, but in Asia, they went up. News magazines also did well, with a 5.4% increase. Books are similar. E-readers like Kindle are popular, but physical book sales only went down by 0.4%. People still read newspapers. Nearly 5,000,000 young people in the UK read national newspapers. In Europe, the situation is different in each country. In Britain, print sales dropped by 10.8%, but in Germany, the drop was only 7%. In France, it was just 3.1%. These differences show that the change to digital is not simple. In the US, online ads were supposed to help newspapers, but now they are not doing as well. Many US newspapers have paywalls, where people pay to read online. The best way to get people to pay is to offer both print and online access together. Print is still important for selling online subscriptions. Print ads make more money than online ads. This is not easy for newspaper companies because running both print and online is hard and expensive. But print still helps newspapers be noticed.'"
CAE_32,C1,"**Photographing People**
Taking pictures of people is very interesting. Photos with people in them are usually more exciting than those without. But, taking good pictures of people can be hard. You need to think about how people move and their facial expressions. Sometimes, people act differently when they see a camera.
**A. Grouping People**
When taking pictures of a group, don't make them stand in straight lines. Ask them to stand at different angles or levels. Some can sit or kneel in front so you can see all faces. You can also take the picture from a higher place.
**B. Posing for Pictures**
People often feel stiff in front of a camera. Help them relax by finding a comfortable position. They can fold their hands or put them in their pockets.
**C. The Right Approach**
Don't pretend you are not taking a picture. This can make people feel tense. Most people will agree to have their picture taken. They might feel shy at first, but they usually like it. You might need to guide them a bit. Make sure they are not looking away from the camera.
**D. Eye Contact**
A picture is more powerful if the person looks at the camera. Ask them to look into the lens. They don't have to smile. Remind them to look just before you take the picture. You can also say something funny to get a real reaction.
**E. Candid Concentration**
Instead of looking at the camera, the person can focus on something else in the picture. This can make the picture feel more natural. It looks like you are watching them without them knowing.
**F. Expressions and Gestures**
Expressions and gestures tell us a lot about a person. A laughing child makes us smile, while a sad face makes us feel sad too. Look for common expressions like winks, tears, or thumbs-up. They are easy to understand.
**G. Situation Interest**
A person's background can make a picture more interesting. Make sure the background is not too busy. Focus on the person. Use a wide-angle lens to make the person look bigger compared to the background.
**H. Interaction**
When people are talking, joking, or working together, you can take great pictures. Look for eye contact or physical contact, like a handshake. Capture how one person reacts to another.
**I. People and Places**
Many pictures are taken on holidays to show where people have been. Use a wide-angle lens to include the background. Ask people to stand close to the camera. This way, you can see both the people and the place clearly.
**J. To Pose or Not to Pose?**
Decide why you want to take the picture. If you want to remember someone, ask them to pose with a nice background. Family pictures can be more fun if they are not posed. Candid pictures of real moments are more lively and memorable."
CAE_65,C1,"Title: 'Under Sarah's Spell'
Sarah Janson is an artist who makes trompe-l'oeil paintings. These paintings trick the eye and look very real. Sarah does not usually sign her work unless someone asks her to. She believes the art is more important than the artist. Sarah is very humble and sometimes acts like her paintings make themselves. She does not like to talk about herself and feels shy about being photographed.
Sarah has been a trompe-l'oeil artist for sixteen years. She studied drawing for two years at art school, got a degree in graphic illustration, and worked at a publishing house. But she did not enjoy illustration much. She then worked with a decorator named Jim Smart, who asked her to make a trompe-l'oeil painting. She loved it and decided to start her own business.
Sarah is very good at observing details, which is important for trompe-l'oeil art. She says you cannot learn trompe-l'oeil from a school; you learn it from life by observing. She believes she is still learning and says, ""The moment you think you've mastered something, you should stop.""
Sarah is honest about her weaknesses. She says she cannot paint bread well because it looks like grey concrete. She also finds math difficult. When she had to paint a big ceiling at Lulworth Castle, she got confused with the measurements. She often questions herself and sometimes talks about her work as if someone else did it.
Sarah's work is very special and better than many others who try to do trompe-l'oeil. She has done many big projects for companies and private clients. Her art is often inspired by buildings. For example, she painted a dining room to look like a Venetian palace and a corridor that looks like it leads to more rooms.
Trompe-l'oeil art must do two things: it must trick you and then keep your interest. Sarah believes the art should also be personal to the client. She enjoys working with clients and getting ideas from them. Many clients become her friends because she spends a lot of time with them while working.
Sarah appreciates her clients and is thankful for those who let her paint on their walls. She is always busy because her clients are happy with her work, even though she does not like to talk about her talent. She says, ""I don't like to shout about myself. Like my work, I am very quiet. You get bored with things that shout."" But you could never get bored with Sarah or her art. Her work deserves to be more famous."

These are called emotional intelligence. Doing well in exams is not enough anymore. We need to have good people skills.
**B** Today, job security is not guaranteed, so personal qualities are important at work. Emotional intelligence is about understanding and managing our own and others' feelings.

Emotional intelligence helps people work well together.
**C** Many businesses see emotional intelligence as important for success. It is especially important in jobs that are not simple. People with good emotional intelligence can work better with others. As work becomes more complex, teamwork and customer focus are important. Emotional intelligence is needed for success in every job around the world.
**D** Unlike IQ, emotional intelligence can grow as we learn from life. We can get better at handling emotions, motivating ourselves, and understanding others. This growth is called maturity. We can learn emotional intelligence skills to help us in life. It is important because jobs are not always stable. Emotional intelligence is not a magic solution, but it helps make everything work better."

Social media has changed how people share these pictures. Now, news often starts on social media, and some journalists use these pictures for their stories. Sometimes, they use these pictures without asking for permission. There are rules that say it's okay to use these pictures without asking if it's very important for the public. But people still talk about whether this is right or wrong. Research shows that about one in ten people would take pictures or videos of a news event. This means that pictures from regular people are important for the media.

CAE_28,C1,"**Ancient Chinese Medicine in the West**
**Acupuncture: An Old Practice**
Acupuncture is a very old practice, about two thousand years old. It comes from China and is part of traditional Chinese medicine. This includes using herbs, massage, diet, and exercise. Acupuncture is used to help with many health problems, but it is most known in the West for helping with pain. Some doctors, midwives, and physiotherapists use it to help people feel less pain.
**How Does It Work?**
In traditional Chinese medicine, being healthy means your mind, body, and spirit are in balance. They believe energy, called Qi (pronounced ""chee""), moves through the body along lines called meridians. There are twelve main meridians, each connected to an organ. If the Qi is blocked or weak, you might feel weak or get sick. An acupuncturist will check your wrist pulse, look at your tongue, and ask about your health, mood, and habits to find where the Qi is not balanced. They use thin needles on the skin to help Qi flow better. Sometimes, they also use heat or pressure.
**Acupuncture Points**
There are over three hundred points on the meridians where needles can be placed. These points might not be near where you feel pain. People often feel a dull ache or tingling when the needle is used. This feeling shows the needle has reached the Qi. 
**Scientific View**
Even if they don't believe in traditional Chinese ideas, some doctors think acupuncture can help with pain. They have scientific reasons for this. For example, acupuncture might block pain signals from reaching the brain or release natural painkillers in the body.
**Types of Pain Treated**
Many people with long-term pain try acupuncture. It is used for back pain, sports injuries, arthritis, headaches, and pain after surgery. Acupuncturists also say it can help with menstrual pain, facial nerve pain, and pain in very sick people.
**Modern Use**
Acupuncture has been used in China for over 2,000 years. In the 1950s, it started being used instead of anesthesia during surgery. This helped some doctors outside China see that acupuncture could be more than just a mind trick. In China, it is used in many surgeries, like tonsil removal and heart surgery. Needles can be used alone or with electricity or medicine. It is said to reduce pain, but it depends on the person. Acupuncture does not have the side effects of regular anesthesia, like feeling sick, and people recover faster.
**Effectiveness**
It is hard to test acupuncture in clinical trials, but some trials show that 50 to 80 percent of people find it helps with long-term pain. Acupuncturists agree with these numbers. They know it does not work for everyone. For long-term pain, it usually takes six or seven visits to feel better, but some improvement should be felt after two or three visits.
**Different Views on Pain**
Western and Chinese medicine see pain differently. Acupuncturists look at the whole person, not just the symptoms. They spend time finding out what might be causing the pain, like if it is worse in cold or damp weather. This helps them decide how to use acupuncture. Regular doctors might not consider these things.
**Choosing an Acupuncturist**
Some medical professionals have traditional acupuncture training. Others, like many general practitioners, use scientific explanations instead of traditional Chinese ideas. Traditional acupuncturists believe their way can lead to longer-lasting cures. It is important to choose a good acupuncturist, and they should send you to a doctor if needed."
CAE_35,C1,"P.D. James is a famous crime writer. Her full name is Phyllis Dorothy James. She looks like a calm and strong person. Some people think she could have been a headmistress at a girls' school. But she is actually a bit shy. She says that her detective character, Adam Dalgliesh, is like her. He likes to solve crimes alone, just like she likes to write alone. She needs privacy to write. P.D. James is very popular, but she is modest and does not call herself the best crime writer in Britain. She likes reading books by her friend Ruth Rendell, who also writes as Barbara Vine. She enjoys books by women writers like Iris Murdoch and Anita Brookner, but also reads male authors like Graham Greene.
P.D. James became successful later in life. She was 42 when her first book, ""Cover Her Face,"" was published. She was born in Oxford and grew up in Cambridge. She met her husband, Connor Bantry White, in Cambridge. He was a student there. Her life was not easy. Her husband came back from World War II very sick. She had to work hard to support him and their two daughters, Clare and Jane. Her husband's parents helped take care of the children.
P.D. James worked for the National Health Service and later for the Home Office. She worked in the Police Department and the Criminal Law section. She saw many things related to crime, but she was more interested in writing stories. She liked the challenge of writing detective stories. She wanted to be a serious writer and thought detective stories were a good start. Writing these stories helped her bring order to chaos. She believes solving a crime shows the importance of life. She says nobody really likes violence."
CAE_5,C1,"'Handwriting Can Show Your Personality In some countries, when you apply for a job, you might need to give a sample of your handwriting. Your handwriting can help decide if you are right for the job. Handwriting analysis, called graphology, is seen as a real science in many places. Experts say it can help find some illnesses like heart disease and cancer. It can also show how a person feels and thinks. Many big companies use graphologists to look at the handwriting of people who want important jobs. But many doctors and psychiatrists do not believe in graphology. Patricia Marne, a graphologist for over 20 years, thinks they should take it seriously. She says handwriting can show if a person is smart, what job they might be good at, and if they are honest or tricky. Ms. Marne believes graphology can help find people who might commit crimes. She says criminals often have messy handwriting. She can tell if someone is honest, a good worker, or if they might be violent. Handwriting can also show if someone is very stressed or might have health problems. If a person's handwriting changes a lot, it might mean something serious is happening. Ms. Marne says it takes six years to learn how to analyze handwriting well. She thinks more research is needed to make graphology a real science. Some people do not agree with her. They say handwriting is just about how you learned to write and does not show anything else.'"
CAE_41,C1,"'Is your office working well? Fresh air and good chairs are important for a happy and healthy workplace, says a new survey. We visited four different offices to see how healthy and happy they are. Our expert team included a building health consultant, an ergonomist (who studies people's working conditions), and an occupational psychologist. Here are their opinions.
Office A: Advertising Agency
Building Health Consultant: This office is very simple. There is no central heating or mechanical ventilation, and the windows open to the street. The team of seven people seems happy and adapts to the seasons by opening doors and using electric heaters, like at home. They have created a friendly work environment without much outside control.
Ergonomist: The furniture is mixed and old, with many broken chairs that are not adjustable. However, the team has different tasks, like meeting clients and making presentations, which helps prevent tiredness and boredom.
Occupational Psychologist: The staff enjoys the variety of work and the flexible office space. They like the office size, which is small enough to know what others are doing but big enough for personal work. The office feels efficient and creative.
Office B: News Service
Building Health Consultant: The office is comfortable and the air quality is good, helped by a No Smoking policy.
Ergonomist: The chairs, lighting, and computer equipment are good, but the office is plain with grey walls. The layout could be better.
Occupational Psychologist: The walls are bare except for a few posters. Most staff have been there for over five years, and relationships are okay. The office could improve by making it easier to share information.
Office C: Bank
Building Health Consultant: The office feels like a glass case. Even with smokers, the air is not stale.
Ergonomist: The office is standard and not inspiring. Desks are just okay, and some chairs are not suitable for computer work. Computer screens are on small desks, which is not ideal.
Occupational Psychologist: Staff support each other and use technology well. The office is busy, but the wood panels and brown carpet make it look a bit dull.
Office D: Newspaper
Building Health Consultant: The air conditioning is poor, causing temperature changes. The office is cluttered and dusty.
Ergonomist: The furniture is old and not suitable for computer work. Many chairs are not adjustable and have armrests that make it hard to sit close to the desk.
Occupational Psychologist: The office is dirty with old chairs and carpets. It needs cleaning and better air conditioning. Few people were talking, and everyone seemed stressed. The company should encourage teamwork.'"
CAE_38,C1,"Chewing gum is very popular, and Americans chew 12 million pieces every day. It has less than ten calories per piece and is considered a food, so it must meet the rules of the American Food and Drug Administration. Today, most gum is made from synthetic materials with added pine resins and softeners to keep the flavor and make it feel nice to chew.
A long time ago, the ancient Greeks chewed a resin from the mastic tree, found in Greece and Turkey. Greek women liked it to clean their teeth and freshen their breath. In America, early settlers learned from Native Americans to chew resin from spruce trees. In the early 1800s, people in the eastern United States could buy spruce gum, making it the first commercial chewing gum there.
Modern chewing gum started in the late 1860s with chicle, a milky substance from the sapodilla tree in Central America. This gum was smoother and more elastic, leading to a big industry. However, growing sapodilla trees for chicle has not worked well, so synthetic alternatives are now used.
Today, a few people called chicleros still collect chicle, but it is hard and dangerous work. They walk long distances in hot, humid forests with poisonous snakes and insects. They climb trees to collect the sap, which they carry to a camp to boil and make into bricks. Life at the camp is tough, with simple food and local alcohol.
The chicleros worry about their jobs because the U.S. used to buy a lot of chicle, but now it buys much less. As gum sales have increased, companies use synthetic materials to save money and meet demand.
Gum is marketed in many ways. It is said to help you relax, give you energy, and reduce stress. During both world wars, soldiers were given gum. Gum is also claimed to reduce tooth decay by increasing saliva, which helps protect teeth. New textures and flavors are being developed, with most flavors being artificial. However, some natural flavors are still used. In America, a large area is used to grow mint for the two most popular chewing gums."

The receptionist is talking on the phone and does not notice Sue. Sue says, 'Very poor.' This is a common mistake she sees in hotels. The Globe Hotel has three red stars, which means it is one of the best hotels. But Sue is not happy. The entrance from the car park is not nice. There is a long, empty corridor. Sue says, 'Not what I expected.' Things get worse. The receptionist cannot find Sue's booking. Most rooms are empty, but the room Sue gets is not nice. It is stuffy, and there is a big hole in the wall. Sue is known for being tough. People called her 'The Woman in Black,' but she says she is not too tough. The next morning, Sue tells the hotel manager, Robin Greaves, who she is. He is surprised and sorry for the bad smell in the lounge. Sue suggests fixing the smell and not taking guests there. Greaves agrees and takes notes. He has been at the hotel for five months. Sue says her feedback will help the hotel. Not everything is bad. Emma, the assistant manager, and Trudy, the waitress, are doing a good job. Dinner is good, too. Greaves asks how to get a better food rating. Sue says, 'Don't serve a pudding that collapses.'

The hotel has the latest technology for both staff and guests. The General Manager, Peter MacCann, wants his staff to know guests by name. For other details, he uses a computer system. This system helps give special service to guests who come back. It cost a lot of money, but MacCann says it will save money in the long run. The system remembers what guests like. For example, if a guest asks for certain music CDs, they will have them ready next time. Guests often complain about room temperature. The hotel has a system to control this. Guests can change the temperature a little, or the front desk can change it more. Business guests will like the technology in the rooms. Each room has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine, and video-conferencing. The hotel is ready for future technology changes. They rent TVs so they can get new ones easily. DVD players can also be updated. Even with all this technology, the rooms are comfortable and welcoming.

Her garden has many flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some plants grow everywhere in the garden. The garden looks nice because of the colors and shapes of the flowers. The people who lived there before Susan loved gardening and left many plants for her. Susan also got a gardener named Danny from them. She says, 'It was really his garden.' At first, Danny did not like some of Susan's ideas, but when she explained she wanted to paint them, he understood. Susan likes to paint one flower at a time. She sometimes paints a group of flowers, but usually, she picks one flower and takes it to her studio. She paints it for a few days, then adds another flower to the painting. Sometimes, it takes her a couple of years to finish a painting. Spring and early summer are her busiest times because the tulips and poppies bloom then. Susan finds it interesting how flowers change over time. For example, tulips change shape when you put them in water. Susan has always liked plants. She studied botany in school and collected wild flowers. She did not like garden flowers before because they looked fake to her. She liked wild flowers because they grew in difficult places. Now, her garden has plants from other countries, but they grow well in her garden. Susan is busy with two art shows, so she does not have much time for gardening. She has another gardener to help her, but she still likes to work in the garden to stay connected to her flowers.'"
FCE_13,B2,"Many trees in the Brackham area fell down during the big storms in March. The town lost two big lime trees from the old market square. This changed how the town looked, and some people were not happy about it. One of these people was Chief Inspector Douglas Pelham, the head of the local police. But during the storm, Pelham was very sick with bronchitis, so he did not notice the changes. 
Pelham was usually healthy, but he got very sick for the first time. He had a headache and chest pain. His wife, Molly, wanted him to see a doctor, but Pelham thought he was too important at work to take a break. He kept working, but this made him forgetful and angry. Finally, his colleague, Sergeant Lloyd, took him to the doctor. Pelham was too weak to argue. The doctor gave him medicine, and Molly took him home to rest.
On Thursday morning, Molly told Pelham that the walnut tree in their garden had fallen. Pelham was too sick to understand. By Saturday, after taking his medicine, he felt better and got out of bed. He was surprised to see that the living room looked different without the tree. 
The Pelhams' house was big and had a nice garden. Pelham liked the privacy the garden gave them. Before, the walnut tree made nice patterns of light and shade in the living room. It also hid the old furniture. Now, without the tree, the room was very bright, and the old furniture looked shabby. The view from the window was not nice anymore. The house next door, which was hidden by the tree, was now visible. It had ugly purple bricks and many windows that seemed to watch the Pelhams.
Pelham said to Molly, ""Doesn't it look terrible?"" But Molly was happy. She said, ""I've been telling you we need a new sofa, no matter the cost."""
FCE_16,B2,"Living in the Valley
We had been living in our valley for sixteen months when we first understood the dangers in the hills around us. It was the year when the storms came early, even before November ended. Before that, we felt safe in our valley below the hills. Soon, snow began to fall. In one day, it was about 15 centimeters deep. It almost blocked our road and made the path by the stream slippery and dangerous. But on the hills, the snow was much deeper and stayed longer. Up there, the wind was very strong. In our valley, we only felt sudden strong winds; trees moved, but the branches stayed strong. Still, we knew we had a reason to worry. The snow and wind were a problem, but they did not worry us too much. It was the river, the Ryburn, which was usually calm, that worried us the most. It reminded us of what could happen if the water from the hills was not controlled by dams built many years ago.
Soon, the snow started to melt. Every day, we saw dark clouds over the hills to the west. They moved and changed, warning us of what was coming. We watched the river, which was getting fuller and wilder every day. The snow was washed away as more rain came from the clouds, but high in the hills, the reservoir was filling up and getting dangerous. Then it happened - for the first time in years, the reservoir overflowed. It was like a big waterfall as the water went over the dam and into the stream below. The river was wild as the water rushed down. Near our cottage, the stream was deeper than we had ever seen it, hitting its banks hard. For three days, we hoped it would stay below its wall. Luckily, our hopes came true as the dam held and the water started to go down.
In the past, before the dam was built, the river often flooded the nearby villages. Now, the dam controls the river, and usually, everything is fine. The water from the hills, from snow and heavy rain, stays behind the dam with only a little overflow sometimes. Because of this protection, we can enjoy the big clouds over the valley and feel excited by the river's power. Thanks to this, we feel our home in the valley is safe."
FCE_21,B2,"'Film Critic Mark Adams talks about his last ten years working as a film critic for a newspaper called The Front Page. Writing about films for The Front Page was my first real job. Before that, I wrote reviews for novels, films, and radio. That's how I met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page. He hired me. Tom wanted a team of critics to write about books, TV, theatre, film, and radio. We would have a weekly lunch to choose what to cover, and there would be guests to make it fun. It felt like a dream: a new newspaper, and I was part of it. I couldn't believe a new paper could start in a busy market. I even thought a millionaire was pretending to hire me. I had little confidence. The first time I saw someone reading my review on the London Underground, I felt shy. Tom's idea for a team of critics didn't work out. We didn't meet as planned, so we talked by phone. People liked reviewers to focus on one subject, so I chose film. Thanks to Tom, I now write a long piece each week, usually about one film. This way of working is perfect for me. I wouldn't like the usual film critic's job, which means reviewing every film. That would make me bored quickly. I would soon be thinking, 'What boring film must I watch now?' But what is my job for the public? I think people choose films because of the stars, the ads, or the director. People are loyal to certain types of films. It's rare for someone who hates westerns to watch one after reading a review. So, if a film review isn't a guide, what is it? I don't feel I have to be 'right' about a movie. I just need to share my opinion. I'm not a judge, and I don't want to be one.'"

She is looking for a training partner who loves sports too, preferably a girl. This person should like running long distances (15km), swimming in cold rivers, and cycling long distances (100km). They must be able to do all three without stopping. 
The triathlon is becoming a popular Olympic sport. Many people watch athletes swim 1500m, cycle 40km, and run 10km without stopping. It is exciting to watch, but why do athletes do it? Melanie, a 17-year-old with good school grades, loves the challenge. She says, ""You swim 1500m, then get on your bike while still wet. You feel cold. After cycling 40km, you run 10km, which is hard when you are tired. But it's fun and worth it.""
Melanie did her first triathlon at 14 and won the junior section because she was the only junior. She felt confident and entered the National Championships. She was fast in swimming and running but got lost while cycling and went 20km too far. She cried during the run but did not give up. She is determined to keep going. 
Steve Trew, the sport's coaching director, admires her determination. He says she worked so hard on a running machine that it threw her off. Melanie was the top junior in this year's European Triathlon Championships, finishing 13th. She is working hard to improve her cycling. Her parents are paying for her trip to New Zealand for the World Championships, and she wants a new bike to help her compete in more races.
Melanie's training is tough, and she doesn't have much of a social life. She says, ""I'm not a party person. After swimming on Friday nights, I just want to sleep. But I talk to other girls in the team about their race times."" Melanie has tried other events, like the triathlon ""sprint,"" which is shorter. She wants to try even harder events. She wishes she had someone her age to train with."
FCE_70,B2,"'The Collectors Amanda Roy talks about the things she collects and why many people like this hobby. I have always loved collecting, and one in three adults enjoys this hobby. It is a world of passion and happiness. But remember, if you do not love an object, do not collect it. Since ancient times, people have wanted to collect things. Early humans collected pebbles and wore them as necklaces. They liked the shapes and colors. Today, children still collect stones and seashells for their beauty. I have been collecting all my life. I collect many things, like flowers, pottery, and paintings. My first collection was stones from my parents' garden. When I was six, I went to a school in a remote part of England. It was cold and windy, with many hills. My parents took me to a local museum full of old objects. I loved these objects. Many adults also love collecting. People collect for different reasons. Some like to have control over something. For me, it's just fun. A famous collector was the Duc de Berry in France. He had a 'room of wonders' with many interesting things. Catherine the Great of Russia collected over 4,000 paintings. You do not need to be rich to start a collection. I have collected tulip bulbs and china cups. I remember getting a special tulip from another collector. I planted it, but one day it was stolen. I also collected 350 American rag dolls. I searched all over the USA for them. But my collection was destroyed in a house fire. The next day, I saw the remains of my furniture and collection. I was very sad. I am interested in how collections change hands. A silver spoon that belonged to a king or poet is valuable. As small objects become popular, their price goes up. Toys from the 1950s are now an investment if you kept the original boxes.

My job is varied. I make sure our publishing matches what people want and keep stocks of about 300 books. We have high standards for information. We get letters from readers about things like international boundaries, and I answer them carefully. I talk about future projects and sales with co-publishers.

It's a big house by the sea, near the village of Ardbeag. An English couple, the Malseeds, bought the house and made it bigger, but they did it very nicely. Strafe found Glencorn for us. He saw an advertisement when the Malseeds still needed to advertise. 'How about this?' he said one evening and read the details. The summer before, we went to a hotel our friends recommended, but it wasn't good because the food was terrible. The four of us, Dekko, Strafe, Cynthia, and I, have played cards together for a long time. They call me Milly, but my real name is Dorothy Milson. Dekko got his nickname at school. He and Strafe went to school together, so we call Strafe by his last name, like the teachers did. We are all about the same age and live near the town where the Malseeds lived before moving from England to Ireland. We think it's a funny coincidence. 'How very nice,' Mrs. Malseed said, smiling when we arrived this year. She always seems to know when guests are coming because she's usually waiting in the big hall that smells like flowers. 'Arthur, take the luggage up,' she told the old porter. 'Rose, Tulip, Lily, and Geranium.' These are the names of the rooms for us. Mrs. Malseed painted flowers on the doors instead of using numbers. In winter, when not many people come to Glencorn Lodge, she does things like that; her husband does repairs. 'Well, well, well,' Mr. Malseed said, coming in from the kitchen. 'A hundred thousand welcomes,' he greeted us in the Irish way. He smiled with his dark brown eyes twinkling, making us feel special. Everyone smiled, and I felt like our holiday had really started. Nothing changed at Glencorn, everything was good. Kitty from the dining room came to greet us. 'You look younger every year, all four of you,' she said, making everyone laugh. Arthur took our luggage to the rooms, carrying as much as he could and coming back for the rest. After dinner, we played cards for a while but not too long because we were tired from the trip. In the lounge, there was a man alone and a French couple. There were other people at dinner because in June Glencorn Lodge is always full. From where we sat by the window, we could see some people walking on the lawns, others going down the cliff path to the seashore. In the morning, we would do the same: walk along the sands to Ardbeag and have coffee at the hotel there, back in time for lunch. In the afternoon, we would drive somewhere. I knew this because we always did the same things. Since we first came here, we all loved the beautiful landscape.'"

She says being a chalet girl is not a career, but it's fun for a year or two before starting a serious job. She meets many successful people every week.
Sarah does not live at the chalet. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks to the chalet, which can have up to 18 guests each week. She eats her breakfast first, then makes breakfast for the guests. They have porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants. After breakfast, Sarah cleans up and either makes afternoon tea or cleans the rooms. She says cleaning the rooms is the hardest part of her job. By 11 a.m., she is ready to go skiing. She skis as much as she can until about 4.30 p.m.
Sarah goes back to the chalet to prepare dinner. She takes a shower but does not sleep because it makes her too tired. Dinner is served at 8 p.m., and coffee is ready by 10 p.m. After dinner, she cleans up and fills the dishwasher. Sometimes she talks with the guests, and other times they want to be alone. Good guests make the week fun, but some weeks are not as good.
Sarah meets her friends at the chalet where she lives and they go out around 11 p.m. They visit places like Bananas, G Jay's, and Dick's T-Bar. But she does not stay out late on Saturday because Sunday is her busiest day. She starts work early on Sunday because breakfast for leaving guests must be ready by 7 a.m. After the guests leave, she cleans everything quickly. If she did not shop on Saturday, she does it now. At 3 p.m., she prepares tea for new guests who arrive around 4.30 p.m. She helps them with questions and takes them to get ski equipment if needed. Then she prepares dinner again. Sometimes she has a drink after dinner, but if she is too tired, she goes to bed early."
FCE_27,B2,"Miss Rita Cohen was a small, pale girl who looked much younger than Seymour's daughter, Marie. But she said she was six years older. One day, she came to Seymour's factory. She wore overalls and big shoes, and her curly hair surrounded her pretty face. She was so small and young that Seymour found it hard to believe she was studying at the University of Pennsylvania. She was doing research on the leather industry in New Jersey for her Master's degree.
A few times a year, someone would call or write to Seymour to ask if they could see his factory. Sometimes, he would help a student by answering questions on the phone or giving a short tour if they seemed serious. Rita Cohen was almost as small as the children from Marie's third-year class. Years ago, these children came from their school 50 kilometers away to see how Marie's dad made gloves. They especially liked the laying-off table, where workers shaped and pressed each glove over hot brass hands. Marie called them 'pancake hands' because they looked flat.
Rita asked Seymour, 'How many pieces come in a shipment?' He replied, 'Between twenty and twenty-five thousand.' She took notes and asked more questions. Seymour liked that she was interested in every detail. He explained that the tannery, a place where leather is made, was a contractor. They bought the material and made it ready for work. Seymour's grandfather and father worked in the tannery, and so did he for six months. He asked Rita if she had ever been inside a tannery. She said, 'Not yet.' Seymour offered to arrange a visit for her, saying tanneries are old places with little change over the years.
Seymour told Rita that his father was the real leather expert and could talk about gloves for days. He asked if she had ever seen anything being made. Rita said she hadn't, except for watching her mother bake a cake as a child. Seymour laughed and found her eager to learn. Rita reminded him of his daughter Marie, who was always full of what she learned at school.
Seymour decided to show Rita the whole process of making gloves. He said, 'We're going to make you a pair of gloves, and you're going to watch them being made from start to finish. What size do you wear?'"
FCE_71,B2,"'Is it a dream job? Chris Arnot talks to four people with jobs that seem amazing. Are they really as great as they look? A. Raquel Graham Raquel Graham calls from a taxi on her way to the airport. She can't meet me tomorrow because her boss wants her in Los Angeles. As a personal assistant to a pop star, she travels a lot. Raquel loves her job and gets along well with her boss. But there's one small problem - she doesn't like flying. 'On a nine-hour flight to California, I usually take sleeping pills to calm down,' she says. Her worst flight was on Concorde. 'It felt so closed in with those tiny windows.' When she's not flying, she works in offices in Manchester and London. She does paperwork, organizes the diary, attends meetings, and makes travel plans. She didn't apply for the job. She met a pop group manager by chance, which led to a job offer. She also took secretarial classes at night. Five years later, she was in the right place when her boss needed a PA. B. David Brown David Brown has been an accountant and a golf caddy, which means he carries a golfer's bags. He liked being a caddy more because he loves golf. But there are downsides. He gets a small fee and a part of the winnings. He earns between £25,000 and £35,000, but spends a lot on travel and hotels. He was 31 when he first worked for golfer Greg Norman. 'You're not just carrying bags. You give advice and try to understand the golf course.' His accountancy skills were noticed by European Tour Productions, and now he works as a statistical data administrator. He collects and analyzes golf statistics, which are used by TV commentators, magazines, and golfers. C. Martin Fern Martin Fern is the editor of the 'Food and Drink' pages of a newspaper. One of his easier tasks is to try food at top restaurants. What does he think about expensive restaurants? 'If people can afford it, it's their choice,' he says. 'I'd rather spend £120 on a memorable meal than buy a microwave.' His cooking talent led to a food column offer from a friend who edited a Saturday Review. At the time, Martin was a creative director at an advertising agency, and the column was extra income. He was 42 when another newspaper offered him a full-time job. 'It meant earning 50% less,' he says. 'But it was a chance to turn my passion into a job.' He still cooks at home and tries to stay fit by cycling to the nearest tube station. D. Dick Prince 'I started writing children's stories about 20 years ago,' says Dick Prince, a popular children's writer in Britain. 'Before that, I loved words and wrote poems. Then I had an idea for a story. I was a farmer and knew about chickens being killed by a fox. So I wrote a story called The Fox Busters, which was my first published children's story.' Where do his ideas come from? 'It's not easy, I have to work on them,' he says. 'I usually do this in the mornings. I'm not an early riser. After lunch, I spend a couple of hours typing my morning notes with one finger on an old typewriter, not a laptop. I get 50 to 100 letters a week, and I enjoy this part of being a writer. I try to answer them all, but now I have some help.'"
FCE_66,B2,"In the lumberyard by the lake, workers cut trees into boards for building. There was an old two-story brick building there, and around it were big piles of soft sawdust. These piles looked like golden mountains and went all the way to the blue lake. One afternoon, Michael and his friends were bored, so they climbed a ladder to the roof of the old building. They sat with their legs hanging over the edge, looking at the lake. Suddenly, Michael said, ""I dare you to jump down,"" and he jumped off the roof onto the sawdust, laughing. ""I dare you all!"" he shouted. ""You're all scared,"" he said, trying to get them to jump too. They looked down, scared, but then one by one, they jumped and felt happy. In the hot sun, they lay on the sawdust, telling jokes. Then one friend said, ""Let's go up and jump again."" They weren't very excited, but they went up and jumped again until only Michael was left on the roof. The others were below, calling, ""Come on, Mike. What's wrong?"" Michael wanted to jump but stayed on the roof, nervous and smiling awkwardly. He tried to count to ten and jump, but he couldn't. The others started laughing and got tired of waiting. They shouted, ""Come on, you're scared. Are we going to wait all night?"" When he didn't move, they walked away, still shouting. Michael stayed on the roof, looking sadly at the ground. He was alone for almost an hour as the sun set. His clothes were wet from sweat. Finally, he closed his eyes, slipped off the roof, and fell onto the sawdust. He lay there for a long time. The yard was quiet because the workers had gone home. As he lay there, he wondered why he couldn't jump before. Then he got up slowly and walked home, feeling ashamed and wanting to avoid everyone. He was late for dinner, and his stepmother said, ""You're old enough to come home on time. If you can't, you should stay in tonight."" She was a strong woman with fair skin, a little grey in her hair, and a patient smile. She spoke seriously, but Michael, feeling sad, didn't really hear her. He was still thinking about his friends laughing at him."
FCE_44,B2,"Title: Careers Advice
Are you unhappy with your job and don't know how to change it? Kitty Doherty has some advice. Many people who want to change jobs go to a careers adviser. You will write a short history about yourself and take some tests called 'psychometrics'. After the tests, you get a report with career suggestions and possible retraining options.
I tried Career Analysts, a big company that gives career advice. The test felt like a science exam. I was with about ten people, answering questions quickly. The tests included finding mistakes in lists and matching shapes. After the test, I talked with an adviser who gave me a report with his thoughts and suggestions. I agreed with most of it, but I was surprised to learn I did poorly in scientific and technical tests. I was happy to hear I made the right choice with journalism.
Changing your career doesn't always mean a big change. Last March, Donna Laney, 25, lost her job as a marketing manager. Her friends told her to try Career Analysts. She wanted to look at her skills and interests again. She found out she was good at design but had to think about the cost of retraining. Other ideas included working in the Far East for a year. She decided to use her skills in a new job as a Public Relations officer. She is happy with the help she got and recommended it to friends.
Some people feel they couldn't have changed without help. Juliet Greene, 26, worked at a bank for six years and wanted a new challenge. She went to Career Counselling Services and took tests that showed she liked sciences. After four meetings with an adviser, she decided to study geology. She thinks the advice was worth the cost and feels happier now.
However, careers advice doesn't work for everyone. Amanda Margetts, 24, a sales representative, didn't find it helpful. She wanted new ideas but didn't like the options because they meant less money or more training. She felt a friend could have given similar advice."
FCE_22,B2,"'Fun at the Dentist's? If you visit W. Lloyd Jerome's dental office in Glasgow, you will see bright paintings on the wall and a nice blue couch for patients. Jerome says, 'Half of the people only go to the dentist when they have pain. They are scared.' To help with this, he tries to make a place where people are not afraid. He does not wear a white coat because it makes people think of pain. He believes dental visits should be relaxing and even fun. This is surprising because many people think of dental visits as painful or very serious. Jerome says, 'If people are relaxed and happy, they will forget bad experiences.' He uses virtual-reality headsets to help people relax. 'We were the first in Britain to use them, and people like them. During the first check-up, patients sit on the blue couch and watch a film about sea animals while I check their teeth. Then, they see a video tour of their mouth.' Many patients enjoy this. The office smells nice, like oranges, not like a dentist's. Jerome says, 'I want people to know it's different from a regular dentist's. Smell is important. The usual dentist smell can make people scared.' I liked the nice smell. Jerome is known as a fashionable dentist, but he is serious about his work. Relaxation is important, but good treatment is most important. He uses a tool that sprays warm water to clean teeth, not scraping them. It feels strange at first, but it is not painful if you are relaxed. Five years ago, Jerome went to the USA to learn about dental techniques. 'I learned that if you make it easy for the patient, it is easy for you too,' he says. He thinks this is the start of a change in British dentistry. A patient arrives, and Jerome offers him tea and asks what video he wants to watch. The patient seems to enjoy this special treatment. The office feels more like a beauty salon than a regular dentist's office.'"
FCE_39,B2,"Title: Chocolate's Journey from South America to the World
Chocolate comes from South America and is now a big business around the world. In the UK, people spend over £230 million on chocolate at Easter. This is when 8% of all chocolate is bought. Only at Christmas do people eat more chocolate.
The cacao plant, which gives us chocolate, was first grown by the Aztec, Toltec, and Mayan people in Central America over 3,000 years ago. The cacao tree is a tropical plant found in Africa, South and Central America, the West Indies, and South-East Asia. Its fruit is the size of a melon and has 20-40 seeds. When dried, these seeds become cacao beans, which are used to make chocolate. In English, they are often called cocoa beans because of a spelling mistake from the 17th century.
The Aztecs used cocoa beans as money and to make a drink called xocoatl, meaning 'bitter water' in their language. They added spices to the drink for special events. The Spanish liked it better with cinnamon and sugar, but it took another 100 years to become popular in Europe. In the late 1600s, chocolate houses opened in Europe's big cities where people drank chocolate.
In 1826, CJ van Houten from the Netherlands made chocolate powder by taking out most of the cocoa butter from the beans. In 1847, Fry and Sons in Bristol made the first chocolate bar by mixing cocoa butter, chocolate liquor, and sugar. Later, a Swiss company added milk to make milk chocolate.
At the start of the 1900s, French companies led the British chocolate market. In 1879, Cadbury named their factory Bournville, hoping to add some French style. But in 1905, Cadbury's Dairy Milk bar became popular because it was linked to healthy English milk.
Today, people in Britain eat about four chocolate bars each week. To keep customers interested, companies now make chocolate bars into ice creams, drinks, and desserts. Meanwhile, cacao farmers are still affected by low cocoa bean prices from the 1980s. Many small farmers had to stop their work. So, next time you eat a chocolate bar, think about the farmers who grow the cacao."
FCE_18,B2,"**THE SHELL ARTIST**
Peter Cooke is 83 years old and very good at making art with shells. He wants to try other things like making paper and working with feathers, but for now, he is happy making beautiful things with shells. He has been doing this for ten years.
Peter shows me his work in his apartment. He is very excited about his art, and it is easy to see why. His work is charming and beautiful. He points to some shell ornaments above his fireplace and says he likes them so much that he doesn't mind if they don't sell. He never planned to sell his work, but friends encouraged him to have an exhibition. Five years ago, he had his first exhibition in London, and 70% of his pieces sold. His second exhibition just opened.
The pieces are expensive, with some costing around £2,000. There are 86 pieces in the exhibition, with prices starting at £225 for a shell-flower in a crystal vase. Peter says he doesn't set the prices, but he is happy people like his work. He believes no one else makes art like his, and the gallery owner told him that one day everyone will want his pieces because he will stop making them.
Peter wishes he started this art earlier in life because he feels he could have made even more wonderful things. He still has many ideas, but he finds it harder to work now than when he was younger. His work is very different from the shell crafts you find in seaside shops. He makes boxes with tiny shells, pictures from shells, and baskets of flowers that look real.
Peter has his own way of working. He uses cardboard from laundered shirts for his flower bases, a special glue from a sail-maker, and washing-up liquid to clean the shells. He says he has an idea of what he wants to do, and it just happens, but his work shows a lot of care and detail.
Peter looks for beautiful and tiny shells not just in Norfolk, but also in places like France, Thailand, Mexico, South Africa, and the Philippines. He only collects dead shells and does not harm living creatures. He says that people walking on the beach break more shells than he collects, and the sea also breaks them. He believes it is okay to collect shells once the creatures have left them. His work is often more beautiful than the shells alone, making his argument convincing."
FCE_62,B2,"'The Schoolgirl Model When 15-year-old Kira Langer is not traveling to exciting places and appearing on magazine covers, she is probably studying for her school exams. Jane Laidlaw finds out more. 'I'm afraid Kira will be a little late,' the receptionist at the agency told me. 'Oh, fine,' I said, 'no problem.' I was trying to forget all the bad things I had read about models, like being difficult, vain, and unintelligent. And now she was going to be late. How late? An hour? Three hours? Maybe she wouldn't come at all. What if she decided to go to the hairdresser instead of talking to me? If she was late, she might be in a bad mood and not want to answer my questions. But when Kira, the winner of the Looks magazine supermodel competition, walked in, she was smiling, relaxed, and said sorry for being late. She was with her mother. Kira was not wearing expensive designer clothes but a simple black dress and trainers. She was very friendly, very tall, and very pretty. All models under 16 must have an adult with them when they work, she explained. Her mother looked like a normal mum, very proud of her successful daughter. Kira seems a bit surprised by her new fame, which makes sense because it was not planned. Her older sister decided she should enter the model competition. 'She saw the competition and said I should try it,' Kira remembers. 'I said no, but she sent some photos anyway.' When they called to say she was a finalist, she was at school. Being chosen for the final made Kira confident, and she did very well. She won easily, and the Select model agency in London offered her work right away. Kira now finds it hard to manage her two lives. But her friends and teachers are used to having a star among them. 'They're really proud of me,' she says. However, some unkind people at her school are rude about her success. 'They say I think too much of myself.' This must be hard for Kira because she is not self-important. But she says, 'They think that because I'm a model now, I can't stay the same. But the only thing that's changed is I'm more confident - not in a bad way, but I can stand up for myself more.' As a busy model, her social life is affected. The Select agency can call anytime and tell her she has a job the next day. 'If my friends are going out, I can't say I'll come because I don't know what I'm doing the next day. I can't really make plans, and if I do, they sometimes get canceled, but my friends are good about it. They don't say, ""Oh, you're always going off modeling now, you never have time for us"".' Kira has the looks, ability, and support to have a great career ahead of her. Not many people can say that before they finish school. I am about to finish the interview with the girl who has it all, and I ask what she would like to do if she wasn't a model. She pauses and replies: 'I'd like to do what you're doing.'"
FCE_49,B2,"Title: Father and Son Search for Gold
Terence and Chris Madden are a father and son team. They have traveled from cold Canada to hot Africa to find gold. Terence is an explorer, and Chris is a mineral expert. They think their mine on a Welsh mountain has a lot of gold, maybe 10,000 ounces. After ten years of digging, they believe they are close to finding gold worth five million dollars. Terence, who is 68 and from Liverpool, says they are finding more gold as they dig. They just need to dig a little more to find where the gold is concentrated.
Their search for gold started when Terence read about gold in the 'Dolgellau gold belt' in Wales. They read old mining journals and newspapers at the Welsh National Library. They picked the best area to look for gold. They cleared the land, found some gold in rocks, and spent ten years getting permission to dig. They also took earth samples and removed old cars and rubbish. They dug out 150 tonnes of rock to make a tunnel and a 10-meter shaft. Now, they are running out of money. They need someone to give them PS50,000 to dig a little more to find the gold. Chris says it is hard to find someone to help, but they have some people they can ask.
People in the area are talking about the dig. Dolgellau is a town that needs tourists, and people hope the gold will bring more visitors. Peter Woolven, who manages the Royal Ship Hotel, says it would be good if more people come, but he hopes not too many people will dig up the hillside.
The Welsh gold industry was big in the late 1880s, with many mines and workers. But now, it is not as big. One of the last mines, Clogau-St David's, closed a month ago. But some people are still looking for gold. George Hall, another gold seeker, wants to dig a tunnel on the other side of the hill from the Maddens. Hall, who is 70, says searching for gold is exciting and like finding hidden treasure. He hopes to be lucky this time."
FCE_31,B2,"'IN HOT WATER Rachel Mills is a scientist who studies the sea. She works at Southampton University and teaches about the ocean. Rachel also goes on special trips to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She uses a small underwater vehicle, like a tiny car, to go down three kilometers to study underwater volcanoes. Inside the vehicle, there is not much space. Rachel can touch the two pilots sitting next to her. They cannot stand up or move much, and they must stay inside until someone opens the door from outside. A dive can last 16 hours - three hours to go down, ten hours to collect rock and water samples, and three hours to come back up. If there is a problem, they can press a panic button. This makes a small escape vessel go up quickly to the surface, like a ping-pong ball in water. No one has used it yet, but it might not be a fun ride. Rachel was nervous the first time she went in the vehicle. She was on a ship and got in with a teacher who showed her what to do in an emergency. Now, Rachel has done six dives. Last year, she went with a Russian team to a place near the Canary Islands. There are many underwater volcanoes there. The Russian team was putting equipment there to study the volcanoes. When Rachel is not at sea, she is in her office at the university. She spends most of her time teaching, but she loves researching the ""black smokers."" These are underwater volcanoes that release hot water that looks like black smoke. The water comes out very fast and is very hot. Rachel was scared once when she was with an American team. They heard a loud bang and thought something bad happened. But they were okay. Rachel loves the adventure of diving deep into the ocean. She feels amazed every time she sees the underwater volcanoes. She studied them for three years, and seeing them in real life was incredible for her.'"
FCE_58,B2,"I was dirty, smelly, hungry, and a bit suntanned. It was the end of my Inter-Rail holiday. My body was tired, and my mind was tired of foreign timetables, money, and languages. ""Never again,"" I said when I got home. But I said the same thing the next year. And the year after that. I just needed to buy one train ticket, and because I was under twenty-five, I could travel anywhere in Europe for a whole month. Sleeping in a train corridor is different from sleeping in a bed. The train's movement helps you sleep deeply. Carrying everything in a backpack makes you travel simply. Sometimes, I even burned socks that smelled bad and threw away books after reading them. This is the Inter-Rail spirit, where you can forget about common sense. All you need is a ticket. This train ticket lets young people travel to many countries quickly. On my first trip, my friends and I thought it was just a cheap way to get to our camp-site in southern France. But we wanted to travel more because there was always another country nearby. And it didn't cost us extra. We were not very interested in culture. This was our first holiday without parents, like many other Inter-Railers. We only saw the most obvious sights. We wanted to escape guided tours and do something different. I was proud that sometimes I only saw the view from the train station. We were there to have fun. We shared train floors, food, water, money, and music with other Inter-Railers. The excitement of travel comes from seeing a place that was just a name before. A city feels real when the train arrives, and you see it with your own eyes. You can only understand Europe by seeing it yourself. Everyone knows what is there, but it means nothing until you see it. This is why other people's holiday photos are boring. The train trip won't show you new things in the world, but it is a valuable personal experience. Europe is big, and Inter-Rail helps you see this, even if it takes time."
FCE_37,B2,"'It is very disappointing to arrive at an airport in another country and find out that your bags are not there. You might have to wear the same clothes for hours or days until the airline finds your bags. Sometimes, you might be in a place with a different climate and have to wear clothes that are not right for the weather. Airlines do not often say how many bags they lose, but it happens to people who travel a lot. Even the best airlines make mistakes, and they cannot promise that your bags will be on the same flight as you, especially if you have to change planes. 
Airlines ask you to check in early so there is enough time for your bags to go through the airport and onto the plane. The shortest time to change between flights is called Minimum Connecting Time (MCT), and it is also longer to help with bag transfers. Usually, this system works well. But extra security checks and air traffic problems can delay flights and cause the baggage system to fail. Sometimes, human mistakes or accidents, like a torn label, can also cause problems. These issues are worse at big airports, called 'hubs', because they handle many bags. For example, last year, London's Heathrow airport had over 41 million passengers, and nine million of them changed planes. British Airways had two million transfer passengers at Heathrow, with many moving between Terminal 1 and Terminal 4. Even good airports like Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Singapore, and Zurich have bad days. 
The chance of losing bags is higher at some airports. In the United States, Miami airport is known for losing bags when passengers connect to flights to Latin America. To avoid losing your bags, choose direct flights if you can and check in early. If you must change planes, try to fly with the same airline and allow more time between flights. Label your bags inside and out with your home and holiday addresses, and include flight numbers. If your bags still go missing, talk to the airline staff in the baggage area and fill out a property irregularity report (PIR) before leaving the airport.'"
FCE_2,B2,"'The Kingfisher Wildlife photographer Charlie James knows a lot about the kingfisher. This bird is blue-green and lives near streams and rivers. It eats fish. Old trees hang over the stream, making some parts of the water dark. The main colors are soft greens, browns, and yellows from the sunlight. The kingfisher flies very fast and straight, like a flash of light. It is small, but very powerful. Charlie James loved kingfishers from a young age. He cannot say exactly why he likes them so much. There are many stories about kingfishers. One Greek story says a moon goddess became a kingfisher. Another story says the kingfisher flew so high that its top became blue like the sky, and its bottom was burned by the sun. This story has some truth. Kingfishers do not have blue color in their feathers. The feathers reflect light, which makes them look blue. Sometimes they look green when the light changes. Many photographers love kingfishers because of their colors. Kingfishers are shy, but you can watch them from a hidden place. Charlie James first hid under an old blanket to watch them. The bird came very close to him. It took him four years to take a good picture. He spent a lot of time by streams with kingfishers. He missed school to watch them and did not do well in his studies. But people noticed his interest in kingfishers. At 16, he worked for a nature magazine. Later, he became a wildlife film cameraman. Now, he wants to make a film about kingfishers with no talking, just beautiful pictures. He loves the simple beauty of the kingfisher's wings. His photos show his feelings, but there is more to his love for kingfishers than his work can show.'"

Giving directions to an orchestra is not easy. Anne Inglis talks to five new conductors about their work.
A. ANNE MANSON
Anne Manson, 30, got a chance to help famous conductor Claudio Abbado in Vienna. She was not nervous and enjoyed working with the orchestra. Anne is from America and works with a London opera company. She is becoming known in Europe with help from the British Arts Council. She has worked with Abbado on many projects.
B. ANDREW CONSTANTINE
Andrew Constantine, 31, says the hardest part of being a conductor is getting the right opportunities. He won a big competition in 1991 after trying twice before. The win gave him many chances to perform and work with a famous conductor. He hopes people will remember him for more than just the competition. The English Chamber Orchestra invites him back, which is a good sign for his career.
C. WASFI KANI
Wasfi Kani started Pimlico Opera and loves the long practice time for operas. She began conducting in her late twenties. After university, she worked in London until Pimlico Opera became professional. Learning from Sian Edwards was important for her. She likes the challenges of opera and working with singers.
D. ROGER VIGNOLES
Roger Vignoles, 48, is surprised by his new career in conducting. He started as a musician in an opera house and worked with good conductors. Last year, he directed Handel's Agrippina from the piano at a festival. He found it easier than expected because he knew the music well. He is learning from all his experiences and is open to new opportunities.
E. WAYNE MARSHALL
In 1986, conductor Simon Rattle noticed Wayne Marshall, now 32, and helped him get a job conducting a musical in London. It was a tough start, but Wayne was firm with the musicians. He has not formally studied conducting but is confident and knows what he likes. People have been supportive of him."
FCE_23,B2,"**Theme Park Visits**
If you want to take children to a theme park in Britain, there are many to choose from. We asked five families to try the best ones.
**Fun Island - The Burns Family**
Last year, we visited a big theme park in the US, so we thought Fun Island might be boring. But we were surprised! The park is good for young children, so our three-year-old had fun too. The kids loved the Crocodile Ride and the Giant Wheel. There is a special dodgems ride for very young kids, which was a big hit. For older kids, there are scarier rides like Splash Out, where you jump into a pool! After five hours, Steve and I were tired, but the kids wanted to stay longer because they were having so much fun. The park could look nicer, but the staff are very helpful, and it is clean and safe.
**Wonderland - The McMillan Family**
We had never been to a theme park before, so we didn't know what to expect. We thought Oscar might be too young, but he loved it. He enjoyed the Mountain Train and Little Land, with small models of famous buildings. The older kids liked the ferris wheel and driving toy cars on a road. We stayed for six hours and liked that there were places to rest. The park looks beautiful, and the staff are friendly. There is something for everyone, even adults.
**Adventure World - The Jeffree Family**
After seven hours, we still had more to see. The kids loved the Big Top Circus with a great trapeze act. We went on the Terror Line, and even though the girls were scared, they liked it. Their favorite ride was Running River, where you think you'll get wet, but you don't. Toy Land is fun for younger kids. The kids wanted to try the new ride, Fear Factor, but they were too small. The park is well designed, so waiting in line isn't too boring. It's very clean, and the staff are nice. On one ride, a staff member helped by sitting with one of my girls.
**The Great Park - The Langridge Family**
We arrived at 1 p.m. and were sad that the park closed at 5 p.m. This park is great for younger kids because the rides aren't too scary. I am usually scared, but I had fun. We all loved Exotic Travels, a boat ride that starts slow and then gets exciting. We waited 30 minutes for Lightning River, and it was over quickly! I didn't try the Big Leap, but it looked fun. If the kids were older, they might find it a bit boring, but they loved it.
**Fantasy World - The Break-all Family**
The park says there is 'No Limit to the Fun,' and we agree. Europe's tallest roller-coaster, the Rocket, is very scary, but Ben loved it. Jennie thought the Hanger, where you hang upside-down 30 meters above the ground, was scarier! There are many rides, and the older kids went on them many times. Sarah was too small for some rides but liked the Long Slide. The staff were sometimes nice, but not always. You need a full day to enjoy Fantasy World. We couldn't tell the kids we were leaving early!"
FCE_60,B2,"**Running a Business in the Countryside: Five Women's Stories**
A. Christine Hogan runs a computer-aided design business. She makes over £200,000 a year and has four full-time workers. Christine and her husband moved from London to the countryside when their children were young. She wanted a job she could do from home. Christine had worked with computers before, so her husband suggested starting a computer-aided design business. It was hard at first and needed a lot of money. Christine was careful with money and talked to the bank manager if she spent too much. Working from home saves money, and she can work in the evenings. Her business is small, and local people usually come to pick up their work.
B. Maggy Sasanow is a designer of greeting cards and works from home. She studied art at university and wanted to work in a museum, but there were no such jobs in the countryside. So, she started her own business and makes 50 different greeting cards, which she sells to museums. Maggy works in a big room at home. The downside of working from home is that there are always chores to do, like mowing the lawn. She gets business through word of mouth and doesn't advertise. People send her work from London because she is cheaper. Maggy misses sharing ideas with others but finds more good things than bad in her work.
C. Delia Turner has a curtain-making business. She started it eight years ago. At first, her business grew quickly, and she managed six full-time workers. But when the economy got worse, she had to let them go, which was hard because jobs are scarce in her area. Now, Delia makes curtains at home with her husband's help and other women who work from their homes. She has to lower her prices sometimes and look for new opportunities.
D. Tessa Strickland runs a children's book publishing business from her farmhouse. She moved to the countryside three years ago because London was too expensive and she loves the country. Tessa likes working when she wants. Most of her money comes from deals with Australia, the Far East, and North America, so she takes calls at odd hours. The hard part is closing the office door and stopping work. Tessa publishes children's books from different cultures and works with authors and artists. She felt lonely at first because all her work experience was in London.
E. Meg Rivers runs a cakes-by-post business and a shop. She makes £250,000 a year and employs six people, some part-time. Meg started ten years ago at home. She is interested in health, so she began making fruit cakes with good flour and eggs. Friends and family liked them, and soon she was sending cakes all over the country. Seven years ago, she rented a small building where everything is made. She has a baker, an assistant, and a professional cake decorator. Meg doesn't bake now; she manages the business side. Her biggest problem has been money because she didn't have much to start with."
FCE_1,B2,"**Meet the Amazing Watkins Family**
The Watkins family is special because they all love music. The sons, Paul and Huw, are musicians and composers. Their dad, John, makes musical instruments. 
When Paul was ten years old, he needed a cello. But cellos were very expensive. So, John decided to make one himself. He went to the Welsh School of Instrument Making for evening classes for three years. After making some violins and violas, he made his first cello for Paul. It was very good, and Paul used it for many years.
John stopped teaching to make instruments full-time. He makes about twelve violins a year. He even sold one to a famous American musician, Jaime Laredo.
Paul and Huw started playing music when they were young. Paul first played the piano, then he wanted to play the cello. He liked the person who played the cello in his dad's music group. So, he started learning the cello and became very good at it. Huw also plays music but chose the piano and became a composer.
Paul won a big music competition with the cello his dad made. He became the main cellist for the BBC Symphony Orchestra when he was only 20 years old. Now, he plays a very old and special cello from the Royal Academy of Music.
Paul will play on TV soon, but he can't watch it because he has a concert the same night. Huw also has a big event that night. Their parents, John and Hetty, will be busy trying to see both of their sons' performances."

THE NATIONAL TRUST
The National Trust is a group that helps protect the British countryside. Gill Page visits the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales and talks to Gareth Roberts, a warden who works for the Trust. 
Gareth says a warden needs common sense and must be good with people. He talks to farmers, visitors, and builders. Gareth grew up on the Lleyn Peninsula and worked on his family's farm. Many people wanted the warden job, but Gareth got it because he knows the area well and has farming experience, even though he didn't have special training.
Gareth still helps on his parents' farm, which helps him understand farmers' problems. He is also strong enough for the job, which includes building fences, planting trees, and making walls. Working with the Trust, Gareth learned more about nature conservation. He remembers collecting flowers and bird nests as a child and now sees how farming has changed the countryside. He says it's not the farmers' fault; they were following government advice.
At first, farmers and conservationists did not agree, but now they talk and understand each other better. Gareth's job includes conservation, letting people visit Trust land, planting trees, and meeting farmers. He makes sure work is done well and cheaply. He likes finishing projects, but he also spends time on paperwork.
Gareth loves his job, even though he is always working. He enjoys talking to people, but some visitors can be rude. They act like they own the place, which annoys him. But, as Gareth says, it's all about common sense. If you have common sense and like working outside, you might want to be a warden like Gareth. But don't expect a job on the Lleyn Peninsula soon!"

When I met her, she had a busy day. She taught at a local school and then trained in a supermarket car park. 'Don't people look at you strangely?' I asked her. 'I'm too focused on my movements and my feet to notice,' she said. 'I might see cars slow down, but that's all.' 'My whole life is about being my best for the Championships,' says Kendra. 'I have a strict plan to be very fit.' These are her fourth World Championships, and they will be the biggest ever, with 27 countries. 'We will have support from people here, which is special,' she says. 'It's important to make netball more popular in this country. There will be more pressure because people expect us to play well.' Their first game is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. 'We have always beaten them, but they are good players,' she says. The England team is ranked fourth in the world. But the World Championships will be hard. 'You have to play every day, with no rest. You only have one chance to win,' says Kendra. In the fifteen years she has played at the top level, the sport has become harder and faster. Players are more aggressive. 'You train to win,' says Kendra. 'But after the game, we are all friendly.' Netball now uses more science for fitness. 'We must think and train like world-class players,' says Kendra. 'As captain, I need a strong mind and must lead by example. I support and encourage my team.' 'From the start, my netball career was planned,' she says. 'I decided this competition would be my last as a player.' She might coach young players in the future, but now she is focused on her last big event. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she might have a tear in her eye.'"
FCE_50,B2,"**Specialist Music Schools**
What can you do if your child is very good at music? It can be hard to know how to help them. Some parents might not see their child's need until the child becomes upset or difficult. Most schools can help children who are good at subjects like math or English, but musically talented children need special help. Regular schools might not have this help, especially if music is not important there. 
Children who are very good at music might do well at a specialist music school. In Britain, there are five music schools for children aged seven to eighteen. These schools help children improve their music skills with the help of professional musicians. At these schools, children spend a lot of time on music activities like lessons, playing in groups, singing, and learning music theory. They also practice a lot in special rooms. The rest of their time is for important subjects like English, math, science, and languages. 
These music schools are private, and classes are small. Most children live at the school, which means they spend a lot of time with other children who love music. 
There are some problems with these schools. They are expensive, costing between £12,000 and £17,000 a year. But schools try to help with scholarships and financial aid. Also, not all parents want their young children to live away from home. Some school directors think it might not be good for very young children to be in such a strict environment. They want to make sure children grow up to be well-rounded people. 
Being in a music school can be stressful. Some children might lose interest in music as they grow older. The pressure to be the best can make them feel like they failed. But schools watch each child's progress and help if needed. 
Some students feel they learned a lot about music at these schools, but they worry about not learning enough in other subjects. Many musically talented children are also smart and want to learn more academically. 
For these reasons, it might be better to wait until the child is older and can decide for themselves about going to a music school. Children who are good at both music and academics might do well in a regular school with a good music program. They can also take music lessons on weekends at music colleges, but this is only possible for families near big cities like London."

Sarah Sutherland-Pilch is a 24-year-old from West Sussex. She works as a chalet girl in Val d'Isère, France. This is her second year doing this job. Sarah cooks and cleans for people who come to ski and stay in chalets, which are wooden houses. She studied French and History of Art at Oxford Brookes University. Sarah says being a chalet girl is not a career, but it's fun for a year or two before starting a serious job. She meets many successful people every week.
Sarah does not live in the chalet. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks to the chalet, which can have up to 18 guests each week. She eats her breakfast first, then makes breakfast for the guests. They have porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants. After breakfast, Sarah cleans up and prepares afternoon tea or cleans the rooms. She says cleaning is the hardest part of the job. By 11 a.m., she is ready to go skiing. She skis until about 4:30 p.m.
Sarah returns to the chalet to prepare dinner. She takes a shower but does not sleep because it makes her too tired. Dinner is served at 8 p.m., and coffee is ready by 10 p.m. After dinner, she cleans up and fills the dishwasher. Sometimes she talks with the guests, and other times they want to be alone. Good guests make the week fun, but sometimes things don't go well.
Sarah meets her friends at her chalet and they go out at 11 p.m. They visit places like Bananas, G Jay's, and Dick's T-Bar. She does not stay out too late on Saturday because Sunday is her busiest day. On Sunday, she starts work early because breakfast must be ready by 7 a.m. After the guests leave, she cleans everything quickly. If she hasn't shopped on Saturday, she does it now. At 3 p.m., she prepares tea for new guests who arrive around 4:30 p.m. She helps them with questions and takes them to get ski equipment if needed. Then it's time for dinner again. Sometimes she chats with friends, but if she's tired, she goes to bed early."

FCE_8,B2,"'Do you want to get your story published? Our expert, Margaret Stubbs, can help you. Many people ask, 'I wrote a story or book. Who should I send it to?' First, you need to learn about publishers and practice writing. Selling your writing needs knowledge about the 'writing world'. No matter what you write, you need to know about the markets you want to reach. The best way to learn is by reading a lot. Visit your local library, bookshops, and newsagents. Reading will show you what publishers want. Remember, things change often. New magazines come out, editors change jobs, and magazines change direction. Publishers always want new writers, so we must give them what they want. If you want to write short love stories, find out which magazines publish them. Get recent copies and see what kind of stories they like. Know who the readers are because the editor wants to please them. Writers often ask me, 'My story was rejected three times. Am I wasting my time?' I never discourage anyone, but maybe the work is not ready to be published. Many new writers send their work too soon. If you have only written one story, it is not likely to be published. Success usually comes after years in publishing or journalism. When you send your work, keep writing more stories. Write ten or even twenty more. Each story will be better, and you will feel more like a writer. Don't throw any stories away—improve them. I suggest not showing your work to others at first. Remember, every successful writer faced many rejections. Do everything you can to become a better writer. Look for a creative writing course or join a local writers' group. This will help you get ideas and confidence. Think of yourself as a writer and practice writing every day if you can.'"

The station didn't feel as nice and clean as usual. Older couples with matching bags sat on the benches, and many college students sat on the floor with their bags. A man with grey hair was talking to different people. He looked rich: tanned skin, nice sweater, and a soft, beige coat. He asked a woman sitting alone a question. Then he talked to a girl near me. She had long blond hair, and I thought I might like to talk to her too. The man asked, 'Are you going to Philadelphia?' 'Well, I'm going north,' she said. 'But to Philadelphia?' 'No, New York, but I'll be ...' 'Thanks, anyway,' he said, and moved to the next bench. Now I was interested. 'Ma'am,' he asked an old lady, 'are you going to Philadelphia?' When she said, 'Wilmington,' he didn't say anything and went to another couple. I moved closer, pretending to look at the train platform. I was going to Philadelphia. He could have asked me. I knew why he didn't. I probably looked unreliable. He just glanced at me and went to the other end of the waiting area. He looked stressed. 'Please!' he said to a woman reading a book. 'Tell me you're going to Philadelphia!' She put her book down. She was about thirty-five, older than me. She looked like a teacher. 'Philadelphia?' she said. 'Yes, I am.' 'Could I ask you a favor?' I stopped a few feet away and looked at my wrist as if I had a watch. (I don't have a watch.) Even without looking, I could tell she was cautious. The man must have noticed too, because he said, 'Nothing too difficult, I promise!' They announced my train. People started moving to Gate E, the older couples pulling their bags like big pets. I heard the man talking. 'My daughter is flying out this afternoon for a study year abroad, leaving from Philadelphia. I put her on a train this morning, then went for groceries, and came home to find my wife upset. My daughter forgot her passport. She called from the station in Philadelphia; she didn't know what to do.' The woman made a sympathetic sound. I would have stayed quiet to see what he wanted. 'So I told her to stay there. I said I would find someone here to take her passport.' A likely story! Why didn't he go himself if it was so important? 'Why don't you go yourself?' the woman asked. 'I can't leave my wife alone for that long. She's in a wheelchair.' This seemed like a weak excuse to me. Also, it seemed like too much bad luck for one family. I looked at them. The man was holding a packet, not a plain envelope, but a padded one the size of a small book. Aha! Padded! So you couldn't feel what was inside! And it looked stapled shut. Be careful, lady, I thought.'"

John Moore, a restaurant owner, talks about his son Gary, who is a famous TV chef.
I think everyone gets a chance in life. My son, Gary, got his chance with cooking, and my chance was to run a restaurant. When I found out about the restaurant, I went quickly to see it. It was in bad shape, but it was just what I wanted. Starting this business made me remember my childhood. I remember my mom going to work in a factory, and I was sad because I was alone. So, I thought, 'We need time for family.' My wife took care of the kids and did my accounts, while I ran the restaurant. We lived above the restaurant, and we always made sure to eat meals together. This was good for our children, Gary and Joe. They are both very confident. From a young age, they would talk to our regular customers. This helped them a lot in life.
Gary was a lively child. When he was about seven, he jumped into a bath like it was a swimming pool and hurt himself. When he was older, he worked for pocket money. He started with small jobs and by ten, he was in the kitchen every weekend, so he always had money at school. He was disciplined. He would wake up even before me. In a family business, everyone helps, and it was nice to see him helping. Gary wasn't very good at school, but he was great in the kitchen. By 15, he was as good as the adults working there, and sometimes he was in charge. He could make over a hundred meals, and I knew he would work in catering because he was talented. When he needed work experience for school, I sent him to a friend's restaurant.
Gary recently started playing the drums and now has a band. I wonder what will happen to his cooking if his music becomes successful. I told Gary, 'If you try to do two things, you might not succeed in either, so focus on what you know you can do.' He understood when I said, 'Gary, if you want to succeed, do it by 30. After that, it might be too late.' Gary went to catering college at 17. On his first day, he finished a morning's work in an hour. That's my son! He even helped others. We can't believe how successful Gary's TV cooking show is. I'm very proud of him. I always told him that if you want something, you have to work hard for it. He saw his chance and took it. When you talk to your kids, if they remember even a little, you should be happy. The things Gary says and does show he listened sometimes."

But if you are new in Dublin, like Jo, you don't have any contacts. You have to stay in a hostel and search for a flat. For Jo, Dublin was a big unknown place. She felt like she was going into the unknown when she took the train to work there. Everyone at her school thought she would go to Dublin. No one wanted to stay in their small town. Some of her classmates went to towns like Ennis or Limerick, where they had family. But Jo was the only one going to Dublin alone.
Jo's mother thought it would be good if she stayed in the hostel run by nuns, as it was safe. Her father hoped the hostel was warm because hostels are often cold. Jo's sisters, who worked as waitresses, thought she was crazy to stay in a hostel for a week. Jo didn't know they were all talking about her as she answered an ad for a flat in Ringsend. The ad said, ""Own room, own television, share kitchen, bathroom."" It was close to the post office where she worked and seemed perfect. Jo hoped it was nice, that they would like her, and that it wasn't too expensive.
There wasn't a long line for this flat because it was more like ""Third Girl Wanted"" than ""Flat to Let."" The ""own television"" part made Jo wonder if it was too fancy for her, but the house looked normal. It was a red-brick terraced house with a basement, but the flat was upstairs. A cheerful girl with a college scarf, who didn't get the flat, was coming down the stairs. She said to Jo, ""Desperate place. They're both awful. Common as dirt."" Jo continued up the stairs.
""Hello,"" said a girl with ""Nessa"" on her T-shirt. ""Did you see that snobby girl leaving? I can't stand her type."" Jo asked, ""What did she do?"" Nessa replied, ""She didn't do much. She just looked around, made a face, and giggled, saying, 'Is this all there is? Oh dear,' in a fancy accent. We wouldn't have her here, right, Pauline?"" Pauline wore a very colorful shirt and had bright hair. Jo was surprised because Pauline was a punk. Jo had seen punks on O'Connell Street but never talked to one.
""I'm Jo, I work at the post office, and I called about the flat,"" Jo said. Nessa said they were about to have tea and brought out three mugs. One said ""Nessa,"" one said ""Pauline,"" and the other said ""Other."" Nessa said kindly, ""We'll put your name on it if you stay."""
FCE_43,B2,"'Dolphins and Their Problems People love dolphins. We like to see them at the beach, in movies, and on TV. But the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society says dolphins are in trouble. Mark Simmonds talks about why dolphins are in danger. Dolphins are special to us. They are very smart animals. They understand human feelings, and they make us think of freedom in the ocean. TV shows like Flipper and Seaquest make us love them more. But these shows do not show the real problems dolphins face in dirty and overfished seas. The number of North Sea harbour porpoises (a type of dolphin) has gone down by up to 89,000. You might think dolphins are protected by law and live in safe places. But this is not true, and not helping them could be a big problem for wildlife. There are 40 kinds of dolphins in the world. In northern Europe, the most common dolphins are the striped, common, bottlenose dolphins, and the smaller harbour porpoise. The first two live far out in the sea. We only see them in small groups near ships, and we do not know much about them. The large grey bottlenoses and harbour porpoises used to be seen near European coasts. Bottlenoses are very social and were found on the Channel coast and in British rivers like the Thames. Now, they are only found in a few places in Scotland and Wales, and they have skin injuries that show they are stressed. Dolphins have complex habits, so it is hard to know why their numbers are going down. Overfishing is a big problem. It reduces fish stocks and hurts local fishing industries. Porpoises need to find food quickly. If fish are taken away by fishing, they may not find food in time. They can also get caught in fishing nets, which they cannot see. Modern fishing uses big nets that float or move fast in the sea. Many dead dolphins have been found on beaches in France and Cornwall. Marks and cuts on their bodies show they were caught in these nets. Waste and chemicals in the sea can stay in dolphins' bodies. For example, pesticides dissolve in fat, so dolphins can eat them, and they build up in their bodies. Female dolphins then make milk with pesticides, passing the poison to their babies. There is a case of a baby dolphin dying from its mother's milk. Another problem for dolphins is human noise. Dolphins live in groups and use sound to understand their world. In the sea, noise from ships and oil wells travels four times better than in the air. This noise may bother dolphins in ways we do not know yet.'"
FCE_51,B2,"**GETTING FIT**
Exercise is very important for your mind, body, and spirit. It helps you stay balanced when life feels busy and stressful. You might think, ""Oh no, another article about exercise!"" But there are many good reasons to exercise. 
Exercise makes your muscles stronger and changes your body shape quickly. It helps you stand or sit better, which is called good posture. Good posture is important because it stops muscle problems that can cause injuries. Exercise also helps your heart, lungs, and blood circulation.
Exercise can make you feel less sad and tired. It helps you sleep better and manage stress. It can also help with some health problems. 
There are many types of exercise you can try, like aerobics, jogging, or lifting weights. But be careful not to train too hard or lift too much weight, as this can cause injuries. Start slowly and carefully. If you are unsure, ask your doctor what is best for you.
Good posture is very important. It affects how you look and feel. If you slouch, imagine a balloon pulling your head up to the sky. This helps you stand straight and breathe better. It also makes your body look slimmer.
Stretching your muscles is important too. It makes you more flexible and helps prevent injuries. Stretching should be part of your exercise routine. Do it slowly and carefully, four or five times a week.
The best exercise routine includes a warm-up, stretching, an energetic workout, and a cool-down period."

Traveling film-makers have been going around the world to film wild animals since TV started. I talked to Newman at a safari lodge. He said they sometimes argue, but they quickly make up. They do not see one person as the leader. They get along well because they both see animals in the same way. When they travel, they set up tents every night. But now, they have a fixed camp. They start their day at 5 a.m., so they make tea the night before and keep it warm in a flask. They eat pre-packed meals, which they heat up. They can be away for up to eight weeks, so food can be a problem, says Newman. 
Living in remote areas is hard, but they like being close to the animals. Once, they filmed a family of lions. One lioness would leave and come back, greeting all the lions. She even greeted their car. Newman first worked with Barrett in 1988 on a film called 'The Great Rift'. Two years later, they filmed Arctic foxes together. They spend four months in one place to make enough material for a half-hour film. Before they start, they need to get a script approved. Newman says they work well together because they share the same ideas. They want to make films that show the true spirit of the place and animals and touch people's hearts. Newman believes it is better to make people feel something than just think about it."
FCE_14,B2,"'The Netball Captain In our series on women in sport, Suzie Ellis met England's netball captain. Kendra Slawinski is the captain of England's netball team. When I met her, she had a busy day. She taught at a local school and then trained in a supermarket car park. I was surprised about her training place. 'Don't people look at you strangely?' I asked. 'I'm too focused on my movements and my feet to notice,' she said. 'I might see cars slow down, but that's all.' 'My whole life now is about being my best for the Championships,' says Kendra. She follows a strict plan to be very fit. These are her fourth World Championships, and they will be the biggest ever, with 27 countries playing. 'We'll have support from people at home, which is special,' she says. 'It's important to make netball more popular here. Playing at home means more pressure. People expect us to start with a good game.' Their first game is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. We have always beaten them, but they are fun to play. They have a lot of skill.' The England team is ranked fourth in the world. But, as Kendra says, the World Championships will be hard. 'You have to play every day, with no rest. In a series, you can lose the first game and still win. But in the Championships, you have only one chance.' In the fifteen years she has played at the top level, the sport has become harder and faster. On the court, players are more aggressive. 'You train hard to win,' says Kendra. But after the game, we are all friendlier.' Netball is also using more science for fitness. 'We must think and train like world-class players,' says Kendra. As captain, I need a strong mind and must lead by example. I support and encourage my team.' 'From the start, my netball career was planned,' she says. So I decided this competition would be my last as a player. She will probably coach young players in the future, but now she focuses on her last big event. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she might have a tear in her eye. Her loyal fans will support her all the way.'"
FCE_63,B2,"'In hot water Rachel Mills is a scientist who studies the sea. She works at Southampton University and teaches about the ocean. Rachel also studies underwater volcanoes. She goes in a small steel vehicle, like a car, to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. Inside the vehicle, there is not much space. She can touch the two pilots next to her. They cannot stand up or move much. They stay inside until someone opens the door from outside. A dive lasts 16 hours: three hours to go down, ten hours to collect rock and water samples, and three hours to come back up. If there is a problem, they can press a panic button. This makes a small escape vessel go up quickly to the surface, like a ping-pong ball in water. No one has used it yet, but it might not be a nice trip. Rachel was nervous the first time she went in the vehicle. She was on a ship with an instructor who showed her what to do in an emergency. Now, Rachel has made six dives. Last year, she went with a Russian team to a place near the Canary Islands. There are many underwater volcanoes there. The Russian team left some equipment to study the volcanoes. When Rachel is not at sea, she is in her office at the university. She loves teaching, but she also loves her research on ""black smokers."" These are underwater volcanoes that release hot water that looks like black smoke. The water comes out very fast and is very hot. Rachel was scared once when she was with an American team. They heard a loud bang and thought something bad would happen, but they were okay. Diving in the ocean is an adventure for Rachel. She feels amazed every time she sees the volcanoes. She studied them for three years, and seeing them in real life was incredible for her.'"
FCE_56,B2,"**Interview Tips**
First impressions are very important. People decide what they think about us in the first few minutes. They look at how we dress, our eye contact, our body movement, how fast or slow we talk, and our voice. Mary Pearce studied to be a teacher. She says, 'I worked hard to get my degree. When I graduated, I was very confident.' She applied for a job at a primary school and got an interview with the Head Teacher. 'I saw a small hole in my jacket that morning,' she remembers. 'I wanted to change, but I knew it would make me late, and I think it's important to be on time.' Mary didn't get the job. Her friend, who also works at the school, told her the Head Teacher said, 'If someone doesn't try to look their best at an interview, what kind of teacher will they be?' 
Simon Grant, a hotel manager, says: 'People who look like they care about themselves are more likely to care about their jobs. People think it's what's inside that counts, but in an interview, you should try to look your best.' Many people forget how important it is to look professional. For example, Janet Goodwood worked for ten years as an assistant in a big accounting firm. When the office manager left, she applied for the job but didn't get an interview. 'I thought it was a mistake, so I asked the Director of Personnel what happened,' she says. 'He told me I didn't look like an office manager. He suggested I dress better before I apply again. I was shocked. I do a good job, and the way I dress shouldn't matter.'
How we move and our gestures also affect the interviewer's first impression. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian found that 7% of our message comes from words, 38% from our voice, and 55% from our facial expressions. If our facial expressions and words are different, the listener will believe the facial expressions more. So make sure your words and body language match. Mixed messages will confuse the interviewer. It's also important not to look too desperate for the job or too eager to please. Sheila Rice, a marketing specialist, applied for a promotion. Her interview went well, and she got the job right away. 'I was happy,' she remembers. 'But I showed too much excitement. When the boss saw how excited I was, he knew I wouldn't say no. So, he offered me a lower salary than I wanted. I'm sure I could have got more if I controlled my excitement.'
Finally, think about what you say and how you say it. David Artesio, a manager at an employment agency, suggests learning about the company before the interview. 'The annual report, for example, will tell you about the company. Mention something that interests you during the interview. This will show you are interested in the company.' Business consultant Marian Woodall suggests having a few questions ready and speaking in short, clear sentences. She says, 'Poor communicators talk in long paragraphs. Successful communicators talk in short sentences and clear points.'"

**The Farmer**
Matt Froggatt used to work as an insurance agent in London. Now, he has a sheep farm. He worked in the city for 14 years, but it became boring and not fun anymore. He lost his job suddenly and used the money he got to start the farm. He met a chef from a famous hotel, and now he sells meat to them and also by mail. He is happy not to be in an office, but he still works long hours.
**The Painter**
Ron Ablewhite was a manager in advertising. Now, he is an artist. Painting was his hobby, and he enjoyed it more than his job. He decided to leave his job and become an artist. A career counselor helped him. Most people need to work for money, but Ron's children were grown up, so he didn't need to support them. He moved to the north of England, far from his friends, but they still visit him.
**The Hat Maker**
Katherine Goodison was a lawyer. Now, she makes hats in her London flat. She liked her job as a lawyer, but the hours were too long. She didn't want to work more, so she left. People thought she would get bored, but she didn't. She has many deadlines because of fashion seasons. She is happier and less stressed now. She misses talking to colleagues but likes being responsible for her work.
**The Masseur**
Paul Drinkwater worked in finance for 16 years. Now, he is a masseur at the Life Centre in London. He started working in finance at 22 but didn't find it rewarding. He almost lost his job in 1989, so he quit and traveled for a year. He wanted to work in health, so he visited gyms and talked to owners. He took courses in massage and got a part-time job at the Life Centre. He is happy now and feels in control of his life."
FCE_6,B2,"**Dedicated to Their Sports: Four Young Sports Stars Talk About Their Lives**
**A. Darius (Runner)**  
I have always liked sports. I played many sports, but I was best at football and running. When I was 14, I tried out for a professional football team, but I chose to focus on running instead. My best moment was when I ran for my country in the youth team and won a medal. I hoped to get some sponsorship because training is expensive, but I didn't get much attention from the media. I train at home in the winter and then go to Florida for three weeks before the season starts. It's fun because there are great places to train and good nightlife. But I have to be disciplined. If friends ask me to go out before training, I have to say no. I want to go to the next Olympics. That would be amazing.
**B. Gabriel (Surfer)**  
The surfing community is small, so I see the same people at competitions. Professional surfers are serious, and the best waves are often early in the morning. So, I can't go to late-night parties. I don't mind that, but I like to sleep in, and I have to give that up too. It's worth it because I won the National Championships last year. After a win, I like to have a big night out, and if I win money, I go somewhere nice. Winning the championship helped me get a job on a TV surfing show. I guess I'm a bit famous now.
**C. Dieter (Yacht Racer)**  
When five guys are on a boat, we have a lot of fun. We celebrate wins in a big way. Some people say we act like kids, but we don't try to get media attention. Reporters sometimes care more about our celebrations than our races. I'm away for eight months a year, so it's nice to come home and hang out with friends who do different things. You can't think about the sport all the time. I'm known in sailing, but I don't get recognized on the street often. I don't want to be a celebrity. I get letters from people asking for signed pictures, and I reply to all of them. It takes time, but I don't mind.
**D. Tomas (Tennis Player)**  
It's great to play tennis and feel the crowd supporting you. At the last tournament, it got a bit crazy with people around me. I like it when fans recognize me when I'm shopping. But it can be hard. My last girlfriend didn't like it when I got attention from female fans. Tennis players travel a lot, and that's why we broke up. It was hard, but you have to be serious and professional in sports. I'm okay with focusing on my game now. I can do other things in life after I retire because that happens early in tennis."
FCE_33,B2,"'Shopping with Children Shopping with children can be very difficult for parents. One mother says, ""They want everything they see. If it's not a sweet breakfast cereal, it's a Disney video or a comic. Usually all three. I can't buy all this, and I feel bad for saying no all the time. I try not to take them shopping, but then I worry they won't learn how to make choices. I can't win."" Research shows that children ask to buy something every two minutes in a supermarket. More than £150 million a year is spent on advertising to children, mostly on TV. This number will probably grow, and supermarkets are where this advertising works best. Children often don't understand why parents say no to buying things. They don't believe that sugar is bad for teeth when they see fun and exciting ads. Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says, ""Most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, but these ideas are not always right. It's good for parents and children to talk about food because if children only learn from TV ads, they get a one-sided view. Parents don't like competing with ads and having to say no to their children."" The Independent Television Commission, which controls TV ads, does not allow ads to tell children to ask their parents to buy things. But, as Dibb says, ""The goal of advertising is to make people want to buy something. So even if they can't say, 'Tell your mum to buy this,' the ads still try to make that happen."" Some parents find it stressful to decide which things to buy for their children and which to refuse. One mother says she talks a lot with her children about food and ads. Her son listens to ads but is critical of them. They look at labels together, and now her children don't ask for things she doesn't want to buy. Parents also say they are not always fair when they say no to their children's requests. Mike, a father of a seven-year-old son and a three-year-old daughter, says, ""We say no to sweets because they are bad for him, but we buy cream and chocolate for ourselves. It's fun to buy nice things, and it's normal for children to want them too. But I still get annoyed by their demands. It depends on how I feel. If I'm happy, I'm more likely to say yes. It's hard to be fair all the time."" Supermarkets could help by not putting sweets near the checkout or by having play areas for children. Parents might spend less if their children are not with them, but shopping without a child's demands might bring more customers.'"
FCE_20,B2,"'Luxury and Modern Technology at the Merrion Hotel The Merrion Hotel is a new five-star hotel in Dublin. It took almost two years to change four old houses into this hotel. The hotel has the latest technology for both staff and guests. The General Manager, Peter MacCann, wants his staff to know guests by name. For other details, he uses a computer system. This system helps give special service to guests who come back. It cost a lot of money, but MacCann says it will save money in the long run. The system remembers what guests like. For example, if a guest asks for certain music CDs, they will have them ready next time. Many guests complain about room temperature. The hotel has a system to control this. Guests can change the temperature a little in their rooms. The front desk can also change it more if needed. Business guests will like the technology in the rooms. MacCann thinks 65% of guests will be business people. Each room has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine, and video-conferencing. The hotel is ready for future technology changes. They have extra cables and rent TVs so they can update them easily. Even with all this technology, the rooms are comfortable and welcoming. The hotel has 145 large rooms, a swimming pool, gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a nice garden. The food at the hotel is very good.

Emma Marsden asked six women how they stay energetic and happy. Here is what they said:
A. Jeanette Kupfermann, Journalist and Author: ""I get energy from excitement and challenges. Learning new things gives me a lot of energy. I am learning flamenco dancing now, and it makes me feel great. Dance is fun and gives me energy. If you are bored, you can feel tired. Doing something useful, even if it's small, gives you energy.""
B. Linda Kelsey, Magazine Editor: ""I have a lot of work, but I enjoy it. Work is not hard for me because I like it. I need a lot of sleep, and when I sleep well, I feel good. I try to exercise, like doing yoga once a week. Exercise makes me feel better. In the afternoon, I feel tired, so I eat something to feel better.""
C. Annie Nightingale, Disc Jockey: ""I get energy from being happy and positive. I don't like negative people. I think we should enjoy life. I love my job, and it is exciting. I like being around young people. I enjoy taking photos and writing songs for fun. It helps me relax when I travel.""
D. Floella Benjamin, Author and Children's TV Presenter: ""I get energy from doing things I love. I believe in my work and my family. Being positive helps me. I love working with kids because they have a lot of energy. Smiling at people and getting a smile back makes me feel good. I try to eat healthy and don't smoke or drink. I play with kids for exercise.""
E. Deborah Moggach, Author and Playwright: ""I love making a garden from nothing. I once turned a concrete area into a garden. It was better than any workout. I also get energy from knowing people want to read my writing. I like exploring nature, even if it's private land. It makes me feel like a child.""
F. Katherine Monblot, Therapist: ""You need to like and respect what you do. I like taking risks and get bored easily, which keeps me active. Doing things you don't like makes you tired. I used to be on committees, but they took too much of my time. Use your energy for things that matter to you."""
FCE_45,B2,"**ICE SKATING**
Ice skating is a very old activity. People have been ice skating for thousands of years. Long ago, people used skates made from animal bones. These bone skates were used until about the year 200 AD when iron skates came to Scandinavia. In Scandinavia, rich people thought skating was an important skill. 
In the early 1900s, skating was calm and stylish. But in 1924, at the Winter Olympics, an 11-year-old girl named Sonja Henie showed a new, more active way to skate. This made skating more popular. Today, skating is a mix of art and sport. It is beautiful and also hard work.
When you start skating, balance and control are very important. You can go faster as you get better. To keep your balance, your legs should be a little bent, and your knees should be bent too. Your body should lean a little forward. Relaxing is very important in skating. 
To start skating, your heels should almost touch, and your feet should point outwards. Push forward with one foot and make a small move with the other foot. It is not too hard, right? As you practice, you can make your movements bigger.
Learning how to fall is one of the first things a skater should know. Even the best skaters fall. To fall safely, try to stay relaxed. This helps reduce the impact when you hit the ice. To get up, use your hands to kneel, then stand up.
Once you can skate well, you can try different styles like figure skating, freestyle, distance skating, speed skating, and skating in pairs. It is best to start with figure skating and then try simple freestyle. Most ice rinks have teachers who can help you learn the basic moves. After that, you can learn turns, jumps, and spins.
Good skaters look relaxed and move easily. To be like them, you should do exercises regularly. It is not safe to skate with a stiff body. Warm-up exercises should include moves for your legs, back, and shoulders, especially your ankles and knees. After skating, do the same exercises to avoid stiffness.
Skating helps improve balance, coordination, relaxation, and movement. It is good for your heart and lungs and makes your body stronger. If you also swim or jog, it is a great way to stay healthy and fit."

A. **Annika Reeder, 15**  
Annika won a gold medal in gymnastics at the Commonwealth Games. She wants to be a physiotherapist and compete in the next Olympics. ""The work is very hard now. I don't have time to watch TV or go out with friends. I just do gym and school. I try to take each training day by day. When I am very tired, my coach sometimes gives me a day off, but not often. You can't take too many days off, or you get stiff.""
B. **Annika's Mother**  
""Annika showed great talent from a young age. Some parents push their kids, but it doesn't work. To perform like Annika, you have to want it yourself. People say we gave up a lot, but they don't see what the sport gave us. We love it and what it did for Annika. She was shy and sucked her thumb, but now she has met people from all over the world and is confident.""
C. **Sarah Stokes**  
Sarah started show-jumping at ten and won the British National Championship. ""It's good my parents like show-jumping because they train me and take me to events. Shows last one to five days. I never get tired of it. I love show-jumping; it's exciting and fun. Even without my parents, I would do it because I am determined. My goal is to join the British young riders team. I want to win a gold medal at the Olympics.""
D. **Sarah's Mother**  
""Sarah loved horses from age 1. At 5, she got up early to exercise her pony. To qualify for big shows, you have to jump all over England. We save money by sleeping in our horse box. Sarah is well-organized and happy on a horse. Watching your child succeed at something they love is amazing.""
E. **Jane McShane, 10**  
Jane is Britain's Under-14 Chess Champion. ""Tournaments are friendly. I know everyone, and it's fun. When I play, I don't concentrate much. I should, but I just look around. I'm not afraid of being proud. I don't talk about my success at school because I don't like embarrassment.""
F. **Jane's Mother**  
""Jane played her first chess game at 5. My father said, 'Let's see if she likes it.' He tried to teach me, but I was bored. Jane loved it from the start. By the end of that day, she knew all the moves, and by 6, she was beating adults. I'm happy when she wins, but if she wanted to stop, I wouldn't stop her. I don't want to hold her back if she has a gift. Let her reach her potential."""
FCE_29,B2,"'We are all getting taller Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his teacher he wanted to join the navy. The teacher joked, 'Do you want to be the flagpole on a ship?' because Chris was already almost two meters tall. Today, at 228 cm, he is the tallest man in Britain. Every ten years, people in Europe get about one centimeter taller. More and more tall people are being born. This does not mean we are becoming a new super race. We are actually going back to how we were as cavemen. We are now eating better, which helps us grow to our full size. Professor Chris Stringer says we are becoming like the Cro-Magnons, who lived 40,000 years ago. In the past, people got food from many places: women collected herbs, fruits, and berries, and men hunted animals. They ate about 85 different wild plants. But about 9,000 years ago, farming started, which changed everything. Farmers took over green areas, and now three plants - wheat, rice, and maize - give us more than half of our food. This poor diet made people less healthy and smaller. In Ohio, scientists found that when people started growing corn, healthy hunter-gatherers became sick and underweight farmers. Tooth decay and diseases increased. Corn was not a blessing but a health problem. Farming spread because it could support more people than hunting and gathering. But most people were not well-fed and were smaller. Only recently have richer countries started eating better again. In Europe, the US, and Japan, people are eating like our ancestors. Now, the average man in the US is 179 cm, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm. This is good, but it also causes problems. Beds are still 190 cm long, as they were in 1860. Leg-room in planes and trains seems smaller, and clothes makers have to change their sizes. We cannot grow forever. There must be a limit. Robert Fogel from the University says it could be 193 cm, and we might reach it this century. But scientists say that while individuals are getting taller, as a species, we are getting smaller. During the last ice age, 10,000 years ago, people were rounder and taller to keep warm. As the climate got warmer, we became thinner and smaller. If the planet keeps getting hotter, we might get even smaller. So, global warming could make us shrink.'"
FCE_57,B2,"'Studio Audiences What is it like to be in the audience when a TV show is made? Cosmo Landesman found out. Studio audiences are a common part of TV, but many people don't know much about them. We see them excited on game shows and wonder - who are these people? Some people think studio audiences are not very important. Even people who work in TV sometimes don't respect them. I thought studio audiences were just people who wanted to be on TV for a short time. But there is no typical studio audience. They come from all kinds of backgrounds. TV shows try to get different people for different shows. Some people like to watch TV at home and don't understand why others go to a studio. Why would someone get tickets, travel far, and sit for hours in a studio to watch something they can see at home? One idea is that people want to be on TV for a moment. I didn't believe this until I talked to Angela. She said she came because she might be on TV. Another idea is that people are curious to see behind the scenes. But many people said they came because a friend gave them a ticket. Not many of us have been in a studio audience, but we think we know what it's like. You sit with strangers, and someone shows signs that say APPLAUD or LAUGH, and you clap or laugh. This might be true for some shows, but not all. A studio manager said, 'We hope a show is good enough not to need these signs.' Is there a difference between being in a studio and watching at home? Claire thinks sitting in a studio is 'more exciting', and Charlotte liked being part of live TV. 'Last year I saw my favorite comedian. At home, you miss a lot.' I missed seeing live actors because I could only see the back of someone's head. The first scenes were so far away that I watched on a studio screen. Going to a studio might not be the best way to watch TV, but that's not the point. For most people, it was just fun and a free night out.'"

I don't like places with no people. I like places with people. When I travel, I like villages with old buildings, not empty deserts. When I was eight, I went to school in England. On Saturdays, I rode my bike to a village called Lastingham. Riding my bike was fun and made me feel free. I liked to see the hills, valleys, and old villages. I am from Scotland, so the land looked the same but also different. I still visit there today. I wrote about my trips in a diary. That was my first try at writing about travel, which I became famous for later.

There is a small train that goes from Hythe to Dungeness. It is run by people who love trains. I always travel first class because it is not much more expensive. The view is not amazing. The train goes through Romney Marsh with sheep and next to a canal. But I like when the train goes through people's back gardens. We can see people doing things like making tea or washing dishes. I see myself as a woman in a small train looking into homes. I like the simple view of fields, sheep, and the sea. It makes me look closer to find something special.

The Hartland Peninsula is a beautiful and quiet coast. The beaches are hard to get to and have many rocks, so not many people go there. Some brave surfers come, but most people like to look at the sea. The coast faces the Atlantic Ocean and is known for shipwrecks. There are walks along the coast and trips inland to valleys with oak trees, ferns, and wildflowers. We stay in simple places with a family in the village of Southole.

My favorite place in England is the Trough of Bowland. It is a big open area perfect for hiking. Not many people live or visit there. It is a quiet and empty place, and I like the space. I found it by accident when I was a student. Since then, I visit every year, sometimes alone, with my boyfriend, and now with my son. It has not changed much since my first visit. Having a child makes these visits special. It makes me sad that he is growing up in a city.

I bought Glenthorne, my favorite house in Britain. I wanted peace and to feel connected to my English roots. I grew up in Sri Lanka, but at twelve, I went to school in Devon, England. I used to ride my bike around the moors and village streets. We had a story about a place we never rode past: if you went down the driveway, you would never come back. That place was Glenthorne. It is my dream place. It is a quiet, hidden, and romantic house. You can only hear the sea, wind, and birds."

We are a family who loves animals. One day, my daughter called me at work. She found a pine snake and asked, ""Can we keep him?"" I said, ""Yes, but only for one night."" We have a special tank for animals we find, so we can look at them and read about them in our nature book.
I came home late and started cooking. Suddenly, I heard my sons shouting, ""Oh, Mother! Help!"" I ran to their room. Our cat, Domino, had caught Bianca, a white mouse I got for Mother's Day. Domino was running around with the mouse in his mouth. I tried to catch Domino but tripped and fell.
While I was on the floor, I saw the snake escaping from its tank. The room was full of noise with the cat, mouse, kids, and even our dog barking. I quickly turned off the stove and went back to the room. I caught Domino by the tail and saved the mouse. The mouse was okay, and it lived a long life.
Next, I had to catch the snake. I sat on the floor and waited for it to calm down. Slowly, I picked up the snake and took it to the garden. I wanted it to go to a tree, but the snake wrapped around my shoulders like a scarf. My eldest child, DJ, said, ""Mum, you're warm, and the shed isn't.""
We all helped the snake move to the tree. It finally went up the wall and over the roof. As the snake's tail disappeared, my three-year-old, Clay, said, ""Boy, that was one big snake!"""

It is exciting to see who it is from and to read it. I have been writing letters for a long time. I started with little notes to my mother. She always made me write thank-you letters for Christmas and birthday presents. It didn't matter if they were short or messy, as long as they were letters. When I left home at 18 to study in London, I wrote letters every week to my mother, and she wrote back. Sometimes my father wrote too, and his letters were funny and long. The letters from home talked about everyday things. We also made phone calls, but I remember the letters more. I also got letters from boyfriends. Writing letters helped our relationships. I could say things in writing that were hard to say in person. I love letters that come with birthday or Christmas cards. Notes are nice, but a letter with lots of news is better! I have friends who write to me from Sri Lanka, Australia, and Canada. I also have a friend in France. We met in a restaurant, and I asked for her address. Now we write to each other often. I can practice my French because she doesn't speak English. We have visited each other too. My biggest letter-writing success was this summer. My family and I visited my American penfriend in Texas. We had been writing for 29 years but never met. People were surprised that we wrote for so long. The local newspaper even wrote about it. I am happy my children also write letters. Like my mother, I make them write thank-you letters. My daughter writes me little letters, just like I did to my mother. She and my son have penfriends in Texas. I think it is important to keep writing letters. Don't let it become a 'lost art'.'"
FCE_54,B2,"Title: Tourists Damage Ancient Rock Art in France
In France, there are very old pictures on rocks in the French Alps. These pictures are about 4,000 years old. They show cows, fields, and gods. But now, these pictures are in danger because tourists are damaging them.
Many people visit this place, and some do not take care of the pictures. They write graffiti on them. Some tourists even step on the pictures or take pieces of rock home. Others rub the pictures to see them better, which makes them fade.
Experts are worried. Jean Clottes, an expert on rock art, says if this continues, the pictures will be gone in 50 years. Some people think the best way to protect the pictures is to stop tourists from visiting. Henry de Lumley, a museum director, thinks only guided tours should be allowed. But Jean Clottes disagrees because local people might not like this idea.
David Lavergne, an architect, also wants to keep the site open. He says it is hard to stop people from damaging the pictures because the area is big. He thinks maybe they should charge money to visit, but there is no money from the government to pay for guards.
Annie Echassoux, another expert, is worried because it is easier for tourists to get to the site now. She thinks they should block off the area and have guides. She says money must be found to protect the pictures because they are important for future generations."
FCE_32,B2,"'Shopping with Children Shopping with children can be very hard for parents. One mother says, ""They want everything they see. If it's not a new cereal, it's a Disney video or a comic. Usually all three. I can't buy all this, and I feel bad if I do. But I also feel bad for saying no all the time. I try not to take them shopping, but then I worry they won't learn how to make choices. I can't win."" Research shows that children ask to buy something every two minutes in a supermarket. More than £150 million a year is spent on advertising to children, mostly on TV. This number will probably grow, and supermarkets are where this advertising works best. Children often don't understand why parents say no to buying things. They don't believe that sugar is bad for teeth when they see fun ads on TV. Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says, ""Most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, but these ideas are not always right. It's good for parents and children to talk about food. If children only learn from TV ads, they get a one-sided view. Parents don't like competing with ads and having to say no to their children."" TV ads can't tell children to ask their parents to buy things, but the ads still make children want to buy them. Some parents find it stressful to decide which things to buy for their children. One mother says she talks a lot with her children about food and ads. Her son listens to ads but is critical of them. They look at labels together, and now her children don't ask for things she won't buy. Parents also say they are not always fair when saying yes or no to their children's requests. Mike, a father of two, says, ""We say no to sweets because they are bad, but we buy cream and chocolate for ourselves. It's fun to buy nice things, and children want that too. But I still get annoyed by their demands. It depends on how I feel. If I'm happy, I might say yes. It's hard to be fair all the time."" Supermarkets could help by not putting sweets near the checkout or by having play areas for children. Parents might spend less if their children are not with them, but shopping without a child's demands might bring more customers.'"
FCE_65,B2,"Title: Climbing Walls
In the past, climbers went to mountains. Now, people can climb anywhere, inside or outside. At the World Cup Climbing Championships in Birmingham, a French climber named Francois Lombard is climbing on a wall. He is hanging upside down by his fingers. This event is at the National Indoor Arena, which is also known for the TV show Gladiators. Both events have a big wall.
Before the 1960s, climbers practiced on cliffs. In winter, they climbed in cold places like Scotland. But climbers needed to stay fit all year. So, they started using brick walls to practice. This helped them keep their fingers strong.
In the 1960s, sports centers began building special climbing walls. Don Robinson, a teacher, made a climbing wall at Leeds University. He used natural rock in concrete blocks. Many walls like this were built in the 1970s. But these walls had problems. They were only straight up and down, unlike real cliffs. Climbers got bored because the walls couldn't change.
In 1985, a Frenchman named Francois Savigny made a new material for climbing. It looked like real rock and could be put on any wall. Climbers could change the holds when they got bored. French companies also made panels with steel frames. These were lighter than concrete and could be moved easily. This gave climbers many new ways to climb."
FCE_61,B2,"'Do you want to be an actor? If you tell someone you want to be an actor, they will probably say it is 'risky'. Acting is a risky job because there are more actors than jobs. Some friends might say you are crazy, but others might think differently. Everyone will give you different advice. It is your choice, and you are responsible for your dream. There are no easy ways to become an actor. There are no exams to pass, and no guarantee you will get a job after training. It depends on luck and talent. There is always a need for new actors, and acting can be exciting and glamorous. Sometimes, it can also be rewarding. People often ask what talent is. I think it is natural skill and imagination. Imagination is hard to measure. Talent also needs courage and belief in what you do. Why do people want to act? It is hard to explain. In the theatre, the important thing is the connection between the actor and the audience. This connection is important in all acting. It is why actors love to act. If you ask actors how they succeed, they might not know. They know about their skills and others' skills, but they do not take success for granted. They know they are only as good as their current job, and fame might not last. Disappointment is a big problem for actors. Last month, you might have been out of work, selling clothes, or waitressing. Then, you get an audition, but you might not get the job. Actors do not talk about their chances. They find ways to handle the stress of auditions and rejection. Nobody likes being rejected. Remember, rejection can happen from the first time you try for a part. You are saying you are available, willing, and hopefully talented enough for the job. It is up to you because if you do not care enough, no one else will care for you.'"

FCE_28,B2,"'We are all getting taller Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his teacher he wanted to join the navy. The teacher joked, 'Do you want to be the flagpole on a ship?' because Chris was already almost two meters tall. Today, at 228 cm, he is the tallest man in Britain. Every ten years, people in Europe get about one centimeter taller. More and more tall people are being born. This does not mean we are becoming a new super race. We are actually going back to how we were as cavemen. We are now eating better, which helps us grow to our full height. Professor Chris Stringer says we are becoming like the Cro-Magnons, who lived 40,000 years ago. In the past, people got food from many places: women gathered plants, and men hunted animals. They ate about 85 different wild plants. But about 9,000 years ago, farming started, which changed everything. Farmers took over green areas, and now three plants - wheat, rice, and maize - give us more than half of our food. This poor diet made people less healthy and shorter. In Ohio, scientists found that when people started growing corn, they became sick and underweight. Tooth decay and diseases increased. Farming spread because it could support more people, even if they were not well-fed. Only recently have richer countries started eating better again. In the US, the average man is now 179 cm tall, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm. This is good, but it also causes problems. Beds are still 190 cm long, and there is less leg-room in planes and trains. Clothes makers have to change their sizes. We cannot keep growing forever. There must be a limit. Robert Fogel from the University says it could be 193 cm, and we might reach it this century. But scientists say that while individuals are getting taller, as a species, we are actually getting smaller. During the last ice age, 10,000 years ago, people were rounder and taller to keep warm. As the climate got warmer, we became thinner and smaller. If the planet keeps getting hotter, we might get even smaller. So, global warming could make us shrink.'"

FCE_5,B2,"Title: A Childhood Game Becomes a Business
Two brothers, Dave and Norm Lagasse, are using a game from their childhood to start a business. They live in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA. The game they play is called pichenotte. Their grandfather, Lucien Rajotte, brought the game from Quebec, Canada, to the USA. The family loved playing it on weekends and holidays.
The pichenotte board was made by their grandfather from old wooden food crates. Even after moving to New Mexico, the family continued to play. Visitors were curious because the game was not known in the southern USA.
Three years ago, Dave noticed the old board was damaged, so he made a new one. It was so nice that a relative and a friend wanted one too. The brothers took the board to a sports bar in Santa Fe. At first, people were not interested, but soon they loved playing it.
Dave researched the game's history. It started in India as 'carroms', then became 'squails' in Britain, and finally 'pichenotte' in Quebec, Canada. The game is for 2 to 4 players. Each player has 12 pieces or 'pucks' to flick into a hole for points. The game lasts about two minutes.
Seeing the game's popularity, the brothers made more boards and sold them at markets and fairs. They even started a championship with a trophy called the 'Lord Pichenotte Cup'. The boards sold quickly, so the brothers decided to make pichenotte their full-time job. They set up a workshop in their garage and have made over 450 boards. Each board is made of birchwood and mahogany, weighs 12kg, and costs $595.
There are no professional pichenotte players or TV shows yet, but the brothers hope their business will grow. They dream of one day having a luxury car in their garage instead of wood and tools. Until then, they enjoy playing the game they love."
FCE_41,B2,"**WELCOME TO THE MODEL VILLAGE**
When you come to the Model Village, it is hard to believe that a few years ago, this place was just empty land with lots of wild plants. People thought it was useless land. But one man, with help from his wife, worked hard to make it beautiful. They moved a lot of soil and clay to change the flat land into the nice shapes you see now. Machines helped, but there was also a lot of hard work by hand. They brought in about 1,000 tonnes of good soil to make the grass, flowers, and rock gardens.
Many trees and bushes were planted. They had to choose plants that could live near the sea and in strong winter winds. Most plants came from local garden shops, but some came from far places like Canada and New Zealand.
Colin Sims thought of the Model Village. He made over 100 models by himself over nine years, starting in 1972. The models are made from stone, concrete, special wood, and plastic to last in all weather. At first, Colin needed help from experts to learn about materials, but soon he became an expert too.
You will see that the models are all made to the same size scale, with lots of detail. This took patience and special building techniques. The Model Village is very popular because of its high quality. The building techniques are now used in other model villages in England and are taught in some schools.
The models show traditional British buildings. One of the best is the Manor House, a 13th-century stone building with a brick tower. You will also see a Castle, St Mary's Church, a zoo, and a mini golf course, which is new.
Please stay on the paths and do not touch the models. If you fall, it can take us a long time to fix the models. You can take photos from the paths. Dogs are welcome if they are on a short lead.
To enjoy your visit more, you can press buttons in front of some models to make them move. At the end of your visit, we would like to hear your thoughts. We are always planning new models, and your ideas can help us. Tell us if any models are not as good as the others. We are always fixing and updating them.
We hope you enjoy your visit and come back again. Please tell your friends about the Model Village."
FCE_69,B2,"'Every week, British tabloid newspapers show pictures that invade people's privacy. These pictures often break the rules that newspaper editors should follow. Sometimes pop stars pose for photographers, but this is not common. Usually, these pictures hurt famous people because they show private moments on the front page. However, not many people ask the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) for help. The PCC is an organization that deals with these problems. These pictures are rarely important for the public. For example, do private photos of pop stars help solve a crime? How did a picture of a famous actress on a hotel balcony help public safety? The actress was upset about these pictures before. She was in a hotel, a place where she should have privacy, so she had a reason to complain, but she didn't. The PCC did not investigate, which is surprising. They should also look into a recent story about a pop star's love life. The pop star, like the actress, did not complain. Shouldn't the PCC do something about these attacks? At first, this seems like a good idea. It would lead to many decisions against newspapers. Other newspapers and TV would talk about it. The public would not support the newspapers, and editors would stop publishing such pictures. Photographers would also be affected because they couldn't make money by hiding and taking pictures of celebrities. If the PCC acted like a 'police officer', there would be problems. How would it decide to start an investigation? Should it ask the victim to complain? And if the person still didn't want to, should it continue? Also, famous people might expect every story about them to be investigated and be upset if it wasn't. The job is too big. How could the PCC watch all British newspapers and magazines? There is also the embarrassment to think about. Even if someone's privacy is invaded, would they want more attention from an investigation? Most people probably want to forget and move on. Some might have other reasons to stay quiet. They might have a worse story they don't want the press to find out. So, even the PCC might seem like the enemy. A British comedian also had problems with the press. He and his wife were secretly photographed on their honeymoon. He didn't complain then or later when his family was photographed on holiday. He was afraid the newspaper would show the pictures again with a new story about his anger. They might say it was just for fun and that, as a comedian, he should have a sense of humor. This fear is understandable. People think they will be targeted again if they challenge the tabloids. It is hard to find an easy solution to this big problem.'"

Confident people seem like they were always confident, but they learned it. Nina Hathway talks to five people about how they became confident.
A. Jenny
When I left school, I was very shy. At 25, I helped at my daughter's school. I thought I couldn't do it, but I did well. Someone suggested I go to university. I was nervous on my first day, but my confidence grew. Working at the school changed my life.
B. Michaela
Four years ago, my father got sick, and I had to run the family business. I was scared and acted too aggressive. I learned that to be confident, you must believe in yourself. If work is too hard, I don't feel bad about finishing tasks the next day. When things are difficult, I remind myself I have nothing to lose. Fear makes you less confident, so I talk to myself to calm down.
C. Lisa
People think I'm confident, but I get scared. In TV, looking confident is important. Interviewing people showed me that everyone gets nervous. My mom once said, ""Who's looking at you? Everyone worries about themselves."" I remember this. You gain confidence by doing things that scare you. I was nervous for my driving test, but I passed. After that, I felt less scared.
D. Barbara
I enjoy my work, which makes me confident. I've built confidence over the years. If you learn from mistakes, you're more confident next time. I work hard and am liked at the restaurant, but not everyone likes me. I don't let it bother me. You should like yourself for who you are. My company has training courses that help my confidence. Setting small goals helps me see my progress.
E. Kim
After college, I worked as a secretary. I was scared to speak in meetings. I finally got the confidence to speak up. In politics, I was nervous speaking in public. I told myself, ""People do this every day, so you can too."" Writing notes helped me feel better. Everyone gets nervous speaking in public. The secret to confidence is telling yourself, ""Nothing is impossible."""
FCE_47,B2,"'Visit to Malaysia Paul Forster goes to a kite-flying festival and spends a night in the forest. Adnan Ali smiled when I gave him his broken kite. 'You should keep it,' he said, 'it's a tradition - if the line breaks, the finder keeps it ... and I have many more.' He showed me a pile of beautifully decorated kites at his feet. All were 120cm wide and long, made of tissue paper and bamboo. We sat next to them under the trees behind the Beach of the Seven Lagoons in Kelantan, and watched Malaysia's biggest kite festival. In the middle of the beach were 10 platforms, where helpers held the kites, and a line of competitors waited for the countdown. When the whistle blew, the crowd cheered and the kites flew up like rockets. More than 500 men and boys joined the competition, which lasts five days every year. Each person entered four different kite designs, judged on decoration, stability, and flying ability. 'Flying kites isn't hard,' said Adnan, 'but making them needs real skill. Visit me at home and I'll show you how it's done.' I accepted his invitation. At his house, I drank cold milky tea and ate fish crackers in a big room. As it got dark, he asked me to come back the next day to help fix his kite, but I couldn't. Instead, I explored the southern part of the state, driving towards Kuala Lumpur, into mountains with thick rainforest. I took a wrong turn, and the road ended at a river. A boat was there to take people across. Nearby, a small sign said: 'Jelawang Jungle 3 km.' Before starting, I didn't know that most of the path was uphill, steep, and slippery. When I reached the track, I found a man with a flask of tea. This was Baba, who took care of a tented kitchen and some bamboo huts. I decided to stay there, trying not to think about insects under my thin mattress. The night was very dark, full of sounds. A waterfall roared nearby, and many creatures moved and made noises. In the morning, there was a great view of green mountains. In the afternoon, it rained. First, the wind blew, then lightning hit the treetops. Soon, I was soaked. Sliding downhill, I wondered how the big butterflies avoided the rain. I also worried about my car being washed away and the chance of drowning if I opened my mouth. Luckily, the car was still there, covered in mud, at the bottom of the track. In Kota Bahru, Kelantan's capital, people asked me questions: 'Where are you from?' 'How old are you?' But they were very friendly. Kelantan is famous for its kites, but I remember it more for its kind people.'"

PET_21,B1,"'MONEY What is money? Money is like a gram or a kilometre. But you can use money to buy things. For example, with five pounds, you can buy a book, a big bag of sweets, or two cinema tickets. The five-pound note is just a piece of paper that is cheap to make. Long ago, people did not have money like we do now. There were no banks or shops. Mr. Green, the farmer, would trade his corn for Mr. Hive's honey. This was a trade between two people who had things the other wanted. Over time, people made their own 'currencies' to trade more easily. These currencies joined together, so now everyone uses a national currency.'"

PET_3,B1,"'THE FIRST WOMAN SCIENTIST
Hypatia was born in Alexandria, Egypt, in 370 A.D. She was the first woman scientist to be in history books for many years. Hypatia's father was the director of Alexandria University. He made sure Hypatia got the best education. This was special because most women did not have many chances to study at that time. 
Hypatia studied in Athens and Rome. Then she went back to Alexandria and started teaching mathematics. She became famous for her new ideas. We do not have her books now, but we know she wrote important math books. Hypatia also liked technology and made some scientific tools for her work.
At that time, many rulers were scared of science, and people who worked in science were in danger. In March 415, Hypatia was attacked on the street and killed.'"

PET_27,B1,"Grass
Grass is one of the most successful plants in the world. There are more than 9,000 different kinds of grass, and you can find them everywhere on Earth. Grass is the only flowering plant that can live in the very cold places like the Arctic and the Antarctic. Many animals live in grasslands, from small insects and birds to big animals like cows and lions. All these animals need grass in some way. Grass grows back quickly after it is cut or hurt. Unlike other plants, new grass leaves grow from below the ground, not from the top. This is why many animals can live in one place. When they eat all the grass, new grass starts to grow again, so they always have food."
PET_44,B1,"Kal Kaur Rai is very interested in fashion. She just won the Young Achiever of the Year award at the Asian Business Awards. Since she was a child, Kal liked drawing clothes and making patterns. Her parents own a supermarket, and she never told them she wanted to make fashion her job. She thought they wanted her to work in a more traditional business, so she studied management at university. After university, she moved to London and worked in an advertising agency. She had to go to events but couldn't buy expensive clothes, so she made her own skirts and tops. Her friends liked her clothes and asked her to make some for them too. A small shop in London agreed to sell her clothes. They sold very well, and nothing was returned. This made Kal confident, so she left her job, took a PS20,000 loan, and started her own women's clothing brand. Kal's parents were not upset about her new career and said they would support her, which made her happy. Now, her clothes are sold in over 70 stores, and her business makes more than PS500,000. Her clothes are in fashion magazines, she designs for pop stars, and she just won an award. Kal feels very lucky. She says, ""What I do is my hobby - and I get paid for it!

The hotel is on a main road that goes to the town center. It takes about 20 minutes by bus to get to the center. Buses to other parts of the town stop outside the hotel. Do not take buses with the blue sign ""Express"" because they do not stop near the hotel. There is an underground station less than 100 meters away.
The main building has 200 single rooms. Each room has hot and cold water. Showers, baths, and toilets are at the end of the corridors. The hotel has a shop, sitting rooms, four TV rooms, a table tennis room, a library, and a laundry. There are also eight pianos for guests to use. You can park your car at the hotel. Free newspapers are available, and you can buy stamps at the office.
Guests staying for a long time must pay weekly in advance. You need to give one week's notice before leaving. Both short-term and long-term guests are welcome, but long-term guests get rooms first.
Meal times are: breakfast from 7 am to 9:30 am, lunch from 1 pm to 2 pm, and dinner from 5:30 pm to 7 pm. During the week, if you study or work late, you can ask for dinner until 11 pm by writing your name on the late list or calling before 7 pm. There are 10 menu choices for breakfast and dinner.
No animals or fires are allowed. Please keep noise down, especially between 11 pm and 8 am. If you arrive by train, it is best to take a taxi to the hotel because it is far from the main railway station."

PET_49,B1,"'The Ghan Train Mark Ottaway traveled by train from Darwin, in the north of Australia, to Adelaide, in the south. The Ghan train goes across Australia, from the warm north to the colder south. It is often called the 'famous Ghan', but it is known for being late. People wanted a train from Darwin to Adelaide since the 1920s. They built a line from Adelaide to Alice Springs, but there was often flooding. A new line was finished a few months before my trip. The train can go up to 115 kph, but it is not a fast train. There are few stops, and most passengers are on holiday. The Ghan is not a luxury train like the Orient Express, but the food is very good. The railway was first built to carry goods, not people. It was thought that sending goods from Europe to Australia's south through Darwin and the train would save time and money. The Ghan says it is the world's first north-south railway. As I waited to get on the Ghan, I saw that everyone was excited. Most of the travelers were older Australians. Our first stop was at Katherine, where the train waited for four hours. Some people got off and took a boat trip. I left the train at Alice Springs and went on a two-day trip to Uluru (Ayers Rock) with a small group and a guide. Climbing the rock is not encouraged now, so we just walked around it and watched the sunset. From Alice Springs, there are two trains a week going south, so many people stop here. After Alice Springs, the view from the train is not very interesting. There is a lot of flat land with cattle. On the third day, at dawn, we reached the hills near the Southern Ocean. My journey was over. The train might not have been as good as the advertisements said, but it took me to some of the most amazing places in Australia.'"
PET_31,B1,"'Climbing to the top of Britain Every year, many people climb Ben Nevis in Scotland. Because it is in the north, the weather can be very cold. Climber Keith Hewitt talks about his first time on Ben Nevis. It was February, my first big winter climb. We went up the north side of the mountain to Tower Ridge. It is 600 meters high - maybe the longest climb in Britain. We planned to camp for three days in the 'Carries', which are like big bowls in the mountain walls halfway up. We carried tents, sleeping bags, and metal spikes for our boots. You need them because the snow is very hard, like ice. Even though some people in our group were very experienced, we took all kinds of safety equipment, like lights to get attention, hard hats, and extra clothes. The weather forecast was good, with no strong winds, but we still felt nervous when we started. Ben Nevis in winter is always difficult. The path soon went up, and my legs felt tired. I was the weakest in the group, so I had to rest more often. The others sometimes stopped to let me catch up, but when I reached them, they started again. I promised myself to train better before a climb next time. After 200 meters, we reached the start of Tower Ridge, the path to the top of Ben Nevis. It is only one and a half meters wide, and the mountain drops hundreds of meters on each side. We knew we had to stay calm and focus on every step as we moved slowly. After seven hours, we reached the top. On a clear day, you can see the sea and the island of Skye, 48 kilometers away. But we were not lucky because there was mist. On Ben Nevis, going back down to camp can be as hard as going up. You need to read a map well because a wrong turn could lead to dangerous slopes in winter. I was happy we took turns to do that job. That first time, I only felt happy when I was safe in the tent. But at least I made it to the top.'"
PET_58,B1,"Anna's New School
This week has been very exciting because we moved to our new school building! The building is amazing. It is made of wood, like our old school, but it is also very good for the environment. It took a long time to build, and we watched it happen. It was exciting to see the builders work, but some nice open land is gone now. The building machines were very loud, and sometimes the builders had to stop because of the rain. We thought the building would never be finished.
Now, we have five big classrooms. They are much bigger than the ones in our old school, which was very old. We also have a room that people in the town can use for meetings. There is a nursery, a nice dining room, and big changing rooms. We will use them when our new sports field is ready.
When you come into the school, you will see there are no heaters! The heat comes from us - the children, the teachers, and the computers. The building keeps all the heat and sound inside. When we sing, it sounds like we are in a concert hall!
Another interesting thing is the tree on the roof! The builders put it there because it is a custom in Austria, where the roof was made. The electricity for lights and computers comes from a wind turbine on a hill behind the school. We visited it with our teacher yesterday. It moves very fast and is so big you can see it from far away! We took pictures to put on our website.
Even though we are using the new school, some parts are not finished yet. For example, we are doing a play for parents, but we have to go back to our old school hall for it. The new hall will be ready next year. We are very happy with our new school, and our teachers say we will learn faster here!"

Now, I looked down at the river far below me and understood why people love rock climbing. My friend Matt and I arrived at the Activity Centre on Friday evening. The place to stay wasn't great, but we had everything we needed: beds, blankets, and food. We were happy to be out of the city and in the fresh air. On Saturday morning, we met the other ten people in our group. Cameron came with two friends, Kevin and Simon, and sisters Carole and Lynn came with Amanda. We all came from different places, and none of us knew the area. We knew we would spend the weekend outside, but we didn't know exactly what we would do. Half of us went caving in the morning while the others went rock climbing, and then we switched at lunchtime. Matt and I went to the caves first. Climbing out was harder than going in, but after a lot of pushing, we finally got out. We were covered in mud but happy and excited about what we did.'"

This makes sharks dangerous for smaller sea animals that they eat. Sharks are like other fish in some ways, but their bodies are different. For example, most sharks need to swim all the time to breathe and stay alive, so they almost never sleep. Also, if you turn a shark over on its back, it can stop moving. This helps scientists who study sharks. It lets them learn more about these interesting animals.'"

My Russian is much better, and I understand my teachers. 
For the first two weeks, my mum stayed with me. When she left, I was a bit sad. One night, I called home because I felt lonely. The classes in Russia are harder than in England. I eat a lot to have enough energy. This helps me perform well. In the evenings, I watch my favorite films on my computer, but sometimes I fall asleep before the film ends. Now, I feel at home here. I like walking around the city and visiting shops, even in December when it was very cold.

PET_55,B1,"'THE ICEHOTEL For many years, people liked to visit the Arctic in the summer to see the midnight sun. But in winter, only a few people lived there with the snow and ice. In the late 1980s, people thought the cold winter could be a good thing. In the winter of 1990, a French artist named Jannot Derit had an art show in a special igloo (a house made of snow) in a small town called Jukkasjarvi on the frozen Torne River. This place, called Arctic Hall, brought many visitors. One night, some visitors decided to sleep in the Arctic Hall. The next morning, they were happy with their night, and the idea of an ice hotel started. Today, the ICEHOTEL is famous around the world. When winter starts, snow builders, architects, and artists from everywhere come to Jukkasjarvi to build the hotel for that year. When one part is ready, it opens to visitors and guests, while other parts are still being built. The first part is ready in December, and each week a new part opens until January 7th when the hotel is finished. The ICEHOTEL is built outside with natural winter materials, so the finish date can change because of the weather. In spring, when it gets warmer, the hotel melts. Inside the hotel, the temperature is always between -5°C and -8°C, even if it is colder outside. Warm clothes like overalls, hats, and gloves are included in the hotel stay. Guests should also bring sweaters, a scarf, and many wool socks. Shoes should be bigger than normal to fit thick socks. If you plan to visit, you can buy warm clothes and socks on the ICEHOTEL website. You can order these when you book your visit, and they will be in your room when you arrive. The hotel is in Jukkasjarvi, 200 km above the Arctic Circle, but only 15 km from Kiruna airport and 17 km from Kiruna train station. You can take a bus from the airport or train station to the ICEHOTEL.'"

There were many special offers, like a leather sofa for £45 (only until 3 am) and a bed for £30 (only between 3 am and 8 am). The shop's normal hours will be 9 am to 9 pm every day. But Homestyle said it would stay open for 24 hours on the first day. However, it had to close in just half an hour. A police officer said: 'We knew many people would come, but they were not patient. The shop was full, so the managers closed the doors. People outside got angry because they thought everything would be sold before they could go in. They did not want to wait quietly. Also, many cars were trying to get to the car park. Some people left their cars in the road and walked to the shop. This blocked the road.' One customer, Jenny Smith, got into the shop. She said: 'I waited for three hours and didn't have time to buy what I wanted. But the staff were calm and explained the situation. It wasn't safe, so they had to close. I will come back when they open again, but I don't want to wait in line again.'"

This time, she held her breath for over three and a half minutes. She was the first woman to break a man's world record in any sport. Fourteen safety divers watched her dive to make sure she was safe. Some people think free-diving is too dangerous, but Tanya says safety and training are very important. Tanya trains a lot.

Cartoon films can show many things. If you can draw it, you can make it move on the screen. New ideas and computer programs make cartoons fun for everyone again. In the late 1970s, people thought cartoons were only for kids. But then, some directors had new ideas. They showed that both adults and kids could enjoy cartoons. Not all cartoon films were good. For example, The Black Cauldron did not do well. It was too scary for kids and too simple for adults. Directors learned from this, and film companies started making a lot of money again."

I only acted at school before, but I loved the book since I was eleven. My grandmother said I was like Polly Finnegan, and I always wanted to play her. 
Before university, I took a year off to travel. When I was in Chile, my mother emailed me. She said they wanted to make the book into a TV show. I knew I had to try for the part. My mother was surprised, but she sent my photo to the director. She convinced him to meet me. I flew back and got the part. 
Filming started a week after university began, so I got permission to be away for three weeks. When I returned to university, I woke up at 6:00 am to write the essays I missed. I didn't tell my university friends, but they found out and thought it was great. It was an amazing experience, and I feel very lucky.

PET_30,B1,"HONEY
Honey is a sweet liquid made by bees. It has water and sugars. Bees travel very far, up to seventy-five thousand kilometers, and visit over two million flowers to make just half a kilo of honey. The color and taste of honey depend on the flowers the bees visit. There are more than three hundred types of honey. Lighter-colored honey usually tastes milder than darker honey.
In ancient times, honey was the main sweet food because sugar was very rare. Honey was very valuable to the ancient Egyptians, who used it as money. Today, honey is made and eaten all over the world. Research says it can help with tiredness and make athletes perform better. Honey is not just food - it can help with sore throats and is used in many skin and hair-care products."
PET_7,B1,"Norwich is a city in East Anglia, a part of Britain. People have lived there for more than two thousand years. It started as a small village by the River Wensum. By 1066, it was one of the largest towns in England. Norwich has two cathedrals and a mosque, making it a popular place for different religions. The first cathedral was built in 1095 and recently celebrated its 900th birthday. In 1994, Norwich celebrated 800 years since it became a city with a Royal Charter, which means it could govern itself.
Today, Norwich is smaller than cities like London or Manchester, with about 150,000 people. But in the 16th century, it was the second biggest city in England. It grew for 300 years and became rich, known for having many churches and pubs. Now, there are fewer churches and pubs, but in 1964, the University of East Anglia was built there. Norwich has many students and is a modern business center, especially for insurance services. The city has many entertainment options like theatres, cinemas, nightclubs, cafes, restaurants, and arts centers. Norwich also has a football team called 'The Canaries', with green and yellow colors.
A new shopping center called 'The Castle Mall' is a big attraction in Norwich. Builders made a large hole in the city for over two years to build it. They moved a lot of earth to make a park on the roof of the Mall, with water pools and trees. People in Norwich are happy that the old market is still there, next to the new shopping center. Both places are popular, showing that Norwich has a good mix of old and new things."
PET_43,B1,"The Albuquerque Balloon Festival
Every autumn, the sky above Albuquerque, a city in the south-western United States, becomes full of bright colors. This is because of the Albuquerque Balloon Festival, a nine-day event every year. The first festival was in 1972 to celebrate the 50th birthday of a local radio station. There were about twelve hot-air balloons, and they took off from a car park in the middle of Albuquerque. Now, the festival is much bigger. This year, at least a thousand balloons from many countries will be at the festival, which is now outside the city.
What to see
The pilots talk to each other by radio and light up their balloons at the same time. This is called a 'balloon glow' and is great for taking photos. You need to arrive just after it gets dark or before 5:30 am to see the balloons glow in the dark sky. During the day, you can walk around the balloons and talk to the pilots as they get ready to fly. The balloons are different sizes and colors, and some look like animals, cartoon characters, or famous products like soft drinks and fast food. Kids will really enjoy it.
In the afternoon, you can go on a balloon ride over the desert with one of the many companies offering flights. Another option is to take a cable car from the desert to the top of the nearby mountains. This is the longest cable car ride anywhere, and you can see the festival from above. There are many other things to do for visitors of all ages, like balloon races and fireworks on the first and last three nights of the festival.
The Albuquerque Box
This is a special wind pattern that is perfect for balloonists. The Sandia Mountains protect the balloons from strong winds and create gentle winds at different heights. This helps skilled pilots control where their balloons go by going up or down.
Practical advice
Buy your tickets online before you go to avoid long lines. Wear several layers of thin clothes. It can be cool at night and in the early morning, but during the day, you need sunglasses and sunscreen. Bring a flashlight for night events and, of course, bring your camera. If you use a film camera, you will need high-speed film for evening and night pictures."
PET_51,B1,"The Eden Project
The Eden Project is in the south-west of England. It is a very popular place for tourists to visit in the UK. When you first see it, the big 'biospheres' look like something from a science-fiction movie. Each biosphere has a different climate. This shows visitors how important the connection between people and plants is. It is surprising to see how many things we use every day come from plants, like wood, rubber, fruit, rice, sugar, coffee, and chocolate. There are over 135,000 different types of plants here. Even if it is cold outside, electric heaters keep the plants warm. In the Rainforest Zone, it is always wet because of a big waterfall. Another zone is like the environment in the Mediterranean, California, and South Africa. There are also plans to make a desert zone soon."
PET_11,B1,"'No Title Some people have said they don't like this year's book, New Writing 3, but I don't know why. It has 500 pages of new writing for only £6.99, which is great! Most of the book is fiction, with parts of novels and short stories. There are fun stories by famous writers like Candia McWilliam and Rose Tremain. It's interesting that the less famous writers mostly wrote about food. Be careful with Jane Harris's Those Nails - don't read it after eating because it has some scenes that might make you feel sick! There are also poems by nineteen poets, including R. S. Thomas and John Burnside. You can read parts of novels being written by Jim Crace and Jane Rogers. There is a little non-fiction too, like a funny article by Alan Rusbridger about newspapers and a special piece by Ursula Owen about herself. This is a great collection, and I am excited to see what next year's book will have.'"
PET_14,B1,"""The best age to start learning the violin is between three and six,"" says Margaret Porter, a violinist and music teacher. ""This is when you are learning about the world."" Margaret lives in London and likes to teach children who are three or four years old, but she also teaches some five-year-olds who are very interested. She started teaching the violin in 1972, and her first class was with her children's five-year-old friends. Margaret's students have group lessons. Each group has about twelve students, and each lesson is one hour long, every two weeks. Also, each student has one private lesson with her every week. Parents must come to the classes too. It is important for parents to be interested in the lessons. From the first lessons, students learn to play by listening. They do not try to read music until they have been playing for several years. For a long time, there is a big difference between how they play and how they read music. Margaret says her method is not meant to make great violinists. She suggests that students who do very well should leave and study the violin with more traditional methods."
PET_56,B1,"'Moonshine The band Moonshine released their third CD last week. 'Here Again' is the new CD after 'The Waves'. There are some changes since the last CD. Tom Wilcott is now playing bass guitar instead of Simon McVee, who left the band last year. Tom Simpson is the new drummer. The first song on the CD is a dance song, showing the band is not focusing on slow songs anymore. The second song is also a dance song and is even louder. Most of the other songs are in the band's usual slow style. These two dance songs will surprise many fans. They could become hit singles because they are very good. Singer Rob Letchford sings perfectly on these songs. Fans should be happy he recorded them before he had problems with his throat. Because of this, the band had to cancel their next tour. (People who bought tickets do not need to worry because all the concerts will be rescheduled when Rob is better.) On this CD, Moonshine shows they can make great music in different styles, from slow songs to ones that make you want to dance. I think the best songs are at the beginning, and the last few songs are not as good. Despite this, 'Here Again' will probably be a big hit and bring more success to the band.'"
PET_36,B1,"San Francisco
San Francisco is a city on the coast of northern California. The first Europeans to find the area were led by a Spanish explorer named Gaspar de Portola. He saw it for the first time in 1769. Even though San Francisco Bay is a great natural harbor, it was found by people traveling on land, not by sea. In 1849, many people came to San Francisco hoping to find gold. But it was not the gold seekers who became rich. The richest people made money by owning banks and law firms. They built big houses on a hill called Nob Hill. Today, tourists visit San Francisco to see famous places like Chinatown and the Golden Gate Bridge. Many also take a short boat trip to Alcatraz Island to see the old prison."

PET_33,B1,"'The History of Shoes In the past, people did not care if shoes were comfortable or fashionable. Early shoes were probably made from animal skins. People tied them around their ankles when it was cold. We still use leather today, but we also use other materials like silk, plastic, or cotton, depending on what is popular. About one hundred and fifty years ago, people started wearing different shoes on each foot. Before that, both shoes were straight and could be worn on either foot. All shoes used to be made by hand. Now, most shoes are made by machines in big factories. Sewing machines helped make many shoes quickly and cheaply for more people.'"

PET_40,B1,"'THE HISTORY OF THE IDITAROD - THE LAST GREAT RACE ON EARTH In the 1880s, people found gold in Alaska, the most northern state of the USA. Many people went there to find gold and become rich. New towns were built quickly. One town was called Iditarod, which means 'far, distant place'. In 1909, Iditarod grew very fast and became the largest city in Alaska for a short time. In summer, boats could bring important things to these towns. But in winter, the rivers and ocean froze, so boats could not travel. In 1910, a winter path was made for teams of dogs pulling sleds. They carried mail, food, and clothes to the gold miners. This path was called the Iditarod Trail. It took about three weeks for a team of dogs to travel across Alaska. They stopped at 'roadhouses' where the drivers could sleep and eat, and feed their dogs. The trail was used every winter until the 1920s when airplanes started to be used instead of boats and dog teams. But in 1925, the dogs were needed again when a disease called diphtheria hit the city of Nome. The medicine to cure the disease was in Anchorage, far away. Airplanes were new, and people were not sure if they could fly in the cold. Also, the best pilot, Carl Eielson, was not there. So, they decided to use dog teams to bring the medicine. The trip was over 1,000 kilometers, mostly on the Iditarod Trail. It took twenty teams six days to finish the journey. Leonhard Seppala, a man from Norway who came to Alaska for gold, traveled the first 400 kilometers. He trusted his dog Togo to find the way in the snow, and Togo was a good guide. The last part of the trip was done by Gunnar Kaasen, who had worked with dog teams in Alaska for 21 years. His lead dog was Balto. At one point, Balto stopped and saved the team from falling into icy water. The diphtheria was stopped, and Balto became a hero. Today, a dog sled race happens every year from Anchorage to Nome, following the 1925 journey. It is called the Iditarod and is known as 'The Last Great Race on Earth'.'"

But then the team we beat complained."" A local newspaper wrote about this, and a man named Jose Craveirinha, who helped other African athletes, heard about Maria. He went to see her and saw her playing football. He noticed she was very fast. ""He talked to me about running. I didn't know what he meant because I only knew football. Then he bought me running shoes and took me to train. It was very hard, and my legs hurt a lot.""
Jose talked to Maria's parents and told them she could be successful and help their family. They agreed to let her go with him to train. In 1991, Maria finally went to train in the United States. She didn't want to go before because she would miss her family. Her life was different from the girls she met in the US. She said, ""They were good athletes, but I worried about my parents having enough food, while they worried about dresses and make-up. They didn't know much about me or my problems. But I knew I was lucky to be there. The trainers were great, and I learned a lot.""

We have a great jazz band at my school, but not everyone can join. Only about half of the people who want to play get in. But anyone who wants to play can come to jazz practice before school. We also spend time together after school, listening to jazz and learning about it. There are trips to jazz summer camps around the country. I've been to a few and learned a lot. Adults are often surprised that young people like jazz. My music teacher thinks it's because pop music is not hard enough for people like me who love music. I find jazz exciting because it is both new and old. You can make your own music, but you also feel part of its history, like the great jazz players before you.

We send these to big newspapers, magazines, TV, radio, and websites. If newspapers or TV and radio stations like our stories, you can read or listen to them on the Eight-eighteen website.
We have three places in the country where young people can meet and work on projects. We want to open more places soon. Our news group started in 1994 and was called 'Young News' then. More than 2,500 young people have been members. Sophie was one of them. She says: 'I first heard about Eight-eighteen when they talked to me for an article about young people's thoughts on hip hop music. I was surprised by the chances they had. Age didn't matter; they could do stories by themselves. I went to the Eight-eighteen center in my city, got some training, and stayed a member until I was 18. Eight-eighteen helped me do more than I thought I could. With the skills I learned, I got a job at 19. Now, I am the youngest worker at a big news website, checking articles before they go online.'
Get involved at every level
When you join Eight-eighteen, you will get training and join monthly meetings to decide who will write each news story. Eight-eighteen helps members share skills. 'Peer trainers' are members who are 12 years old and older. They teach new members basic journalism skills. As they get better, some members give talks to young people and adults outside Eight-eighteen, like in youth clubs and summer camps. Older staff always help these young trainers on trips.

PET_5,B1,"'Winter Driving Winter can be dangerous because it is hard to know what will happen, and accidents can happen easily. Fog can be at the top of a hill. Ice can be under the melting snow and can make you slide off the road. The car coming towards you might slide across the road. Rule Number One for driving on icy roads is to drive smoothly. Quick movements can make a car hard to control. So when you turn the wheel, touch the brakes, or speed up, do it gently and slowly. Imagine you have a full cup of hot coffee next to you. Drive so you don't spill it. Rule Number Two is to watch what might happen. The more ice there is, the further you need to look down the road. Test how long it takes to stop by braking gently. Remember, you might be driving faster than you think. In general, allow double your normal stopping distance when the road is wet, three times this distance on snow, and even more on ice. Try to stay in control of your car at all times to avoid trouble.'"

At art school, he found drawing classes hard, but he kept painting. When he was in his late twenties, the Italian government gave him money to study art in Italy. He liked early Italian artists, and you can see this in his work. He loved the green and brown colors of the Italian fields and the bright light there. He wanted to show this light in his paintings. He painted colors in thin layers, from light to dark, but he says he never knows how it will look in the end. He says, 'It's a secret - because I don't know myself. I don't start by painting yellow, knowing I'm going to put anything on top.' Aitchison makes it sound easy. 'Anyone can do the colors - you can buy them. I just notice what colors go next to each other.' He does not make drawings before he starts a painting because he thinks he might get bored and not finish the painting. Instead, he changes his paintings many times before they are done. He likes models who do not ask to see their pictures while he is painting them. 'If I feel they're worried and want to look at the painting, I can't do it.' Since he moved to London, he does not feel part of the Scottish painting scene. He says he does not want to follow any tradition, but just paints the way he can. However, his work still influences young British painters."

'Okay,' we said, 'but you must think about the rest of the family and the neighbors when you play.' That was just the start. Because drums are hard to move, the other members of Ben's band started coming to our home with their guitars and other equipment. So, for several hours a week, the house is full of the sound of their instruments and their singing. At least Ben's hobby has been good for our health: whenever the band starts playing, my husband and I go out for a long walk. And I must say that, although their music sounds a little strange, they are a friendly and polite group of young men. I cannot say if they are good musicians - after all, I didn't expect my parents to like the same music as I did when I was a teenager - but they do play regularly in local clubs for young people. Our main worry is that they won't spend enough time on their school work because of their music, though this hasn't happened yet. I always tell Ben how important his studies are.

PET_17,B1,"Atlantic College
Last week, I visited Atlantic College. It is a very good private school in Wales. This school is special because it helps young people learn about life outside the classroom. Students can also study for their exams there. The students are between 16 and 18 years old and come from all over the world. In the morning, they study. In the afternoon, they do useful activities. They might help on a farm, take care of people with learning difficulties, or check rivers for pollution.
Atlantic College students come from many different countries and social backgrounds. The school fees are PS20,000 for two years, but many students get help to pay. A quarter of the students are from Britain, and many of them get help from the government to attend.
Barbara Molenkamp, a student from the Netherlands, said, ""I really admire the college for trying to help young people understand each other."" She also said, ""You learn to live with people and respect them, even if you don't like them. During the summer holidays, my mother saw that I argued less with my sister.""
In conclusion, Atlantic College gives students a great education with methods that really work."

I felt sad because I thought I would stay in that job forever. I was jealous of the students at the local university. They looked happy and full of hope, and I wanted to be like them. Now that I am a student, it is hard to make friends with younger students. They often think I am a teacher and ask me questions I cannot answer. I also feel different from the teachers because, even though we are the same age, they know much more than I do. But I am happy to study because I know I need a qualification to get a good job, which is very important to me. Unlike most eighteen-year-olds, I like spending weekends with my books more than going to parties. There are also good things about being a student, like long holidays and discounts for theatre and cinema. I sometimes worry about what I will do after university, but I hope going back to school was a good decision.'"

In 1908, he made the first Ford Model 'T', which cost $825. Soon, he was selling 100 cars every day. By 1927, the Ford Motor Company was worth $700 million. Early Ford cars were simple and cheap, but this sometimes meant less choice. Henry Ford said about the Model T, ""You can have any color you like, as long as it's black."""
