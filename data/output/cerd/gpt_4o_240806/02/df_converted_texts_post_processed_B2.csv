CPE_15,C2,"Charging families for each bag of rubbish they produce seems like a good idea for the environment and economy, but it might not be. In many developed countries, rubbish collection is a common service. Rubbish bags or bins are collected by special trucks and taken to a landfill. Economists find this service strange because it is usually free. Households pay for it through local taxes, but a family that throws away a lot of rubbish pays the same as a couple that throws away very little. However, the cost of disposing of rubbish is not zero. More rubbish means more collectors and trucks are needed, and local authorities have to pay more for landfill fees. This is a basic economic problem: if rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish. The obvious solution is to make households pay for the amount of rubbish they throw away. This would encourage them to throw out less and recycle more, assuming there are places to recycle. 
However, two American economists, Don Fullerton and Thomas Kinnaman, found that this approach can have complicated and sometimes disappointing results. They studied several American towns and cities that started charging households for rubbish. The most common system is to sell stickers or tags that people attach to rubbish bags or cans. Only bags with these labels are collected. In a study of Charlottesville, Virginia, where residents were charged 80 cents per bag, the number of bags fell by 37%. But this was mainly because people packed more rubbish into each bag, a method called the 'Seattle stomp'. The weight of rubbish collected fell by only 14%. In other Virginian cities without this pricing, it fell by 3.5% anyway. Some people also resorted to illegal dumping to avoid paying. 
One positive outcome was a 15% increase in recycling, as people chose to recycle for free rather than pay for rubbish collection. However, this might not be due to the fee, as many were already recycling voluntarily. In a broader study, Fullerton and Kinnaman found that pricing does reduce rubbish weight, but not by much. A 10% increase in sticker prices only reduces rubbish by 0.3%. This is because to significantly reduce rubbish, people would need to buy less of almost everything, and a small fee is unlikely to change that. Other factors like income and education might be just as important. In richer towns, people throw out more rubbish and have less time to recycle. 
So, should we stop charging for rubbish? Not necessarily. Free disposal is too cheap, but simple policies can have complex effects. Detailed economic models are needed to understand them, and sometimes the results are not as expected."
CPE_19,C2,"Theodore Zeldin explores how our work life might change. Do you feel respected and appreciated at work? Just having a successful career is not enough anymore. Many professions feel undervalued, and even famous people can feel bitter. Loving your job used to be special, but now you need to think about how your job affects you as a person, your mind, character, and relationships. This is important because if your skills make you boring or unable to talk to people outside your field, or if you're too busy to gain wisdom or use your imagination, then no amount of status or money will make up for being unfulfilled as a person.
Zeldin wants to find out how work can help us achieve personal fulfillment, rather than just shaping us to fit industrial needs. Work should not only create wealth but also be a meaningful way of life, helping us discover new talents and meet different people. However, this doesn't mean getting rid of unemployment is the only goal. As people become more educated, they want jobs that are interesting and useful. A career should be like a work of art, with a fulfilled person at its center.
Even middle-class jobs are not as appealing as they used to be. Doctors are often more stressed than their patients, accountants worry about ethics, architects rarely use their creativity, and administrators are stuck in bureaucracy. Middle managers are losing confidence in their roles. Companies and public institutions are getting smaller, and ideas like decentralizing decisions and rewarding performance haven't made employees more committed. In Britain, only 8% of employees strongly feel their values match their organization's values.
Zeldin is studying different jobs to see how they shape or harm people. He looks at how different cultures have expanded what humans can do and how courage can be developed. He applies this to important topics like happiness, love, friendship, and respect. Now, he is focusing on finding more satisfying ways to work. Many experts work on extending the life and income of companies, but we also need to evaluate ourselves as people and decide who we want to spend our lives with. How many of us feel truly alive at work? How many are like part-time slaves, stuck in jobs because we see no other choice?
Take hotel workers, for example. They make up 10% of the workforce in the hospitality industry. Many smart and lively people work in hotels with low prestige, low pay, and long hours because hotels haven't changed much since the days of the Ritz. A hotel is more than a place to sleep; it's like a mini United Nations where people from all over the world meet but often don't interact. Many hotel staff are foreigners eager to learn new languages and cultures, but they have shallow interactions with guests. Hotels could be cultural centers, connecting guests with the city and each other. They could use the skills of the students they hire, instead of just giving them basic tasks. If hotels focused on their staff's ambitions, they could offer more services. But accountants often say businesses should focus on one main activity to maximize profits. It's time to rethink this from a human perspective, not just a financial one.
For Zeldin, work is about relationships. As people want more independence and don't just want to follow orders, they should have the chance to design their own jobs and choose their colleagues and customers, within practical and profitable limits. This means they need to communicate beyond professional jargon and connect with people who might seem different at first. Everyone knows communication is important, but it's different from conversation. The new kind of conversation people miss today is more personal and creates respect between people. It's a way to understand others deeply and be changed by the experience. It's more than just relaxing; it's a way to create equality. Every meaningful conversation changes the world a little bit."
CPE_24,C2,"**Broadcasting: The Social Shaping of a Technology**
The word 'broadcasting' originally meant spreading seeds widely by hand. This idea is not just about farming; it also represents the optimistic growth of modern society. It suggests spreading information widely, like seeds, to produce a rich outcome if conditions are right. This metaphor assumes there is a central source of information, like a bucket of seeds, ready to be shared and reproduced.
The question is why a new technology that could send words and pictures electronically was organized in a way that fit this farming metaphor. Television, like the telegraph and telephone, is a form of communication. However, from the start, it was seen as a central 'mass' medium. Sending broadcasts from a central place to private homes matched the social and economic structures of modern societies. Other ways of organizing television were tried but remained just experiments.
Two lesser-known alternatives show what television could have been in a different social setting. In the early 1930s, radio enthusiasts in Britain experimented with two-way television as a possible replacement for the telephone. Magazines like Radio News published articles on building TV transmitters and receivers, and many amateurs were active. However, in 1938, the British Radio Manufacturers Association set standards that pushed these grassroots efforts aside. This ended the chance for television to develop as a widespread, equal form of communication in Britain.
Broadcasting was linked to strong economic interests and the deep structures of modern societies. Despite the efforts of TV amateurs, television in the USA in the early 1930s was mainly a medium for public viewing, often seen as a competitor to the film industry. In Britain and Germany, public viewing was how most people first experienced television. While grassroots, two-way television was unlikely to succeed, public viewing systems in several countries in the 1930s could have challenged the idea of TV as a home-based medium. But this challenge did not happen.
Manufacturers saw the potential for mass sales of home TV sets once prices dropped. With the division between public and private life in modern society, central broadcasting to homes was the most suitable way to organize TV. As working-class people improved their living standards and joined consumer society from the 1920s, the dream of the home as a center for entertainment became possible for many in Western countries. This trend is now happening globally.
There is a link between social modernization and the main structures of broadcasting. As societies modernized, power and capital became more centralized, and traditional communities broke up, creating new ways of life. People became more mobile, both socially and geographically, leading to more isolated lives compared to stable early communities. Centralized broadcasting helped governments reach all citizens with important information and created a sense of national community.
Broadcasting became the dominant form of radio and television because of these structured processes and interests. However, broadcasting also played a positive role in democracy. Between the World Wars, many countries saw broadcasting as a way to ensure equal access to information needed for informed participation in political, social, and cultural life.
Television is changing, and the term 'broadcasting' might become outdated. If that happens, this metaphor will be seen as describing a specific way of organizing audio-visual technology during a certain phase of social modernization."
CPE_13,C2,"**Clutter**  
Sometimes, it feels like no matter how many things you own, you never feel safe. It's normal to want a home that meets your needs, but sometimes the desire to get more things goes too far. Modern advertising is made to make us feel insecure. It often tells us that if we don't have a certain product, we are not good enough. To see how much ads affect you, try not to read any billboards next time you walk down the street. These expensive ads influence us in strong ways without us noticing. We see them everywhere—on TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, T-shirts, the internet—all telling us to buy more.
**Caves**  
Research centers and universities around the world have spent years studying caves, focusing on their origins, water systems, and biology. Caves are a small but mysterious part of nature, which makes us curious and eager to learn more. This is why a lot of research has been done on them. In some parts of the world, caves have even affected how people live. However, exploring caves often requires physical skill, so cave research is not just done by professors. There is a unique mix of professional scientists and amateur explorers who study caves, often for fun.
**Weather Watch**  
Many people, using only their senses, laid the groundwork for meteorology, which has become a very technical science since the 17th century. Today, satellites and electronic tools give us weather information quickly, and computers solve complex math problems faster than humans can. Meteorological theory uses long words that can be hard to understand for non-experts. It might seem like there's no room for simple weather knowledge, but that's not true. Human experience is still important for turning data into weather forecasts. Observations from people can provide unique insights that help professionals understand the atmosphere better."
CPE_16,C2,"**Music and Theatre**
Until recently, I believed opera was mainly about theatre. But after working at a national opera house, I realized that music is the most important part of opera. This makes sense, but I come from the theatre world, where the spoken word and the actor are most important. In theatre, there is no one directing the action once the play starts, and the audience usually understands the language spoken by the actors.
In music performances, like concerts or operas, many people, including myself, may not have a deep understanding of music. Some might feel embarrassed about this, but most are amazed by the performers' skills. A talented singer or a perfect orchestra is easy to admire. Even a good musician shows the results of years of hard work. Watching a great music performance is like watching a sports event; we know athletes are doing something similar to what we do when running, but they do it much better.
Theatre audiences have different expectations. They often don't understand an actor's skill and aren't as impressed by something that seems like what they could do themselves. They don't usually applaud when an actor finishes a long speech, although they often ask, ""How do you learn all those lines?"" This doesn't mean theatre audiences are more generous or less demanding than music audiences. In fact, many people attend both. But in theatre, audiences and performers meet on more equal terms, no matter how challenging the play is.
The question is, should music learn from theatre about this relationship? I think yes, because a different approach can change the concert experience. Live music is naturally theatrical, full of emotion and drama, and can reach the listener's imagination. However, the formal traditions in music, like strict dress codes and high respect for conductors and soloists, can make the experience feel hierarchical. On the other hand, when audiences applaud between movements or after a great performance, it can disrupt the flow of the music, even if it's meant as appreciation.
Is there a solution? Yes, a lot is being done to attract new audiences to concerts and operas and to make serious music more accessible. I remember a special event, Jonathan Dove's community opera ""In Search of Angels,"" which moved from a cathedral to the town. It was a high-quality musical experience that involved the audience directly, changing many people's lives.
I wish music had more of the risk and boldness that theatre can have. Sometimes this comes from performing in unusual places, which can surprise both performers and audiences. It might be uncomfortable, with poor acoustics or cold temperatures, but theatre audiences have learned to follow artists into unexpected spaces. Most plays are performed in a traditional way, similar to concerts, but I believe music conventions can and should change.
I am just an enthusiast who loves theatre and music. I want both to succeed and for more people to enjoy them as much as I do."
CPE_21,C2,"**Sand**
While I admire how sand can be turned into useful things like glass and concrete, I don't really like it in its natural form. For me, sand is mostly an annoying obstacle between a car park by the sea and the water. It blows into your face, gets into your food, and hides important things like car keys and coins. When you're wet, sand sticks to you like glue and is hard to remove, even with a strong water spray. But strangely, as soon as you step onto a beach towel, get into a car, or walk on a clean carpet, it falls off you. For days, you keep finding sand on the floor every time you take off your shoes, and more comes out when you remove your socks. Sand stays with you longer than some illnesses. Personally, I can do without sand.
**Lock and Key**
The need for a safe home, privacy, and security has been around since humans first built permanent homes. The simple wooden bar behind the door has been replaced by electronic locks that use a plastic card with countless combinations, but the desire to keep out intruders is still strong. The attraction of a lock and key is partly psychological. Recently, some companies have tried computerized locking systems, where smart cards control electronic locks. However, people don't like them much. You might accept them at work, but at home, everyone prefers the comfort of turning a real key in a lock. So, when one locksmith company created a new electronic system, they made sure to include a real metal key in the design.
**Modern Art**
I was nervous about visiting the new Tate Modern gallery because, like many people, I find modern art confusing. I know I like some of it, especially furry things, neon light sculptures, and large photographs. Maybe if I knew more about it, I would have opinions on more pieces. But you're not supposed to analyze it like a school essay. The idea is to let art speak to you. This is a great idea, but it never worked for me. However, this new gallery tries to help visitors understand the reasons behind the artworks. The first thing I noticed were the labels, which explained the context and meaning of the art. Instead of just staring at the pictures without understanding, these bits of information helped me get what the art was about."
CPE_46,C2,"**Every Picture Tells a Story**
When novels are turned into films, the story often needs to be shortened and simplified. This can be frustrating for the writer, but it can also be enlightening. While working on a script, I noticed that much of the dialogue and description in a novel can be left out, yet the main point still comes across. This doesn't mean the original text was unnecessary. It's about how each medium—books and films—engages the audience differently and uses repetition in its own way. In novels, repetition helps readers remember character traits and who is speaking. In plays, dialogue often mimics real speech, sometimes using a lot of unnecessary words just to keep the conversation going, which can make it hard to understand what's really being said.
**Watching Movies**
Watching movies can be an immersive experience, making you feel like you're part of the film's world. For the duration of the movie, you escape from reality. However, once the movie ends and the lights come on, you're back in the real world. In the past, movies were often seen as just entertainment, not art. Many people, including our parents and teachers, thought movies were not serious or artistic.
**The Film Studios**
The Leiper Film Company studios were a mix of different buildings, making it hard to navigate. There were a few permanent landmarks, like the Script Department, but many rooms looked the same and were hard to find. The studio had three main entrances, all similar, and none had a place to ask for directions. This made it confusing for newcomers, but most people who worked there knew their way around. The studio's work brought romance and adventure to audiences, helping them escape from everyday life for a few hours.
**Film-makers**
Many people dream of making movies. Bookstores are full of guides on scriptwriting and film production, and universities offer courses on the subject. Competitions offer cameras like the one Robert Rodriguez used to make his film El Mariachi, which cost $7,000 and made him a well-known director. Rodriguez achieved his dream early, making his breakthrough film by age 23. In the past, filmmakers took longer to succeed. They often started as editors, writers, or cinematographers, learning their craft before directing. John Huston was 35 when he made his first film, and Fred Zinnemann found success in his forties. Today, without the support of studios, aspiring filmmakers often have to be independent and resourceful."
CPE_3,C2,"In those days, the council houses covered the western side of the city. They were rows of crowded, dull homes made of orange half-brick or pale white stucco. In the summer, chemicals from the May and Baker factory, two miles away, would fill the air with a strong sulfur smell. The most common sight in that part of Norwich early in the morning was a paperboy wrinkling his nose in disgust as he walked up to someone's front door. 
Most of my early life is a blur, but I do remember sitting, or maybe balancing, near an upstairs window, watching the houses fade into the distance. Later, I have memories of faces I can't name, my mother ironing towels in a house that might not have been ours, and snow falling over the turrets of a big mansion at Earlham. My mother often appears in these early memories. I remember her as a small, precise, and often angry woman. I never understood why she was angry, so I couldn't do anything to make her happy. Even as a child, when I went with her to the small shops in Bunnett Square or on longer trips into the city, I sensed that she was a bit unusual. She was the most solitary person I have ever known, as alone in a room full of people as she would be on a moor. She also had a strict sense of propriety, which was rare on the West Earlham estate. This sometimes led to intense cleaning or handwashing and instructions to 'behave properly'. As a moral code, it was beyond my understanding, and even now, I'm not sure I get it. It meant not walking into neighbors' gardens or damaging their rose bushes, sitting quietly for long periods in the dining room with hands folded, listening to radio programs my mother liked, and many other rules.
Despite her solitude, my mother had a few friends. There was Mrs. Buddery, who was obsessed with the Royal Family, Mrs. Winall, who rarely spoke, and Mrs. Laband, who was livelier and somewhat disapproved of by the others. Later, I realized that this group was not great company. They often talked about bad legs, cold weather, and ungrateful children, a category I often felt I was in. Looking back, it felt like a heavy weight of the West Earlham houses, my mother and her friends, and the need to 'behave properly' was on my shoulders, and I needed to grow up to lift it off. This was not easy. Growing up in West Earlham followed a set pattern. Until you were five, you stayed at home, often getting in your parents' way. I remember boring days when I was about four, playing on a rug while my mother sat coldly in an armchair. Then, after your fifth birthday, you went to Avenue Road infants school, half a mile away. Some lucky kids had a mother with a rickety bike and a child seat. I think my mother let other children in the street take me to school.
If I remember anything from those early years, it's the summer holidays. Those were the days when you got glimpses of the world outside West Earlham. There was an old man next to Mrs. Buddery who told stories about his time in the Merchant Navy. Once, there was a charity fete at a house far away on Christchurch Road, where a kind woman gave out lemonade and tried to interest me in something called the League of Pity, a junior charity. But my mother dismissed it, saying the organizers just wanted money. My mother often talked about people having mercenary motives, and she had a deep contempt for politicians. If she thought about the House of Commons, she probably imagined it as a fancy post office where rich people opened letters full of money from a gullible public. I might be exaggerating, and I might be ignoring her good qualities and focusing on her flaws. But my mother didn't have much kindness; it seemed to have been taken from her. 
To be fair, my mother did care about my education. Sometimes on Sundays, she would take me, dressed in my 'good clothes', on the 85 bus to the Norwich Castle Museum. There, we would walk through rooms of paintings by the Norwich School of Artists. My mother wasn't completely against this activity and eventually started to have opinions on the art. I remember her once stopping in front of a painting of a Roman soldier and saying, 'Well, I wouldn't like to meet him on a dark night!' This was one of the few times I remember her trying to make a joke."
CPE_10,C2,"**Philadelphia Avenue**
I walked down the odd-numbered side of Philadelphia Avenue. The evening was getting darker, and the air was thick and humid, turning into a light drizzle. This made my walk feel secretive and sheltered. I knew this side of the street well since childhood. Our neighbors were the Matzes and the Pritchards, and there was Han Kieffer's grocery store. My first friends, all girls, lived in the Kring's and the Pottses' houses. Each house was familiar to me, just like the small channels in the cement that carried rainwater from the roofs to the street. As I moved down the street, I noticed that the houses seemed to change slightly in social status; the porches were closer to the ground, and the front yards were smaller. Over the years, some things had changed: wooden porch railings and pillars were replaced with wrought iron in a style that seemed Southern or Spanish. In Shillington, some houses I remembered as homes had become stores, and some stores, like Pep Conrad's and Han Kieffer's, had become homes again. I wondered how people lived in these spaces that used to be shops, with the lingering smells of merchandise.
**Bachelor Fads**
Rick Gilbert, a furniture designer, lives in a flat that used to be a curtain warehouse. It has typical loft features like exposed brickwork and large doors, which were used to bring in curtains from trains on the nearby railway. However, Gilbert didn't want an open-plan space because it was hard to separate work from home life. So, he used a large sheet of corrugated plastic to divide the space near the entrance. This created a hallway and directed attention to the kitchen in the middle of the flat. He wanted the kitchen to be a neutral area for both cooking for friends and making coffee for clients. To balance the modern look of the plastic and steel kitchen, he used light wood for the floors. His flat is filled with futuristic furniture, but also with sentimental pieces from his parents or bought from markets.
**Bruce Chatwin**
Bruce Chatwin's life was full of secrets and mysteries, making his nomadic lifestyle a topic of interest. Despite this, he was a brilliant and unique writer. His first book, ""In Patagonia,"" published in 1977, changed travel writing. It combined the excitement of a thriller, the charm of romantic fiction, and deep insights. Chatwin often mixed fact with fiction, changing details to make stories more interesting. His book suggested that through travel, one could discover entire histories that seemed to exist just to captivate future explorers.
**Swimming**
During a heavy summer rain in 1996, I ran across my lawn and took shelter in the pool. As I swam, I watched raindrops create small fountains and bubbles on the water's surface. The best moments were when the storm got stronger, silencing the birds, and a mist rose from the pool as if it was reaching for the sky. It was then that I thought of swimming across Britain, following the rain to the sea. I wanted to escape the routine of swimming laps and explore the wild, unmarked parts of the world. In a world where everything is labeled and explained, activities like walking, cycling, and swimming help us reconnect with nature. A swimming journey would let me explore the mysterious parts of our world, like dark woods or high mountains, that still hold secrets."
CPE_67,C2,"'CRYING Charles Darwin thought that humans cry for no clear evolutionary reason. He was probably wrong. Scientists now say crying has social importance. Psychiatrist John Bowlby said crying helps form a bond between mother and child. Many think tears in children show helplessness. But why adults cry is harder to understand. The sound of crying is less important than the visual signal it gives. In early human groups, crying might have helped build trust and social connections. Tears can also have other reasons. We might cry to show sympathy for people facing injustice. Sometimes, we cry without wanting to, like when we hear beautiful music or moving speeches. We might cry during a sentimental movie, especially when with others rather than alone. Crying clearly has a social role, but research is still ongoing.'"
CPE_27,C2,"**The Heat is On**
We all know about global warming, but how much warmer will the Earth get, and how will it affect us? Many people have an idea of what global warming is, but its exact consequences are unclear. A warmer climate will likely change the weather everywhere. Since the atmosphere is connected to everything on Earth, changes in climate will impact plants, animals, water, and soil. Humans rely on these natural resources to produce food, build cities, and support billions of people. Any changes to these resources are important.
The challenge is understanding how the world will change and what causes these changes. Over the last 100 years, human activities have increased the levels of certain gases in the atmosphere, which are linked to global temperatures. These gases are likely affecting the climate, but our limited understanding of the global heat balance makes the future uncertain. We do know that greenhouse gas levels and global temperatures have changed together over the past 40,000 years, suggesting a strong connection.
Research shows that Earth's surface has warmed by about 0.6°C over the past century. Most scientists believe this warming is not natural and is partly due to human pollution. To predict future conditions, scientists use computer models called general circulation models (GCMs). These models use physics and chemistry to analyze climate factors like temperature and solar radiation. However, they are simplified versions of reality and have limitations. Despite these challenges, most agree that climate change will happen faster than before.
GCMs predict that by 2100, the average global temperature could rise by 1°C to 3.5°C, sea levels could rise by 15-95 cm, and precipitation patterns could change. Extreme weather events like heatwaves, floods, and droughts may become more common. These changes could impact ecosystems, such as forests and grasslands, and the resources we depend on, like food and water. Some effects might be irreversible and harmful, but not all changes will be negative. For example, in Australia, warmer temperatures have increased wheat yields by reducing frost damage.
However, many predicted effects of climate warming are not beneficial. Small climate changes can affect water availability, especially in dry regions or areas with existing shortages. The Mediterranean Basin is already experiencing less rainfall and changes in seasonal patterns. Glacial processes may also change, affecting ice and wildlife habitats. The Arctic ice cover might melt completely, which could help marine transport but increase iceberg risks.
The most noticeable effect of global warming could be rising sea levels, caused by warmer water expanding and melting ice. With about half of the world's population living in coastal areas, rising sea levels could lead to severe consequences, like flooding in cities such as London, New York, and Tokyo. Many people could lose their homes, creating environmental refugees. Small island nations are at risk of disappearing entirely if worst-case scenarios occur, which would be devastating for their people and cultures."
CPE_66,C2,"'Mission to Mars Wanted: a middle-aged, married couple for a 501-day round trip to Mars. Applicants must be strong both physically and emotionally. This will be the profile of the first astronauts to go to Mars if multi-millionaire Dennis Tito's plans to launch a capsule on 5 January 2018 are successful. The capsule will take the crew to about 160 km above Mars. The spacecraft will use Mars's gravity to return to Earth without using more fuel, as saving fuel is very important. The 2018 date is set because the next time Mars and Earth are in the right position for a launch is in 2031. It's a big challenge, but the race is on to create systems with completely new technologies. If these can be developed quickly enough, the spacecraft might succeed. But even if it never leaves Earth, the efforts to reach these ambitious goals will still be valuable, as they will help future missions.'"
CPE_44,C2,"AESTHETICS
Sometimes, the very existence of art can make it hard to understand aesthetic theory. This is because art is often seen as just physical objects like buildings, books, paintings, or statues, separate from human experience. However, the true essence of art is what it does to our experiences. This misunderstanding can make it difficult to truly appreciate art.
Moreover, when art becomes famous and admired over time, it can create fixed ideas that block new insights. Once an art piece is considered a classic, it often gets disconnected from the human experiences and conditions that created it. This separation makes it hard to understand the deeper meaning of art, which is what aesthetic theory tries to explain. Art is often placed in a separate category, away from other human activities and achievements.
The main challenge for someone writing about the philosophy of art is to connect art back to everyday life. Just like mountains are part of the earth, art should be seen as part of human experience. To understand art, we need to look at the ordinary experiences that we don't usually consider as art. This means taking a different approach to understanding art.
For example, you can enjoy flowers without knowing about plant biology. But to understand how flowers grow, you need to learn about soil, air, water, and sunlight. Similarly, to understand art, we should start with everyday experiences that capture our attention and bring us joy.
Many people enjoy things like movies, jazz, and comic strips without thinking of them as art. This is because traditional art is often seen as something that belongs in museums and galleries. However, people naturally seek enjoyable experiences in their daily lives. Even those who criticize the idea of art being only in museums often still separate art from everyday life.
The best times for appreciating art are when it is closely connected to everyday activities. This is when people truly enjoy and value art the most."
CPE_22,C2,"**Observing Lions**
People often imagine lions hunting as a perfect team. In the evening light, a group of lions quietly moves and surrounds their prey, like skilled hunters. Lions seem to be very social animals, working together for a common goal, which is to catch their next meal. However, after many years of watching lions in the wild, we have a different view. When we began our research in 1978, we wanted to understand why lions hunt together, raise their cubs, and scare away rivals with loud roars. If an animal's success is measured by how many of its offspring survive, then working together might not always be beneficial. If an animal is too generous, others might benefit at its cost. So, why do lions cooperate? We thought we could find the answer in two to three years. But lions are very good at doing nothing. Like the noble gases krypton, argon, and neon, lions are inactive. It has taken many research methods to learn about their behavior. Since wild lions can live up to 18 years, we are only now starting to understand the answers to our questions.
**Pop Music Review**
The release of Bedrock's third album was a big moment for the band. ""New Life"" started a new trend in rock music in the country for the rest of the decade. The old style of serious and plain rock music was replaced by a lighter, more melodic style. The album mixed social observations with strong emotions, along with sounds of fairground organs and brass bands. Humor and irony were important, and the singers didn't hide their accents. Bedrock showed they were good at collecting and observing different styles and were clever songwriters. They sang about traditional English topics like sunbathing and Sunday afternoons. But the album's real strength was in its deep, gentle sadness in songs like ""So Low,"" a beautiful tune about weather, and ""To the Brink,"" a serious ballad. The beauty of ""New Life"" is its high quality - 16 tracks with no filler, which is rare in the era of long CDs.
**Extract from an Autobiography**
As a child, I was fascinated by stories of ""The Sibyl,"" wise women who had great influence in ancient times. I first heard about them in a story my mother told me. An old woman from Cumae offered nine books to Tarquin, King of Rome, for 300 gold pieces. He refused, so she burned three books and offered the remaining six for the same price. When he refused again, she burned three more books. He finally bought the last three for the full price. I understood that there was a deep truth in the story - a lesson in sales and life. I was sometimes a lonely only child. I would ask to play with other children and be refused. My mother told me to do something so interesting that other kids would want to join me. It worked, and it was a lesson I never forgot. When I had the chance to write a travel book, I looked for something I wanted to learn about, something relevant to my life. I'm not a big traveler, so I sent my editor a long list of places I didn't want to visit. I'm only interested in ruins because I like to travel in my mind through time.
**What Becomes of Your Manuscript?**
When you submit your manuscript, it usually ends up in a pile waiting to be sorted. This pile is called the ""slush pile."" The person sorting it is often a junior editor or an experienced freelancer who works part-time. They don't have much influence, but they want to find something original. The junior editor wants to make a name for themselves and find an author, while the freelancer wants to keep their job. If they think your novel is good, they will pass it to a senior editor, and it might be discussed at an acquisition meeting. The editor will need to justify accepting your novel based on its quality and potential sales. They will also consider if you, as an author, seem like a long-term prospect, which you will have assured them of in your letter. Another important factor is how promotable you are, as a new novel needs all the help it can get. Publishers often like to meet a potential author before making an offer."
CPE_39,C2,"**Advertising on Trial**
If you worked in an advertising agency in the early 1990s, it might have been a very challenging time for you. The economy was in a recession, which was worse than expected. In Britain, for example, the GDP went down in 1991, interest rates were very high, people spent less money, many lost their jobs, and many homes were taken back by banks. Every business was affected, especially the car and construction industries, which saw a 30% drop.
Advertising professionals were not the only ones losing jobs, but those who kept their jobs felt a lot of pressure. They were expected to help the company make money, and their work was closely watched by their bosses. They also had to do more with less money, as budgets were cut.
Despite these challenges, the importance of marketing was growing. Companies started to focus more on making products that customers wanted, rather than just what was easy for them to produce. This shift meant that marketing activities received more attention from management, and some brands started to be marketed more effectively. This increased the status of marketing professionals but also added to their responsibilities.
Marketing was often seen as a solution to all problems, and since about half of marketing budgets were spent on advertising, the pressure was on advertising professionals. The 1980s were a good time for advertising, but the early 1990s were tough. The recession made companies look closely at their advertising spending, and many questioned if it was worth the cost. They wanted to know exactly what they were getting for their money.
As a result, advertising was under scrutiny. Companies wanted better strategies, targeting, creativity, and media placement. They wanted the best people working hard to produce great work. This meant that advertising professionals had to find ways to do more with less, just like their clients.
Several factors made creating effective advertising difficult. Some were due to the recession, like debates over production costs and a reluctance to take risks. Other challenges were unrelated to the economy, such as demographic changes, the growing power of retailers, changing consumer needs, more sponsorships, stricter advertising laws, and the challenge of advertising in other countries.
These issues forced advertising professionals to reconsider the saying: ""Only half my advertising works. The trouble is I don't know which half."" There was more pressure than ever to make sure advertising was effective.
Unfortunately, help for improving advertising was not easy to find. Companies and agencies were too busy dealing with these challenges to share their strategies. Those who were successful often kept their methods secret. Conferences and seminars offered some help, but books on advertising were not very useful. They often treated advertising with too much respect, suggesting that all advertising work was of high quality and good value, which was not always true."
CPE_18,C2,"**The Lure of the Kitchen**
When I was at university, I decided I wanted to be a chef. This was an unusual choice among my peers. Cooking wasn't a popular career choice. On the surface, being a chef seems unattractive. Chefs work long hours, under pressure, doing basic tasks, and the pay is low. But these things didn't discourage me. I was unhappy at university. The studies were tough, and the social life felt closed and self-important. Being a chef seemed like the perfect escape from this. It offered a seriousness and honesty that I felt was missing in my college life. My desire to cook wasn't just a reaction to being a student. It also represented an artistic ideal for me. I first saw this ideal when I ate at a famous London restaurant. It was eye-opening. I still remember my starter clearly. After that meal, I wanted to thank the chef deeply. I felt happy and light for days. After this experience, I wanted to learn the secrets of this amazing art. I turned my student life into a preparation for entering the culinary world. My history degree felt empty, distracting me from my real passion. I learned about cooking by reading cookbooks, visiting markets and delicatessens, and making elaborate meals.
**The Swimming Instructor**
The school's swimming instructor was a former drill sergeant, small and muscular, with tattooed arms. When I asked him to teach me how to dive, he told me to sit on the pool's edge, put my hands above my head, and roll forward, pushing off with my feet. I practiced this move until the lesson ended. The next time, he had me stand up and dive off the edge. The instructor was strict, and every time I came up from the water, he criticized me: 'Don't look down, look up!' 'Keep your legs straight.' 'Point your toes!' The following week, I went up to the high diving board. It was fixed, and its front edge bent slightly downward. It seemed very high as I stood there, trying to gather my courage. Gradually, the echoing voices faded, and I felt like I was in silence. I moved my arms as I had been taught, tried to look up, not down, and jumped. For a brief moment, I felt like I was flying. When I hit the water, I fell awkwardly, and my legs were everywhere. The instructor looked at me with disapproval and shook his head. But even he couldn't take away my happiness. That's what they mean by 'free as a bird,' I thought.
**The Traveller**
For those of us who value a comfortable bed, running water, and the likelihood of living at least until tomorrow, the idea of a traveller is both confusing and fascinating. These are people who are drawn to the unknown, who choose to risk their lives by climbing dangerous, icy mountains; who sail alone in small boats through huge waves; who will eat insects if there's nothing better, and who can live for months in the uncertainty of the unknown. It's easy to see these people as odd - and they are - similar to hermits, freefall divers, or writers. They exist, but their strange, uncomfortable world is far from our everyday experience and can be dismissed as irrelevant. We can ignore them and return to our world of microwaves and answering machines, happy that the only risks we face are predictable ones, like crossing a busy street.
**Sailing**
Jonathan Raban is afraid of the sea, which is probably why he spends so much time on it. He doesn't claim to be a top sailor, but he is clearly competent. His main reason for sailing is that, as a writer, he likes to write about his sailing experiences. Sailing provides plenty of challenges and successes for him to write about. Raban's small boat has an electronic device that tells sailors their exact position anywhere on Earth. While he likes this tool, Raban has a somewhat old-fashioned view of other sailing aids. He believes the invention of the compass was a mistake, causing a 'break in the relationship between man and sea.' Raban argues that since the compass was invented, about a thousand years ago, sailors focus on it instead of studying the waves and feeling the sea. The ocean, once full of activity, is now just a space. Since the helmsman's job is just to keep a steady course, he can be replaced by an autopilot for long periods. This might be why Raban had time to observe the waves so closely."
CPE_62,C2,"**Holiday Reading**
Summer gives us two great joys: leaving home and reading books. These joys are closely linked. Books help us feel more connected to the world. We can relate our experiences to those in books from long ago or faraway places because there are fewer types of people than there are people. In books, we find our own thoughts and feelings. Authors can describe situations we thought were unique to us, or express our thoughts with clarity we can't achieve. What is unclear in us is clearly expressed in their words, especially if the book is from a different place or time. We feel thankful to these authors for helping us understand ourselves. Through reading and travel, we break free from routine. Our eyes are most open in a new place, or when reading a great book, which shows us things we ignored before. Our mind becomes aware of new details, like the sky's colors, a friend's hypocrisy, or a hidden sadness we didn't know we had.
**Author's Note**
These travel reflections were published in the Observer newspaper over seven years. I have restored some small cuts made by the editor, but added little else. I corrected a few mistakes, but only if they were important details. I could have made more changes, but that would never end. For example, in an article about China, I thought the Hong Kong dollar would stay strong, but it fell a year later. If I changed the article to predict this, it would not be a true report from that time. Like any traveler, I was there at that moment, unaware of the future, trying to understand what had already happened. This is the story of mass travel: the world opening up to people with no special skills, just a ticket. But I believe my fellow travelers are not blind. Even a postcard can have a purpose.
**Ecotourism**
If there were awards for overused tourism phrases, ""ecotourism"" would win. The term appeared in the early 1980s, as people became more aware of the environment. Tour operators realized travelers wanted to believe their trips wouldn't harm the environment. It quickly became a popular marketing term. Now, ""ecotourism"" includes anything from living with remote tribes for two weeks to a one-hour boat trip in Australia. Any tour involving culture, nature, wildlife, or adventure is labeled ecotourism. The original idea was to help people make informed choices, but without clear rules, many travelers are confused by the term.
**Transylvanian Journey**
I lost my notebook from my Transylvanian journey for 50 years, but found it by luck. It helped me remember that time, but not perfectly. In Transylvania, I had an easier time than expected, staying in welcoming homes for weeks. When I stopped moving, I stopped writing, thinking there was nothing to record. I was slow to start writing again, and sometimes only took notes instead of writing full stories. Worried that details might be out of order, I added warnings in my book. But then I realized this book is not a guidebook, so I let the story flow without too many warnings."
CPE_49,C2,"**Fashion**
Fashion is often thought of as a modern idea, linked to the growth of capitalism in the 1800s and 1900s. However, many fashion historians argue that fashion, in terms of style and design, has a long history. They often start with the rise of markets and trade in the 1500s and 1600s. As societies have become more complex, populations have grown, and new ways to make different types of clothing and accessories have been discovered, the meanings of clothing have also become more complex. Today, it is hard to say exactly what any piece of clothing or accessory means. For example, a man's suit, which seems very standard, can have different meanings in different situations and to different people.
**Writer**
Stories about publishers fighting over new manuscripts have given a false idea of what life is like for most novelists. For those of us not at the top of the best-seller lists, there are two ways to make a living. The smartest among us write in the evenings and have other full-time jobs that are secure even if the book doesn't become a hit. Others, like me, do various literary jobs, such as teaching, running workshops, and writing articles like this one. I've heard about writing jobs at a chocolate factory, but I've never gotten one. Somehow, by balancing part-time jobs, using credit cards, and often with help from the people mentioned in Acknowledgements, the novel gets written.
**Sudden Fame**
The small venues we were playing at across the country started to sell out, and extra security was needed to control the growing number of screaming fans. We had to use secret entrances to the places we performed to avoid being mobbed. On the few nights we weren't working, it was hard to leave the house without being chased by fans. In just a few days, we became celebrities. Our fans watched our every move, and our management and others took care of all our needs. Even though I was always shy, this was replaced by a strange confidence that only naturally shy people in similar situations can understand. In short, I was emotionally overwhelmed."
CPE_31,C2,"**Music - The Future Challenges**
Technology keeps changing how we live, work, and enjoy our free time. Susan Hallam talks about how this affects music in Britain. In the late 20th century, we had more ways to listen to music, like radio, TV, records, tapes, CDs, and videos. But, live music performances and full-time jobs for musicians have decreased. It's clear that more people will keep accessing music because it meets many human needs. Music is part of every big national event and offers many activities for individuals. A world without music is hard to imagine. The question is not if there will be music in the 21st century, but what kind of music it will be and if people will still want to learn musical instruments.
I believe people will still want to learn instruments. The music industry is a big part of Britain's economy, and musical skills will remain important for many jobs, especially in media. Besides job opportunities, playing an instrument can help develop skills early on. Research in the USA shows that listening to or making music can improve spatial reasoning, a part of intelligence. Although these results need more proof, studies in Europe show that group music lessons can improve social skills and concentration in children, including those with behavior issues. Further research is looking into how playing an instrument might help develop skills that can be used in other areas, like good study habits and organization.
In the short term, there will still be a demand for music lessons. But what about the long term? Will things change, and how? I think two things might happen. First, people will listen to more types of music, with new genres mixing different styles. Second, technology will be used more in composing and performing music, making it easier for people to create music without needing as much technical skill. This might reduce the need for live performances and musicians focused only on performing. At the same time, more people of all ages might want to make music themselves, often in community settings that reflect local musical traditions.
To prepare for this future, the music profession needs to change. Music lessons should help more people learn different instruments throughout their lives. This will change the music curriculum and how progress is measured, making it relevant to more people. Musicians will need to be trained to inspire and teach people of all ages, work with large and diverse groups, and have skills in communication, social interaction, entrepreneurship, and management for community work. This is a big change from traditional methods and will require accountability to the public. Positively, this is a chance for music educators to show the quality of music teaching available.
Finally, we need to raise the importance of music in our lives. Music is crucial but often overlooked. Everyone in the music profession should work together to change this."
CPE_58,C2,"**The Actor's Craft**
Actors sometimes face criticism and disrespect. This often happens when they talk about their work in interviews, which can lead to clichés or gossip. They could learn from dancer Pavlova, who said, ""If I could tell you, I wouldn't dance it,"" when asked about her dancing. Paul Scofield, a famous actor, once wrote that acting only has life when performed. Discussing it makes it seem empty and theoretical. Acting has no strict rules, except maybe being heard clearly. With each new play, actors start fresh, learning and growing with the characters and the writer's insights. After a play ends, actors feel empty until the next project. This emptiness is noticeable when discussing theatre work.
**A Review of Hamlet**
Adrian Lester's performance as Hamlet is a mix of youth and maturity, showing simplicity and confidence. His control over the text and his actions make him a standout actor. Lester plays a tense young man with hidden anger, using sharp wit and humor that make him both intimidating and likable. His performance is skillful, even if understated. Watch how his body seems ready to come alive. Similarly, Handy's portrayal of Horatio shows a body moved by an inner force. This raises questions about acting and behavior: Is acting just copying real life, or is it something more? What drives these performances, both morally and physically? This is a key question in theatre.
**One Director's Approach to Rehearsal**
This director starts rehearsals with a method called ""dropping in."" The stage manager projects the script on a screen. Actors listen quietly to others, noticing the effect of the words. When it's their turn, they read a line, think about its meaning, and wait for the impulse to speak. For example, with the line ""Queuing all night, the rain, do you remember?"" they breathe, let the thought sink in, and visualize a scene. This helps them find the reason to speak, which the director calls ""The pathway to the line."" Impulses can come from outside or inside. Actors should look into each other's eyes and consider their character's situation. The director encourages actors to approach this with an open mind, trusting that something will happen.
**The Perfect Theatre**
The perfect theatre should make you feel like your presence matters. Going to a live performance is an event, and the staff should recognize this. It's discouraging if the staff treats it like just another job. The theatre should create a connection between the performer and the audience. Everyone should feel they have a fair view of the actor, not too far away, and able to hear and see clearly. The size of the auditorium is important; it should fit the human voice and body. If the space is too big, it loses the human element central to drama. Many theatres from the late 1800s got this right, creating spaces that embrace the stage. Theatres with a sense of history, like worn steps in a church, give a feeling of past human presence. You can't please everyone with a play, and audiences don't always know what they want to see. When you go to the theatre, you want to experience something unexpected, something you couldn't imagine at home."
CPE_37,C2,"**Paul Simon**
In the 1950s, rock and roll was mainly popular among young people, but it also had a big impact on middle-class and older people. It set the stage for future rock stars who were inspired by this new and exciting music. For Paul Simon and other young people in the US, the best way to hear this music was through Alan Freed's radio show, Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party. This show was a must-listen for many future rock stars. Like John Lennon in Liverpool, who listened to Radio Luxembourg, Paul Simon was captivated by the music on Freed's show. He was ready to move from just listening to music to creating his own.
**Snow**
There was no clear path, but I thought I would be safe if I walked carefully. The wind was strong, pushing me down as I slipped on the ice. Suddenly, the snow beneath me collapsed. I fell into a hole about four feet deep. The snow had covered a gap between two rocks, leaving only a thin layer that I broke through. I pulled myself out, feeling shaken and worried about what could have happened if the hole had been deeper. I sat against a pine tree sticking out of the snow to think about my situation. In an hour, I had only traveled about half a mile. It was clear I needed to change my plan.
**Qualitative Research**
There are many books now that try to help researchers with qualitative research. While they talk a lot about collecting data, they often don't explain how to analyze it. Many researchers find data analysis mysterious. So, we asked different social scientists who have done qualitative research to share how they analyze their data. The goal was to provide insight into the process of data analysis, not to create a guidebook. This means making hidden methods more clear. Although this seems easy, it is actually quite difficult. We allowed our contributors to present their work in different styles, including personal stories and more formal approaches."
CPE_2,C2,"**Screen Learning**
A few days ago, I saw my six-year-old eating noodles in a funny way. He was pulling them up with his teeth and trying to look fierce. ""I'm a little dinosaur,"" he said. He was acting out a scene from a TV show he watched recently. I asked him what he remembered about dinosaurs, and he didn't remember much. Many people are eager to use the internet and computers for learning, but is learning from a screen really effective? One writer shared his experience with an interactive program he tried with his son. The father read the words carefully, but the son was more interested in playing with the pictures. The father thought that if his son had spent ten minutes with a book, he might have learned something. Television, as shown by my son and his noodles, is a medium that gives impressions and suggestions. Research shows that learning happens best in an environment where there is dialogue with teachers or parents. It needs to be guided. Using new technology to teach children is fine, but formal education is still very important.
**Hollywood**
By 1918, most of the world's film-making had moved to Hollywood. The local people didn't like it at first, seeing their area of Los Angeles changed by these newcomers. But eventually, they accepted it because of the success it brought. In Hollywood, success is measured by how much money a film makes. Hollywood knows a good film when it sees one: it might make someone a star, but it will definitely make money. In less than a century, Hollywood grew from a small village to a town as famous as New York, Rome, or Paris. Physically, it has changed a lot: a hundred years ago, you would walk through orange groves to get to the village store. Yet, in some ways, it is still like a village, with a narrow focus - just a part of Los Angeles. For those who live and work there, the main topic of conversation is films: how much they have made, who is dating whom, who has been betrayed, and who is working on which project. Successful people often try to leave: they work there but live elsewhere. Still, it is the place where almost everyone in show business eventually goes.
**Photography**
Photography was created by nineteenth-century artists as a new form of art. These artists wanted a lasting and accurate record of what they saw around them, and they found it. The combination of light, lens, shutter, and a surface with light-sensitive chemicals created images that were more lasting, realistic, and detailed than what painters could make in weeks or months. This caused some concern among other artists, and after their initial excitement, art critics argued that photography was not true art. They said that because photography relied on mechanical means, it couldn't be considered a product of human creativity. Despite the critics, photographers knew they had discovered a new art form and a new way to express themselves. They used their tools like other artists used brushes and pencils - to interpret the world and show their vision of nature and the people in it.
**Book Illustration**
During the time when book illustrations were in black and white, it was common for every children's book to have some form of illustration. This also applied to many novels for older readers, although this became less common as the number of printed copies decreased. Children's publishing was still very active, but it was mostly done on a low budget, which led to a lot of routine and average work. However, the best artists always did their best work. The black-and-white archive is a mix of ordinary and valuable work, a great place for research or browsing, where you can find treasures or start to appreciate this artistic period again. The real treasures are likely to be shown to the public again, either through reissues of individual titles, new publications about the artists, or exhibitions of original books and drawings. There are signs that this is starting to happen, and the familiar process of bringing back old styles is underway. Eventually, a smart publisher will see the potential for a series of classic children's book illustrations from this period, either as reprints or new editions using the original artwork."
CPE_68,C2,"**Blogging: Sharing with the World**
Some time ago, a website warned about the dangers of public check-ins—telling everyone online where you are. The message was clear: you might think you're just saying, ""Hey, I'm here,"" but you're also letting everyone know you're not at home, which might not be safe. This highlighted the growing concern that sharing too much online can have negative effects. The internet offers many exciting opportunities to share our lives with a global audience, promising things like wealth and fame. So, we dive into the online world, sharing confessions, photos, and stories. But soon, we realize it's a crowded and risky place, and we can feel lost.
Is this depressing? Maybe, but don't lose hope. This future has a guide, created by early internet users. In the early days of the web, these pioneers explored the internet and faced its challenges. They lost jobs, made and lost friends, and dealt with the ups and downs of fame, all before social media existed. These early bloggers have already experienced what many of us are going through now. Before we forget their stories, it's worth learning from them. As the saying goes, those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.
In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started posting online. Back then, the web was mostly used by students, scientists, and a few curious teenagers like him. The web was created at CERN, a physics lab in Switzerland, to help researchers share their work. But Hall saw it as a chance to share his life. He created a detailed online autobiography with words, photos, and art. In January 1996, he started a daily blog, and many people were drawn to his bold use of this new medium. Hall's rule was simple: if you crossed his path, you might end up on his site, and no topic was off-limits. While some saw him as an exhibitionist, others recognized the art in his work.
One day, visitors to Hall's site found it replaced with a video called ""Dark Night."" He shared that he had fallen in love, but when he wrote about it online, he was told, ""either the blog goes, or I do."" He realized that sharing his life online made people not trust him. He stopped blogging, but the problem remains. Sharing online is great, but if you expect it to make people like you, you'll be disappointed.
In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a web worker in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job at a software company. One day, a colleague sent her blog to the company's vice presidents, including some she had criticized, and she lost her job. Experts call this the ""online distribution effect"": the feeling that we can say things online that we wouldn't say in person. But our online and real lives are connected, and ignoring this can lead to big mistakes.
Armstrong's story ended well. Though she was upset and stopped blogging for a while, she got married and restarted her blog, focusing on her family. Now, she's a successful ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing supports her family. Once an example of online mistakes, she has become skilled at sharing her life carefully. Armstrong learned an important lesson: just because the web lets us say anything, doesn't mean we should."
CPE_23,C2,"'Enough Sleep? Many people today feel tired all the time. In busy and wealthy countries, more people are having trouble sleeping and feeling anxious. In the USA, research shows that 40 million people have serious sleep problems. In Britain, some popular books have characters who can't sleep or are set in sleep research labs. People are interested in sleep: how it works, why we need it, and what happens when we can't sleep. A main concern is that people need more sleep. A top sleep researcher says, 'People sleep less when they're busy. They wake up early to avoid traffic.' A sleep researcher did an experiment where he let people sleep up to 14 hours a night for a month. It took them three weeks to settle at about eight hours of sleep. This shows they were catching up on lost sleep. In Europe, a university in the English Midlands studies sleep. They look at how tiredness affects sailors, how airport noise affects sleep, and the dangers of driving when tired. They find volunteers through student newspapers. Volunteers are picked up by taxi, paid £5 an hour, and asked to change their sleep patterns. Dr. Louise Reyner reassures them: 'Some people worry because we put electrodes on their heads, but we can't see their dreams or thoughts.' The lab is more interested in physical effects. In a dark room, there is a driving simulator. Volunteers come at 2 pm, when people naturally feel sleepy, after a short or no sleep. They drive while answering questions. The road on the screen seems endless, the sun is bright, and the air is warm. Young men say they won't fall asleep. Dr. Reyner has a video of one trying not to. At first, he sits up straight, eyes open. Then he starts blinking more and nodding off. Each time, he wakes up suddenly, but the car has already gone off the road. Coffee might help. Dr. Reyner says two cups can make you a safe driver for over half an hour, even with no sleep. She suggests using tablets, energy drinks, and caffeinated gum, especially for shift workers. But what do we really know about sleep? Humans, like other mammals, sleep in a daily cycle. During sleep, we go through four stages, from light to deep sleep. Dreams usually happen in the lightest sleep, and the brain stops the body from moving to prevent injuries. Beyond this, we have theories. Some say sleep repairs the body, restores muscles, or rests the brain's speech and creativity areas. But these might also happen when we're awake and relaxed, so no one is sure. Scientists are quite sure that women sleep half an hour longer than men and that older people need less sleep, but they don't know why. When asked why we sleep, some researchers say, 'Sleep helps us pass time safely.' In the past, people may have slept differently. A history professor found that between 1500 and 1850 in Britain, people had different sleep patterns. They went to bed at nine or ten, woke up after midnight, stayed awake for an hour, and then had a 'morning sleep.' This time was used for thinking, remembering dreams, or even stealing. The poorest people benefited most from this quiet time. By the 17th century, with more artificial light, the rich started sleeping like we do now. The industrial revolution made most people work longer hours in lit buildings, changing sleep patterns for everyone except some country people. Outside Europe and America, the old sleep pattern was common until recently. In some non-western places, there are no strict bedtimes. People sleep for a few hours, then get up again. The idea of sleeping all night doesn't apply. In some tribal societies, noise, fire watching, and predators make continuous sleep impossible. It seems people everywhere need more sleep.'"
CPE_60,C2,"'We are talking about big boots here. Really big boots. I stood in my expensive cowboy boots on the rocks in the Arizona desert. Money was no problem. I wore a full cowboy outfit, but I wasn't a cowboy. It didn't feel right. I looked at the Arizona mountains and realized I didn't belong there. I flew in from Denver early in the morning, thinking I might look like a cowboy. But that feeling disappeared when I saw a real cowboy at the Phoenix airport. He wore a sweaty T-shirt, needed a shave, and carried a dirty bag. He noticed my new boots, raised an eyebrow, and left without a word. 
I wished there was an outfit for an ex-racing driver that made me feel like I fit in. Something that made me feel like I belonged, no matter where I was. I loved being a racing driver. I was addicted to it, and it was all I knew. But I don't race anymore. Even if I wanted to, I couldn't. So, what do I do now? A racing driver should have other plans for when they stop racing. I thought I did, but they disappeared when I needed them. 
How about being a commentator at the racetrack? 'We have fifteen former drivers ahead of you, Forrest. We'll call you.' Or maybe selling classic cars? That idea lasted a while, but nobody was buying old Ferraris, and Honda was changing its dealers. So, I left before it was too late. Being an 'ex' anything is tough. Who wants to hear about how I almost became World Champion? Nobody likes stories that end in 'almost'. Even if I had been champion, people would only listen for a few minutes. Last year's champion is old news. 
I don't want sympathy, and I don't get any. Why should I? I had a good career, made money, and saved some. But I miss racing. I miss the thrill of driving a powerful car. I miss the danger and the excitement. I miss the people and the reporters who cared about what I said. Being a little famous wasn't so bad. Businessmen and politicians liked to say they knew me. Kids wanted my autograph. But now that I don't race... Last week, the phone rang only twice. I have a lot of free time. 
I looked at the blue sky. No buzzards. Maybe Arizona doesn't have them. But some small birds in a cactus were singing. I never thought the desert had songbirds. I realized that a fake cowboy in designer boots has a lot to learn.'"
CPE_1,C2,"**Vancouver**
In the past ten years, many people from around the world have moved to Vancouver, in western Canada. In the evenings, people like to walk around the city, and if you join them, you will probably hear many different languages. People choose Vancouver because of its mild weather, beautiful location between the ocean and mountains, clean and safe environment, and opportunities for education and jobs. Some people complain about the fast construction of new buildings, but it's clear that new residents and tourism have helped the city grow. Vancouver used to be called 'Terminal City' because it was a gateway to other places. Even though the name is not used as much now, Vancouver is still a major gateway.
**Putting Pen to Paper**
Journalists, like me, are often not good at writing letters. Some say it's because we don't like writing for free, but I don't think that's true. It's more likely because we focus so much on making an impact in our work that we lose the natural flow of a letter. Real artists, who don't always think about the effect of their words (even if they rewrite a lot), don't have this problem. I think a true artist knows how their words will affect people. For example, when Shakespeare wrote his famous lines, he probably didn't think about how the mix of long words made them powerful, but it showed he was a great writer.
**Supermarket Opening**
In the past, opening a new supermarket in Britain was a big event. A soap opera star, a radio DJ, or a minor royal would often come to cut the ribbon. Now, new supermarkets open so often that celebrities are not needed. Why pay a famous person when anyone can do it for free? Last week, people waiting for the new Superbuy store to open didn't care who cut the ribbon, as long as they were first in line. One customer heard that the first five men would get a bottle of aftershave, and the first five women would get flowers. This news spread quickly, making those at the front feel proud and those who came later feel jealous."
CPE_53,C2,"**Citizen Kane**
When the film *Citizen Kane* was finally released in 1941, there was a lot of excitement and controversy. The release was delayed because the distributors were worried about what William Randolph Hearst, who the film was supposedly about, might do to them. Despite getting great reviews, the film was not a commercial hit at first. It was television that later made it popular again. *Citizen Kane* is perhaps the most influential film, inspiring many people to become filmmakers. This is surprising because it was Orson Welles's first film. Welles said its success came from not knowing what he could or couldn't do, so he just did what he wanted. He had a great team, including cameraman Gregg Toland, screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, and special-effects expert Linwood Dunn. When Welles and Mankiewicz decided to create a story about a newspaper owner who was similar to Hearst, Welles knew he had found the perfect project for himself as both director and actor, and he took the opportunity with great enthusiasm.
**Dermot and Carmel**
Dermot noticed that Carmel seemed a bit strange that morning. He mentioned twice that he might be late and not to worry if he stopped by the golf club on his way home. He needed to chat with someone, and that was the best place to do it. Carmel nodded her head in agreement but seemed like she wasn't really listening. Dermot asked, ""Will you be all right? What are you going to do today?"" Carmel smiled and said, ""Funny you should ask that. I was just thinking I had nothing to do all day, so I was going to walk downtown and look at the shops. It feels almost wrong to just spend the day doing nothing."" Dermot smiled back and said, ""You're allowed to enjoy yourself. And as I said, if I'm late, I won't need anything to eat. So don't go to any trouble."" Carmel replied, ""No, that's fine.""
**Title Race**
Human nature can be quite amusing. A recent study showed that job titles are a major cause of jealousy and tension at work. A survey by a top recruitment company found that 90% of employers and 70% of employees agree that titles create divisions among colleagues. Surprisingly, the survey revealed that 70% of office workers would prefer a more 'motivational' or 'professional' job title over a pay raise. If our desire for impressive titles is so strong that it even beats our basic desire for more money, we are in a difficult situation. In today's world, nobody wants to be seen as less important. The job titles being discussed focus on skills (like specialist or coordinator) but are really just nicer ways to describe the same roles."
CPE_55,C2,"I was in Vienna to take photos. That was usually why I traveled anywhere. Photography was not just my job; it was a big part of my life. I loved how light could change a scene and how one photo could capture the essence of a place or person. I always hoped to take the perfect photo, and as long as I had film, there was a chance. I had a routine: finish one roll, load another, and keep looking for the right moment. This had been my way for a long time.
Once, I took a photo of a smoke plume from a burning oil well that became very popular. Newspapers and magazines around the world wanted it. It was a brief moment of success, mostly due to luck. After that, I decided to work freelance, which seemed smart at the time. But life didn't go as planned, and the mid-nineties weren't as successful as I had hoped. That's why I was in Vienna, not somewhere more exciting. But I was still taking photos and getting paid for it, which wasn't bad.
The Vienna job came by chance. I had taken photos in London for a picture book called ""Four Cities in Four Seasons,"" which included London, Paris, Rome, and Vienna. The Austrian photographer, Rudi Schussner, had left the Vienna job, and they asked me to take over. The Austrian publishers liked my work, and I was available, unlike the French and Italian photographers. I was happy to go because things at home weren't great. A week in snowy Vienna sounded good to me.
They put me up at the Europa Hotel in the old city. I had been to Vienna before with my wife during the summer, but it was busy and not very memorable. This time, in cold January, it felt different. I knew I would enjoy it and take great photos. The first day, I didn't take any pictures. I rode the trams around the city, getting a feel for the place. The weather was cold and set, like the old baroque buildings. I hadn't seen Schussner's work from other seasons because I wanted this to be my Vienna.
A photograph captures a moment, but you have to wait for the right moment. I spent time looking around until I was ready. The next morning, I went out at dawn. Snow had fallen overnight, making Stephansplatz look untouched and empty. I wasn't sure how to capture the cathedral in one shot because its spire was tall and the base was large. I decided to focus on part of it, hoping to capture something magical. Photography has always had a magical quality, even when you understand how it works. Watching a photo develop is still mysterious, and that feeling stays with you. That's why what happened at Stephansplatz that morning didn't really surprise me."
CPE_50,C2,"Kinetic Art Rejoice -- Something amazing has happened: London's serious Hayward Gallery has become a place full of wonder. This change wasn't due to a big-budget, heavily advertised show, but rather a unique exploration of a nearly forgotten art form from the last 60 years. A new exhibition looks at the history of kinetic art, which is art focused on movement, in the twentieth century. It shows that creating art that moves by itself or explores the idea of movement has been an ongoing, though often unnoticed, theme in some of the most interesting creative work of this century. The exhibition, curated by Guy Brett, who has studied this subject for a long time, includes a wide range of paintings, drawings, documents, and films on kinetic art. These are presented with little text, allowing visitors to enjoy making their own connections and discoveries.
David Hockney Hockney's art is liked by many people who might not usually be interested in art. This could be because his work is figurative, making it easy to understand, or because it deals with themes of leisure and escape from everyday life. Some people might be more interested in Hockney's charming personality and clever words, which make him popular in the media. Some critics think Hockney is just an overrated minor artist. However, one could argue that he seems minor because being popular is not always accepted today, not because his work lacks depth. Hockney himself knows his limits and believes it's not fair to dismiss his work because it doesn't fit an abstract idea of greatness. He doesn't claim to be a great artist and knows that only the future can truly judge his importance.
Window-shopping - an art exhibition In recent years, I've seen many contemporary art exhibitions, some brilliant and some mediocre. What bothers me are shows that seem to push a hidden agenda, suggesting a common attitude among certain artists. Sometimes this works, revealing new trends in seemingly unrelated work. But often, it feels like a forced concept. As a curator, I wanted to create a show that was the opposite of this. With seven artists, I took over a space in an empty warehouse. 'Window-shopping' was meant to be a collection of individual artworks connected only by the fact that they claimed to be art. Sam Cole's knitted cats playfully chased each other on a toy train track. In contrast, Matthew Crawley's work involved turning on a video camera, opening it, and tinkering with it until it broke, which flickered and disappeared on a monitor in the corner. These works didn't fit into a typical themed exhibition and wouldn't usually be shown together, but why not? They didn't interfere with each other and, through their differences, added something to each other. I haven't made any big statements about contemporary art, but maybe there aren't any to make about an activity where artists set their own rules.
Art History People who enjoy paintings sometimes hesitate to analyze them, fearing it might ruin their experience. Some say that art historians, who focus on theory rather than practice, ignore the pleasure of looking at art and the special act of creating it. This idea is like thinking that knowing a recipe's ingredients and cooking method takes away from the taste of the dish. Enjoying something doesn't mean we can't also understand it deeply. In fact, knowing more about what we're looking at might make it more enjoyable. Pleasure is complex. How we feel and recognize it can be questioned and is influenced by history. Why we like certain things at certain times isn't just about our genes or personalities but is shaped by the values of our society. So, while it's important to appreciate the immediate and instinctive reactions to art, the idea that thinking about art takes away from its enjoyment is an old belief from a time when art was seen as separate from thought."
CPE_25,C2,"**Metals**
Stone Age people might have become interested in metals because they wanted to decorate themselves. Imagine sitting by a river, waiting to catch a fish, when one of our early ancestors found a shiny yellow stone. It didn't feel like a regular stone, but it was beautiful. This is how gold might have become important to early humans. Gold is soft and easy to shape, so it quickly became a valuable material. Copper might have been found by accident too. Once people realized how useful copper tools were, they started looking for copper ores and ways to extract copper from them. This is how metalworking became an important skill for our ancestors.
**St Ives**
We walked down the narrow, cobbled street into the town, carrying our bags and leaning against the strong wind. We tried to avoid the cold waves crashing over the promenade. The streets were empty, and the windows of the waterfront cottages were shut tight against the storm. We had seen the weather get worse as we arrived in St Ives on the small train. The dark grey skies made visiting Cornwall in the off-season without a car seem like a bad idea. I had convinced my friend to come with promises of walks along the beautiful Cornish coast and cozy evenings by the fire.
**Computer Modelling**
Studying the past is difficult because it is gone. The people who lived through good and bad times are no longer here. The reasons they settled in certain places or formed families and communities are forgotten. Archaeology gives us some clues, but we can't test our ideas with experiments on past cultures. We can't watch the past like a movie. However, computer modelling can help us recreate ancient landscapes and fill them with virtual communities. These digital people have some needs and abilities like real humans. We can set rules for them and change conditions, like reducing rainfall or increasing population, to see how these virtual societies react."
CPE_34,C2,"**Vervet Monkeys**
Cheney and Seyfarth studied a group of vervet monkeys. One day, the dominant male noticed a strange male monkey nearby. This stranger wanted to join the group, which could mean the current leader would lose his position. To prevent this, the dominant male came up with a clever plan. Whenever the stranger tried to approach, the leader gave an alarm call that vervets use to warn about leopards. This scared the stranger back into the trees. The plan worked well until the leader made a mistake: he gave the alarm call while walking calmly across open ground, revealing his trick.
**What Cats Catch**
In the English village of Felmersham, people collected the prey caught by their cats. Over a year, seventy cats caught over 1,000 animals. An American professor estimated that, based on these numbers, cats in Britain might be killing 100 million birds and small mammals each year. However, this calculation is not accurate because most cats live in towns and catch fewer animals. The important question is whether these numbers are sustainable. The answer seems to be yes, as many people feed birds in winter, and gardens provide nesting sites. The survey showed that cats are significant predators but are not destroying Britain's bird population.
**Buffalo's Day**
Buffaloes are very important to marsh people and are well cared for. Every morning, the buffaloes leave their sleeping area slowly and with groans, heading to the reed beds. They stand at the edge, complaining about the day's work, until the leader finally moves into the water. Once in the water, they seem to forget their purpose and rest there for a while. Eventually, they start swimming, appearing almost submerged, with only their noses above water. They spend the day among the reeds, eating leisurely.
**PICASSO, Pablo - The Soles 1940**
In early 1940, while staying in the fishing port of Royan, Picasso painted several fish still lifes. One painting shows a fishmonger's slab with a crab and some fish. The sea creatures look alive despite their situation. The painting is complex, with overlapping and interlocking shapes. The colors and brushwork create a calm, underwater feel. However, there is tension in the painting, with fish showing their teeth and a crab with open claws, suggesting an impending conflict. The sharp forms and even a chain around a fish add a sense of danger, giving the painting a symbolic meaning."
CPE_12,C2,"Photography has been used for about 150 years to capture all parts of human life. In this short time, it has grown to show moments in time and space, letting us see both big and small things. Photography has shown us images from faraway places on Earth and in space, as well as the complex and difficult parts of modern life. It has become a powerful way to express human experiences.
However, using images to record events is much older. The first pictures go back to the Upper Palaeolithic period, about 35,000 years ago. We don't know exactly why early humans made cave paintings—whether to show real events, for magic, religious reasons, or just to decorate. But images have always been a part of human culture.
Throughout history, people have questioned how accurate images are and their importance in society. The idea that ""seeing is believing"" has given images a special place. When photography was invented in the mid-1800s, it seemed to promise a true visual record. The camera, like the human eye, was seen as a tool that could capture a fixed image, close to what we actually see. This was a big achievement, as artists had long tried to create such images by hand.
Because cameras seemed so realistic, people thought everyone could understand photographs, leading to the idea of photography as a ""universal language."" For example, in 1933, photographer August Sander said even isolated people could understand a photo of the sky. But with global communication growing in the late 20th century, we must ask if photos can really cross cultural differences. Is photography as tied to culture as language is?
Photography is often seen as providing clear evidence, making it seem transparent and blurring the line between reality and its image. It's common for someone to show a photo and say, ""this is my grandson."" Since its invention in 1839, photography and how people use it have changed a lot. It has moved from being a simple record-keeper to an important historical document, showing as much about the people and society that made it as about its subject.
I want to show that the camera is not just a silent recorder of events. Photography can inspire social and political change. For example, the Italian Renaissance in the 15th century was influenced by new ways of seeing, like perspective. Similarly, photography has helped create the media culture of today and has also shown the world's harsh realities in everyday settings."
CPE_26,C2,"**How to Write Poetry**
Writing poetry can be tricky. It's like walking through a field full of hidden dangers. You need to be spontaneous, but one wrong move can ruin everything. It's risky to act like you know everything about poetry. So, for beginners, the best advice is to read a lot, write a lot, and let your imagination run free, as long as it doesn't lead to chaos. Some people need a stable life to write poetry, while others write to escape their troubles. Some follow a schedule, while others wait for inspiration. All methods are valid as long as they are not just copying others. The key is to find your own voice, nurture it, and let it grow until it can stand on its own.
**The Short Story**
In a short story, you can't have too many characters or long descriptions. Flashbacks should be brief and only used if necessary to explain something. A good way to do this is through a quick memory in the main character's mind, which can help move the story forward. Dialogue is very useful because it can show different sides of a situation quickly and keeps the reader interested. Writing too much can ruin a short story, but it doesn't mean it should be as short as a summary. A short story needs to have conflict and action, just like a novel, but every word must be important.
**Screenplays**
Writing a screenplay is like playing chess. Many chess players don't know much at first, but they learn as they play. They make moves without knowing what will happen next. Over time, they realize that chess is more about long-term strategy than short-term tactics. They start to see the whole game, not just individual moves. In chess, as in screenwriting, the more you practice, the more you understand its complexities.
**Looking at Writing**
Charles Darwin once said that humans naturally learn to speak, but not to write. Language is found in all societies, and while languages change, they don't get better. English today is not more complex than ancient languages. All healthy children learn to speak without lessons. When children don't have a language, they create one. Writing, however, is different. Writing systems were invented only a few times in history and only in complex societies. Most children didn't learn to read or write until recently, and even today, many struggle. Children naturally learn to speak, but writing is a skill that must be taught. We need to understand how writing works and how to teach it effectively."
CPE_8,C2,"I have never started writing a novel with more uncertainty. I call it a novel because I don't know what else to call it. I don't have much of a story to tell, and I don't end with a death or a marriage. Instead, I leave the reader with an open ending. This book is about my memories of a man I met only occasionally, and I don't know much about what happened to him in between. I could make up details to fill the gaps and make the story more complete, but I don't want to do that. I just want to share what I know. To protect the privacy of people still alive, I have given them made-up names and taken care to ensure no one recognizes them. The man I am writing about is not famous. He might never be. When he dies, he might leave no more impact on the world than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the water's surface. If my book is read, it will be for its own interest. But maybe his way of life and his strong, kind character will influence others, and people will realize he was remarkable. Then, it will be clear who I am writing about, and those interested in his early life might find something useful in my book. I think my book will be a helpful source for his future biographers, even with its limitations. I don't claim that the conversations I wrote are exact quotes. I didn't take notes, but I remember well what matters to me. I have written these conversations in my own words, but I believe they are true to what was said. I mentioned earlier that I haven't invented anything, but I have taken the same liberty as historians to create speeches for people in my story that I didn't hear myself. I did this to make the scenes more lively and realistic. I want my book to be read, and I think it's fair to make it interesting. Intelligent readers will notice where I used this technique and can choose to ignore it. Another reason I am nervous about this book is that the people I write about are from a different culture. It's hard to truly know people, and I think you can only really know your own countrymen. People are shaped by where they were born, the places they grew up, the games they played, the food they ate, the schools they went to, the sports they played, and the poets they read. These things make them who they are, and you can't understand them just by hearing about them; you have to live them. You can only know them if you are one of them. Because you can't fully know people from another country just by observing, it's hard to make them believable in a book. I have only written about my own countrymen before, and if I have written about others in short stories, it's because you can describe characters more briefly in them. You give the reader a general idea and let them imagine the rest. In this book, I don't claim that my characters see themselves as I describe them; they are seen through my eyes, just like the main character."
CPE_4,C2,"**POETRY RECITALS**
Throughout history, the world of literature often seems confusing to those living in it. It is only later that people can see the clear patterns and important figures. Today, poetry is especially complex with many different styles, debates, and ideas about the poet's role in society. Generally, there is a debate between 'literary' poets, who write poems to be read on the page, and 'popular' poets, who prefer performing their poems to an audience. This division is not strict, though.
Public poetry readings have become more common over the last twenty years. These events happen in various places, like small town halls, schools, colleges, and arts festivals. Poets are often expected to perform their work publicly, which has mixed results. For 'pop' poets, who write for live audiences, public performances are beneficial. Their poems are usually simple and easy to understand when heard once. However, on the page, their lack of depth and technique can be more obvious.
On the other hand, poets who focus on the craft of poetry, aiming to pack deep emotion, thought, and rhythm into their work, may not be fully appreciated by audiences hearing their poems for the first time. The risk is not that they will copy the style of entertainers, but that they might choose to read only their simpler work to connect quickly with the audience.
Listening to poetry readings cannot replace reading poetry on the page, but it can be a fun and educational experience. Hearing poets read their work can help listeners understand the emphasis and rhythm, especially if they follow along with the text or know the poems beforehand.
The main reason for popular poetry recitals, sometimes mixed with music, is to make poetry enjoyable and accessible to everyone, not just a select few."
CPE_30,C2,"**Oral History**
Historians are increasingly using oral evidence, but this method has challenges. It's not realistic to think that someone's spoken account is a perfect reflection of the past. During an interview, both the historian and the person being interviewed influence each other. The historian chooses who to interview and what topics to cover. Even if the historian just listens, their presence can change how the person remembers and talks about the past. The final account is shaped by the historian's social position and how they understand history, which can affect the person being interviewed. Historians need to acknowledge their role in creating new evidence. Additionally, the person being interviewed is not directly connected to the past. Their memories might be influenced by other sources, like the media, or by nostalgia or later life experiences. Emotions and attitudes can make the testimony seem convincing, but they might not be from the time being discussed.
**Animal Science**
There are two main ways to study animal science: focusing on the body's functions or looking at the whole animal. Physiologists study how the body's parts, like nerves and muscles, work together to create behavior. Those who study the whole animal look at the behavior of the entire animal and what affects it. Within this approach, psychologists and ethologists are different. Psychologists usually work in labs and study how animals like rats and pigeons learn. Ethologists study natural behaviors in animals, often in the wild. Although these fields are different, they are starting to work together more. Physiologists often say their methods are more basic, but even if we understood every nerve cell's role in behavior, we would still need to study behavior as a whole. Behavior has its own structure that we need to understand. Describing a bird's nest-building by looking at nerve cells is like trying to read a book with a microscope.
**The Social Sciences**
Students new to social sciences face a challenge: they must learn both the content and the methods of the subject. They need to understand the knowledge and research in textbooks and also how this knowledge is gathered and organized. These two parts are closely connected. We all have everyday experiences with social life, so social sciences might seem like common sense. However, each social science goes beyond common sense. Each focuses on a specific part of social life, uses particular study methods, and has its own concepts. These concepts are the basic ideas that form the 'logical basis' of the subject, helping social scientists go beyond everyday understanding and distinguishing one discipline from another.
**Classical Architecture**
In Ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was more than just building structures. The Roman architect Vitruvius said architecture involves order, arrangement, proportion, symmetry, propriety, and distribution. He used Greek terms for some of these ideas, likely from an earlier Greek source. Utility and function are not part of his definition, though he later discusses the best designs for different purposes. Initially, the focus is on architecture as an art. The origins of classical architecture are complex. There was a long history of simple building forms in Greece and Italy that didn't meet Vitruvius' artistic standards. These simple forms contributed to later sophisticated architectural ideas. Despite its elaborate appearance, the classical temple is essentially a simple, single-room structure."
CPE_7,C2,"The two sisters, Lily and Mui, kept Lily's driving a secret from Chen for a while. Lily would drive around the allotments, near the railway line and gasworks, even jumping a small bridge with all four wheels off the ground, which was her only mistake. She would finish her drive near the gasworks, where it smelled of sulphur. Surprisingly, Chen found out and was amused by Lily's secret driving. He praised her, saying, ""So you can really drive, Lily? Well done!"" Mui thought men were strange because Chen should have been upset, but instead, he was excited and started planning a trip with Lily. They decided to go on a Monday at the start of the next month, leaving early and returning by midday to avoid losing customers. Meanwhile, Lily would keep practicing her driving.
Mui, despite her doubts, bought a road map and got a ten percent discount, which impressed Chen. However, Lily felt a bit insulted by Mui's lack of trust in her navigation skills. An hour after leaving home, they reached the English Channel. Lily drove perfectly, and even Mui, who was ready to give directions from the back seat, had to admit it. Lily overtook a few slow cars with great skill, and Chen even applauded her. After passing through the gasworks of a seaside town, they drove along the empty promenade. Lily parked in a street with many empty parking spaces. She wasn't sure about the road markings, so she preferred to pay a parking fee rather than risk getting towed or fined. This cautiousness might have reassured Mui.
During the drive, Lily noticed Mui's tense face in the mirror. She decided not to mention any worries that Mui hadn't thought of herself. Lily carefully locked all the van doors. Chen joked, ""Don't worry, no one will want that old van."" The sisters were annoyed. Lily accused Chen of being ungrateful, and Mui told him he was too easily fooled by appearances. Surprised, Chen took their son, Man Kee, to look at the sea. He held Man Kee on the railing, feeling the warmth and responsiveness of his son. Chen decided then that he would raise Man Kee his way, giving him a good education and helping him own many restaurants.
The sight of the sea made Chen feel thoughtful as he planned Man Kee's future. He saw a ship on the horizon and used a telescope to look at it. At first, he couldn't find it, but then he saw it clearly: a small, old, rusty ship. He lifted Man Kee to see through the telescope and said softly, ""Do you see the ship, Son? It's special for people like us. It will take us back home when we're done here. It will take you to your homeland, which you've never seen."" Chen kissed Man Kee's head. Lily and Mui joined them, and Lily put her arm around Chen. Chen said, ""The little old ship. Let your mother see, Son."" But Man Kee didn't want to let go of the telescope. When he finally did, the view was gone, and all Lily saw was a white light. By the time Chen found another coin, the ship had disappeared over the horizon, and Lily only saw seagulls following the ship's path."
CPE_43,C2,"Title: The Well
I had read that if you dig a deep enough hole, you could see the stars during the day. I convinced you to help me try this. You watched as I pulled up the well bucket, steadied it, and climbed in. I asked you to lower me down. I didn't think about how heavy the bucket would be or that you might not be strong enough to hold it. You tried to hold the handle but then let go, and I fell into the well. I hit my head and saw strange lights. Later, I realized they looked like the stars and planets you see in cartoons when a character gets hit.
At first, I was dazed, then scared, then relieved, and finally angry at you for letting me fall. I was also worried about what Mother would say. You called down to ask if I was okay. I was about to shout back when you called again, sounding panicked, which stopped me. I lay still and watched you through my eyelashes. You ran off to get help. I quickly climbed out of the well and hid in the shadows near the moat bridge.
Mother, Father, you, and Arthur came out, looking worried. Mother was shouting, and Father told Arthur to use the winch. You looked pale and shocked. I felt a mix of excitement and fear. Then I noticed the trail of water drops I had left from the well to where I was hiding. I was scared someone would see them. Father was shining a flashlight into the well, and Mother was screaming. I realized this was more serious than I had planned. It started as a fun idea but turned into something that could get me in big trouble.
I decided to act like I had just escaped. I came out of hiding, pretending to be weak and tired. I told them I found a secret tunnel from the well to the moat and crawled out. I thought they believed me until Father asked me to repeat the story. I added that the tunnel collapsed after I got out, so no one could check it. Father looked at me with disbelief and told me not to be ridiculous. Arthur looked at me with pity, worried about my future if I kept lying. Their reactions made me realize the seriousness of my actions."
CPE_51,C2,"Title: Moving Day
Susan, a widow, is moving out of her family home now that her children are grown up. The moving van had ""Removers of Distinction"" written on it, and Susan noticed that everything special about the house was being packed away. Fred, the removal man, was carefully wrapping fragile items, while his team was not as gentle. The house was beautiful, with four floors and a view of a small harbor. Susan remembered the years spent there with her children, Robert and Francesca, who were now adults and helping with the move.
Robert was making sure Susan didn't mention the piano, a fine Steinway, which Francesca insisted on handling herself. Fred, the removal man, commented that Susan didn't seem like she was going to cry, which surprised her. Fred explained that many people cry when they see their home being taken apart, but they feel better once they reach the new place.
Susan remembered when they first moved in and how the piano got stuck on the stairs. Her late husband, Peter, had solved the problem by hiring a builder to remove a window and using a crane to bring the piano inside. It was an expensive process, and they couldn't afford to tune the piano for months. Peter had said the piano would stay there forever, but now it was time to move.
Susan was worried about the piano getting stuck again, but it was too late to warn the movers. As the piano was carefully carried down the stairs and out the door, Susan, Robert, and Francesca started laughing with relief. They walked down the path together for the last time, arm in arm, with tears of laughter in their eyes."
CPE_11,C2,"**Online Literary Criticism for Everyone: Is It Just Harmless Fun?**
From the beginning, the Internet was meant to be open to everyone. In theory, anyone could publish their ideas or start a music channel online. But in the early days, you needed some technical skills to do this. However, one area that truly became accessible to everyone was literary criticism. With Amazon.com, the first popular online bookstore, anyone could write a book review. Amazon's idea was simple: anyone could say what they thought about a book and give it up to five stars. Each book had its own page, and new reviews appeared automatically. This allowed Amazon to have many free reviews, and potential buyers could see what other readers thought, not just the publisher's description or professional critics' opinions. Other online bookstores did similar things, but Amazon, being the biggest, had the most customers and reviews.
This open system led to some problems. Thousands of reviews were submitted daily, and it was impossible to check them all. Amazon had a team to ensure reviews followed their rules. For example, reviews couldn't be just one word, attack the author personally, contain bad language, reveal the ending, or mention other reviews. Reviewers were anonymous, so some mischief happened. For instance, authors could write positive reviews of their own books. Lev Grossman, an author, did this after his book got bad reviews. He wrote fake positive reviews until he admitted his trick in an article, and Amazon removed them.
Authors could also comment on their books through a special link. Most used it to encourage people to buy and enjoy their books. Some even shared their email addresses to talk directly with readers. However, Amazon didn't always check if the comments were really from the authors, except for famous ones. For example, a fake comment pretending to be from the famous author John Updike was removed.
The real drama came from readers, not writers. When James McElroy's book about a cheerleading team was published, it got good reviews from the press. But people mentioned in the book felt betrayed and used Amazon to express their anger. Many critical reviews appeared but were later removed.
Despite these issues, Amazon saw the large number of reviews as good for business. Reviews were meant to be a place to discuss books, not a chat room, so Amazon closely watched popular books to ensure reviews followed the rules. This meant that funny or silly reviews were more likely to be found on less popular books. For example, a children's book called ""The Story about Ping"" inspired humorous reviews because ""ping"" is also a term used in Internet technology.
Most reviews on Amazon were serious, and they gave a good idea of whether a book was worth buying. The writer George Orwell once said that reviewing too many books meant pretending to have feelings about books you didn't care about. This makes the open review process on Amazon seem like a positive change."
CPE_14,C2,"**Art in Modern Times**
In the last two hundred years, people have started to think that every artist must be different from others. We often praise art for being unique, revolutionary, or even shocking. We admire artists whose work was not appreciated a hundred years ago. But when it comes to modern art, we sometimes feel unsure and say that an artist has gone too far, and what they do is no longer art. The media often express these thoughts for us, and we tend to agree because we expect art to be new and confusing. We don't always notice the old themes and methods in modern art. We think artists should be different from everyone else, with special talents and energy that can't be limited by rules. In the past, people asked artists to create art for specific purposes, and it was part of everyday life. Today, we let artists do their own thing and get annoyed if they try to be more ordinary.
**Picture This**
Let me describe a situation and ask an important question. An artist picks a piece of text from an art book. The text talks about the variety of pictures and asks, ""What are they all about?"" It then says, ""There is no end to the number of different kinds of pictures."" This sounds simple, but stay with me. The artist asks someone to make a canvas and take it to a sign painter. The sign painter writes the text on the canvas in simple black letters, without any fancy style. So, my question is: Is this finished product a painting?
**Underground Encounters**
At the Mercury Gallery in London until June 26th, there is an unspoken rule for successful painters: once you find a profitable style, you should stick to it. Collectors expect artists to keep doing the same thing, and trying something new can upset them. Gallery owners prefer safe choices, and the art-buying public likes consistency. Some artists, like Picasso and Hockney, have successfully changed their style. Eric Rimmington is another artist trying something new. His new show moves away from the still lifes he is known for and focuses on the London Underground. Rimmington has always been interested in railways. He made drawings of Kings Cross Station in the 1980s, and now he explores the underground world. His exhibition, ""Underground Encounters,"" includes 40 paintings and drawings that capture the unique atmosphere of this hidden world.
**Extract from a Novel**
I have come to this island with a few books. I don't know why I say ""escape."" The villagers joke that only a sick person would choose such a remote place to rebuild. So, I am here to heal myself, if you want to put it that way. Apart from an old woman who comes from the village to clean the house, I am alone. I am neither happy nor unhappy; I feel like I am floating in memories. I talked about the uselessness of art but didn't mention its comforts. The comfort of my work as a painter or writer is that in the silence, reality can be changed and shown in a meaningful way. Our everyday actions are like a rough cloth hiding the beautiful pattern underneath. For artists, art is a way to deal with what hurts or defeats us in life, not to avoid our destiny, but to fulfill it through imagination. Otherwise, why would we hurt each other?"
CPE_63,C2,"'Family Business'
""Look here, it's no good!"" said my Dad. We were driving back to London. My father, with my brother Maurice, had just picked me up from the fancy girls' school I attended. He had also just been to Parent's Day, where I received the Latin prize and the prize for doing best in my final exams. He had a long talk with my headteacher, and now we were heading home for the holidays. ""What isn't?"" I asked, though I had a feeling I knew what he was thinking because he was unusually quiet. Normally, he talked a lot. ""You can't fool me. You'll do what you want now,"" he said. ""With all those certificates, I heard you'll get a scholarship to Oxford."" ""So?"" I said, trying to act confident. ""Mightn't that be useful?"" ""I also heard,"" he continued, and I knew a confrontation was coming, ""that you want to be a barrister. A barrister of all things!"" My father knew a lot about barristers and the law. ""I just said that,"" I replied. ""I couldn't think of anything else to say!"" ""And apparently,"" he went on, ""you have the right personality - you can quickly understand a lot of information, you talk well, and you like performing."" ""I don't know about that,"" I said. ""I only know what I see in TV dramas."" ""Be that as it may,"" he continued, ""I feel your heart's never going to be in the business now. Obviously, you'll go to Oxford University, and after that, I can't see you wanting it."" The problem was that, like many children in family businesses, I felt trapped by family expectations. I saw different career options and wanted to explore them. At the same time, I didn't want to upset my father. I wasn't as scared of him as Maurice was - I was the favorite - but I found him intimidating. ""It's too soon to know,"" I said weakly. ""I tell you you're not going to want to join us,"" said my father, who was usually right about these things, ""and it's a pity because you've got the gifts - the brains, the nerves, the vision."" ""There's still Maurice,"" I said, sulking. My father snorted. We both knew Maurice hated the business. ""Anyway,"" I continued, ""you could always use me as a sort of consultant."" My mother wasn't around to help - she died when I was young, and my father raised Maurice and me. Maurice was two years younger, and because he was motherless, I got used to taking care of him. It wasn't hard. I loved Maurice. Because the business was successful, we lived in luxury - a big house in London, fancy schools, nice clothes, parties, theatres, operas. My father knew many people - politicians, actors, businessmen - and our house was full of interesting conversations. ""I tell you what,"" my father continued. ""You can help us during holidays until you leave Oxford, and then if you decide to leave us, you can. It will give you some pocket money and be a real help to me."" ""OK,"" I said, relieved to avoid immediate decisions and especially the depression and sulks my father would fall into if I opposed him. This was how he controlled us. So it happened. In my last term at school, and then during university vacations, I helped out, never more than twice a year, and always on safer tasks. I became one of the smarter students, with a little house of my own, a small but powerful white car, designer clothes, and a black dress with a Paris label that I planned to wear for my final exams. In my last term, my father visited me and took me to a village for a meal and a chat. There were only a few weeks left. My tutor predicted I would get a First Class degree in Law, and I knew that if I stayed focused and used these last days wisely, he might be right. I felt ready, confident, and focused. But that was not to be. My father told me that, in about a week, he needed me to do one last job for him, the most important work the family business had ever done, and that it would be worth my while. ""But Dad,"" I protested, ""I've got my final exams coming up, and I need to focus on that. It's really important that I do well, and I don't want to think about anything else right now."" I could tell that such pressures were beyond my father's understanding (or maybe he was jealous of my life away from him?) and that he would see a refusal from me as a betrayal in his time of need. That was not all. As he explained the job, I saw more clearly than ever his single-mindedness - the clarity and resourcefulness with which he approached his work, his energy, and his perfect self-control. In his way, he was a sort of genius, and I respected that. It made my own plans and hopes seem less important. ""All right,"" I said. ""I'll do it."""
CPE_56,C2,"Simon Costello realized that buying the house in Pembroke Square was a mistake within a year of moving in with his wife, Lois. They could only afford it by being very careful with money, which wasn't ideal. At first, it seemed like a good decision because Simon had many successful cases, and Lois had returned to her job at an advertising agency after having twins. She even got a raise, making her salary thirty-five thousand. Lois was the one who really wanted to move, and Simon didn't resist much. She argued that their flat wasn't suitable for a family, and they needed more space, a garden, and a place for an au pair. They could have found these things in a less expensive area, but Lois wanted more than just space. She felt their old address wasn't good enough for a rising barrister and a successful businesswoman. 
To save money, Lois decided one of them should use public transport. Since her job was far away, Simon had to take the crowded tube, which made him unhappy. He often thought about his grandfather's house in Hampstead, where he was treated well after a long day. His grandmother believed in taking care of the 'lawyer's wife' role, but that world was gone. Lois made it clear before they married that her career was as important as his. Their lifestyle depended on both their salaries.
Now, their situation was at risk because of Venetia, who was very upset. She had confronted Simon with accusations. She claimed that Brian Cartwright, a client, said Simon knew about jury bribery in a past case but did nothing. Simon denied it, but his denial felt weak even to him. He felt guilty and remembered being punished as a child. He wished he had been prepared and said something different. Venetia's anger and disgust confused him. He wondered why she was so upset and if she had the right to ruin his career. If the rumors spread, he knew he would be in serious trouble."
CPE_36,C2,"I chose to live here because I thought I could be anonymous among people who didn't care if the rented houses were falling apart or if the gardens were overgrown. But I was wrong. People in the shops start to recognize you, even if you don't feel like you're living a real life. The roses next door remind me that the gardens were once loved. Usually, I stay inside, trying to ignore the summer outside, but tonight I'm watching the birds fly between the trees and roofs. I've cleared some space in the garden for a chair, and my arms are scratched from cutting back the plants. It's a small London garden where plants have to grow tall to survive. 
My upstairs neighbor, Jaz, leans out of the window. She's written several unpublished books, and as an English teacher, I sometimes have to pretend to like them. I have her latest book now. 'How's the writing going, Jaz?' I ask. 'In no other job do you have to explain yourself so often,' she replies. Then she offers to bring a drink down. I don't really want her in the garden, which now looks messy. The only way to the garden is through my flat, and Jaz is knocking on my door. 'You're on holiday now,' she says, sitting in the chair while I put a cushion on the grass. 'I should've been a teacher - writers don't get holidays. But you know what they say, those who can, do, those who can't, teach.' And some can't do either. 'What are your plans for the holidays?' she asks. 
I feel anxious about the school year ending. Empty days, hot pavements, and loneliness in the park. 'I'm going to Stonebridge tomorrow. Can you feed the cats?' I ask, my heart racing. 'Of course,' Jaz says, knowing she will be around. 'Where will you stay? A nice B and B?' 'No, with my oldest friend, Ruby, at the Rising Sun. We've known each other since we were eight.' It's not true, but I often deal with fiction. 'Going back to your roots. What do you think of my book?' Jaz asks about her manuscript, The Cruelty of Red Vans, which I haven't finished reading. I like the title and tell her so. I decide to be honest for once. 'Try writing about nice people for a change, people who want to be good,' I suggest. 'Teachers!' Jaz responds like a rebellious student. 'I keep a journal where I write something good about each day,' I say, sounding old-fashioned. 'Keep a journal! Nice people! Get a life, Ann.' 
Oh, I have a life. I have my work, and I go out sometimes, reading on the tube. When we go inside, my calm kitchen reassures me. Then I suddenly remember my school geography teacher, Miss Tarrantine, winking at us and saying, 'I've had my moments.' We nearly died laughing."
CPE_6,C2,"**Heritage**
Heritage is important because it connects people and communities to the past. We often feel connected to our personal heritage, like knowing about our grandparents and their lives. But beyond that, there is a need to learn about our past to understand our future, both individually and as a nation. Heritage gives us a sense of continuity, helping us feel secure about the future. Just like we inherit genes, we also inherit culture passed down through generations. Even if there are parts of our national heritage we don't like, it is still ours, and it feels good to belong to something. Heritage teaches us a lot and is important for our well-being. It influences everything from customs to material culture. In the past, we learned about our heritage through stories from our ancestors. However, Western industrial society has broken up communities, and much of this oral tradition is lost. Now, places and buildings help us learn about our past. It is important to preserve these as a testament to our ancestors' identity.
**The Fens**
I started writing a novel called ""Waterland,"" where the landscape of the Fens in England became important. People often ask why I, a Londoner with no personal connection to the Fens, chose to write about it. The simple answer is that I thought the Fens were a quiet, empty place to set my story. But I learned that the Fens are not flat or empty. They are as English as any other part of England but also strangely unique. It's interesting that in the middle of England, there is a place that feels foreign to many English people. The Fens are both empty and full, cultivated and wild, open yet mysterious. While writing my novel, I didn't explore the Fens extensively. I haven't been to places like Wisbech or Prickwillow. As a fiction writer, I prefer to imagine worlds rather than rely on facts. Imagining the Fens has its own logic because, as Edward Storey's book shows, the Fens are not just a landscape but also a state of mind.
**Museums**
Museums need to make their collections accessible. In the past, this meant putting items in display cases with long labels that were hard to understand. Today, accessibility means more. Displays should be lively and interesting, using techniques to capture visitors' attention and emotions. Museums should also reach out to the community. For example, they can provide loan boxes of objects for teachers or use similar materials to help elderly people with memory loss. Museums focus on real artefacts and specimens, not replicas. They offer encounters with authentic items that existed and had meaning in history. This is their strength and what sets them apart from heritage centers, theme parks, books, and digital media. Museums that embrace this challenge and offer exciting displays and outreach programs will find that virtual history can actually help them by increasing interest in the real items they have.
**Architecture and Environment**
The desire to preserve things is not new, but changes in our towns happen quickly and affect us all. This makes some people want to preserve everything, while others think more about the nature and future of towns. It can be argued that people who have lived through events like world wars are more inclined to preserve things because stability becomes important. If there is a psychological need for preservation, planners should consider it. Change is not bad if we learn to manage it. Physical changes in our towns reflect social changes, like changes in population, welfare, and demands."
CPE_33,C2,"**Einstein**
If you ask someone on the street to name a scientist, they will probably say Albert Einstein. His face is often used in ads for smart products like computers and encyclopedias. Most people don't know much about what Einstein did, except that he created some theories called 'relativity'. These theories are famous for being hard to understand and for making strange predictions that don't match everyday life. Einstein was part of a big change in scientific thinking, which started modern science in the 20th century. Scientists were trying to describe the universe better by studying matter and natural forces. Einstein made important contributions by rethinking basic ideas like time, space, matter, and energy. Before him, people followed Isaac Newton's idea that stars and planets moved in a fixed space and time. Einstein changed this by saying that time and space are not fixed but relative.
**Young Readers**
When we were kids, Lydia and I didn't trust books that won prizes because we thought they would be 'worthy', which to us meant 'boring'. Our mother didn't like our attitude and would hint at her disapproval, but our father would happily give us small amounts of money to encourage us to read these books. He would also sneak in a few good books among our Christmas and birthday gifts, marking them with 'This Book is NOT Literature'. Although we ignored most of these books as 'boys' books', he did manage to get us to read some good short stories and, once, a famous collection of poems.
**Language**
In 1851, Jacob Grimm wrote that 'The origin of human language is truly secret and marvellous'. This mystery has led to many strange ideas. In 1928, Charles Caller said that early humans might have made sounds like ""meuh"" when they felt danger. ""Meuh"" sounds sad. People who lived in dangerous places with scary animals made desperate sounds, and some of these sounds stayed in languages, like the word malaria meaning ""fever"" or the Latin mors meaning ""death"". Because of these odd ideas, many people avoided the topic, thinking it was for eccentric thinkers. But recently, the origin and evolution of language have become important research areas. Language likely started in East Africa about 100,000 years ago. It was mainly used for friendly communication and was important in power struggles. Sharing information was probably not its original purpose, unlike what philosopher John Locke thought when he called language a 'great conduit' for sharing knowledge."
CPE_20,C2,"'Writing Reviews Frank Kermode looks at the skill of writing reviews from the perspective of someone who does it. Most reviews are written and shared in ways that make them relevant for only a short time. There are deadlines and strict limits on how long they can be. Once published, they are only important for as long as the newspaper or magazine they are in lasts, which is usually a day, a week, or at most a month. Because of this short lifespan, reviews are often not seen as having high literary value. Many people, including the writers, think that reviewing is something you do only if you need extra money or if you can't spend all your time working on a novel or a serious book. However, reviewing is a skilled and complex job. Writing a short, fair review of 600 to 800 words for a newspaper is different from writing a detailed 6,000 to 8,000-word review for an international journal. A 1,500-word review in a weekly magazine has challenges of both short and long reviews. Length is not the only thing to consider. Reviewers must think about their audience, from casual readers to those deeply interested in the subject. A reviewer needs to know a lot about many topics and write in a way that intelligent people can understand and enjoy. This means reviewers often write other things besides reviews. The American novelist John Updike, who doesn't think highly of criticism, still enjoys writing reviews between his novels. He collects all his reviews, even short ones, into books with modest titles. Some might think less famous writers should accept that their reviews are temporary, but if they can, they should be allowed to keep a record of their work, especially if they believe some of their best writing is in reviews. I feel this way about my own work. My main job has been academic, and most of my serious books are academic, the kind professors are expected to write. In the English-speaking world, unlike other cultures, there is no strict separation between reviewing and literary study, so it's common for the same people to do both. In the past, other academics criticized professors who wrote reviews for showing off or wasting time, but this is less common now. There is more reviewing work available, so almost everyone can do some, even though the pay is often low. I believe this is good for readers, who can trust that the reviewer knows what they are talking about, and for professors, as it helps them stay connected to a wider audience. It reminds them to communicate clearly with non-academics. While they might use complex language with each other, they need to be clear when speaking to intelligent non-professors. In the end, reviewing is a secondary job. You can only do it well if you are also doing something else well.'"
CPE_40,C2,"Ralph unlocked the door to his apartment and felt a brief moment of doubt about owning it, even after three years. When he first bought the flat, he would come home excited and curious, often arriving early, wondering what the flat had been like while he was away. It felt like a welcoming place where he was in control. He thought he should worry about things like intruders or leaks, but the flat always seemed to be waiting for him, either tidy or messy, depending on how he left it. Over time, he saw it as just another part of himself, a space filled with his thoughts and feelings. He became frustrated that it couldn't change. Sometimes, there would be a small pile of letters by the door or a blinking light on the answering machine when he returned. He was thankful that the windows hadn't been broken or the flat damaged, but he wondered what it would look like if it were. From his dull office on Holloway Road, Ralph often looked forward to his evenings alone at home. Once he left the office and started to feel like himself again on the bus ride home, he realized he didn't need to be alone, a fact he often forgot when planning his social life. At his desk, he longed for time alone with his belongings, but once home, he felt empty and waited for a sense of self to return. Instead, he felt a deep emptiness, making him think that working in a job that didn't suit him had changed him, moving him away from who he thought he was. He would read or listen to music at night, but now he questioned why he did these things. His sense of direction was unclear, and his thoughts and feelings seemed lost, unable to connect. He remembered a time when he didn't feel so powerless, when he might have escaped if he had realized his own value. But he had been eager to settle into something and followed the first opportunity that came along. After university, he tried to make a plan for his future, but he found he only wanted to survive quietly. He applied for jobs he heard about from friends, following their paths without imagining a job that would make him happy. He went to his only job interview with gratitude and didn't think to evaluate the position, an editorial role at a free local newspaper. He was relieved to have a pleasant conversation with Neil, his boss, and didn't think about the long meetings he would face daily. Neil offered him the job on the spot, saying Ralph was the only graduate who applied, which Ralph took as a compliment at the time."
CPE_45,C2,"**Goat Racing**
I was about to see goat racing on Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. I pushed through crowds, ice-cream vans, food stalls, and loud music to get a good spot. The racecourse was a simple area marked off for the event. It wasn't like big racecourses, but people stood on both sides of the track to watch the goats run. Keeping the goats in order was not easy because goats are known to eat almost anything.
**Canoe Trip**
As the day ended, I worried about the night ahead. The canoe was too wet to sleep in, and we hadn't seen any villages or huts since morning. In the dim moonlight, we used a torch to see the cliffs, but the batteries were dying. We replaced them, but the new ones didn't work. We couldn't find a place to camp. A few miles later, Lesley thought she saw a light, and we got hopeful, but it was just moonlight on the waves. Soon, we heard the loud noise of fast water, but we couldn't see what was happening. Time seemed to stop as we continued.
**How to be Presentation Perfect - We Answer Your Questions**
I am not naturally good at making presentations, but as a managing director, I have to present to my colleagues and major shareholders. How can I improve my presentation skills and confidence? 
You are not alone. Presenting is a different skill from running a company, but many senior executives need to be good at it. To convince your audience, you must believe in what you are saying. Show your belief with passion and enthusiasm. This means you need to prepare well. Test your ideas in advance and ask colleagues to think of difficult questions the audience might ask. Start your presentation by finding common ground with your audience and build towards your conclusion."
CPE_64,C2,"Some activities cannot be rushed; they need their own time. For example, if you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you add oil too quickly when making mayonnaise, it will curdle. If you pull too hard on a tangled fishing line, the knot will get tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some things it does very quickly, while others take longer. We can get faster at solving puzzles or doing math in our heads, but some mental processes cannot be rushed. If we try to hurry them, they might fail, like the mayonnaise, or get tangled, like the fishing line. 
The mind has different speeds for different tasks. Sometimes we need to react instantly, without thinking. For example, when my motorbike skidded on a wet road, my body reacted quickly to keep me safe, and only afterward did I realize what happened. This fast reaction is a kind of intelligence called 'wits'. 
Then there is the kind of intelligence that involves thinking things through, like solving problems or making decisions. This is called 'intellect'. People who are good at this are often called 'bright' or 'clever'. 
Finally, there is a slower way of thinking that is more relaxed and less focused. This is when we are daydreaming or reflecting. It is just as important as the faster ways of thinking. This slow thinking helps us understand complex or unclear situations. 
Recent studies show that this slower thinking is good for dealing with complicated problems. When we don't know what questions to ask or when the problem is too complex, we need this slow thinking. It is linked to creativity and wisdom. Poets and philosophers have long understood the limits of fast, deliberate thinking and have valued these slower ways of knowing. Scientists are now exploring these slower, less deliberate ways of thinking. They find that the unconscious mind can solve complex problems and learn patterns that the conscious mind cannot."
CPE_29,C2,"**Surviving in a Foreign Land**
I have been welcomed warmly. It's a friendly and well-equipped base camp in a very isolated place. At any time, there are about forty people - scientists, students, weathermen, satellite trackers - in a close community where everyone helps each other. My basic French is just enough to communicate, but not to have casual conversations. I miss the small details, and my phrasebook is not helpful at breakfast. This isn't a practical problem for me, but at first, it affected my self-confidence. I was a bit nervous about mealtimes. I would hesitate, unsure which table to choose, worried about the silence when I spoke, anxious like I was in the first weeks of school. I still smile awkwardly or panic when people talk to me. I think this occasional sadness is not because of missing company or communication, but because I've lost the social advantage that my ability to talk has always given me.
**Elliot**
When I first met Elliot, I was just a young author like any other, and he didn't pay much attention to me. He never forgot a face though, and when I saw him again, he shook hands with me politely but didn't try to become friends. If I saw him at the opera with someone important, he often pretended not to see me. But then I had a big success as a playwright, and I noticed that Elliot started to like me more. One day, he invited me to lunch, and I thought he was testing me. After that, because my success brought me many new friends, I began to see him more often.
**Alfred Hitchcock**
The film director Alfred Hitchcock always said he didn't care about the story of his films or the acting, but he did care about the photography, the soundtrack, and all the technical parts. For Hitchcock, it wasn't the message or a great performance that moved the audience. He believed that people are excited by pure film, no matter their cultural background. So, if a film is made correctly, people from Japan and India should react the same way. Hitchcock's view of himself was always clear and logical. He was a man of reason and a talented craftsman who liked to hear an audience scream. He didn't deal with guesses, abstract ideas, or intellectual hints, and he didn't explore his screen characters deeply. He focused on film, pure film, and the precise, calculated beauty of what a strip of film can do to an audience."
CPE_57,C2,"**Amateur Astronomy**
Astronomy has changed a lot in the last 50 years. About 30 years ago, there were not many charts or catalogues. Telescopes were basic, and there were few books on how to do astronomy. Now, you can buy many different telescopes and equipment. Electronic calculators and computers have made it easier to create almanacs and charts, analyze observations, and publish results. This might be the best time for amateur astronomy. However, some things have been lost. Today, you might need to travel 80 km to find a sky as clear as it was in cities 50 years ago. During the day, airplane trails can last for hours and turn into clouds, making it hard to observe the sun and stars.
**Too Much Choice**
Today, there are too many choices. There are too many things to do and too many options. In the new economy, people always want the latest product or service, and technology makes changes happen faster. New products come out quickly, making it hard to keep up. This can make people feel tired and disconnected from life. More choices mean more stress, less time, and more complexity. Because of this, people are looking for 'simplexity'—simple things that bring meaning in a complex world. But simplifying life is hard when there are so many products and services. There are more types of detergent and breakfast cereals than we need, and more software updates and phone plans than we can follow.
**McAndrews Hotel**
Every summer, we spend two weeks at McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. It is a family tradition started by my grandmother, and it has become very important to us. We do not let anything disturb this tradition. The people who stay at McAndrews are similar: old-fashioned and maybe a bit snobbish. I do not like the rude behavior of shop assistants today, which is seen as being equal. I also do not like waiters being too friendly. I know most of the guests' names because they have been coming here since they were children, like me. But I can be sure that when I see them in the hotel, we will only exchange polite greetings. Such respect for privacy is rare in hotels these days."
CPE_9,C2,"**Othello**
An amazing production of Shakespeare's play ""Othello"" has moved from Stratford to London. This gives me a chance to correct a previous unfair review I wrote when the show first opened last spring. At that time, I said Ray Fearon was too young for the main role and criticized his acting. I still believe that changing the age difference between Othello and Desdemona affects the story, but I take back my negative comments about Mr. Fearon's excellent performance. In fact, the entire cast is outstanding. Some unforgettable scenes include Cassio's dangerous games with other young officers and the moment when Iago starts to lose control and struggles to regain it. I dare anyone not to be moved to tears during the scene where Emilia helps Desdemona get ready for bed. The pace and tension throughout the play are fantastic. Don't miss this production.
**Lake Vostok**
In the middle of Antarctica, there is no movement. On the edges of the continent, there are many penguins, seals, and birds. But on the large white plateau inside, there is no life. Except for a huge hidden freshwater lake called Lake Vostok, which is under nearly 4 kilometers of ice, right below the coldest place on earth. The water has been cut off from air and sunlight for up to 25 million years. Biologists are eager to explore its mysterious depths and find out what strange organisms live there. Geologists and glaciologists are also very interested. For two years, researchers from around the world have been planning how to uncover the lake's secrets. If they succeed, the next few years will be known as the decade of Lake Vostok.
**Scientists**
There was an interesting discussion on the radio last week. It seems that a group of scientists is getting very excited about what motivates them to be scientists. The phrase ""because it's there"" comes to mind. We all know it's the age-old quest for knowledge and the desire to understand everything from atoms to black holes. But these scientists want to know why we want to know all of this in the first place and why science can't explain our curiosity. Surely, it's more important to know whether what scientists are doing is right, rather than getting stuck in debates about the purpose of it all. I think the key issue is not why we pursue science, but to recognize that science is a tool, and we should decide how, where, when, and why to use it."
CPE_42,C2,"**Food**
Our connection with food is very basic and fulfilling. Many people who love cooking buy cookbooks like this one. Often, we think that cooking is only worth it for special occasions or complicated dishes. But that's not true. You can make a delicious soup just by putting some chopped carrots, a leek, celery, and a few herbs into water. This is much more satisfying than buying a packet or opening a can. Instead of buying a chocolate mousse with too many preservatives and additives, you can make a delicious dessert in five minutes that both adults and children will enjoy. Cooking is also a way to show care and love by bringing your own creation, no matter how simple, to the table. Sharing food is full of meaning and meets our deep human needs, which is why all our celebrations, like birthdays, anniversaries, and engagements, happen around tables. No one would have a takeaway for a wedding or anniversary party! And not many people would want to discuss a business deal over canned soup.
**In the Elevator**
This morning, Alistair tried to tidy up his office, but papers were still everywhere. Tax forms were overflowing from desk drawers and boxes, waiting for a day when he felt like filing them. He also had extra paperwork from owning an apartment building. Books and journals were near the new bookshelves but not organized. As the elevator took him to his floor, he knew Mallory would be on time for their meeting. She would knock on his office door exactly on time. She was very precise about time and neatness. How would she react to the mess? She might think someone had vandalized the place. He could pretend to be shocked when he walked in behind her. Mrs. Wilson, his cleaning lady, arrived while he was trying to clear some space on the carpet. He smiled at her hopefully as she unlocked his apartment door. Her eyes showed she wasn't going to help with the office. She believed he was like a visitor from another world, not from her familiar Brooklyn streets.
**KAREN**
Karen wanted to be different from her mother, which led her to create her own story of strength. A key moment in her life was when she was twelve, and her brother accidentally hit her in the eye with a golf club. At first, she thought she was blind, but the doctor later told her that the bone had protected her eye. She only needed a few stitches, which healed over time. When she opened her eyes in the doctor's office and saw her mother talking about miracles and small mercies, she felt she was saved for a reason.
**Miss Fogerty**
Miss Fogerty was walking quickly across the village green, feeling both excited and sad about what she had just seen. In a small community, it's thrilling to be the first to know something important, and her life was usually quiet. But she was very sad about Dr. Bailey's condition. He had been her doctor for many years, and she appreciated his care for her yearly throat infections, which were her only health issues. She valued how he always made time for his patients and listened to their worries. This quality made him very loved in the village. He was always ready to give his time, knowledge, and humor, and in return, he received loyalty and affection."
CPE_59,C2,"Joanna's Lessons
Joanna MacGregor is a busy concert pianist. Despite her hectic schedule, she has started writing books for young children learning the piano. Joanna's performances are exciting, and she plays a wide range of music styles, including classical, jazz, and blues. At a recent concert for children, a young boy asked her to play the theme from ""Match of the Day,"" a popular TV show. Joanna found this amusing and played it, impressing the boy.
Joanna is unique among top pianists because she is interested in how young children learn the piano. She has published a piano tutor book for children called ""Joanna MacGregor's Piano World,"" even though she has a very busy work schedule. She is involved in many music festivals, runs her own recording label, and often collaborates with other artists.
Joanna believes that the first piano lessons are very important. She thinks that music should be accessible to everyone, not just those with exceptional talent. She grew up in a home where her mother taught piano to many children, which influenced her view that everyone should have the chance to learn music.
Joanna is interested in children who learn at different speeds and sometimes give up. She worries that some parents push their children too hard to achieve in music, rather than letting them enjoy it. She wants her books to make learning fun and includes stories and CDs with different music styles to keep children interested.
Joanna believes practice is the most important part of learning the piano. She admits she didn't practice much until she went to the Royal Academy of Music, where she had to practice a lot to learn difficult pieces. Now, she practices eight hours a day and finds it essential to her music. She advises setting clear goals for practice and mixing easy and hard pieces to keep it enjoyable."
CPE_54,C2,"**Writing by Hand and on Screen**
Dr. Johnson once said that writing without effort is usually not enjoyable to read. This suggests that good writing is difficult to achieve. When I look back at my handwritten school essays, I notice there were very few mistakes. Today, I would rewrite them many times. I think this is because writing by hand is physically hard, which makes you think more carefully. You write with care because it's hard to change or erase. On the other hand, using a computer can make you careless. Many writers find that they spend as much time fixing drafts on a computer as they did writing by hand. Also, emails, unlike handwritten letters, can be emotionally heavy. Some say emails have brought back the art of love letters, with millions being sent instead of just casual talk. That's a good thing. At least these emails are written in some form of English and grammar. But words on a screen can feel dull. Writers often don't realize the power of written words and may exaggerate their meaning. Words typed quickly lack the care and personality of handwriting.
**The CD**
I put down my cup and looked at the CD. The case was not impressive, but the shiny disc inside was interesting. ""Aren't they amazing?"" Mr. Warriston said as he came back into the room. I agreed and carefully handed the disc to him. ""It's incredible they can fit seventy minutes of music on them,"" he said, turning on the hi-fi device. Lights came on, and he pressed a button to open a small drawer. He placed the disc inside and closed it. ""Some people say they sound too clean, but I think they..."" ""Do you have to turn them over, like records?"" I asked. ""What? No,"" Mr. Warriston replied. ""You only play one side."" ""Why?"" I asked. He looked puzzled, then thoughtful. ""You know,"" he said, ""I have no idea. You could make both sides playable and double the capacity..."" He looked at the machine. ""You could have two lasers or just turn it over by hand... hmm."" He smiled at me. ""Yes, good point."" He nodded at my chair. ""Come on, let's get you sitting in the best spot for the stereo effect, eh?"" I smiled, happy to have asked a technical question Mr. Warriston couldn't answer.
**Books versus Electronic Text**
When comparing books and electronic text, author Malcolm Bradbury was right when he said that if matches were invented after lighters, we'd think they were a great improvement. Many people, excited by new technology, say electronic text is as big a change as the invention of printing and that it's almost complete. They forget that changes in how we think take a long time. This kind of talk is self-centered, thinking our generation is at a major turning point in history. For example, a book from 1979 predicted that books would start disappearing in the 1980s. So far, that's not true. Reading long texts on a screen is unpleasant, so most people don't do it. Computers encourage people to read bits and pieces. Some say this leads to new ways of storytelling, but there's nothing new about reading non-linearly. Many books, like religious texts, dictionaries, and poetry collections, aren't read from start to finish. What's new is that computers don't encourage reading a whole text in one go.
**The Office**
Charles walked into the office and saw a perfectly organized space. The carpet was clear of the papers that had covered it since it was laid down, and the desk was dark wood, just as he remembered from the auction five weeks ago. Neat file-holders were being put in drawers. Twelve years of trade journals filled the shelves on one wall. Kathleen struggled to close the filing cabinet and then turned to him. ""You need to use computers, Charles. This is too much."" ""Hello, Kathleen. This is amazing."" He admired the room and its antique furniture. He wasn't thinking about a computer or any other device, not even a pencil sharpener. ""Simply amazing,"" he said, avoiding the topic of computers. Over the two years he had known her, they had this conversation many times. She couldn't understand why he resisted technology when he was so good with computers and had even published an important paper on computer skills. She had inspired that paper. With a keyboard, she could transform any software into something new and exciting."
CPE_32,C2,"""You don't take sugar, do you?"" shouted his secretary. She wasn't really asking because she had been making Lancelot coffee for many months. She sometimes forgot because he wasn't usually supposed to be there. But now, he was there all the time. He realized that if he stayed away, things would get out of control. He thought about how he had gone from being a respected advisor, meeting authors and playwrights for lunch, to being overwhelmed with work and having trouble finding a parking spot in the morning.
""This came,"" she yelled, waving a folder before putting it in front of him. ""From that guy in Los Angeles. You said you wanted to see it."" The label said: ""A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert."" It also said ""An Expanded Synopsis."" Lancelot didn't want to see another synopsis. He wanted to see a ""First Draft."" Ian Cuthbert had already been paid a large advance for this book when Lancelot bought the company. Ian was an old friend, and Lancelot had made the mistake of commissioning books from friends. Ian was known for being unpredictable and unreliable.
Lancelot skipped the introduction, which he had read many times, and looked at the synopsis. It was all familiar. He closed the folder and put it aside. It seemed like Ian's manuscript would never be finished. The synopsis lacked the brilliance Ian was supposed to have, and it felt like Ian had lost interest. Lancelot remembered stories of a famous author whose last book was published incomplete after his death, with payments made chapter by chapter. But Ian had already received a large advance, which was not how business usually worked.
Lancelot, who studied modern languages at Oxford, remembered when Ian was the most promising talent at Cambridge. Ian's peers had taken over British theatre quickly, but Ian's energy seemed unmatched. He wore his coat like a cape and talked about famous writers as if he knew them personally. Yet, Ian's creative potential remained untapped. While others succeeded, Ian withdrew further. He was difficult to work with even at the peak of his influence. He was supposed to edit an arts magazine but never published an issue, using up the budget for twelve. His contract with a fashion magazine produced little except stories about his high salary, which increased to try to make him work more.
At editorial meetings, Ian was critical and sarcastic. Ten years later, he was unreliable. Lancelot was starting to admit that commissioning ""A World History of the Short"" from Ian had been a mistake from the beginning."
CPE_65,C2,"'The Breakfast Change in England
Health experts agree that having a good breakfast is very important. However, in England's history, breakfast is a relatively new habit. In medieval times, breakfast was rarely mentioned in literature. There are a few mentions of travelers eating at dawn before long journeys and sick people having breakfast for health reasons, but most people did not eat breakfast unless they were kings or nobles. 
In the sixteenth century, breakfast slowly became common for everyone. Some people think this happened because there was more food available. However, they might not have considered other important social changes. For example, new work patterns could explain why breakfast became more important. People started working fixed hours, often starting very early. So, eating a meal in the morning became necessary and was no longer just for the wealthy.'"
CPE_61,C2,"**Photography**
When a photographer takes a picture, they choose what to show based on their skills, personal views, and experiences, along with social and cultural norms. In this book, we will explore how these factors influence the style, content, and expression of a photograph, and how viewers perceive and react to these images. For instance, a newspaper reader might think they understand the photos they see. However, instead of just accepting the photo as it is, we might ask if it truly shows the scene as it was. Does it reflect the photographer's perspective? Is the exact moment captured important, or should the photo be seen as a symbol of a situation in the world?
**More than a Game**
For me, sport is more than just a game. The most successful athletes have complete self-confidence. You need to focus completely if you want to succeed in sports. There's only one way to be the best, and you have to prioritize it above everything else. Sport is tough, and no one will do it for you. It's a matter of survival. Sport has taught me discipline and determination, but it also shows the value of teamwork. My sport allows you to shine individually, but it's also a team game, so you must balance both. It's similar to life - you can succeed alone, but you should remember others around you. Sport has given me a lot, not just money. It has opened opportunities and shown me things worldwide that others might never see. But you also have to sacrifice a lot for these benefits.
**Tuning In**
Some experiences are so vivid that they become clear memories. For me, one such moment happened one night in California years ago. I was awake, listening to a mockingbird singing beautifully from a hidden spot in a tall tree in the neighborhood. I don't usually have trouble sleeping, but the bird's amazing singing kept me awake. As I listened to its complex melodies, I felt like I was in a new artistic world. To follow the bird's patterns, I used my knowledge of jazz and Indian classical music. The bird made me feel like I was hearing an incredible, spontaneous musical performance. I reacted with amazement and joy as each surprising musical variation came through the open window until I finally fell asleep."
CPE_52,C2,"Birds have always been important in human culture. They are loved, feared, and even worshipped. But what does this say about us? Paul Evans explores this idea. 
In a greenhouse, a small brown bird, a wren, is bumping against the glass. Wrens are seen as mysterious birds, linked to messages and predictions. Is this wren trying to tell me something, or is it just trapped? Both could be true, depending on how you see it. Wrens have been part of British culture for a long time. In medieval times, people believed that the direction a wren flew could predict their luck. Today, wrens are still popular in British art and homes. Even if old beliefs have faded, wrens still hold a special place in our hearts. A forest without wrens feels empty and sad.
This connection to birds comes from a long history of folklore. In the past, people depended on nature for survival and developed a way to understand the world through the behavior of animals. This understanding changes over time. For example, in the 1500s, red kites were common in London and were seen as helpful scavengers. But later, they were considered pests and almost disappeared, except in Wales. Now, red kites are protected and have become symbols of conservation in Britain.
Our relationship with birds goes back to early human history. Early humans watched birds closely because they could warn of danger, bad weather, or food sources. Birds also connected people to their dreams. When we think about why birds matter to us, we also think about what it means to be human. Birds represent flight, song, and freedom, which we admire and envy. Some people might say these feelings are outdated, but they are still part of us. Birds are now seen as indicators of environmental health. In Britain, 30 bird species are endangered, which is sad not only because we lose these birds but also because we lose part of our culture. Birds like the skylark, turtle dove, and lapwing have deep cultural meanings, representing love and magic. Their loss is felt deeply by those who know their significance in literature and folklore.
Folklore is important because it keeps stories and legends alive, connecting us to the past. These stories have more power than scientific terms because they are part of everyday language. They evoke feelings and attitudes that science cannot. Whether we watch birds on TV or in our gardens, the excitement we feel is hard to explain scientifically. Birds engage us in ways we don't fully understand, and the stories we tell about them help us interpret their messages. The wren in the greenhouse is a mystery, linking the present with a distant past and holding a promise for the future."
CPE_28,C2,"Maps
Maps are used to show the relationships between different points and features on the earth's surface. These relationships are based on distance and direction. In the past, people often measured distance in time, like ""a day's journey by river,"" which told more about how easy it was to travel through the area than the actual distance. Direction was less important for travelers who mainly wanted to know ""Where do I go from here?"" and ""How far is it?"" Because of this, written travel guides were popular for a long time, even more than maps. Some maps, like those showing train routes, still don't focus on true directions. Early maps used signs to show important landmarks, and these signs varied in size to show their importance. The style of maps changed depending on their purpose and location, so understanding early maps requires knowing the specific style used.
The history of map-making, or cartography, is about improving the accuracy of distance and direction and adding more details to maps. Cartography has used other sciences to help with this. For example, instead of using shadows or stars to find direction, people used the magnetic compass, which allowed for more precise measurements. As people explored more of the world, they tried to map it. Astronomers found out that the earth is not a perfect sphere but is slightly flattened at the poles, which led to more precise mapping of large areas.
Over time, the needs of map users changed. Maps were no longer just for travelers or merchants. Soldiers needed accurate maps for artillery use, which required showing the land's surface features accurately. This led to the invention of contour lines. Archaeologists, historians, and modern geographers also needed maps for their work. Today's map makers create maps showing various distributions, like geological layers, climate, and land use. The recognition of maps' value in many sciences has led to a modern revival of cartography.
The development of maps has not been a smooth or continuous process. There have been times of slow progress and times of rapid development. Sometimes old ideas stayed alongside new ones. Cartographers often knew what needed to be done but had to wait for better tools to apply their ideas. Since making a map by copying an old one is easy, and because of the investment in printing, map publishers have sometimes resisted new ideas. Therefore, maps should not be taken as perfect evidence of the knowledge and techniques of their time. The many maps we have today are the result of much human effort and thought, making them a valuable record of human history. This is what makes studying historical maps so interesting and educational."
CPE_35,C2,"TIM RICE
I was invited into a young man's living room, which was a calm and cultured space compared to the messy rooms around it. Moving from the kitchen to his room felt like going from economy to business class on a plane. He had the largest collection of records I had ever seen, the first stereo record player and tuner I had come across, and he had even bought Georgian wine glasses, pictures, and furniture. His name was Andrew Lloyd Webber. He had won a scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford, to study history, and he had nine months before starting. During this time, he wanted to become England's version of the composer Richard Rodgers. My own dreams were just as wild; I wanted to be a pop star for the usual reasons: women, money, and fame. The difference between Andrew and me was that my dreams weren't as serious to me, although they might have been if I had failed. So, when Andrew suggested I try to become as famous a lyricist as Oscar Hammerstein, I was open to it. This was partly because, within ten minutes of meeting, he played me three tunes he had composed, and I could tell he was very talented. As he played more music from shows he had written at school, I was reminded of the best show albums from my parents' collection. He needed a new lyricist for the outside world. I didn't have much to impress him with, except for praising his music and showing him a seven-inch single of a song I had written, which an unknown pop group had recorded. We promised to meet again and write something together. I was still more interested in pop music than in West End theatre, but on the bus back to my flat, I thought I had just met someone with rare talent and determination. I would be foolish not to work with him, as he seemed destined to succeed in musical theatre. Even if we didn't become top musical composers, we could try to compete with the Beatles and Rolling Stones later. The Everly Brothers had just made a comeback and might need new songs. The next day, back at my desk where I was training to become a lawyer, my brief certainty of a life in show business with Andrew had faded a bit. I would keep looking for groups needing a vocalist and write more simple songs that suited my voice. But it seemed likely I would eventually pass my exams and become a respectable lawyer by twenty-five. By then, I might have outgrown pop music, as my father predicted I would by twenty-one. This worried me because if he was right, I only had a few more months to enjoy it. But I felt I had nothing to lose by seeing Andrew again. It would be fun to see a musical with him and write lyrics like musical lyricists instead of pop stars. Andrew was interesting and talked about good food and Victorian architecture, and he supported Leyton Orient football team. I wasn't convinced by the musical idea he had been working on for a year, but in 1965, I was rarely convinced about anything. His talent was clear, and he said he had all the contacts. I soon returned to his living room. The idea was about Dr. Thomas Barnardo, a nineteenth-century philanthropist who founded orphanages. His story was worthy but didn't excite me. The hero was too perfect, and the project seemed unoriginal, similar to Lionel Bart's hit show, Oliver. However, Andrew's belief in his music's brilliance was contagious and somewhat justified. What did I know about musicals? As David Land, who later became my agent, said, if there's a demand for one hamburger bar, there's room for two. We could be the second one. I started working with great enthusiasm, especially on the funny songs. Andrew explained the plot, played the tunes, and often gave me the titles, which his previous lyricist friend had likely thought of. I skipped a day at the law office, pretending to be sick, to write my first theatrical lyrics. I didn't know it then, but I had changed careers."
CPE_5,C2,"**Language**  
Humans have an amazing ability: we can communicate with each other using language. Language is so important in our lives that it's hard to imagine living without it. If you see two or more people together anywhere in the world, they will probably start talking. Even when people are alone, they often talk to themselves, their pets, or even their plants. I like to think of language as an 'instinct'. This means that people know how to talk naturally, just like spiders know how to spin webs. Spiders didn't learn web-spinning from a special spider school; it's something they just know how to do.
**Climate and Weather**  
Climate and weather, created by the air around us, have a big impact on where animals and plants live. Climate can shape the look of landscapes. For example, warm and wet climates all year round allow tropical jungles to grow, which are full of many different species. On the other hand, cold and windy areas have fewer living things. Weather patterns, which together form the climate, are caused by large masses of air moving and mixing because the atmosphere is always in motion. Some of this movement happens because the air is on a spinning Earth, and it doesn't move as fast as the planet. The sun is another important cause of air movement.
**Coffee**  
As a bar-person, I had to serve drinks and, more importantly, make coffee. In Lygon Street, Melbourne, a restaurant's success can depend on its coffee. I went through several days of intense training to learn how to use the restaurant's shiny espresso machine. I also learned the key steps to make a perfect cup of rich, frothy cappuccino. By the end of the first week, I realized that making good coffee was harder than it seemed, and I thought I might be moved to simpler tasks like cleaning ashtrays. Fortunately, my boss was patient. He said, 'Making coffee is both an art and a science, and you need time to learn how to do it well.'"
CPE_41,C2,"**Art on TV**
Why does television often fail with programs about visual arts? Painting and sculpture should be easy for TV to show because cameras can capture the whole artwork and zoom in on details. However, few TV series successfully show both the enjoyment and complexity of viewing art. A good example of this issue is Robert Hughes's series ""American Visions,"" which is about American art. Hughes is a trustworthy critic with a strong personality, and he had almost eight hours to introduce British viewers to American art, which is often ignored by British galleries. I expected the series to focus on great artworks, but instead, it was more about how American history and culture are shown in its art and architecture.
**Dealing in Metals**
For 20 years, I worked as an international metals dealer and became known as a risk-taker. The metals market is less regulated than others. With some luck, a willingness to take risks, and a good understanding of the market, you can make a lot of money. Risk-taking is a normal part of the industry, and it fits well with a free-market global economy. However, free-trade economists who thought the market would keep metal prices high have found the opposite. More minerals are being extracted, and raw material costs are going down. Considering inflation, most metal prices are about half of what they were 20 years ago. Recently, I was asked to investigate claims against a multinational company that benefits from these cheap raw materials.
**Extract from a Holiday Brochure**
Abaco and its nearby cays are part of the 700 islands of the Bahamas, stretching from Florida past the Tropic of Cancer to Cuba. Each island has its own character and offers something unique. To get around the islands and cays of Abaco, you need a boat. If your room doesn't include one, don't worry. There are many ferries and water-taxis. You can also rent a boat if you want to travel on your own. Sailing is the most popular way to get around here. Abaco is called 'The Sailing Capital of the World' for a good reason. The calm, protected waters are perfect for fishing, diving, snorkeling, and swimming. The cays and their beaches stretch for 200 miles like a string of pearls. At night, the lights of the restaurants and cafes in Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay shine brightly."
CPE_69,C2,"**Build Your Own Bamboo Bike in the UK**
At the Bamboo Bike Club, run by engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan, you can join a course to build your own custom bamboo bike frame. The workshop is located in Hackney Wick, east London. It's a lively place where you can hear the sound of machinery as people work on their bikes. Bamboo is becoming a popular material for bike construction, with companies like Calfee Design in California and Bamboo Bikes in Yorkshire using it. However, their bikes can be expensive, costing around $2,995 or £1,868.
James and Ian wanted to make bamboo bikes more affordable. They spent years developing their idea in a shed in Brecon, Wales. They realized they didn't just want to sell bike frames; they wanted to share the experience of making something unique and sustainable. This led to the creation of the Bamboo Bike Club, which is more like a community than a business. James and Ian still have full-time jobs—James works with wind turbines, and Ian is a civil engineer—but they run monthly courses where you can build your own bike frame for a reasonable price.
During the course, you'll learn how to choose bamboo for strength and how to make strong joints. You'll start by assembling the front triangle of the bike with 40 mm diameter bamboo, then move on to the seat and chain assembly. Metal tubes are used for parts that need extra strength, like the handlebars and wheel forks. James and Ian are there to help and supervise, ensuring everything is done correctly.
Building the bike yourself is a big part of the fun, and many participants are engineers. But don't worry if you're not an expert—everyone makes mistakes, and you can always try again with a new piece of bamboo. The bamboo is pre-checked for quality, and you can choose from different styles, like plain, black, or mottled bamboo.
On the second day, you'll focus on building the lugs, or wraps, using hemp bindings and epoxy resin to create strong joints. After adding a waterproof coating, the bike is ready for wheels, brakes, gears, and other parts. The finished bike is strong and durable, just like metal bikes. Ian has used his bamboo bike for over a year on a 16-mile commute, and James has tested one off-road for three months without any issues.
Bamboo bikes might look a bit rough compared to professional frames, but they have a unique charm. They are great for a relaxed ride rather than racing. I chose a 'Classic English' frame for a smooth, easy-going ride. Bamboo bikes are light and absorb vibrations well, making them comfortable to ride. James says the real joy comes when you take the bike on the road. And the best part? The cost is less than £500."
CPE_38,C2,"**Self-help Books**
Dione Reverend was just an editor at Random House in New York when she found a manuscript by an unknown psychologist, Dr. John Gray. She immediately knew it would be a bestseller, and she was right. Dr. Gray is now very successful, and Dione Reverend has her own company. Dr. Gray's book on communication between men and women is very popular and is part of a growing self-help industry. This industry claims to help people improve their lives, but it also benefits from people's desires to get better. It supports the publishing world in New York. In Britain, the self-help genre is also becoming popular, with many books being published. However, many self-help books are rejected for being too similar to others or too specific. Editors focus on how marketable a book is, asking questions like, ""How promotable is the author?"" and ""Is the idea universal?"" A catchy title is very important for success.
**Autobiographies**
When someone writes an autobiography, there is an unspoken agreement with the reader that they are telling the truth. However, this is not always the case. Writers might leave out embarrassing details or things they think are not important. Some writers might even invent stories to better express the truth about themselves. Others might call their book an autobiography to make readers believe it is true, even if it is fiction. This is not always done with bad intentions.
**Dashiell Hammett's Detective Stories**
Detective stories became popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries because they reflect the conflicts of that time. These stories are like allegories, where the crime represents human desires like lust or greed. Solving the crime shows how society can return to normal. In Hammett's stories, society is shown as corrupt. The detective and the criminal understand each other and are similar. The detective is both a part of the law and a bit of a criminal. His mission is complicated by his understanding of both sides.
**Science Writing**
Stephen Jay Gould is a well-known science essayist. He believes that to write well about science, you need to understand the scientific community. He says you should never simplify the argument for the reader, even if you simplify the language. If readers feel they are being talked down to, they will lose interest."
CPE_17,C2,"**Air-conditioning**
At Cannons Gym in the City of London, the air feels very cold. The gym has used a lot of air-conditioning to deal with the very hot summer. Sometimes, it feels as cold as the Arctic inside. This is an example of how people often use too much air-conditioning. Air-conditioning is now a big part of our lives, showing how we can control or change the climate. However, many buildings could use other ways to stay cool. They could use natural light and air, and have thicker walls that keep out heat during the day and release it at night. These simple ideas can work well and reduce the need for air-conditioning.
**Sundials**
It is interesting that as we start a new millennium, people are again interested in sundials. Sundials are tools that tell time by the sun's position. A hundred years ago, they were important for keeping time accurately. But as clocks and watches improved, sundials became just garden decorations. Now, people are taking them seriously again. David Harber, who makes sundials, thinks they are popular because they connect us to the planets. He says there is a magical moment when a sundial starts working. They are calm and romantic objects that remind us of our place in the universe.
**Paint Your Own China**
I used to think china-painting was only for very skilled people. I once saw older women at an arts and crafts show painting teacups with perfect flowers. They were so precise that it seemed they had been doing it for many years or had a special talent. I wondered who would be brave enough to take a china-painting class. Would beginners also be naturally good at it? But when I visited a class, it was not scary at all. The students were there to have fun, and even the teacher did not want to paint flowers on teacups as quickly as I remembered."
CPE_47,C2,"Uncle chose a package holiday for Keith and Dawne at a good price: a flight from Gatwick Airport and twelve nights in Venice at the Pensione Concordia. When they went to book the trip, the travel agent told them that the other people in their package were a school group learning Italian. But something went wrong. Either at the travel agency, the check-in desk, or in a computer, a mistake happened. Keith and Dawne ended up in a hotel called the Edelweiss, in Room 212, in Switzerland. 
At Gatwick, they gave their tickets to a girl in a yellow-and-red uniform. She checked their tickets and said everything was fine. On the plane, they were surprised to hear people speaking with North of England accents. Keith thought maybe there was a cancellation or the Italian class was on another plane. They ordered drinks and relaxed. 
When they arrived, a woman with glasses told everyone to stay together. There was no mention of an overnight stop in the brochure, but Keith thought it was just a stopover. It was almost midnight when they got off the coach, and they were too tired to question the situation. The next morning, they realized they were staying there for the whole holiday. 
The receptionist told them about the lake and the steamer to Interlaken. Keith calmly explained there was a mistake; they were supposed to be in Venice. The receptionist didn't know about any mistake. Dawne described the travel agent who booked their trip. 
A woman named Mrs. Franks, who they saw at Gatwick, approached them. Dawne explained they were in the wrong hotel. Keith said they followed the wrong group. Mrs. Franks explained that many holidays have similar tickets and labels, and it was easy to follow the wrong group. 
Keith insisted they were not supposed to be in Switzerland. Mrs. Franks left to check, and the receptionist was gone too. Dawne thought Mrs. Franks seemed kind. Keith tried to remember everything that happened at the airport. An elderly couple, Mr. and Mrs. Nottage, talked to them about how well they slept. 
Keith and Dawne left the reception area. They didn't mention the irony of ending up on a holiday with elderly people when they wanted to escape the demands of the elderly. Uncle had insisted on this holiday for them."
CPE_48,C2,"**He Was a People Person**
American business leaders are now looking up to the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton as a great example of good management. Eluned Price reports on this trend. In Britain, many people know who Sir Ernest Shackleton was and have a basic idea of his achievements. However, in America, he is only recently becoming well-known. The Wall Street Journal even called him 'an Antarctic explorer whose feats went unnoticed for most of the 20th century,' which might be an exaggeration. But now, Americans are very enthusiastic about him. Many biographies and stories about his famous voyage on the Endurance are being written and are expected to sell quickly. The American Museum of Natural History is planning a big exhibition, and Columbia Tristar is making a movie about Shackleton's life.
Some American managers see Shackleton as a role model. They admire his actions and learn lessons in leadership and communication from his story. They even use the term 'speaking Shackleton' among themselves. Shackleton, known for being determined and resourceful, is now a model for modern management consultants. Jim MacGregor, a managing partner at Abernathy MacGregor Frank in New York, has been inspired by Shackleton for years. His company deals with communication during mergers, acquisitions, and corporate crises, like when a company's plant explodes or when many employees are laid off.
Shackleton once worked in public relations for a Glasgow steel company, but it might be hard to see how surviving on albatross meat in freezing temperatures relates to handling a financial crisis. MacGregor says, 'Even if a company manages its crises well, it can still cause problems if it communicates poorly.' Shackleton is a model for management because he was a great leader and communicator. He had strong values and was at his best when he and his team had a lot to lose, like their lives. One of Shackleton's most important decisions was to turn back when he was only 97 miles from the South Pole. This decision showed his credibility for future expeditions because he prioritized the lives of his men.
In 1908, Shackleton's expedition to the South Pole was 97 miles short of their goal. With supplies running low and limited time to return to their ship, Shackleton made the brave decision to turn back. In a crisis, MacGregor says, people want to know someone is in charge. While many managers today avoid responsibility, Shackleton was ready to take it. His 1914 expedition became legendary. His ship, the Endurance, was trapped in ice for nine months and eventually crushed. Shackleton told his men, 'We will all reach safety if you continue to do your best and trust me.' From their diaries, it's clear that Shackleton was always in charge.
Shackleton planned for every situation, kept his men informed, and asked for their opinions. He was flexible and ready to start over if needed. MacGregor says, 'We've created a set of principles based on Shackleton's story. Clients can relate to it without feeling criticized.' Shackleton believed an explorer needs optimism, physical endurance, and patience. MacGregor adds, 'One of the hardest things to do in difficult times is to wait, especially in America, where people want quick solutions.' For example, if you buy bonds and the interest rates change, you should wait instead of selling at a loss. Also, don't be afraid to change plans if they're not working. If a new product fails, stop selling it.
Shackleton led by example. On the return journey from the Endurance, he saw Hurley, the expedition photographer, without gloves. He gave Hurley his own gloves, saying he would throw them overboard if Hurley didn't wear them. Someone else remembered Shackleton doing the same with a biscuit when they were starving in 1905: 'He said he'd leave it in the snow. Millions of pounds couldn't have bought that biscuit.' Caroline Alexander, author of ""Endurance,"" says, 'People are more interested in heroic stories now. Shackleton shows that there is little heroism today. He stands out as a true example of the ideals we miss.'"
CAE_15,C1,"In the forests of Madagascar, there is a primate called the aye-aye that has a lifestyle similar to a woodpecker. Both the woodpecker and the aye-aye search for insect larvae inside wood. The woodpecker uses its beak to make holes and its long tongue to get the insects. The aye-aye uses its sharp teeth to gnaw into the wood and its long, thin third finger to reach and scoop out the insects.
Although scientists described the aye-aye's feeding habits over a hundred years ago, they have only recently discovered how it finds insects hidden in the wood. Dr. Carl Erickson from Duke University studied the hunting skills of some aye-ayes named Nosferatu, Poe, Samantha, and her daughter Annabelle. He tested if they found insects by looking for visual signs, like holes on the wood surface. He gave them logs with drilled holes, some leading to mealworms and others to empty spaces. The aye-ayes went directly to the mealworms, showing they didn't rely on visual clues.
Dr. Erickson also tested if the aye-ayes used smell or sound to find the insects. Even when the smell was blocked, and the insects were dead and silent, the aye-ayes still found them. It seemed they could sense the empty spaces in the wood. The aye-aye taps the wood with its middle finger and listens with its large ears. Dr. Erickson thinks they use echo-location, listening for sounds that indicate a hollow space below. They might also hear insects moving when disturbed by the tapping.
The idea that the aye-aye takes the place of woodpeckers in Madagascar is interesting, but there are birds like the Sickle-billed and Nuthatch Vangas that also search for insects in wood. The aye-aye is unique because it combines features of a woodpecker, an echo-locating bat, and a squirrel. Its teeth grow continuously like a squirrel's, and it has been seen in the wild gnawing through nut shells and using its long finger to get the nut meat."
CAE_19,C1,"Title: 'Ordinary People, Ordinary Lives'
Most of us have photos of our grandparents, but do we really know what their lives were like when they were young? Diaries and family stories often give us only small, incomplete pictures. And what will our grandchildren know about us? We often plan to write things down but never do. We might leave videos instead of photos, but they still don't tell the whole story.
Hannah Renier has a solution: she writes autobiographies for other people, creating a book of at least 20,000 words, with pictures if wanted. These books are not about famous people, but about ordinary ones. The idea came to her when she talked to her family and realized how much of the past was being forgotten. ""When I started, I didn't take it as seriously as I do now,"" she says. ""People do it for their children or for the future, but they also enjoy it themselves.""
The promise of privacy helps people be honest. A 62-year-old man who made and lost a fortune said, ""I was surprised at what came out. There were painful things, like my divorce."" He did it for his family, hoping they might learn something, but hasn't let his children read it yet. He thinks they should read it after he is gone.
Ms. Renier has noticed that many people repeat patterns from their childhood. ""It's amazing how many people are influenced by their parents,"" she says. ""Things their parents said or did affect them for life. They might marry someone their parents would like, or do the opposite to rebel.""
Many people still feel disappointed about things that happened long ago. Even in middle age, they try to impress a parent who was never impressed. Some want to say, ""I can't stand my mother.""
Ms. Renier listens and writes, but she is not nosy. ""It's not for the public, and I'm not there to pry. People sometimes tell me things and then say, 'I'm not sure if that should go in.' I include it, but they can remove it later. Most people want to be honest.""
This is not about showing off. It's about keeping a connection to the past. We are losing touch with history because families don't stay together like they used to. People want a little bit of immortality.
Each book takes about 30 hours of interviews, which Ms. Renier uses to write the life story. Modern technology helps her produce everything except the book cover. The final product is high quality and costs nearly £3,000, with extra copies at £25 each. She gets about 10 inquiries a week, but the cost stops many people. ""I thought it would be more affordable,"" she says. ""But the people I've worked with are often wealthy, like readers of Harpers & Queen, where I advertise. They are the kind of people who might have had their portraits painted for their descendants."""

The Museum of Classical Archaeology has one of the few collections of Greek and Roman sculpture casts in the world, with over six hundred pieces. Remember, none of the sculptures here are real; they are all accurate copies made from the originals, mostly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Museum is in a special gallery with great natural light. Plaster casts have many benefits: sculptures that were originally displayed together but are now in different museums across Europe can be seen together as they were meant to be. You can see almost all the famous Greek and Roman sculptures in one afternoon.

This collection has over 400,000 air photographs, both oblique and vertical, taken by university staff over the past 45 years. The University has its own aircraft at Cambridge Airport and takes photos throughout Great Britain. The photos are interesting as they show detailed records of the landscape, including natural environments and human activities from prehistoric times to today. There is a small display in the entrance hall, and the knowledgeable library staff can help with inquiries. The photos cannot be borrowed, but copies can be purchased, usually taking about a month to make.
**E. Cambridge Medieval Brass Rubbing Centre**  
The Cambridge Brass Rubbing Centre is the second oldest and longest-running center of its kind in the world and is a unique tourist attraction. Visitors can enjoy making wall hangings by rubbing one of over a hundred different brass plates from the tombs of medieval knights and ladies. By creating resin copies, known as facsimiles, the center preserves the originals while allowing everyone to enjoy brass rubbing. Brass plates, used as memorials instead of tomb statues, spread from Germany across medieval Europe and Scandinavia. Many were destroyed during various revolutions, but most of the remaining brasses are in Britain, with the widest range at the Cambridge Centre."
CAE_13,C1,"**From Here to Fatherhood**
**A. The Theatre Director**
I have had 35 years of raising young children, and I have loved every moment of it. This morning, I fed the baby, and for me, that's what being a father is all about. I'm very lucky because my children and I share interests like opera, theatre, books, and music. This has created a strong bond between us, especially now that they are mostly grown up, and I am more of a friend than a father. I don't believe in physical punishment. I have slapped my children in anger before, but I don't support it. I may not have been the most attentive father, but I have always tried to be available. I'm here if they need me, but I let them contact me first. If you start chasing them to ask why they haven't been in touch, it creates a burden of guilt. My parents did that to me, and I would never do it to my children.
**B. The Advertising Executive**
I was young when my children were born, around 25, and I found the responsibilities difficult. It made me feel older quickly, but it also kept me young, which I value. As they became teenagers, they introduced me to music, youth culture, and fashion. This has been very helpful for my work at the agency. I have never felt out of touch. When they were young, I was busy building my business, so I missed some important events like their first concerts and sports days. I feel sad about that, but now I can take them on holidays to the south of France. They get along well with our friends and come to parties and advertising award ceremonies with us without feeling shy. I think it's an advantage that they see my job as glamorous and interesting.
**C. The Politician**
My first child was born just as I was about to be elected to the Greater London Council, and the others came soon after. My wife and I promised to make time for them, but as I became more politically active, time became a problem. I only accept weekend meetings and public events where my kids can come with me. This way, they know what I do when I'm not with them, and there's no feeling of me disappearing. I've noticed more MPs bringing their kids to the House. Maybe we are all realizing the importance of involving our children in our lives.
**D. The Writer**
My first marriage ended when Kate and Bonnie were young, so I had to think a lot about being a father. I worked hard to stay in touch with them. My ex-wife and I even tried living next door to each other so the kids could come and go as they wanted, but I think they found it confusing. Kate has said in interviews that I was always there for her, but I'm not sure I was a very good father. I was around a lot, but like many parents in the Seventies, I treated the kids as adults too soon. Kate recently complained that we were too liberal. I think I should have been more organized. I regret that now. I still worry about my older daughters as much as my youngest. In that way, your kids never leave you.
**E. The TV Presenter**
I was ready for kids. I was 30, met my wife, and we had a nice house, so we thought, ""Why keep spending money on new things when we could have a child instead?"" Having my daughter Betty has made me understand who I am. You feel special when you have a child, and you are, but you also become just another parent. It's a great equalizer. Sometimes I feel annoyed, but one look at her and it goes away. A baby's smile is the best way to melt a grown man's heart."

CAE_46,C1,"**Science Defying Gravity**
Journalist Tom Mumford joins students testing their ideas in weightlessness. From the outside, it looked like a regular airplane. The pilot told the young passengers it was a Boeing KC-135 refueling tanker, built in 1964, similar to a Boeing 707 passenger plane. But inside, it was different. The 13 students from Europe and America were about to have an unforgettable flight. The inside was a long white tunnel with few windows, lit by lights along the padded walls. Most seats were removed, except for a few at the back where the nervous students sat. For a year, they competed with other students to join this flight, a challenge by the European Space Agency to propose creative experiments in weightless conditions. The best ideas won a spot on this unique flight, which was like an extraordinary roller-coaster ride.
For the next two hours, the Boeing would fly like a giant bird, going up and down. The goal was to create a weightless state at the top of each curve. At 3,000 meters, the pilot cut the engines, and the plane continued upward by momentum before gravity pulled it down again. In those few silent seconds between going up and falling, everything inside became weightless, and the students felt closer to the moon than Earth.
The takeoff was smooth, but any thoughts of a normal flight disappeared when the pilot made the plane climb at a 45-degree angle for about 20 seconds. The engines roared, blood rushed from our heads, and we were scattered across the cabin floor. Then the engines stopped, and we instantly felt weightless. For 20 seconds, we floated in silence: the floor felt like a trampoline, and one step sent us towards the ceiling. We floated aimlessly; directions like left, right, up, or down no longer made sense. Only gravity helps us understand movement.
After ten seconds of freefall, the pilot pulled the plane out of its dive. Gravity returned suddenly, causing some students to land with a bump. After the first curve, some students felt sick thinking about the 29 more to come. Thirty curves gave ten minutes of 'space time' for experiments. The Dutch students studied their robotic cat, Leonardo, to see how cats always land on their feet. They used a device to turn it belly-down with radio controls. During another curve, a student accidentally landed on it. Nearby, a German team from the University of Aachen studied how metal joins are affected by no gravity, important for future space stations. A team from Utah State University explored making solar sails from thin liquid films hardened by sunlight. They tried to create these films in microgravity, believing satellites could use solar sails like yachts use wind.
After two hours of swinging between heaven and Earth, breakfast felt unstable, but the main feeling was excitement, not sickness. This feeling would last a long time. ""It was an unforgettable experience,"" said one student. ""I wanted to become an astronaut before, but now I want to even more."""
CAE_3,C1,"**With the Trees, I Planted My Stake in New Zealand**
**Jonathon Porritt Talks to Danny Danziger**
Jonathon Porritt is the author of *Seeing Green - The Politics of Ecology*.
I had a unique time in my life when I didn't experience any summers. I traveled to New Zealand every summer from here, which is winter in New Zealand, so I had nine winters in a row. I enjoyed it because I like winter. My parents had the idea to buy a small piece of land for my brother, sister, and me to take care of. My mother said, ""If you plant trees on it, you can have it."" This way, we would always have a connection to New Zealand, which was nice since my father grew up there. They found a plot about 20 miles north of Auckland in a place called Rangitoupuni. The land wasn't very good, but it was suitable for planting trees.
I've always been interested in land. I spent a year in Australia working on sheep farms and doing various farming jobs, so the idea of planting trees sounded great to me. I was eager to start, and my family became enthusiastic as we progressed. We began planting in 1968, and by the end of 1972, we had planted the entire 70 acres.
In 1968, it was a very rainy winter in New Zealand. It rained almost every day while we were planting, and I don't think I've ever been wetter or colder for such a long time. Every morning, there was a moment of truth: getting ready for another day of planting. We would step out of the Land Rover, warm and dry, into the rain, with our anoraks still damp from the day before, boots soaked, and hands struggling with wet laces.
In the first year, I worked with an experienced tree-planter, which was helpful since I had never planted trees seriously before. You carry a planting bag around your neck filled with as many trees as possible. When the bag is full, it's difficult, but it gets easier as it becomes lighter. The hardest part was getting the lines straight. You decide the spacing for the trees, line up three poles across a long distance, and those poles guide your lines. Once aligned, you plant all the way down the line, turn around, and come back.
I enjoy hard physical work, and it made me fit. After a while, you can plant trees almost automatically, finding a rhythm and using the fewest spade strokes needed to dig a hole. This rhythm is common in many farming jobs, where you train your body to perform standard moves, making the process easy: taking the tree out of the bag, digging a hole, planting it, stamping it in, and moving on.
Mentally, it's interesting. Your mind starts to wander, and you think about life. Many of my thoughts about the natural world and our place in it began during those days. I've returned to New Zealand four times since then and watched the trees grow, which is satisfying because I planted them and feel connected to their success. I worry when I read about storms or droughts in New Zealand, but the trees are now 20 years old and doing well.
In 1984, I took a break from teaching and returned to New Zealand alone for three months. I wrote my first book, *Seeing Green*, there. There's a simple cabin on the tree farm with just a bed, table, and chair. I wrote in the mornings, pruned trees in the afternoons, and did research in the evenings. My connection to that area is still very strong. It's the place where I feel most connected to the earth, a powerful bond."

CAE_67,C1,"'In search of true north - and the man behind Halley's comet Dr. Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, wants to follow Sir Edmund Halley's journey to map compass variations. Anjana Ahuja reports. Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) is famous for the comet named after him. However, one of his important achievements was mapping 'compass variations' during his sea voyages on the warship Paramore. These variations, now called 'declination', are the angle between magnetic north and true north. Without knowing this, sailors couldn't correct their compasses, making it hard to find longitude and navigate the seas. Halley, one of the few people paid to do scientific research at the time, set sail for the Cape Verde Islands to map declination in the North and South Atlantic. The trip was stopped early due to crew problems, but Halley tried again. This time, he traveled to Rio de Janeiro, South Georgia, Newfoundland, and back to England. From these travels, Halley published a 'New and Correct Chart showing the Variations of the Compass in the Western and Southern Oceans' in 1701. This chart was very useful to sailors for over a century until changes in Earth's magnetic field made it outdated. Dr. Clark, who enjoys sailing, plans to celebrate the 300th anniversary of Halley's trip by following the Paramore's route. He needs to raise £70,000 before starting, and Sir Vivian Fuchs, known for leading the first cross-Antarctica expedition, is supporting him. Dr. Clark became interested in Halley during a two-year stay at Halley Station in Antarctica, where he read about the scientist. 'Halley led a remarkable life,' says Dr. Clark. 'He was a respected scientist and led expeditions. He wasn't just an astronomer; he also did research in geophysics. While he was Astronomer Royal, he mapped stars and found time for other interests.' During this time, Halley developed a diving bell and advised Sir Isaac Newton on his book Principia Mathematica, the foundation of classical physics. Dr. Clark believes recreating the voyage will give Halley the recognition he deserves. The expedition, called 'In the Wake of the Paramore', will also have scientific value. It will involve taking the same measurements Halley did, but with more precise instruments. These measurements need updating because Earth's magnetic field is always changing. The data collected will help improve the current model of Earth's magnetic field, known as the international geomagnetic reference field. 'It's common to measure the size but not the direction of the magnetic field. You need to know true north to measure the direction,' says Dr. Clark. 'On our expedition, we can use global positioning satellites to find that.' The British Geological Survey and the United States Navy will provide instruments. A Danish satellite will also be taking similar measurements globally. Dr. Clark hopes his measurements will fill any gaps in the satellite's coverage of the Atlantic Ocean and notes that ground-based measurements are useful for comparison. It's easy to forget how important Halley's Atlantic journey was. It was the first scientific sea expedition, and Halley was the first civilian appointed as a naval captain to pursue what many saw as an obsession with declination. Does Dr. Clark have the skills to make his voyage successful? Besides spending two years in Antarctica and working in the geomagnetic group at the British Geological Survey, he has already sailed 13,000 kilometers from Rio de Janeiro to England. He plans to complete the expedition in four stages with four different crews. Does he share Halley's obsessive nature? 'I'm willing to dedicate eight months of my life to this, so some might think I'm obsessed. But I wouldn't want to cross the Atlantic again without a good reason. Halley and his fascinating life have given me a real sense of purpose.'"
CAE_27,C1,"Every summer, the peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire show off their beautiful tails to the female peacocks, or hens. This display raises a question that puzzled Charles Darwin: in a world where survival is tough, why do peacocks have such extravagant tails? Darwin believed that animals evolved through natural selection, meaning the strongest and smartest survive. However, the peacock's tail seemed to be a disadvantage, so Darwin suggested another idea called 'sexual selection.' He thought females chose mates based on beauty alone. 
Darwin's friend, Alfred Russel Wallace, disagreed. He believed that if hens chose the most beautiful males, there must be a reason beyond just looks. Wallace thought the tail might signal some hidden quality that helped survival. Today, scientists like Marion Petrie are studying peacocks at Whipsnade to find answers. They want to know if hens really prefer males with the showiest tails and if these males have other advantages.
Observations show that hens do prefer males with more eye-spots on their tails, which attract more mates. However, it's unclear if these males are better in other ways. Some scientists, like William Hamilton, suggest that showy males might be healthier and free of parasites, but this hasn't been proven in Whipsnade peacocks yet. 
This year, Dr. Petrie is comparing the offspring of attractive and less attractive males to see if the former grow faster or are healthier. If they are, it would support Wallace's idea that female choice is practical. 
There's another theory by R.A. Fisher called 'Fisher's Runaway.' It suggests that if females start preferring slightly better tails, over generations, this preference and the trait itself will grow stronger. This could explain the peacock's tail and support Darwin's idea of 'beauty for beauty's sake.'"
CAE_66,C1,"**THE BOAT OF MY DREAMS**
Tom Cunliffe believes the best boat design should mix old and new ideas. He did this with his own boat, 'The Westerman'. This week, the Summer Boat Show in London is full of modern yachts with the latest technology. Most of these yachts are based on design changes from 25 years ago. In contrast, my boat is quietly anchored in a tidal creek on the south coast. It was designed last year, but it looks like it could be 100 years old. Some might think I'm a romantic dreamer, but I don't think so. My boat uses the best of old boat designs, but modern technology made it easier to build. However, while technology is important in boat design today, it often separates sailors from the real experiences of being at sea. These are the experiences they wanted to find by sailing. I'm not saying sailors should suffer, but I believe boats should have a coal stove for warmth and comfortable beds. But why sail if everything is done automatically? Sometimes, dealing with sails is part of the adventure. Also, why move the steering from the safe back of the boat to a risky spot in the middle? This change is often made to create more space inside, like a big cabin. For me, a boat should be a boat, not a floating house. 
When I bought my previous boat, Hirta, for a TV race around Britain, the former owner said it had comfort but no luxury. During my time with Hirta, I learned he was right. Hirta had heavy sails, no pumped water, no electricity, no fridge, no central heating, no winches, and no electronics, especially for navigation. Yet, she was the easiest boat I've ever sailed. However, old boats need a lot of care. After a back injury, I realized I had to let Hirta go. I couldn't find a suitable new boat, so I decided to build one. The Westerman has never let me down. Designer Nigel Irens and his assistant Ed Burnett used computers for the design, but Irens first sketched the boat on a napkin. He then made a model, like in the old days. We reviewed the model and made changes on the computer. The final design was perfect. The Westerman has crossed the North Atlantic and won four out of six races. She looks timeless, sails beautifully, and her interior, made from reclaimed wood, feels peaceful. This is because she was designed as a sailing boat first, without focusing on furniture. This traditional method works well. The Westerman shows that you don't need to follow trends to be happy and that history can teach us valuable lessons. Made from wood treated with a special glue, she is completely waterproof. She has all the benefits of a fiberglass boat but looks, feels, and sails like a classic wooden boat."
CAE_44,C1,"**RETREAT, RELAX, RECHARGE**
Health farms and country house hotels with spa facilities are becoming very popular. We asked five journalists to visit some of these places.
**A. HENLOW GRANGE**
I was excited to visit Henlow Grange for six days because I was tired and needed a break. My room in the large 18th-century house was very comfortable, and I felt relaxed right away. On the first day, I rested and slept a lot. From the second day, I joined many classes like body conditioning, yoga, and stretching. The instructors are very skilled, and I felt more flexible as the week went on. They offer many treatments, such as aromatherapy, seaweed baths, manicures, and pedicures. The one-hour facial made me feel refreshed. The staff were friendly and professional, creating a lively and enthusiastic atmosphere. Henlow plans to add a half-size Olympic swimming pool and a Light Diet Room this year. You can also ride bicycles around the grounds or enjoy a walk in the garden. My mood and appetite improved during my stay, and I left feeling energetic. I look forward to visiting again. This is a great break for busy working women. Save Room 5 for me! - Marcella D'Argy Smith
**B. SHRUBLAND HALL**
The calm and relaxing atmosphere of this grand home was clear as soon as I entered. The Hall has a beautifully decorated library, a lovely conservatory, and lots of space, so you can have privacy if you want. Everyone gets a medical check-up on arrival, which includes checking weight and blood pressure. We were called patients, which felt strange since I am healthy. However, they found a shoulder problem during the check-up, and the fitness instructor helped me with it in group and individual sessions. Each person gets a specific diet plan. I lost weight without fasting, but I was hungry and got a headache on the second day. My daily menu included grapefruit and honey for breakfast, salads for lunch, and exotic fruit with yogurt and hot broth for dinner. If you're not on a diet, you can eat in the main dining hall, where the food is tasty. You get a massage or water therapy every other day, and extra treatments are reasonably priced. - Liz Gregory
**C. CAREYS MANOR**
Careys is not a health farm and doesn't claim to be. It's a charming old manor with cozy log fires and a large lounge. If you're watching your weight, you might want to skip the gourmet food. The French chef makes rich sauces and delicious desserts. Luckily, the hotel has a gym and a pool to help burn off the extra calories. You can choose a 'health-conscious' diet if you want to lose weight. There is also a spa bath, steam room, Swiss shower, sauna, and treatment rooms. A big attraction is the sports injury clinic, where I got advice on an old shoulder injury. The physiotherapist suggested good posture, exercises, and massage. Careys is comfortable and luxurious, relaxed and calm. If you want to explore, there is beautiful countryside nearby. - Beverly D'Silva
**D. CLIVEDEN**
Cliveden is a grand country home and a five-star hotel that treats guests like royalty. It offers health and beauty treatments, a gym, saunas, a swimming pool, tennis, horse riding, and more. There are beautiful woodland walks and gardens on the 376-acre National Trust estate. Waldo's, a famous restaurant, offers amazing dishes. The dinner menu has many choices, and the meal was fantastic, especially the sticky-toffee pudding with banana ice cream. I went to bed happy! The next morning, I spent a few hours in the gym to burn off some calories before my next meal. In the Pavilion, I enjoyed a facial with gentle heat and essential oils, followed by an aromatherapy massage. Cliveden offers fitness assessments, workouts, and beauty treatments if you want them, before enjoying a meal at Waldo's. - Kay Letch
**E. SPRINGS HYDRO**
The best and worst thing about Springs Hydro is the carrot cake. It's the best because it's delicious, but the worst because it's 360 calories, which isn't great if you're trying to lose weight. You've been warned! The second best thing is the wonderful aromatherapy massage. I chose relaxing oils and fell asleep twice during the massage. I returned to my room feeling refreshed and had a great night's sleep. The facilities are modern and well-run, with luxurious bedrooms. There are many therapists and beauty rooms, so it's easy to schedule appointments. They offer a variety of treatments, from manicures and pedicures to deep-cleansing facials and body treatments. Guests include football teams, mothers and daughters, best friends, and singles. I would love to visit here once a month. - Eve Cameron"
CAE_22,C1,"**NATURAL TALENTS**
In the seven million years since humans split from chimpanzees, we haven't changed much genetically. We are still more than 98% the same as chimps. This means that what makes us different from animals is a recent development. Our ability to create art and other human traits must come from a small part of our genes. This is why studies show that the differences between humans and animals are often just a matter of degree. For example, both humans and animals use tools: chimpanzees use sticks, and sea otters use rocks. Monkeys have simple languages with different sounds for different predators like leopards and snakes. 
The main difference between us and animals might be art. But if art is a unique human trait, it's strange that our ancestors didn't create it for most of our history. The earliest art might have been wood carvings or body painting, but these don't last over time. Clear evidence of human art, like cave paintings and statues, only appears around 35,000 years ago with the Cro-Magnons.
If we say our art sets us apart, we often claim three things: human art is not useful, it's made for pleasure, and it's learned, not instinctive. Let's look at these claims. First, as Oscar Wilde said, ""All art is quite useless."" This means human art doesn't help us survive or reproduce, unlike most animal behaviors. For example, birds sing to defend territory or attract mates, which helps pass on their genes. By this measure, human art is different.
The second claim is that human art is motivated by aesthetic pleasure. We can't ask birds if they enjoy their songs, but they mostly sing during breeding season, suggesting they sing for reasons other than pleasure. Again, human art seems unique here.
The third claim is that human art is learned. Different human groups have distinct art styles that are learned, not inherited. For example, songs in Tokyo and Paris are different, but people can learn each other's songs. In contrast, some birds inherit their songs and would sing them even if they never heard them. It's like a French baby raised in Japan singing the French national anthem without being taught.
Human art changes quickly. Geese honked 2,000 years ago as they do today, but human art evolves fast. Even a casual museum visitor can tell a 20th-century painting from the Mona Lisa. Experts can often identify when and who painted a work. However, they might mistake paintings by two chimpanzees, Congo and Betsy, for human art. Congo created many paintings in a day and got upset when his pencil was taken away. In 1957, their paintings were shown in London, and many were sold, which some human artists can't claim.
These chimpanzee paintings blur the line between human art and animal activities. Like human art, they weren't made for practical reasons but for the painter's satisfaction. You might argue that human art is different because it's meant to communicate. However, some famous human art was created for the artist's personal satisfaction, not to communicate with others."
CAE_39,C1,"Title: A Big Adventure
The Taklamakan Desert in western China is one of the last places on earth that hasn't been fully explored. It's also very dangerous. Charles Blackmore crossed it and survived to share his story. Today, there are not many big adventures or heroes left. In the past, children's stories often featured brave explorers with sunburnt skin and eyes focused on distant horizons as they journeyed into the unknown. Nowadays, such people are rare in both fiction and real life. But then I met Charles Blackmore.
Blackmore led an expedition across the Taklamakan Desert, one of the last unexplored places on earth. Its name means 'once entered you never come out', and locals call it the Desert of Death. He remembered the dangers and excitement of the journey while sitting calmly at home. His team included four Britons (one was a medical officer), an American photographer, four Chinese experts, 30 camels, and six camel handlers. It turned out the camel handlers had never worked with camels before; they were actually long-distance truck drivers. This misunderstanding could have been very dangerous and put the expedition at risk.
This diverse group set out to cross 1,200 kilometers of one of the world's toughest deserts. Charles Blackmore wrote a fascinating account of their journey. At the time, he was about to leave the Army after 14 happy years. He started the expedition for fun, to fill a gap in his life, and to prove something to himself. 'I always thought I'd spend my whole life in the Army. I was offered a promotion, but suddenly I wanted to find out who Charles Blackmore really was, outside of that. It was a big risk. My wife, Tina, was very worried because nobody had ever done that route before; we went into it without knowing what to expect. In the end, it took 59 days to cross from west to east, and the desert was very kind to us.'
Anyone reading about their crossing might wonder why he used the word 'kind'. The team faced many hardships: dysentery, extreme temperatures, severe thirst and dehydration, and losing part of their water supply. 'But', Blackmore explains, 'when we were at our limits and the camels hadn't had water for seven days, we found some. We didn't face the Taklamakan's famous sandstorms. And we never experienced the freezing desert cold that could have stopped us completely. That's not to say we didn't face challenges. The fine sand got into everything, especially blisters and wounds. The high dunes were hard to climb for us and the camels, which often fell over onto us.'
'What kept me going was the need to survive. We had no backup plan. Our budget and time didn't allow for one. No aircraft flew over us. Once we were in the sandhills, we were completely on our own. I knew I had the mental strength for the trip, but I was worried about my physical ability. I remember the first day -- we sat at the edge of the desert, and it was so hot you couldn't breathe. I thought, ""We have to do it now!"" At that moment, I was very scared.'
If it was like that at the start, how did they feel towards the end? 'When you've walked 1,000 kilometers, you're not going to give up. You've been through so much; you have so much behind you. We were very thin but strong and muscular despite being exhausted. My body was well-toned, and my legs were like pistons. I could walk over anything.'
In the middle of the book, Blackmore describes lying in the desert, looking at a full moon, and thinking of his family. How aware was he of the challenge it must have been for them? 'Inside me, there's someone trying to find peace with himself. When I doubt myself now, I think back to the desert and remember that we managed to do it. As a personal achievement, I'm prouder of that expedition than anything else I've done. But in terms of a lifetime's achievement, I think of my family and the happiness we share -- compared to that, the desert doesn't measure up.'
Has Charles Blackmore found peace? 'I long for the challenge -- for the open spaces -- the purpose of it all. We were lifted by the sense of purpose. I find it hard now to be part of the sameness of modern life.'"
CAE_18,C1,"Susan Harr decided to unplug her gadgets and enjoy doing things by hand. Many people love technology because it gives us gadgets that make life easier and save time. However, Susan realized that technology might not be as great as it seems. She had a bad experience with her broken word processor, which was expensive to fix. This made her question if we really need all these gadgets.
Susan started letting her household gadgets go when they stopped working. She wondered if technology really gives us more time or just makes us buy more gadgets. When her sewing machine started making strange noises, she left it in the backyard and began sewing by hand. She found it freeing not to be tied to a noisy machine and enjoyed taking her time with her sewing projects.
There are some gadgets Susan still values, like the washing machine, but she found joy in losing others. She returned her rented color TV and went back to a small black-and-white one. This made her focus on what was worth watching and spend more time on other activities like walking the dog, reading, and talking.
Sewing by hand became a new hobby for Susan. Her old sewing machine became a plant table, and she couldn't afford a new one, so she sewed by hand. She realized that doing things by hand wasn't as bad as she thought. It was relaxing and satisfying to see her work improve. She found that life slowed down to the pace of her hands, and she didn't have to rush from one task to another.
Susan also enjoyed washing dishes by hand, which gave her time to daydream. She started to question if she really needed other gadgets like the freezer, microwave, or lawnmower. She even thought about saving money by not using electric lights."
CAE_62,C1,"Charles Hurst is a cabinet-maker who creates beautifully crafted furniture. When I visit his workshop in East London, he seems to be in a hurry. He greets me quickly and tells me to start the interview. His workshop is busy, filled with half-made furniture and colorful wood. Hurst has been making furniture for ten years and has a great reputation. He is always busy with orders, even though he doesn't advertise. People know that if they want quality furniture like cupboards, tables, or bookcases, Hurst is the person to go to.
Finding a furniture-maker is not hard, but finding one who makes simple, well-crafted pieces is rare. Hurst is disappointed by some modern furniture and criticizes mass-produced, low-quality pieces. His quest for perfection and his talent are keys to his success. He is confident in his skills, saying he has a natural ability for making things. Hurst is self-taught and learned by asking the right questions.
Most of his work comes from private clients, and some return for more pieces. He finds it satisfying to furnish a whole house. However, he admits that not all client relationships are smooth. He prefers clients who know what they want. Hurst also praises others when deserved, acknowledging that some are better than him. He criticizes craftsmen who take too long to make one piece and students who try to make fashion statements with their work. For Hurst, furniture should be practical and usable.
Despite his confidence, Hurst is humble about his work. As I leave, he says, ""After all, I am only making furniture."""
CAE_49,C1,"'Three theories about sleep People spend about one-third of their lives sleeping. This suggests that sleep is very important. However, scientists still do not fully agree on why we need to sleep so much. There are three main theories. The most common theory says that sleep is mainly for our physical health. It suggests that while we sleep, our body repairs any damage from the day and restores our energy. Another theory focuses on the learning benefits of sleep. It suggests that sleep helps us process and understand the information we learn during the day. Without sleep, learning would be difficult. The third theory is about energy. It says that we need sleep to recharge our energy, like recharging a battery, so we have enough energy for the next day.'"
CAE_31,C1,"Eccentrics are people whose behavior is different from what is considered normal in society. This makes us ask, ""What is normal?"" Many of us have our own unique habits, like entering newspaper contests, collecting beer mats, or writing letters to newspapers about various topics. Eccentricity is about showing our individuality. Inside us, there is a struggle between wanting to be unique and wanting to fit in. It's like having two trains pushing against each other on the same track: one is individualism, and the other is conformity. For most people, the desire to be accepted and loved is stronger than the desire to stand out.
People with unusual hobbies or strong opinions often gather together. They form clubs and hold meetings to share their interests, which others might see as odd. Being part of a group, even a small one, is comforting. We all feel a tension between wanting to be unique and wanting to fit in. We might say things like, ""I say what I think,"" or ""You must take me as you find me,"" to show our individuality.
At any time, we can choose to be more individualistic and show our personality. Many successful people have done this. For example, Bob Dylan, the American singer, said that when you follow your instincts and don't give up, you might confuse others. But this self-expression is not eccentricity, at least not at first. When a pop singer wears strange clothes for attention or a socialite makes shocking comments to be noticed, it's not eccentricity. However, if they continue these behaviors until they become a natural part of who they are, then they might be considered eccentric.
The key to being eccentric is being natural. Eccentrics don't try to be different; they just are. They are not concerned with what others think. This makes them different from enthusiasts, practical jokers, criminals, exhibitionists, and recluses, who are all aware of society and react to it. Eccentrics simply do what they do because of who they are, without worrying about society."
CAE_58,C1,"**Natural Books**
We asked four well-known naturalists to share the wildlife book that influenced them the most.
**A. Geoffrey Lean**
Choosing the author was easy for me. As an environmental journalist, I've met many important figures in the field. None impressed me more than Barbara Ward, a small but powerful woman who was central to environmental issues in post-war Europe. She combined her experiences into a strong philosophy. As a young journalist, her work helped me understand the field. Choosing her book was harder. It could have been ""Only One Earth"" or ""Progress for a Small Planet."" But ""The Home of Man,"" despite its old-fashioned title, is her most important book to me. It focuses on the rapid growth of cities and the big themes she cared about, like sustainable development. I've read many books since, but none match its impact.
**B. Linda Bennett**
When I read ""Signals for Survival"" by Niko Tinbergen, I can almost hear the calls of herring gulls and remember the smell of their colony. This book explains animal communication with words and pictures. After reading it, watching a gull colony changes from chaos to an organized social structure. You can see which birds are partners and recognize families. Niko Tinbergen was a great behaviorist who wanted to share his findings with everyone. His work with wildlife artist Eric Ennion made this book special. Ennion's paintings, with simple lines and colors, show the behavior of gulls clearly. This is the work of a true field naturalist.
**C. Lee Durrell**
""My Family and Other Animals"" by Gerald Durrell is the book that influenced me the most. It led me to a wonderful husband and a career in conservation. This book confirmed my love for the natural world. I was researching animal sounds in Madagascar when I first read it. I was facing many challenges, but reading this book made my world brighter. It shows animals, people, joy, and beauty all connected, a world worth saving. Some say humans are the worst species because of the harm we've done. But I think of Gerald as a boy, seeing the world as a family, all connected. This is a concept we all need to understand.
**D. Bruce Pearson**
I found ""The Shell Bird Book"" by James Fisher in my school library soon after it was published in 1966. I was drawn to the 48 color plates of birds by Eric Ennion. I already had other bird books and had learned to identify birds during holidays. They inspired me to start sketching birds to help with identification. But ""The Shell Bird Book"" offered much more. It included chapters on bird migration, the history of birds in Britain, and birds in music, literature, and art. This wide range of information and exciting images made me appreciate birds and nature more broadly. The book showed me that my emotional and creative response to nature was as valid as a scientific one. Since I was better at art than math or physics, it opened a new path for me."
CAE_37,C1,"**DO REVIEWS SELL BOOKS?**
We asked five top British publishers if book reviews help sell books. Here’s what they said:
**Publisher A**  
Reviews are very important for publishers. They are the first thing we look at in newspapers. The Book Marketing Council found that more people buy books because of reviews than for any other reason, like ads or word of mouth. Authors and publishers both dislike getting no reviews, but publishers are usually less upset by bad reviews. They think that any mention, whether good or bad, can help sell books because readers want to decide for themselves. Publishers enjoy reviews that match their own opinion of the book since they are often the first to read it.
**Publisher B**  
Publishers and the press both care about book reviews, but they have different needs. Newspapers want to entertain their readers, while publishers want their books reviewed positively. Book reviews are better now than 40 years ago, but paperbacks are still often ignored. Publishers need reviews because they help make a book and its author known. A good review by a trusted person can boost sales, especially if there are several reviews. Fame helps get books into readers' hands.
**Publisher C**  
Reviews are crucial for literary publishing. Without them, we would miss an important way to reach readers. We publish books by less-known authors, so we rely on reviews since we don’t advertise much. Good reviews are more valuable than ads because they are seen as honest opinions. Reviews can help sell books, but they need to work with other things like word-of-mouth, support from bookstores, and smart marketing.
**Publisher D**  
In Britain, the link between publishing and reviews is unclear. In the U.S., a review in the New York Times can greatly affect a book's success. Here, bookshops don’t always pay attention to reviews. Sometimes, it takes many years of good reviews for a writer to become popular. Some poorly reviewed books sell very well, so it’s unpredictable. Non-fiction reviews often focus more on the reviewer’s knowledge than the book itself.
**Publisher E**  
All publishers and writers want long, positive reviews. But do they sell books? I once published a biography that got great reviews, but it didn’t sell well because people felt they didn’t need to buy it after reading the reviews. The reviewer’s name used to matter more, but now it’s the surprise choice of reviewer or the quality of the review that can persuade people to buy a book."
CAE_2,C1,"The craft of making weathervanes is very old, dating back to ancient Egypt. Today, Graham Smith keeps this tradition alive in his workshop. He is one of the few people in the country who make weathervanes by hand. Graham creates unique designs based on what his customers want. He says, ""This way, I can make a special item just for them."" Many of his customers are women buying gifts for their husbands. They want something special that shows the man's job or hobbies. 
Unlike the usual cockerel design, Graham's first weathervane was a witch on a broomstick, which he made as a surprise for his wife. His friends liked it and asked him to make weathervanes for them too. Graham realized he could make weathervanes in many different shapes and decided to start a business. He used to be a precision engineer for 15 years, but then he and his wife, Liz, switched roles. She went to work as an architectural assistant, and he stayed home to take care of their children and grow the business. That was five years ago, and he is happy with his choice. ""My old job wasn't creative, but this is exciting,"" he says. ""I love designing.""
Graham has created over 100 original designs. He pays close attention to detail and always gets the customer's approval before cutting the design by hand. He also keeps traditional designs in stock because they are popular too. ""People like handmade things,"" Graham says. ""They like having something unique."" He doesn't plan to expand his business because he wants to keep it as a small, rural craft. ""I've found my place in the market,"" he says. ""People love the uniqueness, and I enjoy turning a simple shape into something almost lifelike.""
Weathervanes have helped communities understand the weather for centuries by showing changes in wind direction. Now, more people are moving to the countryside and want unique touches for their homes, which helps crafts like Graham's. He is getting busier, sending flat-packed weathervanes to customers around the world, especially in America and Denmark. ""The price,"" he says, ""depends on how detailed the design is."" His latest request was for a curly-coated dog. Whatever the occasion, Graham can create a special gift."
CAE_68,C1,"Title: Beginner Takes All
Before it was even published, ""The Horse Whisperer"" was the most talked-about book of the year. It is the first novel by British screenwriter Nicholas Evans, and it has made him a lot of money. Here, he talks about what inspired him and his success.
At the start of the year, things were not going well for Nicholas Evans, who was a screenwriter, producer, and wanted to be a director. His year started badly when a film project called ""Life and Limb,"" which he had been working on for months, suddenly failed. He was worried because he hadn't made any money for two years, and this film was his only hope to avoid problems with his bank manager. A sensible person in Evans' situation might have looked for a job. He could have returned to working in television or started a TV project he had paused. Instead, he made a risky decision. He bought a ticket to America and spent three months researching his first novel.
Even though he was acting on impulse, the idea for the story had been with him for a while. It started when he met a farrier (a person who shoes horses) on Dartmoor. The farrier told him about a calm horse that suddenly became wild. The owners were desperate until they found a gypsy who calmed the horse just by talking to it. Such people were called ""horse whisperers."" This story captured Evans' imagination. He started researching the topic to write a screenplay, as he was a filmmaker. But after ""Life and Limb"" failed, he decided to write it as a book.
In the spring, he traveled across the US, visiting ranches and learning about horses and the people who work with them. ""It was a strange time,"" he says now. ""I was watching people, but I was mostly alone and felt like my life was falling apart. I had tried for ten years to succeed as a filmmaker, and now I was in debt, worried about feeding my children, and wondering if it was all a mistake.""
By the end of August, he was back home and had written the first half of the book. ""The bank manager was getting really serious with us, and I needed to know if it was worth continuing. I showed it to a friend who was a literary agent; he read it and said it was 'fine.'"" When asked, the agent thought Evans might get $30,000 as an advance for the book. ""I had an idea of how much I needed to pay off some of the debt and keep us going, and it was more than that. I had spent seven months on 'The Horse Whisperer,' and there were at least two more months to go. $30,000 was a tough number. I was also advised to write a 12-page summary of the rest of the book.""
In October, along with the first two hundred pages of the novel, this summary was sent to seven UK publishers just before they left for the Frankfurt Book Fair. Within days, his agent called to say he had turned down the first offer of $75,000. ""I said, 'You what?' And he said, 'It's OK, I just feel something is happening.'""
What happened next became publishing history. Within a week, after intense bidding, the novel was sold to Transworld Publications in the UK for $550,000 and to Delacorte in the US for $3.15 million, both record-breaking advances for a first novel. ""We couldn't believe it; we were shocked. We never sent the manuscript to New York, and we still don't know how it got there,"" Evans says. They also didn't send it to Hollywood, but within that same week, major studios were competing for it. ""My agent in the UK wisely involved an agent over there, and when he called us to say, 'I think we can get $3 million outright,' we laughed in disbelief.""
As they agreed to this amount, it was decided that each studio would present their case to Evans. So, one night in October, he sat in his study while four major filmmakers called, one after the other, to ask for the chance to pay $3 million for an unfinished novel.
Evans told me all this as we sat drinking coffee on a wooden porch above the leafy garden of his home. He said he had since turned down an offer to write the screenplay for ""The Horse Whisperer."" ""It's all been like a fairy tale so far. I don't want to ruin it. Writing at that level is very tough, and I don't want to become an employee of these people who I like and who have paid me so much money. I'd hate to find myself writing a draft or two and then have them say, 'Thanks, Nick, but now we'll bring in someone else.'""
He said he would be involved, but from a distance. The success of his novel had also brought new offers to support ""Life and Limb,"" but he was no longer sure he wanted to make it. ""I think I would be foolish not to write another novel,"" he said."
CAE_23,C1,"'Young Masters Bobby Fischer is facing challenges as he tries to make a comeback in chess. Chess is now more popular among younger players. After 20 years away from the game, Fischer is playing against his old rival, Boris Spassky. Fischer won the first game with a brilliant move, but he is not the same player he was in 1972. He is now 49 years old, out of practice, and not in the best physical shape. Spassky is even older. Chess has changed a lot in the last 20 years. Fischer himself helped make chess more popular, leading to a new era of professional players. Today, winning is the main goal for chess masters. In international chess, a player's nerves and stamina are as important as their intelligence. The pressure of the game is intense: players must make a certain number of moves in a set time, or they lose. Now, games last longer and are often played without breaks, which benefits younger players. In the last 30 years, each new world champion has been younger than the one before. Of the top ten players in the world, eight are under 30. The way chess is played has also changed. Much of the game happens off the board, with players preparing extensively before matches. Computers have had a big impact on chess. A small computer can store a million games and help players study their opponents. In one recent match, both players had teams working nonstop to find weaknesses in each other's strategies. The opening moves of a game are now studied in great detail, and being well-prepared can decide the outcome. Today, there are more top-level players than ever before. Hundreds of grandmasters compete for modest prize money worldwide. Success requires both physical and mental effort. A single game can last up to eight hours, and players must stay focused. Losing concentration can lead to disaster. The chess clock adds to the tension, especially during the final moments when players have only seconds to make moves. This is not a time for deep thinking; it becomes a battle of nerves and determination. At the highest level, losing is very painful, while winning brings great satisfaction. But one win is not enough to win a tournament. Chess masters must be ready to compete every day for 9-11 days in most tournaments, and there are competitions all year round. World championship matches are even tougher. In 1984, a match between Anatoli Karpov and Gary Kasparov in Moscow had to stop because both players were exhausted. Karpov lost about 10kg during the match. Can Fischer overcome these challenges? He once said, ""All I want to do, ever, is play chess."" This made his sudden departure from chess in 1972 surprising. But it also made him a legend. If Fischer has returned for money, he will earn a lot. But if he truly believes he can still be the best, losing could be very disappointing.'"

**A. Nick Grosso**  
Nick Grosso, in his early 30s, is a playwright with three successful plays. He is now turning his first play, ""Peaches,"" into a movie script. ""It's a low-budget project, but we don't know how low,"" he says. ""It won't be more than £30 million, but it could be as little as £30."" Interestingly, before writing ""Peaches,"" Nick had never seen or read a play. ""When I wrote it, I never thought it would be performed,"" he admits. ""It's set in a car, which I wouldn't do now because of the challenges. I knew nothing back then."" Nick left school at 16 but returned a year later. After finishing his A-levels, he joined the Young People's Theatre. ""I realized I wanted to write for actors. I wanted my writing to be heard, not just read, because of its rhythm and rhyme,"" he explains. ""Being around like-minded people was the first time I enjoyed an educational environment. It was very inspiring.""
**B. Simon Pegg**  
Comedian Simon Pegg, 28, has advanced in his career since studying drama at Bristol University. He is writing a TV comedy series and recently finished a demanding tour with comedy star Steve Coogan. Simon has always worked hard, even performing in comedy clubs during his university days. ""University was very theoretical,"" Simon recalls. ""It made me realize I didn't want to be a traditional actor and that I was more interested in comedy. People think comedy is the hardest job, but it's not. If you have courage and good material, making people laugh is wonderful."" Simon has performed with the comic group Funny Business, but his work with Steve Coogan has been the most rewarding. ""Steve saw my show, and since I was a big fan, he probably noticed me imitating him,"" Simon admits.
**C. Ciaran McMenamin**  
Ciaran McMenamin, 24, became well-known as the lead in the series ""The Young Person's Guide To Becoming A Rock Star."" The show received great reviews, and his career has taken off quickly. ""It's been a great opportunity for me,"" he says. ""I can now choose what I want to do, which is what I've always wanted."" This is a rare position, especially since he just graduated. Looking at Ciaran's early career, it's clear he was destined for success. Encouraged by his mother, he went from school plays to the Ulster Youth Theatre, where he stayed for four years. ""I used acting as an excuse not to do homework,"" Ciaran laughs. ""But I decided to pursue it because I was good at it and loved it."" Now, he is waiting for more recognition but is thoughtful about fame. ""At 18, you think you'll love the photos and interviews, but you realize it's not about that. It's about getting respect for good work.""
**D. Neil Taylor**  
Neil Taylor, 25, is the lead singer of the pop band Matrix, which just signed a three-album deal with Domino Records. Neil and his bandmate Rick Brown are expected to be very successful when their single ""Chimera"" is released. ""The record company talks about a smash hit, but I have no idea. If two people buy it, I'll be happy,"" he says. Unlike many new pop stars, Neil has worked hard for his success. He left school at 16 and has been trying to enter the music industry ever since. ""It's funny how things happen,"" he says. ""I was doing student gigs for eight years and was about to give up when I met Rick Brown, who had contacts at Domino, and we formed Matrix. It couldn't have happened at a better time. I've been in some terrible bands, but hopefully, it will all be worth it.""
**E. Stephen Richards**  
Stephen Richards, 27, is a poet and author who has won many prizes and awards. He is well-known in the poetry world and has been touring and giving readings for six years. His first novel, ""Hidden,"" will be published in March. ""It's a story of obsessive love. It was a strong idea that I couldn't express in a poem,"" he says. Stephen loved creative writing in school but became disillusioned with education later. ""I decided not to go to university, but when I got bored with stuffing envelopes at a theatre, I decided to go."" After university, he published his first work, a children's book, in 1992. ""My parents didn't expect me to be a writer. They thought I'd be a reader because that's all I did as a child."" With his poetry receiving praise, moving to novels is a bold step. ""There's a structure in poetry, so there's less chance of making big mistakes,"" he explains. ""A novel can be any length, so there are more chances for bad writing. My main goal is not to produce work without caring about its quality."""
CAE_1,C1,"A. Isabel, the main character in this funny novel, is an art student who loves historical romance stories. She is 31 years old and is looking for Mr. Right. Isabel thinks she looks good in jeans but avoids wearing them because she doesn't want to attract the wrong kind of people. She worries that her knobbly knees might ruin her chances of finding love. However, she remains hopeful, which helps her and others in the story. The author writes with great energy, using a fast-paced style similar to early silent films, with chapter titles like 'Our Hero Feels Inspired.'
B. This story is about the beginning and near-end of a local radio station in America. It is told from the perspective of Francis With, a smart but weak child. Francis works for WLT (With Lettuce and Tomato) Radio, a station started by Roy and Ray Soderbjerg to promote their sandwich shop. The station broadcasts a mix of singers, preachers, soap-opera stars, and announcers. The small-town American setting allows the author to use dry humor and simple writing. The story takes readers back to the 1940s and 1950s, a time of dime stores, old cars, and the radio.
C. In this story, it is normal for a second husband to talk with his wife's first husband. Professor Richard Vaisey falls in love with a beautiful Russian poetess and shares his feelings with his wife's ex-husband. The poetess writes bad poetry, which bothers Richard, and she wants his help to free her brother from prison. The author skillfully untangles these complications with humor and insight into relationships, making the story enjoyable and witty.
D. Two pairs of best friends, two women and two men, meet in London during the 1960s and stay connected for 25 years. At the start of this long novel, one of the four, an American businessman named James Hudson, is starting a newspaper, which his friend Richard Blake is editing. The newspaper launch is important, but so is the fact that the woman they both loved (and one of them married) was killed years ago. The story includes murder, ambition, love, and jealousy, with well-written characters that readers can really get to know.
E. This story, written by a top American fiction writer, is both funny and touching. It tells how Ian Bedloe, feeling guilty for a past mistake, becomes a 'father' to his brother's three orphaned children. At 40, Ian is slowly becoming an eccentric bachelor, surrounded by the chaos of family life. The story explores many emotions and focuses on the tender relationship Ian develops with the youngest child, Daphne. It is a warm book with a perfect mix of sadness and laughter."
CAE_53,C1,"**Volunteer Tourism: A Discussion**
**A.** Volunteer tourism involves people traveling to other countries to help with projects like building homes or schools. However, volunteers often pay a lot of money to participate. This money, if given directly to local communities, could hire more workers than the volunteer can replace. This is especially true for gap year students, who usually don't have special skills or experience. Many studies question if these volunteers are truly motivated by a desire to help others or if they are more interested in gaining experiences that will help their careers. Despite this, volunteering can help people become more ethical and caring in their future lives and careers.
**B.** Volunteering can improve international understanding, help solve conflicts, and increase participation in global issues. It can also create international social networks among regular people. In this way, both volunteers and host communities benefit, contributing to a better world. However, if only wealthy people from rich countries volunteer, they gain international experience and career advantages, but it doesn't help those who can't access these opportunities. These volunteers might use the experience to advance personally, rather than truly helping the communities.
**C.** At its worst, international volunteering can be seen as a form of charity that benefits the volunteer more than the community. It can also be a way for wealthy people to boost their careers. At its best, it provides benefits to both volunteers and the communities, allowing for an exchange of skills and cultural experiences. Importantly, volunteering can increase awareness and commitment to fighting poverty, injustice, and unsustainable development.
**D.** Volunteer tourism fits with the idea of helping others in small ways. These efforts can seem positive because they avoid big government and business involvement. However, they also avoid the democratic process and reduce development to individual acts of charity, often not addressing the root causes of poverty. While volunteering is a good act, when it is promoted as sustainable development, it can weaken the true meaning of development. The politics of volunteer tourism can ignore the real social issues and inequalities faced by many in developing countries."
CAE_55,C1,"Many of us use a radio to wake up in the morning, and we often need something to help us get out of bed. That's where the clock radio comes in. But how do you choose a good one? Our team, including myself, inventor Tom Granger, and broadcaster Paul Bridges, tested five models.
One model advertised a 'dual alarm function,' but it doesn't let you snooze and then wake up again. Instead, it lets you set two different wake-up times, like one for weekdays and one for weekends. This model is priced similarly to another one we tested, but it includes a cassette player, which is a good deal. You can fall asleep to your own music and wake up without news. We all thought the radio quality was excellent, but it's quite large, about the size of a rugby ball. Paul Bridges said he needs space on his bedside table for his keys, wallet, glasses, and phone, and he always books a wake-up call just in case the alarm fails.
This model was the most attractive and was our overall favorite. Paul Bridges loved it, although the clock on his test model kept getting stuck at 16:00. I liked the digital display with its grey numbers on a green background. The snooze bar is wide, so you can tap it with your eyes closed. However, the smooth buttons made me want to touch them like piano keys, which was a problem when I had to read the 50-page instruction booklet. The clock has a backup power feature, so you don't have to reset it if someone unplugs it to use a hairdryer or vacuum cleaner. We all liked this feature, but setting it up was difficult, though we felt 'cool' and sophisticated once we figured it out.
Tom Granger thought the model with an extra built-in lamp was poorly made. You have to pull the light out of its socket to use it, which made him question its quality. He had to read the instructions twice to make it work, and the clock kept jumping from 12:00 to 02:00. The light is hard to position and only shines on the clock, which is already lit. Paul Bridges liked the lamp idea but agreed the radio was hard to tune. The buzzer was loud and annoying, like an alarm on a submarine. Despite this, it's the third most popular model on the market.
Aimed at young people, with its bright colors and strap, this model appealed to Tom Granger and me. Tom liked it because it stands out and doesn't blend into the background. It was the only model we could set up without reading the instructions. However, the alarm can be off by 20 minutes, which Paul Bridges found ridiculous. He thought it was 'fiddly' and 'useless.'
The simplest and cheapest model scored points with Tom Granger because it was standard and took up little space. It has old-fashioned dial tuning, which he found more intuitive. With modern push-button tuning, you're never sure if you've pressed the buttons correctly. He admitted that manufacturers had to improve radio quality because of button-tuning. I thought the tuning was basic, as did Paul Bridges, but we agreed the radio quality was fine. The buzzer on this model worked well, getting me out of bed in just two beeps!"
CAE_50,C1,"Hedgehogs
A hedgehog is a small animal known for the sharp spines covering its body. Hedgehogs live in many parts of the world, but they are not originally from America or Australia. All hedgehogs can roll into a tight ball when they feel threatened, making their spines stick out to protect them. This defense works better if the hedgehog has many spines. Some hedgehogs that live in the desert have fewer spines because they have evolved to be lighter. These hedgehogs might try to run away from danger first and only roll into a ball if they have no other choice. Hedgehogs are mostly active at night and sleep during the day, usually under bushes or in holes in the ground. Although all hedgehogs can hibernate, not all of them do. If the weather is good, some hedgehogs stay awake all year."
CAE_25,C1,"**Great Sportswomen on a Winning Streak**
Excelling in sports is challenging for everyone, but women often face extra difficulties. Training and competitions take up a lot of time, leaving little room for a normal life, so sacrifices are necessary. Despite these challenges, women are overcoming prejudice and setting new records. Here, we talk to some talented British sportswomen who are achieving their goals.
**A. Jill, 27, Skier**
""It's an amazing feeling to fly through the air and land smoothly, but it can be scary. Sometimes you don't feel well, or it's windy and hard to see, but you just keep going. It's difficult to have a career outside skiing because we train for ten months a year. You give up a lot of your social life and friends. But it was my choice. There are six men and three women in the British team. We all compete on the same courses and get treated the same - it's a young sport.""
**B. Caroline, 22, Cyclist**
""Two years ago, I borrowed a bike to join a charity race. I won because I cycled faster than everyone else, which was surprising because I'd never cycled before! I'm well paid as a professional, and cycling has many opportunities for endorsements. However, I worry that people might think I succeeded because of my looks, not because I'm the best cyclist. So I focus on cycling right now, rather than making money. I train at least four hours every day on the bike, plus stretching exercises, swimming, and running. My boyfriend is a cyclist too, so he understands the time commitment.""
**C. Annabel, 26, Rower**
""Rowing is hard for girls to get into because very few girls' schools offer it. Most don't start until they're 19 or 20, which makes it harder to succeed internationally. Also, coaches usually stay for only a year or so, so there's no continuity, and the women's squad is often disorganized. But it's great fun, I love being fit, and there's a good social life.""
**D. Ffyona, 24, Long Distance Walker**
""At 13, I dreamed of walking around the world—I didn't realize how big it was then! Britain felt too small and safe. I was very determined and didn't like anyone controlling me. Now I am more tactful. Each walk has been different. Walking across Australia was the most painful experience I've ever had. I walked 50 miles and 21 hours each day with only three hours of sleep, in high temperatures, and with 15 blisters on each foot. But I got the record! I had to, because my sponsorship money was going to run out after 95 days. Men often think women are more likely to fail, so sponsoring them is seen as a higher risk.""
**E. Lisa, 26, Saloon Car Racer**
""Some men have big egos when driving—you see it on motorways. When I'm doing well, they don't talk to me. Being a woman has its disadvantages. When I reach a corner, men think 'I've got to beat her,' so I've had a lot of bumps! You have to be naturally competitive and aggressive. It's very hard to earn money, and what I do make goes back into the sport. Women have been racing since the 1920s and have always been seen as unusual. It's great that more women are taking up racing every year. For me, the appeal of saloon car racing is aiming for perfection, always trying to complete a perfect lap.""
**F. Alison, 28, Triathlete**
""I get up at 5:30 three mornings a week to swim. I need Tuesday and Thursday mornings to catch up on sleep. In the evening, I just cycle or run. Yes, I do fall asleep at my desk sometimes! There is a lot of nervous build-up before a race, and when you're racing, you really push yourself—you don't feel good if you don't. Several times I've asked myself why I do it. The answer is: a) I'm happier when I keep fit, b) I'm naturally lazy, and if I didn't make myself do this, I'd really be lazy, c) racing is very social. Men and women usually compete together, but when an event is covered in the press, 90% of the article will explain the men's event, and 10% will say, 'Oh, by the way, so-and-so won the women's event.' The prize money isn't as good either, of course. But now we've formed an International Triathlon Women's Commission, so we're working on it."""
CAE_34,C1,"Title: The Day I Met Picasso
Richard Cork remembers the time he, as an 18-year-old student, met the famous artist Picasso. Even from a distance, while Picasso was having lunch at a restaurant in Cannes, he was easy to recognize. Richard was traveling around Europe and Morocco in an old van before starting university. He had run out of money and found a job painting boats. He loved drawing and had a sketchbook with him when he saw Picasso.
Picasso was known to be a private person who usually worked alone in the hills. So, Richard was surprised to see him at a table with his wife, Jacqueline, and three friends. Encouraged by a friend, Richard nervously approached Picasso to ask for his autograph. To his surprise, Picasso agreed and signed his sketchbook. Then, Picasso added a playful drawing on the page. The drawing might have been inspired by the surroundings, like the sea or the harbor.
Richard thanked Picasso and tried to have a conversation with him. Since Picasso's English was not good and Richard's French was also limited, an American woman at the table helped translate. She called Picasso ""the Maestro"" and was very enthusiastic. Richard told Picasso about his love for art and admiration for his work.
After showing the autograph to his friend, the friend suggested Richard go back and draw Picasso's portrait. Richard returned to Picasso's table and started drawing without asking for permission, fearing a refusal. Picasso noticed and made funny faces, making it hard for Richard to draw. Despite the challenge, Richard continued, feeling that Picasso was testing his determination.
Eventually, Picasso stopped joking and allowed Richard to study him quietly. Richard noticed how strong and alert Picasso looked, wearing a blue-and-white striped shirt. Picasso seemed younger than his age, with intense, youthful eyes. Even in a group, he appeared thoughtful and private.
When the American woman said Picasso wanted to see the portrait, Richard felt embarrassed but showed it to him. Picasso nodded in approval and then decided to draw Richard. In a few quick strokes, Picasso drew a playful version of Richard's face, moving one eye to his nose and capturing his smile with a single line. Richard felt like a character from one of Picasso's imaginative works.
Richard asked Picasso to sign the drawing, but the American woman explained that Picasso said he had already signed once. Despite this, Richard felt lucky to have met Picasso and received his attention, which meant a lot to him."
CAE_12,C1,"**Talking Shop: How Stores Make You Spend More**
Have you ever gone into a store and bought more than you planned? We explain the tricks shops use to make you spend more money.
**A. The Image of Freshness**
Supermarkets know that customers value fresh produce. They often place fruits and vegetables at the store entrance or have displays of house plants to create a fresh image. Some stores have in-store bakeries that spread the smell of fresh bread. The store's colors, like green, can also make things seem fresher. However, most of what supermarkets sell, like frozen foods and cleaning products, doesn't match this fresh image.
**B. Displaying to Advantage**
Where products are placed in a store is very important for sales. Supermarkets use computer systems to find out which areas of the store are most popular. They put high-profit or fast-selling items in these spots. Products at eye level sell better, so manufacturers want their items there. Special offer bins attract bargain hunters. Stores also use 'complementation' by placing related items, like salad dressings near salads, together.
**C. Spreading Staples Around the Store**
Supermarkets place basic items like bread and sugar far from the entrance. This way, shoppers pass by other tempting products. Chain stores do the same with popular items, placing them far from the entrance to encourage customers to explore the store and see other products.
**D. Less Sells More**
Chain stores have changed how they display products. The Next chain, for example, moved away from stacking items high and selling them cheap. Instead, they display fewer items to make them seem exclusive. This approach makes their stores look like boutiques, even though their clothes are mass-produced like their competitors.
**E. Tempting Totals**
Food shoppers often focus on the total cost of their shopping rather than individual prices. Supermarkets use this by offering a mix of low and high-profit items. They might sell some items at a loss to attract customers, known as 'loss leaders.' More often, they buy in bulk to get discounts from manufacturers.
**F. The All-Important Price Tag**
In chain stores, customers buy fewer items and pay more attention to prices. Pricing a blouse at £14.99 instead of £15 can make a difference. This pricing also helps reduce theft, as staff must record the sale to give change.
**G. Lighting to Effect**
Both supermarkets and chain stores carefully plan their lighting. Chain stores aim for natural lighting so customers see the true color of clothes. Supermarkets use special lighting and mirrors to make fresh produce look better.
**H. Walk This Way**
Chain stores use different carpets to guide customers through the store. These paths, called the 'Yellow Brick Road,' lead shoppers through the store. However, not all customers follow these paths. Marks and Spencer use wood or marble for paths, encouraging shoppers to step onto the more inviting carpet in sales areas.
**I. In-Store Promotion**
When you enter a supermarket, you might see large photos of delicious food. In the U.S., some supermarkets use 'video trolleys' with screens that show ads as you shop. Sensors trigger ads for products near you, like ready-made meals. These trolleys target impulse buyers and can increase sales by about 30%."
CAE_26,C1,"Chris Bonnington, a 58-year-old mountaineer, is famous for climbing Everest in 1985. He has also created new climbing routes in Britain and the Alps and has written books like ""Quest for Adventure"" and ""Everest the Hard Way."" Robin Knox-Johnston, aged 53, started his sea career in the Merchant Navy. In 1968-9, he was the first person to sail around the world alone in his yacht, Sunhaili. He also set a record by sailing from New York to the Lizard in 10 days. Chris and Robin teamed up to sail and climb in Greenland, and they wrote about their journey in their book ""Sea, Ice and Rock.""
In 1979, while working on ""Quest for Adventure,"" Chris contacted Robin for an interview. Robin invited Chris to join him for a sail, where Chris could teach him climbing, and Robin could teach Chris sailing. It was Chris's first time on a yacht. They sailed, anchored, and then went ashore to try climbing. Chris was impressed by Robin's calmness in difficult climbing conditions. Robin had never climbed before, so Chris showed him how. Robin then used his own method to climb down, which was safe but different from what Chris expected.
During their trip to Skye, Chris and Robin became good friends. Robin suggested they combine their skills for a trip to Greenland, which was a bigger version of their Skye adventure. Chris admired Robin's leadership. Although the skipper usually makes all decisions, Robin involved everyone in the decision-making process. Chris found sailing boring and challenging, especially being at sea for days. He preferred land and wasn't handy with repairs, unlike Robin, who enjoyed fixing things on the boat. Chris sometimes felt useless, which was hard for him. The yacht was crowded with six people in a space meant for four, unlike mountain expeditions where you can have some space.
When they reached Greenland, Chris led the climbing part of the expedition. He found it hard to be responsible for Robin's safety, as a fall could endanger both of them. Climbing Greenland's highest mountain, the Cathedral, was tougher than Chris expected. Robin, not a natural climber, impressed Chris with his determination. On their first attempt, they climbed for 24 hours straight and were exhausted. Robin trusted Chris completely, even when they had to turn back. Despite worrying about the boat, Robin supported trying to climb the mountain again.
The only tension between them happened on the yacht home. Chris was supposed to take a watch shift at 4 am, but Robin didn't wake him, thinking he could handle it alone. Chris felt Robin didn't trust him, but Robin reassured him it was a misunderstanding. By the end of the Greenland expedition, Chris realized that beneath Robin's tough exterior, he was a kind and sensitive person."
CAE_8,C1,"**A History of the Apple**
Apples have been with us since ancient times, in many different colors, shapes, and sizes. However, in the late 20th century, we risk losing this heritage.
**Prehistoric Times (8,000 BC)**
Humans have been eating apples since prehistoric times. In ancient Britain, people spat out apple seeds. Around 10,000 years ago, they left apple remains near their homes in Switzerland and Italy. In Switzerland and near the Caucasus mountains, ancient people even stored dried apple halves for winter. These were wild crab apples, small and not like the apples we know today.
**Norman Influence (1000 AD)**
The French learned fruit-growing skills from the Romans, which they developed in monasteries. This knowledge, including cider-making, was brought to Britain. The Romans introduced some apple varieties, but most were not suitable for the British climate. The Normans introduced better varieties, and British monks continued to develop new apples. Many Western apples come from these varieties.
**Medieval Times (1200)**
In the 13th century, several apple types became popular in Britain. The Old English Pearmain, recorded in 1204, was the main dessert apple until the 18th century. Its cooking partner was the Costard, sold in Oxford markets from 1296. However, apple production declined due to droughts, the Black Death, and wars. More apples were imported until the 16th century when Henry VIII sent Richard Harris to France to learn about apple cultivation. Harris brought back many grafts, including the famous Pippins, and started the first modern orchard in Kent.
**Settler Expansion (1750)**
By the 17th century, apples were so popular in Britain that settlers took them to Canada, Australia, the US, South Africa, and New Zealand. Captain Bligh took apples to Australia, Jan van Riebeeck to South Africa, and the Pilgrim Fathers to America. In North America, John Chapman, known as 'Johnny Appleseed,' planted apple nurseries from Pennsylvania to Indiana. He was known for his love of apple trees and his kind nature.
**Modern Apples (1850)**
Around this time in Iowa, a farmer named Jesse Hiatt discovered a new apple tree, which he named 'Hawkey.' It was later called 'Delicious' and became one of the most popular apples worldwide. In Australia, Maria Anne Smith discovered another famous apple. Known as 'Granny Smith,' she found a new apple tree in 1868 and soon harvested the first major crop of green apples, which became famous globally.
**Uniformity Concerns (1950)**
Today, apples are grown worldwide, from India to Africa. Most are grown commercially and come from just a few varieties, chosen for their appearance and ability to travel well, not for taste. This uniformity reduces the variety and gene pool of apples. While some gardeners in the UK preserve old apple varieties, the US has lost many apples from 100 years ago. Consumers now want more variety. We must protect natural diversity in apples and other foods for everyone's benefit."

Our trips are suitable for anyone in good health, reasonably fit, and adaptable. Most travelers are aged 25-55, with about half being couples and the rest solo adventurers.
Activities and Interests
Each Explore Worldwide trip is unique, so we have divided our adventures into 8 categories based on main activities and interests. These categories highlight special features of each tour, but many other factors contribute to the success of our trips, such as unique places, unusual encounters, and personal involvement.
Cultural/Adventure
Most of our trips have a strong cultural focus, emphasizing local cultures and historical sites. Destinations include Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Yemen, Turkey, Greece, India, Bhutan, Thailand, China, Peru, Bolivia, Guatemala, and Belize. Short day walks to off-the-beaten-path sites are often included.
Wildlife and Natural History
Our wildlife safaris visit some of the world's greatest game parks, offering thrilling encounters with animals. In Africa, you can step out of your safari vehicle to explore. Activities include tracking gorillas in Zaire, bush walking in Uganda, climbing Mount Kenya, and canoeing on the Zambezi River. Most safaris involve camping, with some offering hotel stays. In Asia and South America, we stay in hotels or lodges for game viewing, like our tiger safari in India. In the Galapagos Islands, we stay on a small motor yacht.
Ethnic Encounters
A highlight of our adventures is meeting ethnic or tribal peoples, such as the Tuareg in the Sahara, the Maya in Mexico, or the Huli in Papua New Guinea. We travel in small groups to minimize cultural and environmental impact, promoting tolerance and understanding.
Easy/Moderate Hiking
Many trips include easy walks through countryside or village-to-village hiking, staying in rented or hotel accommodations. Destinations include Spain, Provence, Tuscany, Crete, Corsica, Greece, Morocco, Turkey, Bulgaria, Thailand, Bhutan, Nepal, and Venezuela. On longer walks, your main luggage is transported separately.
Major Treks
We offer major treks for strong walkers, sometimes at high altitudes. These treks take place in mountain ranges like the Atlas, Kackar, Himalayas, and Andes. We may stay with locals or camp, with support vehicles or porters to carry gear.
Wilderness Experience
Exploring remote wilderness areas is a thrilling adventure. We visit places like the Amazon Rainforest and the Sahara, offering a chance for a unique travel experience.
Sailtreks/Seatreks
These relaxing holidays involve traveling by local boats, such as felucca sailboats in Egypt or gulets in Turkey. We explore islands in the Indonesian Archipelago and the Galapagos by chartered yachts.
Raft and River Journeys
River journeys range from a few hours to several days, using inflatables or whitewater rafts. No experience is needed, and safety skills are quickly learned. Our river trips in India, Africa, and the Amazon offer insights into exotic jungles."
CAE_30,C1,"Richard Nerurkar, a top British 10,000-metre runner, visited a high-altitude training camp in Kenya. This camp is located in Nanyuki, near Mount Kenya, and has been his base for winter training for three years. However, he had never trained with Kenyan runners on their home ground until his fourth visit. During this trip, he competed in his first race in Kenya and stayed at the national team training camp. He was invited by the national team coach after finishing fifth in the World Championship 10,000 meters race, behind three Kenyans and a Moroccan. This was a great opportunity for him.
Training at high altitudes helps produce more red blood cells, improving oxygen capacity. This is one reason for the success of Kenyan runners. Richard's first race in Africa was an international cross-country race in Nairobi, the first of its kind on the continent. Although he finished behind 41 runners, most of whom were Kenyan, he felt he had performed well.
Kenyan runners are known for their simple approach to running. They have an effortless style, a simple diet, and a relaxed manner, but they love to compete. The key to their success might be their training methods. Richard learned about these during his stay at the training camp.
The camp is at St Mark's College, 6,200 feet up Mount Kenya, surrounded by beautiful fields and vegetation. The facilities are basic, with athletes living six to a room in dormitories. Their day includes three workouts: an easy morning run, interval training mid-morning, and a steady run in the late afternoon. They cover about 40 kilometers daily, except on Sundays when they run 20 kilometers.
Life at the camp is simple. Morning preparations are minimal, and meals consist of tea, bread, boiled eggs, ugali (a maize dish), stew, cabbage or spinach, and tea. After the day's training, they bathe in streams from Mount Kenya's glaciers.
By the end of his stay, Richard appreciated Kenyan success even more. He realized it wasn't just about genetics, upbringing, or altitude. The simple lifestyle, tough workouts, and passion for success might be the real reasons behind Kenya's dominance in distance running."
CAE_7,C1,"**Hit and Miss of Mass Marketing**
Advertising is struggling, and it's not just because of the recession. The decline started in 1989, before the recession hit hard. The main issue is that advertising hasn't kept up with economic changes. Advertisers focus on mass markets and mass media, but as more brands and media options have appeared, target markets have become smaller and more specific. Major brand campaigns should focus on these smaller audiences, but they often don't. This is where advertising has gone wrong.
Think about your shopping habits. When you go to a supermarket, you might buy 30 to 50 items, but only a few are advertised brands. Over a year, you probably buy only a few hundred different brands. For big items like cars, you might buy one every three years, and many people get their cars from their employers. You don't buy many clothes either, and most aren't advertised brands. Even when you include things like candy, medicine, and services, you likely don't buy more than 400 different brands a year.
Now, compare that to the 32,500 branded goods and services advertised. If we focus on the 9,500 brands that spend more on advertising, the average person buys only about 4% of them. This means 96% of advertising might be wasted because people don't buy those brands. When you watch TV, count how many commercials are for brands you buy or might buy. For most people, it's about 6%, meaning 94% of commercials are wasted.
Most people think they aren't influenced by advertising, but that's not true. Waste is part of using media for advertising. Not everyone who sees an ad will buy the product. People notice only a few ads and ignore the rest, so some waste is unavoidable. However, advertising can still be cost-effective. It reaches many people to find the few who will respond, even if the advertiser doesn't know who they are in advance.
With better targeting, advertisers can reduce waste by reaching more people who might respond, but they can never know exactly who will. Even the best direct mail campaigns don't get a 100% response. This is different from face-to-face selling, where a salesperson might succeed with every client. If advertisers knew exactly who would respond, they wouldn't need media; they could contact those people directly.
Any advertiser who gains one million new customers (2% of the adult population) is doing well. For example, top-selling soap brands would be happy with a million extra customers. An advertising campaign that wins over 2% of the population is very successful, but that's still a small part of the population. To succeed, advertising needs to target its message more precisely than ever before."
CAE_43,C1,"Title: Exploring Britain's Most Eco-Friendly Home
Charles Clover visits Britain's most eco-friendly home in Southwell, Nottinghamshire. This town is known for its ancient cathedral, Southwell Minster, which features 'green' men figures carved by medieval craftsmen. The town also hosts Britain's greenest house, the 'autonomous house', created by Robert and Brenda Vale.
The Vales' house uses rainwater for washing and drinking, recycles sewage into garden compost, and heats the home using waste heat from appliances and body heat from the family and their two cats, Edison and Faraday. The house looks traditional with a clay tile roof and fits well with the town's old buildings, even though it's in a protected area.
The house is very quiet inside because it is super-insulated with special windows. When you enter, you must take off your shoes, and the house feels very peaceful. On a sunny day, the conservatory warms the air before it circulates through the house. Robert opens windows and ventilation shafts to create airflow because the house is very well sealed, even the cats have their own special door.
The Vales, who teach architecture at Nottingham University, have been interested in the environment for a long time. They wrote a book on green architecture in the 1970s. They designed their house to produce no carbon dioxide and decided to use no mains water. They use composting toilets, collect rainwater, and filter it for drinking. They avoid using a dishwasher to prevent using strong detergents.
Robert explains that they wanted to show it's possible to have an environmentally friendly house without living in darkness. The house's design is modern, but the hall is tall like in medieval times. The Vales don't pay water bills, and last winter, they used very little electricity, costing about 70p a day. Soon, they will add solar panels to generate more electricity, possibly enough to charge an electric car.
The only heating is a small wood stove, rarely used. In winter, the house stays warm because there are no drafts and everything is at the same temperature. Robert says people used to be comfortable at lower temperatures because of their clothing. He suggests people in old houses should live like they did in the past, but this idea might not be popular.
The house is simple and low-tech, with materials from local builders, making it cheap to build. However, commercial builders are not interested in this idea."
CAE_51,C1,"'The camera never lies Arthur Conan Doyle, who created the Sherlock Holmes stories, thought of himself as a logical and scientific person. However, in 1920, when he saw photos of fairies taken in a garden, he believed they were real evidence that fairies existed. He published these photos with an article he wrote, saying fairies were amazing supernatural beings. It wasn't until 1939 that the two women who took the photos admitted they were fake. They had simply cut out pictures of fairies from a book and placed them among flowers. The photos are undeniably beautiful, but the simple trick challenges the idea that cameras always show the truth. In fact, cameras can lie and always could. Today, we are familiar with using computer software to change our digital images, and it's a myth that photography ever had a time when it was completely honest. From the start, when cameras began capturing reality, that reality was being changed.'"
CAE_11,C1,"Blacksmiths have always been important throughout history. They work with iron, a metal that has fascinated people for a long time. Before the Industrial Revolution, blacksmiths were as respected as doctors because they made weapons, armor, and farming tools. They were also seen as artists. For example, in the 18th century, blacksmiths created beautiful ironwork for St Paul's Cathedral. The elegant metal designs in French and Belgian Art Nouveau buildings were also made by skilled blacksmiths.
However, by the late 1960s, blacksmiths were almost gone in Britain. Heavy industry no longer needed them, and modern architects rarely used decorative ironwork. But in the past 10 years, there has been a revival. People are more interested in decorative architecture and creative interior design. Still, much of the work looks old-fashioned, with many products labeled as 'classical' or 'Victorian-style'. Trendy stores often sell rusty candlesticks with decorations.
Fortunately, there are new opportunities for blacksmiths. A series of events aims to promote their craft. The first event is an exhibition by the British Artist Blacksmiths Association (BABA) at the Fire & Iron gallery in Leatherhead, Surrey. Alan Dawson, BABA's secretary, believes we might be entering a new Iron Age. Modern tools have made it easier for blacksmiths to work with metal, allowing them to be more creative. The exhibition features about 250 pieces, from bookends to a spiral staircase, with prices starting at £90. Most of the money goes to the artists, but some supports the promotion of good ironwork.
Dawson's own work includes an eight-foot gate and a lamp with a glass shade. He describes his style as letting steel bend and flow when it's hot, like drawing with metal in space. Many artists are fascinated by iron because it is soft when hot but becomes hard when it cools. Susan May, a jeweler, finds this transformation magical. Ann Catrin Evans creates door-knockers and handles inspired by horror film castles. She likes that steel feels permanent and strong.
Iron has given people visual pleasure and a sense of security for a long time. It is likely that iron will continue to be used decoratively for many years, as long as we avoid more rusty candlesticks."
CAE_14,C1,"Title: The Day I Quit Smoking
I thought everyone would be happy when I quit smoking, but one of my colleagues was really angry. She said, ""If it was that easy, why didn't you stop years ago?"" I couldn't explain how I went from smoking a pack a day to not smoking at all in just four hours. It even surprised me. 
The session I attended was a mix of group therapy and hypnotherapy, and it happened two months and three weeks ago. I didn't plan to quit, and I didn't really want to. I was annoyed by the constant pressure from anti-smoking groups, and I still am. I had low blood pressure, a healthy family, and I didn't feel sick. I even got over colds faster than my friends who lived healthier lives.
On that ordinary Thursday afternoon, I went to a session called The Easy Way to Stop Smoking in Birmingham to write an article about others trying to quit. I told them, ""I won't be trying to stop myself; it wouldn't be fair."" I was there to write, not to quit, so I didn't expect their method to work on me. I actually enjoyed smoking; it made me happy. The counselor seemed to understand something I didn't.
We were allowed to smoke as much as we wanted, and the room was so full of smoke that we had to open the windows. I noticed that when I was told to smoke, I didn't want to, and neither did the others. The messages about quitting made sense to me. Just like smoking had been a challenge against opposition, quitting started to feel appealing. The idea of not being a smoker made me feel strong. It was a personal feeling, just for me. Could I conquer the world too?
In many ways, quitting was easy. The physical craving for nicotine, which felt like hunger, went away after a minute or two and only lasted for four or five days. I thought working without cigarettes would be hard, but it wasn't a problem at all. I believed I needed nicotine to meet deadlines, but I was wrong. Surprisingly, the hardest part was spending weekend mornings at home without smoking, and it still is. I think smoking was a way to avoid boredom; it was an activity by itself.
Yes, I miss my cigarettes, but not too much. Every new experience as a non-smoker is a challenge: eating out, waiting for a plane, checking into a hotel, or during a theater break. These were all times when I used to smoke."
CAE_63,C1,"Dorothy Hodgkin is the only British woman scientist to have won a Nobel Prize, yet she is not well-known in her own country. Georgina Ferry, who is writing Hodgkin's biography, has noticed that many people in Britain are unaware of Hodgkin's achievements. Hodgkin, who passed away in 1994, was an extraordinary person. Her life mirrored significant changes in the 20th century, like the progress of women's education and the global spread of science.
When Ferry started her research, she read scientific biographies and was surprised to find that even famous scientists like Linus Pauling, who won Nobel Prizes in chemistry and peace, were not well-known in Britain. This lack of interest in scientists' lives is partly because some people think scientific biographies are boring. Peter Medawar, another Nobel laureate, once said that scientists' lives are often dull to read about. This view is common among publishers and booksellers, who often treat scientists differently from other biographical subjects.
However, this is changing. More scientists are appearing in public in different ways. For example, Richard Dawkins presents TV quiz prizes, and geneticist Steve Jones advertises cars on TV. These activities help people see scientists as real people, not just as researchers.
The publishing world is also changing. Scientific biographies used to be serious and focused only on work, ignoring personal lives. But books like Richard Feynman's ""Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman?"" show scientists as real people with interesting lives. Now, even famous scientists like Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein are shown with their personal flaws.
Dorothy Hodgkin was dedicated to her scientific work. She solved the structures of penicillin, vitamin B12, and insulin, which won her the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1964. She also had three children and a husband who was often away. Her personal life may not seem directly related to her work, but it shows how she balanced different parts of her life.
Understanding scientific ideas is not harder than reading Shakespeare or learning a new language; it just requires effort. It's unfortunate that many educated people don't recognize the names of important scientists like Dorothy Hodgkin, even though they are part of our rich cultural heritage."
CAE_56,C1,"Margaret and Her Water-Finding Skills
Margaret Wilkins is known for having a special ability, often called a 'sixth sense'. She can use a forked hazel stick to find water underground. Many farmers, whose wells have dried up, ask for her help. Margaret and her husband run a well-drilling business. They use modern tools like drilling rigs and air-compressed hammers, but to find water, Margaret only needs her hazel stick. They are successful more than 90% of the time.
This skill, called dowsing, is the ability to find water, minerals, or lost objects underground. There are many ideas about how dowsing works. Some people think it involves physical forces like magnetism, while others believe it is more spiritual. One popular theory is that everything on Earth vibrates, and water vibrates more than other things. Dowsers, like Margaret, might be very good at sensing these vibrations. Some say they can 'sense' or even smell water.
In recent years, when there has been less rain, Margaret has been very busy. At one point, people had to wait almost six weeks for her help. Most of her customers are farmers with dry wells. She says, 'We usually see customers only once because wells last a long time.' Other customers include people with remote holiday homes and golf-course developers who need water for their facilities.
Margaret tries to find water 50 to 70 meters deep. She avoids drilling where farm waste could contaminate the water. The water she finds flows through cracks in hard rock, which helps keep it clean. However, in Cornwall, where she works, there is a lot of iron in the ground, so she has to be careful. Electricity is needed to run the water pump, so it's best if the well is near power sources.
To find water on large properties like golf courses, Margaret starts with a map and a pendulum. She holds the pendulum over the map, and it swings when it is over a spot with water. After identifying possible areas, she walks over the land with her hazel stick. When she is above water, she feels a strange sensation and uses the stick to find the exact spot to drill. The stick moves when water is directly below. It's important to drill exactly where the stick indicates, or they might miss the water. Her husband also checks the area, and they only drill when they agree on the spot.
Margaret's skill is not just an old tradition. Many people are interested in this mysterious ability. She calls it an 'intuitive perception of the environment'. This might explain why she is so good at finding water. Without this 'sixth sense', her family wouldn't be able to run their well-drilling business successfully year after year."
CAE_36,C1,"**We changed lives for a day!**
Have you ever thought about swapping lives with someone else for a day? Maybe you think it would be fun to try something different? We arranged this for four people - read about their experiences.
**Amanda's Story**
Amanda, a 23-year-old mother with two daughters, swapped lives with her friend Cindy, a 30-year-old waitress at a busy London restaurant. Amanda had never been in such a lively place before. It was dark, noisy, and full of people, which was very different from her hometown. She had to learn quickly how to carry a tray of drinks with one hand. It seemed easy for the other waitresses, but Amanda struggled and dropped the drinks. She was embarrassed, but the other waitresses laughed it off, saying everyone makes mistakes at first.
By 11:30 am, a line of customers had formed, and Amanda felt nervous. Luckily, the orders were automated, so she didn't have to remember them. After a few hours, her feet hurt, and she found the loud music hard to handle. She often had to ask customers to repeat themselves, which was embarrassing. By the end of her shift at 5 pm, she was exhausted and wanted to soak her feet. She was surprised to hear it had been a ""quiet"" day. Amanda realized waitressing was more tiring than she thought and required a bubbly personality and the ability to handle many customers. She was glad to return to her children, finding it easier than waitressing.
**Cindy's Story**
Cindy was nervous but excited to be a ""mum"" for the day. She knew Amanda's daughters could be cheeky but thought she could manage. After Amanda left for work, Cindy had to dress and feed the girls, drop Sophie at school, and Katie at nursery. She expected some free time but had chores to do, like making beds and cleaning. After picking up Katie and shopping, she brought Sophie home, and the girls started playing loudly. Cindy hoped they would tire out, but they didn't. She managed to get them to bed by 8 pm, but they kept asking for water to stay up. Cindy found it exhausting to look after two small children and realized how much responsibility it involved. Despite the challenges, she enjoyed the day.
**Rosemary's Story**
Rosemary, a 42-year-old dairy farmer, swapped with Hilary, a 30-year-old primary school teacher. On the farm, Rosemary usually wakes up at 5:30 am, so sleeping until 7 was a treat. She was unsure about what to wear to school. At the school assembly, she hoped to blend in among 400 pupils. She helped with a maths class and a nature project, which was different from her school days. By lunchtime, she was tired but found teachers only have a short break. She attended a staff meeting and helped with athletics trials. After lunch, there was a silent reading lesson and a French lesson, where the children practiced on her. Finally, they had Physical Education, and Rosemary was exhausted. She found speaking in front of the class challenging. Despite teachers having more holidays, she preferred farming.
**Hilary's Story**
Hilary arrived at White House Farm at 8:30 am, surprised that Rosemary had been up for three hours. The farm has 100 Jersey cows, 15 calves, and about 800 ewes. Rosemary also makes ice cream, yogurt, and cream. Hilary spent the morning in the ice-cream parlour, bottling milk and packaging ice cream. At lunchtime, she checked the sheep and helped a fallen ewe. She realized how important it was to check them daily. After feeding the calves, she started milking, which took two and a half hours. Hilary found the day lonely and missed the children. She learned that farming is demanding, with little time off, and the income is irregular. Despite its romantic image, the reality of farming is tough."
CAE_6,C1,"A trumpet isn't just for Christmas... It's interesting how many musicians come from homes without music. Hakan Hardenberger, the only son of non-musical parents in southern Sweden, has become a unique trumpet player at the age of 30. His recordings introduce new music, including concertos by lesser-known composers from the baroque and classical periods, as well as new works. When you meet him, he seems even younger than his age, with a fresh and open manner like the sound of the trumpet. Recently, he played the Hummel Trumpet Concerto in one of London's top concert halls, and a TV feature focused on his work and development, filmed in both the UK and Sweden.
Hardenberger was born near Malmo and started his career thanks to a Christmas gift when he was eight. His father, who liked Louis Armstrong's music, decided to give him a real trumpet instead of a toy. The gift was a success, and Hardenberger never stopped playing. His mother found a teacher for him, Bo Nilsson, a rising musician in the Malmo Symphony Orchestra, who noticed his natural talent. Hardenberger is grateful for having such a dedicated teacher who was passionate about the trumpet and connected with players worldwide.
Hardenberger explains that the trumpet is a primitive instrument with imperfections, and no two mouthpieces are the same. He believes in understanding these imperfections and working with them. From a young age, he had a unique sound, which he developed further. Unlike John Wallace, a great British trumpet player who started in brass bands and orchestras, Hardenberger always saw himself as a solo artist. He admired the French trumpeter Maurice Andre, who also focused on solo performances, and collected all his records.
His parents supported his ambition to make a career out of trumpet playing. At 15, he needed to decide where to study. America was considered too far and dangerous, so he went to Paris at 16 to study with Pierre Thibaud. Thibaud advised against joining an orchestra, comparing it to gardening. Hardenberger knew he played better than others his age, but it was during his first competition at 17 in Paris that he realized he had a special gift for communicating through music. Thibaud suggested entering the competition for experience. Hardenberger learned the pieces for the first round and advanced to the second, where he knew most of the pieces. In the final, he faced a challenging concerto but enjoyed the performance, realizing that even though he didn't play perfectly, people listened to him.
Hardenberger's realism about his work might seem arrogant, but that's not true. He thoughtfully avoids analyzing his gift for communication, believing that trying to explain it might ruin it. He believes the power of music lies in its ability to move people."
CAE_33,C1,"**A.** The story of Tristan Smith takes place in the made-up country of Efica. It's a special tale about human power, history, and humor. The author has skillfully created a world with its own history and traditions. The book is known for its humor and the author's unique way of seeing things. It also offers deep psychological insights, making it a challenging but rewarding read.
**B.** Harriet is a middle-class woman with an architect husband and her own business. Normally, she wouldn't meet someone like Sheila, who is from a working-class background and takes care of her elderly father and grandson, Leo. Their lives change when Leo attacks Harriet's son, Joe. After the court case, neither boy talks about the incident. Leo, who was a good student, won't explain his actions, and Joe becomes withdrawn. Harriet is deeply affected by her son's condition, while Sheila feels guilty and asks to meet Harriet. This meeting leads to an unusual friendship. The author is great at showing how people deal with big changes in their lives and captures the feeling that mothers often have of never doing enough.
**C.** This book, which was shortlisted for the Booker Prize, tells the story of a remote Scottish Orkney island and its people over a long, quiet history. It connects this story with important moments in Scottish history, imagined through the dreams of a young character, Throfinn Ragnarson. Throfinn disappears at one point but returns after World War II, having learned to appreciate the simple lives of his ancestors.
**D.** After a successful book, the author has written a sequel with the same gentle irony and sharp observations about family life. Fifteen years after her daughter's death, Aurora Greenway is nearing her seventies with her lively friend, Rosie Sunlap. Aurora's approach to life is a mix of vanity, charm, and kindness, and Rosie helps her in dealing with suitors and friends. By the end, Aurora realizes that time has passed and a new generation is taking over. The author is good at showing the sadness that lies beneath everyday life and highlights the unpredictability of events.
**E.** Six different people are brought together by millionaire Logan Urquhart to sail around the South Pacific islands on his yacht, the Ardent Spirit. The author uses beautiful language to describe how each person goes on a journey of self-discovery. They return home with their spirits lifted by their time on the ocean. The author uses striking images to explore themes of memory and awareness, which can be both confusing and enlightening."

""I wake up at 6:30 am, go to the gym at 7 am, and start work by 8 am. I begin operating at 8:30 am. I operate all day on Monday and Wednesday, and sometimes on Friday afternoons. Most head surgeries take three hours, but some can last all day. I've worked ten hours straight without eating or using the bathroom. Deciding when and how to operate can be stressful. I don't feel stressed while operating, but I do worry about the next day's plans. Brain surgery is often a last option for patients, but when it succeeds, it's amazing and makes up for the failures. From 10 am to 1 pm, I have an out-patients' clinic where I explain the operations. I enjoy talking to patients, but comforting them can be hard due to time pressure. I leave work between 6 pm and 8 pm. Some nights and weekends, I'm on call and always carry my pager. On holidays, I worry for the first three days about my patients, and I dream about operating at night. I find it hard to relax.""

**MARITA'S DAY**  
""I get up at 7:45 am, leave home by 8:20 am, take the train, and arrive at work by 9:15 am. On Mondays at 10:30 am, we have meetings to discuss our work, problems, or if anyone needs help. We work in teams; mine has three senior designers, a company partner, and a junior designer. Only 10-15% of the work is design; the rest is production. I get a brief from the client, and if we're lucky, they have clear ideas about their goals, target market, and project form. I spend three to four weeks designing, researching, and developing the project. After presenting my ideas to the client and getting approval, we work on estimates and budgets, and I start hiring photographers and illustrators. I coordinate with printers to ensure the job is done on time. I spend a lot of time managing people and need to communicate well with a wide range of people. Briefing them correctly is crucial. Once their work is done, I assemble everything and send it to the printers. Managing several jobs at once can be very stressful. Deadlines are always near, and no day is the same. Lunch is at 1 pm for an hour, and we try to go to the pub. Otherwise, I have sandwiches and work through. It's great when a client likes your designs, but disappointing when a job is rejected after hard work. I get home at 7:30 pm at the earliest, often later. I find it hard to relax when I'm busy.""

Since chauffeuring is a sitting job, I have to watch my diet and exercise. I usually have a big breakfast and just snack during the day. People often ask me to recommend places, so I need to know my way around. Many jobs are pre-booked, so I can check routes beforehand. Not everyone is polite; some passengers are rude, but most are well-behaved, and I have a good relationship with regular clients. Sometimes I hear conversations in the car and have to focus on driving and not listening. The press has tried to get me to talk about clients, but I won't.

**TRACY'S DAY**  
""I get up at 7 am, leave home at 7:30 am, and start my first job. My assistant and I mostly maintain gardens we designed and landscaped. We do some commercial jobs, but mostly private gardens. We spend about an hour and a half at each house. Around 11 am, we get hungry and go to a local café for a big breakfast. I often wish time didn't pass so quickly. In summer, I may work until 10 pm; in winter, until 4:30 pm. The business office is at home, so when I return, I listen to messages and return calls. If someone wants their garden landscaped, I usually arrange a consultation in the evening. We specialize in using old materials and unusual plants to make gardens look old. Sometimes people have specific ideas that aren't great, but it's satisfying to see a garden bloom after landscaping. It's hard to relax in the evenings because I can hear the business phone. I never have trouble sleeping because the work is so physical that I'm always tired. I'm not very strong, but I'm fit. It's a tough job physically, but it allows creativity.""

I ensure contractors follow the schedule, specifications, safety systems, and minimize environmental impact. I coordinate site professionals and solve problems. Contractors start at 6 am, so my first task is to learn from the clerk of works what happened since I left. The rest of the day depends on this information. I review paperwork from contractors or answer design questions. Lunch is usually half an hour between 2 pm and 2:30 pm, but I often eat on the go. When contractors are on break, it's easier to check the site. Checking their work can cause conflict, so we need an open relationship. I see the duty resident engineer once a day, but if something important happens, I act immediately. I usually leave the site around 6 pm and am always on call."""
CAE_40,C1,"**Careers: Six People Talk About Their Typical Working Day**
**A. Credit Card Executive**
I wake up at 6 am and get to the office by 7:30 am. I manage customer programs for our regular credit card users. My job includes launching and managing the Membership Rewards program in major European markets. I keep in touch with current card users, find new ones, and build relationships with partner companies. I spend the first 45 minutes organizing my day and answering emails. I handle all advertising for the membership program across Europe, so I meet with our marketing team and advertising agencies to plan strategies and future developments. I have meetings most of the day, but I keep my door open for questions. I travel to different markets in Europe once or twice a week to discuss issues. When I'm in London, I leave work between 6:30 pm and 7:00 pm.
**B. Record Company Executive**
I start work at 10:00 am and go through the mail, which includes demo tapes, letters from producers, concert information, and invoices. The phone starts ringing around 10:30 am with calls from producers and publishers. I have meetings throughout the day about campaigns or projects for artists, involving the press, marketing, and the managing director. When I listen to demo tapes, I try to be constructive because it's important to the artists. I know if the sound fits our record label. After signing a band, we work on the first album, choosing songs, producers, and musicians. I share my vision of the album with the company for marketing and sales. I also manage budgets and spending. I leave work at 7:00 pm at the earliest and often go to gigs, sometimes seeing up to five new groups a night. After gigs, I might visit an artist in the studio. My social life is mostly work-related, and I often get home at 1:00 am, where I listen to music to relax.
**C. Sales Director**
I get up at 8:00 am and drive to work, arriving by 9:30 am. I open the mail, check the diary for client visits, and wait to see who comes in. I enjoy showing people around the showrooms and selling furniture, knowing it's going to a good home. We sell antiques priced between £1,000 and £6,000, buying from London salerooms, country house sales, private clients, and overseas. Many items need restoration, so I work with gilders, picture framers, and paper repairers. I read the Antiques Trade Gazette during coffee breaks to stay updated on the business and often visit the Victoria and Albert Museum to compare furniture. I do the accounts once a month and tax returns every three months. I go home at 5:30 pm and it takes about an hour to unwind.
**D. Air Traffic Controller**
I work set shifts, leaving home at 6:00 am for early shifts. At 7:00 am, I take over from the night shift at one of the four control positions in the tower. We rotate stations, working for about an hour and a half, then taking a half-hour break before switching stations. The team includes air traffic controllers, a supervisor, and a watch manager, and we control aircraft movements together. In winter, we handle about 1,000 movements a day, and even more in summer. Night shifts are quieter, allowing time to read up on new air traffic requirements. It's important to be alert in this job, so I don't hesitate to take sick leave if needed. The work is stressful, and it takes time to relax after a shift. I hope to become a watch manager and eventually a general manager of the airport.
**E. Shop Manager**
If I'm on an early shift, I leave home by 8:00 am. I start by setting up the electronic point-of-sale system. I ensure someone is at the till and coordinate staff lunches and breaks. I spend the morning helping customers and ordering books for them. I enjoy serving customers, though it can be frustrating when they expect me to gather many books based on reviews. Between 2:00 pm and 4:00 pm, publishers' representatives visit the shop, and I discuss new titles for the coming months. I decide how many copies of a title the shop might sell. When featuring a new title, I ensure it's delivered on time. The early shift ends at 5:45 pm. I work late shifts twice a week, closing the computer system, locking up, and going home.
**F. Financial Analyst**
I listen to the news at 7:00 am, then get up and take a taxi to work, arriving at 8:45 am. I contact our freelance reporters to learn about events in my region. I assess financial risks for multinational companies abroad, warning clients of potential issues. I provide three services: an online executive preview, a security forecast, and a travel information security guide. From 9:15 am to 9:30 am, I meet with editors to discuss stories. My first executive preview is due online by 10:00 am, and the second by 11:00 am, so I quickly gather stories. I type them, send them to my editor for approval, and make any necessary changes before they are published. I travel to Africa about three times a year to report on events or stay updated. I leave work around 6:00 pm. It's hard to switch off, and I'm often awake until 1:00 am."
CAE_45,C1,"**Career Power: Take Control at Work**
A. **What Makes a Good Leader?**  
A good leader inspires others and brings about change. Leadership is not about being tall or having a certain background, as early theories suggested. It's not just about being smart either. Pat Dixon, author of ""Making the Difference: Women and Men in the Workplace,"" says leadership is about ""making things happen through people who are as enthusiastic and interested as you are."" Enthusiasm is important, and a good leader should speak clearly and confidently. Dixon says it's about having the confidence to say ""I believe"" instead of ""I think.""
B. **Recognizing Leadership Potential**  
John van Maurik, a director of a Leadership in Management course, believes many people have more leadership potential than they realize. Becoming a leader involves recognizing, developing, and using these hidden talents. We are all born with some leadership ability, but we need the right environment to grow. While it's easy to see leadership in famous figures like Emmeline Pankhurst or Mahatma Gandhi, it can be harder to see it in our own workplaces. Yet, leadership is now seen as essential for effective management.
C. **Reflect on Past Leaders**  
Think about the best and worst bosses you've had. They might have been equally good at setting goals and meeting deadlines. But how did they achieve these? The best leader motivated and supported you. The worst made you feel unimportant and kept information from you, blaming you when things went wrong. The first led well; the second just managed poorly.
D. **Leaders vs. Managers**  
Leaders and managers are different. Managers like working within set rules. Leaders create new paths. Michael Shea, author of ""Leadership Rules,"" writes that a good manager can keep a company running smoothly, but a good leader can transform a struggling organization, whether it's a company, a sports team, or a nation.
E. **Improving Leadership Skills**  
Whether you're a boss or a middle manager, you can improve your leadership skills. Here are some lessons:  
- Leadership is best when you choose to do it. Find what you are passionate about. When you feel inspired to lead, use that energy and act.  
- Think of yourself as a leader. Recognize your ability to lead.  
- Collaboration is good, but sometimes firm leadership is needed. Try different styles. If you usually ask for others' opinions, try taking the lead. See how this changes the outcome.  
- Set goals and exceed them. Identify areas in your job where leadership can improve your effectiveness and career prospects.
F. **Developing Leadership**  
- Leadership doesn't just happen. It develops by taking the lead, taking risks, and learning from mistakes. Learn to delegate, motivate, organize, and give feedback.  
- Don't assume your leadership style will immediately win over colleagues. It might even push them away. Keep improving your communication skills. You don't have to be liked, but your ideas and achievements should be.  
- Be visible and accessible to those who matter. Remember, you don't have to lead all the time. Know where your contribution is crucial and how you can help others become leaders too."
CAE_64,C1,"**Films on Video: Reviews by Nick James**
**A. Abyss**  
Before Titanic, director James Cameron made this intense Cold War thriller. It’s about oil rig workers and navy experts trying to save a nuclear submarine deep underwater. The main character, Bud, and his team remind us of the cool heroes in Howard Hawks' movies. The production design and special effects are very impressive, but the dialogue and characters are not as strong. Despite the skilled filmmaking, the story feels like a typical B-movie.
**B. The Thin Red Line**  
This video release of the James Jones novel about the battle for Guadalcanal, directed by Andrew Marton, is interesting compared to Terrence Malick's new film. While Malick's version is mystical and poetic, Marton's is a more traditional war movie, often closer to the book. It focuses on one soldier and his tough sergeant. Malick's film is richer and more complex, but Marton's has its moments. The flashback of the soldier dreaming of his wife is done with a harshness that might work better than Malick's softer imagery.
**C. On Guard**  
Loosely based on Paul Feval's 1875 novel, this entertaining swashbuckler is better than most musketeer adventures. Fabrice Luchini plays a great villain, a sneaky politician causing chaos. Vincent Perez is a lively hero, though his role is short. Daniel Auteuil, as an acrobat-turned-swordsman, is perhaps too serious for this fun film, but he has his moments. The filmmakers use costume-drama clichés with such wit and energy that it’s enjoyable.
**D. Character**  
This is a serious story set in early 1900s Rotterdam. The detailed production and costumes make the film look like a museum piece. Jan Decleir plays the harsh bailiff Dreverhaven, who is ruthless when evicting tenants. The main story is about his difficult relationship with his son, but the filmmakers focus too much on the period details, missing the dark and intense story.
**E. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly**  
This digitally re-mastered video shows director Leone's skills at their best. The sound editing is excellent, with every sound clear and loud. The story is harsh, and whenever it slows down, Morricone's great music brings excitement. Morally, there’s little difference between the good (Clint Eastwood), the bad (Lee van Cleef), and the ugly (Eli Wallach), as they all act without much scruple in the post-Civil War West.
**F. The Longest Day**  
This three-hour war epic by Darryl Zanuck features 'forty-eight international stars.' With four directors and 23,000 extras, it’s a big production. The early scenes, where soldiers wait for the invasion, feel slow for both the characters and the audience. Logistically, it’s impressive, but it’s better suited for the big screen. On video, it loses some of its impact."
CAE_29,C1,"**BOOK A**  
""Compelling Evidence"" by Steve Martin is a gripping story. The narrator is a lawyer trying to start a new practice after leaving a big law firm. He ends up defending his boss's wife, who is accused of murdering her husband. The trial scenes are exciting, with the verdict uncertain until the end, and there's a surprising twist in the final pages. This is a great first book in a popular genre.
**BOOK B**  
""Curtains for the Cardinal"" starts with excitement and follows Sigismondo, a problem-solver for the Italian Renaissance aristocracy. He gets involved in political and religious intrigue and murder. We always believe he will solve the mystery and find the guilty. The plot is complex and the book is a bit long, but it's still very enjoyable.
**BOOK C**  
""File Under: Deceased"" introduces a new detective, Leah Hunter, created by first-time author Sarah Lacey. Leah is a tax inspector who starts investigating when a strange man dies at her feet. Despite facing challenges and the disapproval of a local detective sergeant, Leah is determined and successful. She is a strong and versatile character.
**BOOK D**  
""Double Deuce"" by Robert B. Parker features Spenser, a smart private investigator. He helps his friend Hawk to remove drug dealers from a poor area in Boston. The dialogue is quick and clever, and there is more philosophy than violence. As always, Parker provides high-quality entertainment.
**BOOK E**  
""False Prophet"" by Faye Kellermann features detectives Pete Decker and Marge Dunn. They investigate an attack and burglary at the home of a famous film star's daughter. The author's easy writing style and understanding of human behavior make this an entertaining mystery.
**BOOK F**  
""Blood Red, Snow White"" is written by Diane Henry and Nicholas Horrock. It features a lawyer and a female client, but the action happens outside the courtroom. The lawyer becomes a victim as the story unfolds. The book mixes romance, money, and violence to create an exciting suspense novel.
**BOOK G**  
""Dead for a Ducat"" by Simon Shaw features actor Philip Fletcher, who becomes a target. A funny group of characters gathers to film a Robin Hood story, but Philip feels this isn't right for his career. Simon Shaw usually entertains, but this time the story is more of a farce and not as good as his usual work.
**BOOK H**  
""Fall Down Easy"" by Lawrence Gough is his best book in a while. Canadian police are after a clever bank robber who targets female bank tellers. The slow and skillful build-up of tension and the portrayal of the smart but troubled robber make this a standout detective novel."
CAE_57,C1,"At 34, Tim Pozzi decided to leave his good job and go backpacking. He wonders why he and others his age are making this choice. This summer, he quit his job, rented out his flat, and planned to travel in Southeast Asia for a year. You might think he's lucky, but he's nervous. It's not his first time traveling; after university, he spent two years backpacking in the Americas. When he returned, he wanted to do it again someday. But life happened—he fell in love, started a career, bought a flat, and got used to earning a salary. Over time, he realized he was giving up his happiness for money. Quitting his job felt like taking control of his life again. Now, he has no ties. Many of his friends are married with children, and while they wouldn't trade places with him, they envy his freedom. He's single and has no big career goals, so he feels he should make the most of his freedom, even for his friends' sake.
Why is he nervous? First, he has to make arrangements. How can he let someone else live in his home? How will he organize the rental? And he needs to decide where to go. He's a procrastinator and is already weeks behind schedule. He told himself to enjoy the summer in England and then thought about staying for the football season. Cutting emotional ties makes it harder. He's delaying because he wonders if he can still handle backpacking. Can he adjust to a simpler life? Will he fit in with younger backpackers? Maybe not. More Britons in their late twenties and thirties want to leave their lives behind and travel. Jennifer Cox from Lonely Planet says people are realizing they can have adventures if they're brave, organized, and confident.
For Danny, a 30-year-old accountant, and his girlfriend Tammy, a 28-year-old teacher, it's a chance to have fun before settling down. They bought a round-the-world ticket for a year. Danny is willing to risk job security for the trip. He knows he might not advance in his career, but he thinks it's worth the risk. When he left his office, he threw his calculator into the river as a sign of defiance. For Matt, who just left the Army, a year of traveling was a time of change. In the military, there's a set way of doing things. He traveled to change this mindset and live better as a civilian.
There are many reasons to travel at this age, but some common factors exist. Angela Baron from the Institute of Personnel Development says the workforce is more flexible now. More people work on short-term contracts, so if a contract ends, there's nothing to lose. Some companies even have career-break policies. They prefer employees to return rather than work for competitors. Dan Hiscocks, managing director of Travellerseye, says more people in their thirties are rethinking their lives. If they're unhappy, they don't just stick with it. They know opportunities exist, and jobs aren't for life anymore. Travel offers a chance to reassess life.
Is this wanderlust a sign of not accepting adulthood? Jennifer Cox thinks not. She says it's a sign of a better-educated, stable society. People want a balanced life, not just to pay bills. They ask, ""Is this what I want?"" Ben, a 32-year-old picture researcher going to Central America for a year, doesn't think he's running away. He's running towards something he wants. But he feels nervous about leaving behind a comfortable routine, like going to the office and having coffee with colleagues. Tim shares Ben's concerns about leaving a stable life. He might not be traveling if his boss wasn't so difficult. Jennifer Cox says there's often a trigger, like a breakup or job loss, that pushes people to travel. Tim needed a push to start, but now he's excited about the next 12 months. Whatever happens, he'll be proud of taking this step, and he believes other older backpackers feel the same."
CAE_42,C1,"Georgina McGuiness took a long break from her journalism career and felt disconnected from the new technology. She shares how she turned her home into an efficient workplace. When she turned 37, she realized she needed to restart her journalism career, which seemed outdated. Her resume showed she was stuck in the 1980s, using old technology like typewriters. She felt unqualified for jobs requiring desktop publishing skills, which she didn't have. She was a technophobe, confused by even simple gadgets like pocket calculators and video timers. 
She thought returning to work would be difficult until she entered a local newspaper competition and won a computer package. Her family received a laptop and a personal computer, and they quickly adapted to new terms like cyberspace and Internet. They started chatting online with people worldwide. The children stopped watching TV, and Georgina set up a small office in the kitchen with a phone, fax machine, CD-ROM, and modem. This allowed her to work from home and still take her children to school. The children were already comfortable with computers from school, but Georgina was hesitant, worried she might lose her work by pressing the wrong button. However, she learned the basic skills and found it logical and easy.
Georgina started freelancing for a magazine, writing two articles a month, and felt she had the best of both worlds. The computer helped her become organized, especially with office tasks. Spreadsheets helped track income and expenses, and pre-formatted invoices saved time. For a journalist, being online meant she could research stories, ask for information, and discuss working from home with others worldwide.
However, working from home has downsides, like feeling isolated and being distracted by household chores. There are also arguments over computer use when the children are home. Many people are buying multimedia PCs for education, leisure, and work, avoiding the daily commute. A report on PC usage in UK homes describes the typical computer user as 38 years old, well-educated, with a personal computer, CD-ROM, laser printer, and modem. Georgina feels ahead of the curve and dreams of emailing a column to a newspaper in Melbourne or publishing her own magazine from home. The possibilities seem endless."
CAE_59,C1,"The Tartan Museum
The new Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh has modern buildings that look very different from the historic area around it. Sally Varlow visited the museum just before it opened to see if the inside was as impressive as the outside. The museum is hard to miss with its large yellow sandstone tower and unique design. When the building was first completed, people had mixed feelings about its modern architecture. Some loved it, calling it a ""masterpiece,"" while others were not so sure.
Inside, the museum tells many stories about Scotland's history, using important historical objects. There is a timeline to help visitors understand the order of events, but it doesn't limit the displays. The museum doesn't let national pride overshadow its treasures, like Mary Queen of Scots' jewels.
The main question is whether people will find the museum interesting enough to visit more than once. Dr. David Clarke, who is in charge of the exhibitions, wants the museum to be enjoyable for everyone, not just experts. He believes in showing the truth about history, so there are no imaginative recreations of the past. Instead, the museum uses explanation panels, captions, and some multimedia to tell the stories of the objects.
The museum's design is impressive, with galleries that flow into each other and plenty of natural light. There is also a Discovery Centre for children, thanks to a group of young advisors from across Scotland. Although the children wanted to ride through the displays, they got a hands-on center instead.
On the top floor, there is a Twentieth Century gallery with objects chosen by Scottish people and others that have impacted life in Scotland. The Prime Minister suggested an electric guitar, while others chose televisions and favorite toys. This gallery will change every three years.
Overall, Dr. Clarke believes that objects can vividly show the past. The modern architecture of the museum works well from the inside, but whether it fits in with its surroundings is still up for debate."
CAE_54,C1,"The end of print newspapers might take longer than expected. Transition is a comforting word, suggesting a smooth change from the present to the future. However, the shift of newspapers to the online world is uncertain and uncomfortable. Many believe it will happen because print sales are dropping while online visits are increasing. For example, The Daily Telegraph and The Guardian have seen print sales fall by 8-10% in a year, but their websites are more popular than ever. 
Despite this, the situation is not straightforward. The World Association of Newspapers reports that global newspaper circulation actually rose by 1.1% last year, thanks to growth in Asia, even though sales in the West declined. News magazines, which we might expect to struggle, actually saw a 5.4% increase. 
Books show a similar trend. E-readers like Kindle are selling well, but the value of physical book sales only dropped by 0.4%. It seems people are using both digital and print formats. 
The idea that young people are abandoning newspapers is exaggerated. Nearly 5 million people aged 15 to 35 still read national dailies. Different countries have different trends. In Britain, print sales fell by 10.8%, but in Germany, the decline was only 7%, and in France, just 3.1%. 
These differences suggest the situation is more complex than expected. In the US, online advertising was supposed to support digital newspapers, but digital ad revenues are now falling. Many US newspapers have introduced paywalls, but the best way to attract paying readers is to offer both print and digital access together. Print is still important for selling online subscriptions, and print ads earn much more money than online ads. 
This is challenging for newspaper companies because maintaining both print and online editions is costly and complex. However, newspapers still have a strong presence in print, and being noticed online is more difficult."
CAE_32,C1,"**Photographing People**
People are very interesting to photograph. A picture with a person in it is usually more engaging than one without. However, photographing people well can be challenging. Besides technical and artistic skills, a photographer must pay attention to actions, gestures, and expressions. Sometimes, the camera can make people act unnaturally.
**A. Grouping People**
Avoid straight lines in group photos. Ask people to stand at different angles and distances, or on different levels. You can also have some people sit or kneel in front so all faces are visible, or take the photo from a higher angle.
**B. Posing for Pictures**
People often act unnaturally in front of a camera. They might become stiff. Help them relax by suggesting they find a comfortable position, like folding their hands or putting them in their pockets.
**C. The Right Approach**
Don't pretend you are not taking a picture when you clearly are, as this can create tension. Most people will agree to be photographed, even if they protest at first. They might become self-conscious, so you may need to guide them. A photo can be ruined if the person is looking away aimlessly.
**D. Eye Contact**
A photo is more impactful if the person looks at the viewer. Ask them to look into the lens, but they don't have to smile. They might not be able to do this for long, so remind them just before you take the picture. You can also say something funny to get a natural reaction.
**E. Candid Concentration**
Instead of direct eye contact, the person can focus on something in the picture. This might be easier for them, and the viewer can follow their gaze. Candid shots are interesting, and the person's expression is important.
**F. Expressions and Gestures**
Expressions and gestures tell us a lot about the person in a photo. A laughing child makes the viewer smile, while a sad expression can make the viewer feel sympathy. Look for familiar expressions like shrugs, winks, or thumbs-up. They are a universal visual language.
**G. Situation Interest**
Photos that show a person with their background can be more interesting. Make sure the background adds to the photo and doesn't distract from the person. Use a wide-angle lens to make the person stand out against the background.
**H. Interaction**
When people are interacting, there are great photo opportunities. Couples, mothers and babies, or teams working together make appealing shots. Look for eye contact or physical contact, like a handshake, or wait for an expressive gesture.
**I. People and Places**
Many photos of people are taken on holidays to show the places they visit. To improve these photos, use a standard or wide-angle lens and step back to include the whole scene. Ask people to stand close to the camera so they are in the foreground without blocking the background. An elevated camera position can help balance the people and the place in the photo.
**J. To Pose or Not to Pose?**
Decide why you want to take the picture. If it's to remember someone you met briefly, ask them to pose against a nice background. Family photos can be boring if they are all formal poses. Candid photos of events are more lively and capture natural moments. A spontaneous picture can bring back memories better than a posed one."
CAE_65,C1,"**Under Sarah's Spell**
Sarah Janson is a trompe-l'oeil artist. This means she paints pictures that trick the eye into seeing something that looks real. In this interview with Joanna Watt, we learn more about her and her work.
Sarah Janson is different from many artists because she doesn't sign her paintings unless someone asks her to. She believes the artwork is more important than the artist. She is very modest and sometimes acts like her paintings create themselves. This attitude makes her a bit shy during interviews. She doesn't like talking about herself and feels uncomfortable being photographed.
However, once she relaxes, the interview becomes fun and interesting. Sarah has been a trompe-l'oeil artist for sixteen years. She studied drawing for two years at art school, got a degree in graphic illustration, and worked at a publishing house. But she wasn't satisfied with illustration, so she started working with a decorator named Jim Smart. He asked her to try trompe-l'oeil, and she loved it. She decided to start her own business, even though she wasn't sure where it would lead.
Sarah's skills in observing details, which she developed through illustrating, are very important for trompe-l'oeil. She believes that no one can teach you trompe-l'oeil; it's something you learn by observing life. She always feels like she is still learning and believes that if you think you've mastered something, it's time to stop.
Sarah is honest about her weaknesses. For example, she says she can't paint bread well because it looks like grey concrete. She also struggles with math, which was a problem when she had to calculate measurements for a big project at Lulworth Castle. She often questions herself and doesn't openly acknowledge her talent, sometimes talking about herself in the third person.
Despite her modesty, Sarah's work is exceptional. Her trompe-l'oeil paintings are much better than those of many others who have tried this art form. She has completed many important projects for both companies and private clients. Her work is often inspired by architecture, like a dining room painted to look like a Venetian palace or a painting that makes a hallway look like it leads to more rooms.
Sarah knows that trompe-l'oeil must do two things: it must trick you and then keep your interest by engaging your imagination. She believes the art should be personal to the client, and she enjoys working with them to create ideas. Many of her clients become friends because she spends a lot of time with them while working on their projects.
Sarah appreciates her clients, especially those who give her creative freedom. They are happy with her work, which keeps her busy, even though she doesn't like to boast about her talent. She repeats that she doesn't like to shout about herself or her work, preferring a more subtle approach. But her work is so impressive that it deserves more recognition, even if she doesn't seek it."
CAE_61,C1,"**Emotional Intelligence - The Key to Success**
**A** The way we are judged at work is changing. It's not just about how smart we are or our training, but also how well we manage ourselves and interact with others. This new way of judging is important for hiring and promotions. It helps predict who will excel and who might not. These skills are crucial for future job opportunities. They are different from what we learned in school, where exams were important. Now, it's assumed we have enough intelligence and technical skills. The focus is on social skills and personal qualities like initiative, empathy, adaptability, and persuasiveness. These are called emotional intelligence.
**B** Job security is less certain now, so personal qualities are more important at work. These qualities have been called different names like 'character' and 'soft skills', but now we call them 'emotional intelligence'. This means being aware of and managing our own and others' feelings, and using them to guide our actions. Emotional intelligence includes self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills. It's not just about being nice. Sometimes it means being honest, even if it's uncomfortable. It also doesn't mean expressing all feelings freely. Instead, it means managing feelings so they help people work well together towards a common goal.
**C** Many businesses now see emotional intelligence as important for management. The more complex the job, the more emotional intelligence matters. Without it, technical skills and intelligence might not be used effectively. Some people succeed despite lacking emotional intelligence, but as work becomes more complex and team-based, companies that encourage teamwork and customer focus have an advantage. Emotional intelligence is becoming essential for success in every job worldwide.
**D** Unlike IQ, which changes little, emotional intelligence can grow as we learn from life experiences. Studies show that people often get better at managing emotions, motivating themselves, and improving social skills over time. This growth is sometimes called maturity. Emotional intelligence can be learned, and we can add these skills to help us succeed, especially when job stability is uncertain. While emotional intelligence isn't a magic solution for struggling companies, ignoring it can make everything else less effective."
CAE_52,C1,"'Should the media make money from content they don't own? Digital cameras and camera phones have made it easier to capture important events, but social media has changed citizen photography even more. News often breaks on social networks, so some journalists use them to find images when events happen quickly. Unfortunately, some reporters have used user-generated content (UGC) without asking for permission. Even though there is official advice that images on social media can be used without permission in special cases or if there is a strong public interest, people still argue about whether this is right. Research shows that about one in ten people would film or photograph a news event, so UGC is clearly important for the future of the media. However, to keep a good relationship with the public, the media must make sure people are properly rewarded for their work and always ask for permission.'"
CAE_28,C1,"**Ancient Chinese Medicine in the West: Acupuncture**
Acupuncture is a practice that is 2,000 years old and comes from traditional Chinese medicine. This system includes herbal remedies, massage, diet, physical manipulation, and exercise. Acupuncture is used to treat many conditions, but it is most known in the West for helping with pain relief. Some general practitioners, midwives, and physiotherapists use it regularly for this purpose.
**A. What is Acupuncture?**
Traditional Chinese medicine believes that health is when the energy of the mind, body, and spirit are balanced. This energy, called Qi (pronounced ""chee""), flows through the body along paths called meridians. There are twelve main meridians, each connected to an internal organ, and many smaller ones that carry Qi to every cell. If the flow of Qi is disturbed, the body can become unbalanced, leading to weakness or illness. An acupuncturist will try to find where the Qi is imbalanced by checking your pulse, looking at your tongue, and assessing your overall appearance. They will also ask about your medical history, current health, and lifestyle habits. Acupuncture involves inserting fine needles into the skin, sometimes with added warmth or pressure, to stimulate the flow of Qi.
**B. Acupuncture Points**
The points used in acupuncture are related to meridians and may not be near the area of pain. People often feel a dull ache or tingling when the needle is moved, either by hand or with an electro-acupuncture machine. This feeling indicates that the needle has reached the Qi in a meridian. There are over 300 main points on the meridians, with many more used less frequently.
**C. Scientific Explanations**
Even without accepting traditional Chinese principles, Western doctors recognize that acupuncture can relieve pain. Scientific explanations suggest that acupuncture might work by stimulating nerves to block pain signals from reaching the brain or by releasing natural pain-relieving substances called endorphins.
**D. Types of Pain Treated**
Many people with chronic pain turn to acupuncture as a last resort. It is commonly used for back pain, sports injuries, arthritis, headaches, migraines, and post-surgery pain. Acupuncturists also claim to treat menstrual pain, facial nerve pain, and pain in terminally ill patients.
**E. Modern Use of Acupuncture**
Although acupuncture has been used in China for over 2,000 years, using it instead of anesthesia during surgery began in the 1950s. This helped convince some doctors outside China of its effectiveness. In China, acupuncture is used in various surgeries, including tonsillectomies, caesareans, and even open-heart surgery. It can be used alone, with electrical stimulation, or with drugs. It is said to eliminate pain, but this varies from person to person. Acupuncture anesthesia has no side effects like conventional anesthetics, such as nausea, and recovery is quicker.
**F. Effectiveness of Acupuncture**
Clinical trials for acupuncture are challenging to conduct, but those that have been done show that 50 to 80 percent of people find it effective for chronic pain. Acupuncturists agree with this success rate but acknowledge it doesn't work for everyone. For chronic pain, it usually takes six to seven visits to feel significant relief, though some improvement should be felt after two or three visits.
**G. A Different View on Pain**
Western and Chinese medicine view pain differently. Acupuncturists take a holistic approach, considering not just symptoms but also underlying weaknesses in Qi and external factors like weather conditions. They ask if the pain is worse in cold, heat, damp, or wind, and whether it feels sharp, dull, throbbing, constant, or burning. These factors help decide how to treat the pain with acupuncture, unlike the typical approach of a medical doctor.
**H. Traditional vs. Modern Approaches**
Some medical professionals have traditional acupuncture training, while others, including many GPs, prefer scientific explanations over traditional Chinese theory. Traditional acupuncturists believe that only by using traditional methods can deep changes be made for a longer-lasting cure, which is hard to measure in trials. It's important to choose an acupuncturist carefully, and they should refer you to a medical doctor if further investigation is needed."
CAE_35,C1,"P.D. James, whose full name is Phyllis Dorothy James, is a famous crime writer known for her complex and imaginative stories. She has a calm and authoritative presence, which might make you think she could have been a headmistress if she hadn't become a writer. However, she admits that this authority hides her shyness. Her famous detective character, Adam Dalgliesh, is somewhat based on her, or how she imagines she might have been if she were a man. Like Dalgliesh, she prefers to work alone, especially when writing, needing complete privacy.
Despite her success, with 12 major detective novels read by millions worldwide, she is modest about her fame. She enjoys the psychological novels of her friend Ruth Rendell, who writes under the name Barbara Vine, and also reads works by women authors like Iris Murdoch and Anita Brookner, as well as male authors like Graham Greene and Evelyn Waugh.
P.D. James found success later in life. She was 42 when her first novel, ""Cover Her Face,"" was published. Born in Oxford and raised in Cambridge, she met her husband, Connor Bantry White, there. Life was challenging after her husband returned from World War II very ill. She had to work long hours to support him and their two daughters, Clare and Jane. Her husband's parents helped by taking care of the children during those tough times.
While working full-time for the National Health Service and later at the Home Office, she used her organizational skills effectively. Her work included administration for forensic science research and dealing with juvenile crime. During this time, she became used to seeing corpses, but it was the structure of writing crime novels that interested her, not death itself. She always wanted to be a writer and saw detective stories as a way to learn how to write serious novels. Writing these stories allowed her to bring order to chaos and show the value of life, even if the life in question was not lovable. She believes that nobody truly likes violence."
CAE_5,C1,"The pen is mightier than the psychoanalyst
The study of handwriting to understand a person's character is becoming more popular. In some countries, if you apply for a job, you might be asked for a handwriting sample. Your handwriting could help decide if you are right for the job. Handwriting analysis, also known as graphology, is seen as a real science in many places. Researchers say it can help identify certain illnesses, like heart disease and cancer, and show psychological and emotional issues. More companies are using handwriting analysis for career guidance and during interviews. Many large companies hire graphologists to look at the handwriting of people applying for important jobs. However, most doctors and psychiatrists are still unsure about the value of graphology.
Patricia Marne, a graphologist with over 20 years of experience, believes doctors should take it more seriously. She thinks handwriting can show psychological traits and some medical conditions. She says, ""Handwriting can show social class and intelligence. It can also help assess mental ability, whether someone should focus on arts or sciences, and if they have a tricky or honest character."" According to Ms. Marne, graphology can be useful in spotting criminal tendencies: ""Criminals often have messy handwriting, usually poorly shaped. Many come from difficult backgrounds and have stopped developing emotionally. This can appear as childish handwriting or writing over letters multiple times.""
Ms. Marne can tell if people are honest, manipulative, or reliable workers. ""Young male offenders often have high ascenders, showing they live in a fantasy world and dream of success. Graphologists can see if violence might happen, if the writer is under too much pressure, or if there are psychopathic tendencies. Handwriting can even predict potential suicides."" She also says heart and lung problems can appear in handwriting. ""You can't diagnose from one sample unless the writing is clearly shaky or disturbed. But if it changes over time or becomes disjointed, or if there's a break in the signature that wasn't there before, it could mean something serious has happened."" A big emotional upset can also temporarily change a signature, she says.
Ms. Marne explains that handwriting can show other psychological traits. People whose letters form 'threads' instead of clear shapes are often clever and tricky. Those who write mostly in capital letters might be hiding their true selves. Light pressure in writing shows sensitivity and low energy. Original handwriting, different from standard script, shows confidence and artistic talent. Disconnected writing is a sign of a loner. Very small signatures show inhibition and an inferiority complex; circles over the 'i' are a call for attention, and crossing the 't' heavily over the whole word shows intolerance and a patronizing attitude.
Ms. Marne says it takes six years of study and experience to analyze handwriting accurately, along with empathy and intuition. She believes more research is needed to make graphology a proper science, and she thinks this will happen soon. ""It's more accurate than psychoanalysis because you can learn a person's whole history, including emotional crises, without asking questions they might answer incorrectly.""
While this sounds interesting, there is little solid evidence to support these claims. Some psychiatrists are very critical. They say handwriting is a result of education, artistic skill, and the type of writing taught, and it has no other meaning."
CAE_41,C1,"'Is your office working well? Fresh air and good chairs are important for a happy, healthy workforce, according to a new survey. We visited four different offices to see how healthy and happy they were as work environments. Our expert panel included a building health consultant, an ergonomist who studies people's working conditions, and an occupational psychologist. Here are their opinions.
Office A: Advertising Agency
Building Health Consultant: This office is very simple; no central heating, no mechanical ventilation, and windows open directly to the street. It's hard to see why this space works, but the small, dynamic team seems happy. They adjust to the seasons by opening doors and roof panels or using electric heaters, much like they do at home. This might be the key: a team of seven people has created a happy, homely work environment without outside rules.
Ergonomist: The furniture here is mismatched and often causes bad working postures. Chairs are old, most aren't adjustable, and many are broken. Despite this, the staff have a varied work schedule, which they control, including office work, client meetings, and presentations. This variety reduces the risk of fatigue, boredom, and muscle problems.
Occupational Psychologist: Staff enjoy the variety of work and the flexible office space. They said their office was 'just the right size'—small enough to know what colleagues are doing, but large enough to work alone. I found the office attractive and fun, showing both efficiency and creativity.
Office B: News Service
Building Health Consultant: The office may not be exciting, but it is comfortable and the staff don't dislike it. The air quality and maintenance are good, helped by a No Smoking policy.
Ergonomist: The company has already used an ergonomist. Chairs are excellent, and lighting and computer equipment are good. Space is good, but the layout could be better. The environment is impersonal and dull, with grey, bare walls.
Occupational Psychologist: Walls are bare except for year planners and a poster about maternity rights. Most staff have been there for at least five years, and relationships are satisfactory. The office could improve if desks were arranged to share information more easily. Success stories or upcoming projects could be displayed on the walls.
Office C: Bank
Building Health Consultant: This office gets mixed reactions. It feels like being in a glass case, viewing and being viewed by many similar setups. Despite smokers and non-smokers in a small space, the air doesn't seem stale. Even standing 1.5 meters from a smoker, you can't smell the cigarette.
Ergonomist: The office is very standard and uninspiring. Desks are just adequate. Not all chairs meet requirements, but this is user choice. Computer screens are often on small desks with lowered keyboard shelves, which is outdated.
Occupational Psychologist: Staff support each other and are well-served by technology. Many communication awards are displayed. The wood-colored panels and brown carpet give a slightly serious effect. The office is busy.
Office D: Newspaper
Building Health Consultant: It's hard to say anything good about this building. The air-conditioning is poorly controlled, causing big temperature changes. The space is cluttered, and most people have inadequate desk space. The office is very dusty, with many places for dust to settle. The roof collects dust, which can fall on people below.
Ergonomist: The furniture looks more suited to a carpentry workshop than a high-tech industry. Most chairs are not good for keyboard users, especially those shorter than 1.75 m. Many chairs are old, lack adjustment, and have armrests that prevent users from getting close to the desk.
Occupational Psychologist: Old brown chairs, dirty carpets, dust, and dirt everywhere. There's a lot of room for improvement—the place needs a good clean-up, individual success should be more recognized, and air conditioning needs immediate improvement due to many smokers. Few conversations were happening when we visited; everyone seemed stressed and focused on deadlines. The company needs to adopt team-working policies.'"
CAE_38,C1,"Chewing Gum Culture
Chewing gum is popular and classless, with Americans chewing 12 million pieces every day. Learn how this ancient habit became a big business. Each stick of gum has fewer than ten calories, but it is considered a food and must meet the standards of the American Food and Drug Administration. Modern gum is mostly synthetic, with added pine resins and softeners to keep the flavor and improve texture. 
In the past, the ancient Greeks chewed a resin from the mastic tree, found mainly in Greece and Turkey. Greek women used mastic gum to clean their teeth and freshen their breath. American colonists learned from the Amero-Indians in New England to chew resin from spruce trees. In the early 1800s, spruce gum was sold in the eastern United States, becoming the first commercial chewing gum there.
Modern chewing gum started in the late 1860s with chicle, a milky substance from the sapodilla tree in Central America. This gum was smoother and more elastic, leading to a new industry. However, attempts to grow sapodilla commercially have failed, so synthetic alternatives were developed as the market grew. Today, the few remaining chicle gatherers, called chicleros, have a tough and dangerous job. They travel long distances in high humidity to collect sapodilla sap. They face dangers like poisonous snakes and insects, including the chicle fly, which lays eggs in their ears and nose. Chicleros climb trees with just a rope and an axe to collect the sap, which is then boiled into bricks at forest camps. Life at these camps is hard, with a basic maize diet and local alcohol.
Despite the harsh conditions, chicleros worry about their jobs. The U.S. used to import 7,000 tonnes of chicle a year from Central America, but last year only 200 tonnes were collected in Mexico's Yucatan peninsula. As gum sales have increased, manufacturers use synthetics to cut costs and meet demand.
Gum producers are also finding new ways to market their products. Gum is said to help you relax, boost energy, and reduce tension. Soldiers in both world wars were given gum. The biggest claim is that gum reduces tooth decay by increasing saliva flow, which neutralizes plaque acid and provides minerals like calcium, phosphate, and fluoride. Research continues on new textures and flavors, with glycerine and vegetable oils used in the gum base. Most new flavors are artificial, but some still need natural ingredients. In the U.S., 137 square kilometers are used to grow mint for the two most popular chewing gums in the world."

The hotel is on Nairobi Hill, away from the busy city center, and is a great place to watch the African sunset with a drink.
**H. ITALY - HOTEL SPLENDIDO, PORTOFINO**  
The Hotel Splendido in Portofino was first visited by the Duke of Windsor. Many famous people have stayed here, like Lauren Bacall and Humphrey Bogart. Today, you might meet wealthy businesspeople. The hotel, once a monastery, is still splendid, with simple but delicious food and beautiful Persian rugs."
CAE_47,C1,"Sue Brown is a hotel inspector. She checks hotels to see if they meet certain standards. Christopher Middleton watched her inspect the Globe Hotel. Right from the start, things were not going well for the hotel. The receptionist was busy on the phone and did not notice Sue, which was a mistake. Sue has seen this happen many times in her 11 years as an inspector. The Globe Hotel is special because it has three red stars, meaning it is one of the top 130 hotels out of 4,000 in the guide Sue works for. 
When Sue arrived, she noticed problems. The entrance from the car park was through an empty door with a buzzer, leading to a long, empty corridor. This was not what she expected. Things got worse when the receptionist said they had no record of Sue's booking, even though most rooms were empty. The room they offered was not good. It was stuffy, and there was a big hole in the wall behind the wardrobe.
Sue is known for being tough but fair. The next morning, after paying her bill, she told the hotel manager, Robin Greaves, who she was. He was worried. Before Sue said anything, he apologized for a bad smell in the lounge, caused by a blocked drain. Sue suggested fixing the plumbing and not taking guests to that lounge. Greaves agreed and took notes. He had only been at the hotel for five months and hoped Sue's feedback would help improve the hotel.
Not everything was bad. Sue praised Emma, the assistant manager, and Trudy, a waitress, for their good work. The dinner was also good enough to keep the hotel's two-rosette food rating. Greaves asked what they needed to do to get three rosettes. Sue suggested not serving a dessert that falls apart. 
Sue's job is to give feedback that others might be too afraid to give. Sometimes people complain about her feedback, but she has to be honest. She also writes a full report for the hotel. Hotels pay to be included in the guide, so they value her feedback. Sue told Greaves that the hotel would keep its red stars, which was good news. However, another inspector would visit in the next two months to check if improvements were made. Greaves said he looked forward to it, though he didn't seem very happy."
CAE_48,C1,"Title: Conquering the Seven Summits
Doug Scott, a mountaineer, shares his experiences of climbing the highest peak on each continent, known as the Seven Summits. He started this journey later in life and describes each climb in the order he completed them.
A. Mt. Everest, Asia (8,848m)
Doug and his partner, Dougal Haston, were in a snow cave near the summit. Dougal started talking to someone who wasn't there, likely due to lack of oxygen. Doug also found himself talking to his feet, worried about frostbite. Despite the challenges, Doug felt confident with Dougal and managed to reach the summit.
B. Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)
In April 1976, Doug and Dougal faced the dangerous Mt. McKinley. They carried all their gear on their backs, a first for a new route on this mountain. The climb was tough, with cold and low air pressure making it feel higher than it was. They finally reached the summit, feeling victorious.
C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,895m)
In September 1976, Doug and Paul Braithwaite planned to climb Mt. Kenya but ended up on Kilimanjaro. They got lost in the jungle and struggled to find water. Eventually, they found a trail and reached the summit using the Umbwe route.
D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)
In January 1992, Doug and his wife, Sharu, joined a group climbing Aconcagua via the Polish Glacier. Due to time constraints, they took the standard route instead. They reached the summit and met climbers aiming to complete the Seven Summits, inspiring Doug to consider the same goal.
E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)
In November 1992, Doug's team traveled to Antarctica. Despite harsh weather, they reached the summit in 8 hours. The experience was uplifting, even though visibility was poor due to a storm.
F. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)
In summer 1994, Doug's team climbed Elbrus. After acclimatizing, they used a cableway to reach 3,900m and then walked to a refuge. They faced strong winds and icy slopes but eventually reached the summit, realizing there was more to climb than expected.
G. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)
Doug's team aimed to establish a new route and connect with the local Dani people. Despite warnings of danger, they climbed the mountain, which is near a large gold mine. On May 12, they reached the summit, marking Doug's completion of the Seven Summits.
Mission accomplished!"
