CPE_15,"Charging families for each bag of rubbish they produce seems like a good idea for the environment and economy, but it might not be. In many developed countries, rubbish collection is a common practice. Rubbish bags or bins are regularly collected by special trucks and taken to a landfill. Economists find this process strange because it is usually free. Households pay for it through local taxes, but a family that produces a lot of rubbish pays the same as a couple that produces little. However, disposing of rubbish is not free. More rubbish means more collectors and trucks are needed, and local authorities have to pay more in landfill fees. This is a basic economic problem: if rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish. The obvious solution is to charge households for the waste they produce, encouraging them to throw out less and recycle more. But, as economists Don Fullerton and Thomas Kinnaman found, this approach can have unexpected and sometimes disappointing results.

Their research looked at several American towns and cities that started charging for rubbish. The most common system is selling stickers or tags for rubbish bags or cans. Only bags with these labels are collected. In a study of Charlottesville, Virginia, where residents were charged 80 cents per bag, the number of bags decreased by 37%. However, this was mainly because people packed more rubbish into each bag, a tactic known as the 'Seattle stomp'. The weight of rubbish collected, which is a better measure of disposal costs, only fell by 14%. In other Virginian cities without such a scheme, it fell by 3.5% anyway. Some people also resorted to illegal dumping to avoid paying, which might account for 30-40% of the reduction in collected rubbish. On a positive note, recycling increased by 15%, but this might not be due to the fee, as many were already recycling voluntarily.

In a broader study, Fullerton and Kinnaman found that pricing does reduce rubbish weight, but not by much. A 10% increase in sticker prices only reduces rubbish by 0.3%. This is lower than other studies, but not surprising. To significantly reduce rubbish, people would need to buy less of almost everything. A small tax on rubbish is unlikely to make a big difference. Other factors, like income and education, might be just as important. In wealthier towns, people throw out more rubbish and have less time to recycle. So, should we abandon the idea of charging for rubbish? Not necessarily. Free disposal is too cheap, but simple policies can have complex effects. Detailed economic models are often needed to understand them, and sometimes the results are not pleasant."
CPE_19,"Theodore Zeldin explores how our work lives might change. Are you respected and appreciated as you should be? Just having a successful career isn't enough anymore. Many professions feel undervalued, and even famous individuals often feel bitter. Loving your job used to be enough to make you part of a lucky few. But now, you need to consider how your job affects you as a person—your mind, character, and relationships. This is important because no matter how skilled you are, if your work makes you boring or unable to talk to people outside your field, or if you're too busy to gain wisdom or use your imagination and humor, then status or money won't make up for your shortcomings as a person.

I am exploring how work can prioritize personal fulfillment instead of just shaping us to fit industrial needs. Work should not only create wealth but also offer a meaningful lifestyle, help us discover hidden talents, and connect us with diverse people. However, this doesn't mean eliminating unemployment is the only goal. As people become more educated, they want jobs that are enriching, interesting, and useful. A career should be like a work of art, with a fulfilled person at its center.

Even middle-class jobs aren't as appealing as they used to be. Doctors are often more stressed than their patients, accountants worry about ethics, architects rarely get to be creative, and administrators are stuck in bureaucracy. Middle managers, once proud of their status, are losing confidence. Meanwhile, companies and public institutions are downsizing. Efforts like decentralized decision-making and performance-based rewards haven't gained employee commitment. In Britain, only 8% of employees strongly feel their values align with their organization's.

I am investigating various jobs to see how they shape or harm people. I've studied how different cultures expand human potential and how courage can be developed. I've looked at happiness, love, friendship, and respect, and now I'm focusing on finding more satisfying ways to work. Many experts focus on extending the life and income of companies, but we also need to evaluate ourselves as people and decide who we want to spend our lives with. How many of us feel truly alive at work? How many are part-time slaves, theoretically free to leave but actually trapped by our qualifications and careers, working not to become better people but because we see no other choice?

Take hotel workers, for example. They make up 10% of the workforce in the hospitality industry. There's a lot of untapped potential. Many smart and lively people endure low prestige, low pay, and long hours because hotels haven't been rethought since the days of the Ritz. A hotel isn't just a place for travelers to sleep; it's like a mini United Nations. People from all over the world meet in hotels but usually pass each other silently. Many hotel staff are foreigners eager to learn a new language and culture, but they have only superficial interactions with guests. Hotels could be cultural centers, connecting guests with the city and each other. Hoteliers could use the knowledge of the students they employ instead of giving them only basic tasks. If they focused on their staff's true ambitions, they would see many other services hotels could offer. But accountants often say companies should focus on one main activity to maximize profits. It's time to rethink this from a human perspective, not just a financial one, and move beyond traditional categories.

For me, work is a relationship. Now that many people want more than just obedience and see work as a way to express independence or personality, they should have the chance to design their own jobs and choose their colleagues and even customers, within practical and profitable limits. This means they need to communicate beyond professional jargon, with minds that might seem different at first. Everyone knows communication is important, but it's different from conversation. Traditional conversation is different from the new kind of conversation people miss today. This is a more personal interaction that creates respect and helps you understand others, possibly changing you in the process. It's more than just relaxing; it's the best way to create equality. Every time you have a conversation like that, the world changes a little bit."
CPE_24,"**Broadcasting: The Social Shaping of a Technology**

The term 'broadcasting' originally referred to the act of spreading seeds widely by hand. This metaphor suggests planned growth and a rich harvest, assuming there are central resources ready to spread and reproduce. The question is why a new technology that could send words and pictures electronically was organized in a way that fit this agricultural metaphor. Television, like the telegraph and telephone, is a two-way communication technology. Yet, from the start, it was seen as a centralized 'mass' medium. This setup matched the socio-economic structures and lifestyles of modern societies. Other organizational forms were tried but remained just experiments.

Two lesser-known alternatives show what television could have been in a different social context. In the early 1930s, British radio amateurs experimented with two-way television as a possible telephone replacement. Popular science magazines provided instructions for building TV transmitters and receivers, and many amateurs were active. However, in 1938, the British Radio Manufacturers Association set standards that pushed these grassroots efforts aside. Thus, the chance for a grassroots, egalitarian form of television communication was lost, at least in Britain.

Broadcasting was linked to strong economic interests and the deep structures of modern societies. Despite TV amateurs' efforts, television in the early 1930s USA was mainly a medium for public theatrical exhibition and seen as a potential competitor to the film industry. Public viewing was common in Britain and Germany, where most early audiences experienced television. While grassroots, two-way television was marginalized, public reception systems operated in several countries in the 1930s. These systems could have threatened the domestic focus of television, but they did not. Manufacturers saw the potential for mass sales of home TV sets once prices dropped. Given the division between public and private life in modernity, centralized broadcasting to homes was the most suitable organization.

As working-class people improved their living standards and joined 'consumer' society from the 1920s, the dream of a home as a center for entertainment and culture became possible for many in Western countries. This trend is now global. There is a link between social modernization and broadcasting structures. Social and economic modernization led to centralization of capital and power, while breaking up traditional communities created new lifestyles. People became more mobile, both socially and geographically, leading to relative isolation compared to stable early communities. Centralized broadcasting helped governments efficiently reach citizens with important information and create a unified national community.

These processes made centralized broadcasting the dominant form for radio and television. However, broadcasting also played a positive role in democracy. Between the World Wars, many countries saw broadcasting as a way to ensure equal access to resources for informed participation in political, social, and cultural life. Television is changing, and the term 'broadcasting' might become outdated. If so, this metaphor will refer to a specific organization of audio-visual technology during a centralized phase of social modernization."
CPE_13,"**Clutter**  
Sometimes, it feels like no matter how many things you own, you never feel secure. It's normal to want a home that meets your needs, but sometimes the desire to get more things can go too far. Modern advertising is designed to make us feel insecure. The message is often that if you don't have a certain product, you're not as good as others. To see how much you're influenced, try not to read any advertising billboards next time you're out. These expensive ads influence us in powerful ways without us even noticing. We're surrounded by them—on TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, T-shirts, the internet, and more—all telling us to buy, buy, buy.

**Caves**  
Research centers and universities worldwide have spent years studying caves, focusing on their origins, water systems, and biology. Caves are a small but intriguing part of nature, sparking our curiosity and desire for knowledge. This has led to a lot of research. In places where caves have impacted our lives, studies have increased. However, exploring many caves requires physical agility, so cave research is often done by both professionals and amateurs who visit caves for sport. This creates a unique overlap between scientific and amateur studies.

**Weather Watch**  
Many observant people, using only their senses, laid the groundwork for meteorology, which has evolved into a highly technical science since the 17th century. Satellites and electronic tools now provide us with constant weather information quickly, and computers solve complex calculations faster than humans can. Meteorological theory is full of complex terms that can be confusing to non-experts. However, simple weather wisdom is still important. Human experience is crucial in turning data into weather forecasts. Observations from people can offer unique insights that help professionals understand the atmosphere better."
CPE_16,"**MUSIC AND THEATRE**

Until recently, I believed opera was mainly about theatre. Now, I see it's primarily about music. This makes sense, but my background is in theatre, where the spoken word and the actor are most important. In theatre, there's no one directing the action once it starts, and the audience usually understands the language spoken on stage.

In music performances, whether in a concert hall or opera house, many people, like me, don't have a deep understanding of music. Some might feel embarrassed by this, while most are amazed by the performers' skills. A brilliant singer or a perfect string section is easy to admire. Even a fairly good musician shows the results of years of hard work. Watching top-level music is like watching an athletics match—we see athletes doing something similar to running for a bus, but much better.

Theatre audiences have different expectations. They often don't understand an actor's skill and aren't particularly impressed by something that seems close to what they could do themselves. They're not usually amazed when an actor delivers a long speech, though they often ask, ""How do you learn all those lines?"" This doesn't mean theatre audiences are more generous or less demanding than music audiences; many are the same people. It suggests that in theatre, audiences and performers meet on more equal terms, no matter how challenging the material or spectacular the event.

Should music learn from theatre about this relationship? I think so. I've seen how a different approach can change the concert-goer's experience. Live music is naturally theatrical, full of emotion and drama, and it connects with the listener's imagination as part of a group. However, music presentation often feels hierarchical, with strict dress codes and great respect for conductors and soloists. On the other hand, modern audiences sometimes interrupt performances by applauding between movements or after a showy piece, which can disrupt the flow of the work.

Can anything be done? Yes, much is being done. Efforts are underway to attract new audiences to concert halls and opera houses and to make 'serious' music more accessible. I recall a remarkable event, Jonathan Dove's community opera ""In Search of Angels,"" which moved from a cathedral to the town. It was a top-level musical experience, with professional musicians playing a central role, and it was life-changing for many in the audience, who also participated.

I wish music had more of the risk and boldness that theatre can show. Sometimes this comes from using unusual or challenging locations, which can surprise both performers and audiences. Comforts might be sacrificed, the acoustics might not be perfect, or it might be cold, but theatre audiences have learned to be adventurous in such spaces. Most plays are staged in a conventional way, similar to concerts, but I believe music conventions can and should change. My only authority is as an enthusiast: I love theatre and spend as much time and money as I can on music. I want both to thrive and for more people to enjoy them as much as I do."
CPE_21,"**Sand**  
While I admire sand's amazing ability to be turned into useful things like glass and concrete, I don't really like it in its natural form. To me, it's mostly an annoying barrier between a seaside car park and the water. It blows in your face, gets into your sandwiches, and hides important things like car keys and coins. When you're wet, it sticks to you like plaster and won't come off, even with a strong hose. But here's the strange part: as soon as you step onto a beach towel, get into a car, or walk on a clean carpet, it falls off you. For days after, you keep finding piles of it on the floor every time you take off your shoes, and more flies around when you remove your socks. Sand stays with you longer than many illnesses. No, you can keep sand, as far as I'm concerned.

**Lock and Key**  
The search for a safe home, for privacy and security, has been around since humans first built permanent homes. The simple beam behind the door has evolved into an electronic lock activated by a plastic card with countless combinations, but the desire to keep out the 'bad guys' remains. The appeal of a lock and key is partly psychological. Recently, some companies have tried computerized locking systems, where smart cards control electronic locks with a digital command. But people don't like them. You might accept them at work, but at home, everyone wants the comfort of turning a physical key in a lock. So, when one locksmith company created a new electronic system, they made sure to include a real metal key in the device.

**Modern Art**  
I was nervous about visiting the new Tate Modern gallery because, like many people, I can't make sense of modern art. I know I like some of it, especially furry things, neon light sculptures, and large photographs. Maybe if I knew more about it, I'd have opinions on more pieces. But you're not supposed to approach it like a school essay. The idea is not to understand art but to let it speak to you. This is a great idea, but it never worked for me. However, this new gallery tries to give visitors a real understanding of the reasons behind the works. The first thing I noticed were the labels, proper labels that put a work in context and actually explained what it was trying to say. Instead of just staring blankly at the pictures as I used to, these bits of information helped me understand."
CPE_46,"**Every Picture Tells a Story**

Adapting novels into films often means cutting down, shortening, and removing parts of the story. This can be frustrating for the writer but also enlightening. While working on a script, I realized how much dialogue and description from a novel could be left out while still conveying the same message. This doesn't mean the original text was unnecessary. It's about the different ways stories are told in books and films, and how each uses repetition. In novels, repetition might include repeatedly mentioning character traits or using speech tags like ""he said."" These help readers understand and remember details. In stage drama, which is mostly dialogue, real speech is imitated with some stylization. Some modern plays use so much redundant language that it seems like the dialogue is just for keeping the conversation going, without clear communication.

**Watching Movies**

Watching movies can transport you into another world, making you feel part of the film's universe. It's an experience that takes you away from reality for the film's duration. Once the movie ends and the lights come on, you're back in the real world. This temporary escape makes it feel like the time spent watching doesn't really matter. In the past, movies were seen as mere entertainment, not art, by some older generations and teachers. They enjoyed being entertained but didn't consider films to be artistic.

**The Film Studios**

The Leiper Film Company studios were a mix of different buildings. The layout was confusing and hard to navigate. There were a few permanent landmarks like the Script Department, but many rooms looked the same and were identified by a strange system of numbers and letters. Finding your way around was challenging without help. The studio lacked a central focus, with three main entrances that were all similar. Only one led to where you wanted to go, and none had a place for inquiries or directions. Strangers rarely visited, as the organization didn't encourage outsiders. Employees, however, knew their way around and worked together to create films that offered audiences a temporary escape from everyday life.

**Film-makers**

Many people dream of making movies. Bookstores are filled with guides on scriptwriting and film production, and universities offer courses. Competitions offer cameras like the one Robert Rodriguez used to make El Mariachi, a film that cost $7,000 and launched his career as a top independent director. Rodriguez's dreams came true quickly. In his book about making El Mariachi, he recalls thinking on his 23rd birthday: ""Orson Welles made Citizen Kane at 25. Spielberg made Jaws at 26. I have only a few years to make my breakthrough film."" In the past, filmmakers took time to develop their skills. They worked behind the scenes in roles like editors or writers and directed low-budget films to learn the craft. John Huston was 35 when he made his first film, The Maltese Falcon. Fred Zinnemann, director of High Noon, found success in his forties. Today, without studio or TV support, aspiring filmmakers often have to be independent and resourceful."
CPE_3,"In those days, council houses covered the western side of the city, with rows of cramped, dull homes made of orange half-brick or pale white stucco. In summer, chemicals from the May and Baker factory, two miles away, would linger around the doors and gardens, giving off a strong sulfur smell. A common sight in that part of Norwich early in the morning was a paperboy wrinkling his nose in disgust as he walked up to someone's front door. Most of my early life is a blur, but I remember sitting, or maybe balancing, near an upstairs window, watching the houses fade into the distance. Later, there are other vague memories—faces I can't name, my mother ironing towels in a house that probably wasn't ours, snow falling over the turrets of a mansion at Earlham.

It's no surprise that my mother appears in these early memories. I remember her as a small, precise, and often angry woman, though I never understood why she was angry or how to make her happy. Even as a child, when I went with her to the small shops in Bunnett Square or on longer trips into the city, I sensed her unusual personality. She was the most solitary person I have ever known, as alone in a crowded room as on an empty moor. She was also obsessed with a kind of propriety uncommon in West Earlham, which sometimes led to intense cleaning sprees or handwashing and instructions to 'behave properly.' This moral code was beyond my understanding, and even now, I'm not sure I fully grasp it. It meant not walking into neighbors' gardens or damaging their rose bushes, sitting quietly in the dining room with hands folded, listening to radio programs my mother liked, and following countless other rules.

Despite her solitude, my mother had a few friends. There was Mrs. Buddery, who was obsessed with the Royal Family, Mrs. Winall, who rarely spoke except to agree with others, and Mrs. Laband, who was livelier and somewhat disapproved of by the others. It was only later that I realized how poor their company was, forming a gloomy group that talked about bad legs, cold weather, and ungrateful children—a category I often felt I belonged to. Looking back, it felt like a heavy burden of West Earlham houses, my mother and her friends, and the need to 'behave properly' weighed on me, and I felt I had to grow up quickly to free myself from it. But this was easier said than done.

Growing up in West Earlham followed a set pattern. Until you were five, you stayed at home, often getting in your parents' way. I remember aimless days when I was about four, playing on a rug while my mother sat coldly in an armchair. Then, the September after your fifth birthday, you went to Avenue Road infants school, half a mile towards the city. The lucky ones had a mother with a rickety bike and a child seat, which were strange contraptions with makeshift safety straps. As far as I remember, my mother left me in the care of other children for this journey.

If I remember anything from those early years, it's the summer holidays, when you caught glimpses of the world outside West Earlham. There was an old man next door to Mrs. Buddery who told stories about his time in the Merchant Navy, and once, a charity fete at a house far away on Christchurch Road, where a kind woman offered lemonade and tried to interest me in something called the League of Pity—a junior charity, I think. But my mother dismissed it, saying the organizers were 'only after your money.' She often talked about mercenary motives, and she had a deep contempt for politicians. If she thought of the House of Commons, it was as a place where wealthy people opened letters filled with money from a gullible public. I might be exaggerating, and I might overlook her good qualities and focus on her flaws, but my mother had little kindness left in her; it had been drained away.

To be fair, my mother did care about my education. Occasionally on Sundays, she would take me, dressed in my 'good clothes,' on the 85 bus to the Norwich Castle Museum. There, we would walk through rooms of paintings by the Norwich School of Artists. My mother wasn't entirely against this activity and eventually developed some opinions on the art. I remember her once stopping in front of a painting of a Roman soldier in full armor and saying, 'Well, I wouldn't like to meet him on a dark night!' This is the only time I recall my mother trying to make a joke."
CPE_10,"**Philadelphia Avenue**

I walked down the odd-numbered side of Philadelphia Avenue. The evening was getting darker, and the air was thick with a light, prickly drizzle. This made my walk feel secretive and sheltered. I knew this side of the street well, from my childhood. Our neighbors were the Matzes and the Pritchards, and there was Han Kieffer's grocery store. My first playmates, all girls, lived in the Kring's and the Pottses' houses. Each house was as familiar to me as the little rain channels in the sidewalk, which I used to navigate on my roller skates or scooter. As the street sloped down, the houses seemed to reflect a slight drop in social status: porches were lower, and front yards smaller. Over the years, changes occurred: wooden porch railings and pillars were replaced with wrought iron, in a style that seemed vaguely Southern or Spanish. In Shillington, some houses I remembered as homes had become stores, and some stores, like Pep Conrad's and Han Kieffer's, had turned back into homes. I wondered how people lived in those spaces that used to be shops, with the lingering smells of merchandise.

**Bachelor Fads**

Rick Gilbert, a furniture designer, lives in a flat that used to be a curtain warehouse. It has typical loft features like exposed brickwork and large doors, which were once used to bring in curtains from trains on the nearby railway. However, Gilbert didn't want an open-plan space, both for practical and aesthetic reasons. In his previous home, his living and working areas were combined, making it hard to separate work from relaxation. So, he divided the space near the entrance with a large sheet of corrugated plastic. This screen hides the office, creates a hallway, and directs attention to the kitchen in the middle of the flat. Gilbert wanted the kitchen to be a neutral area, suitable for both cooking for friends and making coffee for clients. To balance the modern look of the plastic screen and stainless steel kitchen, he used light wood for the floors. His flat is filled with futuristic chairs and sofas, but also with sentimental and homely furniture from his parents or bought at markets.

**Bruce Chatwin**

Bruce Chatwin's life was full of secrets and mysteries, making his nomadic lifestyle a topic of literary debate. Despite this, he was a brilliant and unique writer. His first book, ""In Patagonia,"" published in 1977, is a remarkable work of imagination. It reinvented travel writing, combining the excitement of a thriller, the charm of romantic fiction, and the deep insights of extraordinary literature. Even in this book, Chatwin mixed fact with fiction, altering reality to enhance anecdotes or to capture the essence of his belief that travel could uncover entire histories, lived as if to captivate future explorers.

**Swimming**

During a midsummer rainstorm, I hurried across my lawn and took refuge in the pool. As I swam, each raindrop created a small, bouncing fountain that turned into a bubble and burst. The best moments were when the storm grew stronger, silencing the birds, and a mist rose from the water, as if the pool was reaching up to the sky. It was during this intense rain in the summer of 1996 that I began to dream of a long swim through Britain. I wanted to follow the rain's path to the sea, breaking free from the monotony of swimming laps, like a tiger pacing in a cage. In our world, where everything is labeled and explained, activities like walking, cycling, and swimming allow us to reconnect with what is wild and mysterious. A swimming journey would let me explore parts of the world that, like darkness, misty woods, or high mountains, still hold mystery."
CPE_67,"Text: 'CRYING Charles Darwin believed that crying had no clear evolutionary purpose, but he was likely mistaken. Recent studies suggest that crying has social importance. Psychiatrist John Bowlby noted that crying helps form bonds between a mother and her child. Many think that tears, especially in children, show helplessness. However, why adults continue to cry is less clear. The sound of crying seems less important than the visual signal it sends. In early human groups, crying might have helped build trust and social connections. Tears can also have other reasons. We might cry to show sympathy for those facing injustice. Additionally, we might cry without meaning to, which can be embarrassing, when we hear inspiring music or speeches. We may cry during a sentimental movie, and this is more common when we are with others than when we are alone. The social role of crying seems clear, but research is ongoing.'"
CPE_27,"**The Heat is On**

We've all heard about global warming, but how much warmer will the Earth get, and how will it affect us? Most people know something about global warming, but its exact consequences are uncertain. A warmer climate will likely change weather patterns worldwide. Since the atmosphere is closely connected to everything on our planet, any climate changes will significantly impact plants, animals, water, and soil. Humans rely on these natural resources to produce food, build cities, and support our population of six billion. Any changes to these resources are serious.

The challenge is understanding how the world will change and what causes these changes. Over the last 100 years, human activities have increased the levels of certain gases in the atmosphere, which are linked to global temperatures. These increased levels are likely affecting the global climate, but our limited understanding of the Earth's heat balance makes the future uncertain. We know that greenhouse gas levels have fluctuated with global temperatures over the past 40,000 years, suggesting a strong connection. Evidence shows that the Earth's surface has warmed by about 0.6°C over the past century. Most scientists believe this warming is not natural and is partly due to human pollution.

A lot of research uses computer models called general circulation models (GCMs) to predict future climate conditions. These models use physics and chemistry to analyze temperature, pressure, solar radiation, and other factors. However, they simplify the real world and have limitations. Their predictions are approximate, slow, and costly. We don't fully understand all climate processes, but we recognize their complexity. Despite these challenges, most agree that the rate of climate change will be faster than anything we've experienced before. GCMs help us understand the future world we will live in.

Currently, predictions suggest that by 2100, the average global surface temperature will rise by 1°C to 3.5°C, sea levels will rise by 15-95 cm, and precipitation patterns will change. Extreme weather events like heatwaves, floods, and droughts are expected to become more frequent. These forecasts highlight the potential impact of climate change on the environment and humans. Climate changes can affect the locations of ecosystems, like forests and grasslands, the species they contain, and their ability to provide benefits essential for human survival. Resources like food production, water, and human settlements are sensitive to climate changes. Some effects may be irreversible and unfavorable, but not all. Some impacts might be beneficial. For example, in Australia, warmer temperatures have increased wheat yields by reducing frost damage.

However, many predicted effects of future warming are not beneficial. Small climate changes can affect water availability, either by long-term drying or more frequent droughts. Problems will likely arise first in dry regions and areas with existing water shortages. The Mediterranean Basin is one example, with decreasing rainfall in some areas and changes in seasonal patterns. In southern Portugal, more rain falls in autumn and winter, reducing spring totals.

Another concern is changes to glaciers, affecting ice, vegetation, wildlife, and human structures. The Arctic's ice cover might melt completely, easing marine transport and resource exploration but increasing iceberg risks. The most dramatic effect of global warming could be rising sea levels due to ocean expansion and melting ice. With about half the world's population living in coastal areas, rising sea levels could cause severe consequences. Increased flooding could disrupt cities like London, New York, and Tokyo, displacing millions and creating environmental refugees. Small, low-lying island states could face the most severe consequences, potentially disappearing if worst-case scenarios occur. This would devastate the people and cultures of these islands and challenge countries that need to accommodate displaced populations."
CPE_66,"Text: 'Mission to Mars Wanted: a middle-aged, married couple for a 501-day round trip to Mars. Applicants must be physically and emotionally strong. This will be the profile of the first astronauts to go to Mars if multi-millionaire Dennis Tito's plans to launch a capsule on 5 January 2018 succeed. The capsule will take the crew to about 160 km above Mars. The spacecraft will use Mars's gravity to return to Earth without using more fuel, as saving fuel is important. The 2018 deadline is set because the next time Mars and Earth align for a launch is in 2031. It's a tight schedule, and the race is on to develop systems with completely new technologies. If these can be ready in time, the spacecraft might make the journey. But even if it doesn't launch, the efforts to reach these ambitious goals will still be valuable, as they will lead to important advances for future missions.'"
CPE_44,"AESTHETICS

Ironically, the very existence of art, which is essential for developing aesthetic theory, can sometimes hinder our understanding of it. This is because art is often seen as just physical objects like buildings, books, paintings, or statues, separate from human experience. However, the true essence of art lies in what it does to and within our experiences. This misunderstanding can block our understanding of art.

Moreover, the perfection and long-standing admiration of some art pieces create conventions that prevent new insights. Once an art piece becomes a classic, it often gets disconnected from the human conditions that created it and the effects it has on our lives. When art is separated from its origins and its impact on experience, it becomes difficult to understand its broader significance, which is what aesthetic theory tries to address. Art is often placed in a separate realm, disconnected from other human efforts and achievements.

Therefore, a key task for anyone writing about the philosophy of fine arts is to reconnect art with everyday experiences. Just like mountains are part of the earth, art should be seen as part of human experience. Geographers and geologists explain how mountains are connected to the earth, and similarly, those who study art should show how it connects to everyday life.

To truly understand art, we need to temporarily set aside the art objects themselves and focus on the ordinary experiences that we don't usually consider aesthetic. We must approach the theory of art indirectly. Just as one can enjoy flowers without knowing plant biology, understanding art requires exploring the basic elements of experience that capture our attention and provide enjoyment.

Many people might be surprised to learn that they enjoy everyday activities, like movies, jazz, or comic strips, partly because of their aesthetic qualities. These forms of art are often more vital to the average person than traditional art forms found in museums and galleries. When art is confined to museums, people naturally seek enjoyable experiences in their daily lives. Even those who criticize the museum approach to art often still separate art from ordinary experiences, a misconception shared by many theorists and critics.

The times when art is closely linked to everyday life are when appreciation for it is most widespread and intense."
CPE_22,"**Observing Lions**

People often imagine lions hunting as a perfect team: in the evening light, a group of silent cats suddenly appears and surrounds their prey. Lions seem like the perfect social animals, working together without any arguments to catch their next meal. However, after many years of watching lions in the wild, we have a different view. When we began our research in 1978, we wanted to understand why lions hunt together, raise their young, and scare off rivals with loud roars. If an animal's success is measured by how many of its offspring survive, then working together might not always be beneficial. If an animal is too generous, others might benefit at its expense. So, why do lions cooperate? We thought we could answer this in two to three years. But lions are very good at doing nothing. Like the inert noble gases krypton, argon, and neon, lions are often inactive. It has taken many research methods to learn about their behavior. Since wild lions can live up to 18 years, we are only now starting to find answers.

**Pop Music Review**

The release of Bedrock's third album was a major event for the band. ""New Life"" started a movement that changed rock music in the country for the rest of the decade. The old style of serious, plain music with loud guitars was replaced by a lighter, more melodic sound. The album mixed social commentary and strong emotions with the sounds of fairground organs and brass bands. Humor and irony were prominent, and the singers didn't hide their accents. Bedrock showed they were skilled at collecting and observing different styles, and they were clever songwriters. They explored traditional English themes like sunbathing and Sunday afternoons. But the album's real strength was in its gentle, melancholic songs like ""So Low,"" a beautiful tune about weather, and ""To the Brink,"" a serious ballad. ""New Life"" is remarkable for its high quality - 16 tracks with no filler, which is rare in the era of long CDs.

**Extract from an Autobiography**

As a child, I was fascinated by stories of ""The Sibyl,"" wise women who had great influence in ancient times. I first heard about them in a story my mother told me. An old woman from Cumae offered Tarquin, King of Rome, nine books for 300 gold pieces. He refused, so she burned three and offered the remaining six for the same price. When he refused again, she burned three more. He finally bought the last three for the full price. I realized there was a deep truth in this story - a lesson in salesmanship and life. As a lonely only child, I often asked to play with others and was refused. My mother advised me to do something so interesting that others would want to join me. It worked, and it's a lesson I've never forgotten. When I was asked to write a travel book, I looked for something meaningful to me. I'm not a keen traveler, so I sent my editor a long list of places I didn't want to visit. I'm only interested in ruins because I enjoy traveling through time in my mind.

**What Becomes of Your Manuscript?**

When you submit your manuscript, it will likely end up in a pile waiting to be sorted - the ""slush pile."" This task is usually done by a junior editor or an experienced freelancer who works part-time. They don't have much influence, but they want to find something original. The junior hopes to make a name for themselves and find an author, while the freelancer wants to keep their job. If they think your novel has potential, they'll pass it to a senior editor, and it might be discussed at an acquisition meeting. The editor must justify accepting your novel based on its quality and sales potential. They also consider if you, as an author, seem like a long-term prospect, which you will have assured them of in your letter. Another important factor is how promotable you are, as a new novel needs all the help it can get. Publishers often like to meet a potential author before making an offer."
CPE_39,"Advertising on trial

If you worked in advertising during the early 1990s, you likely faced one of the toughest times in your career. The recession was severe, lasting longer and hitting harder than expected, especially in industrialized countries. In Britain, 1991 saw a drop in GDP, high interest rates, reduced consumer spending, over half a million job losses, and 75,000 homes repossessed. Every business felt the impact, with industries like vehicles and construction seeing a 30% decline. Many people and companies across various countries suffered.

Advertising professionals were not alone in losing jobs, but those who remained employed felt significant pressure. They were expected to boost company profits while working with shrinking budgets. Despite these challenges, the importance of marketing grew. Companies began focusing more on producing what customers wanted rather than what was convenient for them. This shift increased the status of marketing professionals but also added to their responsibilities. Marketing was mistakenly seen as a cure-all solution.

With about half of marketing budgets spent on advertising, the pressure was on ad professionals. The 1980s were a prosperous time for advertising, but the 1990s brought a downturn. This was partly due to the economy, but also because clients began questioning the value of advertising. They wanted clear evidence of what they were getting for their money. Advertising, often viewed skeptically, was under scrutiny more than ever.

Clients demanded better strategies, targeting, creativity, media placement, and thinking from advertising agencies. They wanted the best people working hard to produce outstanding work. This meant advertising professionals had to do more with less, facing the same challenges as their clients.

Several factors made creating effective advertising difficult. The recession led to debates over production costs and a reluctance to take risks, which are often key to good advertising. Other challenges included demographic changes, the growing power of retailers, changing consumer needs, the rise of sponsorship, stricter legal restrictions, and the challenge of advertising abroad.

These issues forced advertisers to reconsider the effectiveness of their work. The pressure to make advertising more effective was intense. However, finding help was difficult. Companies and agencies were too busy managing these challenges to share their strategies, and those who succeeded were reluctant to reveal their secrets. Conferences and seminars offered some insights, but books on advertising often failed to provide practical guidance. They tended to overestimate the quality and value of advertising work, which didn't help those responsible for it."
CPE_18,"**The Lure of the Kitchen**

When I was at university, I decided I wanted to become a chef. This was an unusual choice among my peers. Cooking wasn't considered a desirable job. On the surface, being a chef seems unattractive: the work is long, stressful, and poorly paid. However, these factors didn't deter me. I was unhappy at university. The academic work was tough, and the social environment felt closed-off and pretentious. Becoming a chef seemed like the perfect escape from this intellectual and social pretension. It offered a sense of seriousness and integrity that I found lacking in my college life. But my interest in cooking wasn't just a reaction to being a student. It also represented an aesthetic ideal for me. I first experienced this ideal when I dined at a famous London restaurant. The meal was a revelation. I still vividly remember the starter. After finishing, I felt like bowing down in gratitude to the chef. I felt uplifted for days. This experience sparked a strong desire in me to learn the secrets of this amazing art. I turned my student life into a preparation for entering the culinary world. My history degree felt like a distraction from my true passion. I educated myself by reading cookbooks, exploring markets and delicatessens, and cooking elaborate meals.

**The Swimming Instructor**

The school's swimming instructor was a former drill sergeant, small and muscular, with tattooed arms. When I asked him to teach me how to dive, he told me to sit on the pool's edge, put my hands above my head, and roll forward, pushing off with my feet. I practiced this move until the lesson ended. The next time, he had me stand upright and dive off the edge. The instructor was strict, and every time I surfaced, he criticized me: ""Don't look down, look up!"" ""Keep your legs straight."" ""Point your toes!"" The following week, I went up to the high diving board. It was fixed, and its front edge bent slightly downward. It seemed incredibly high as I stood there, trying to gather my courage. Gradually, the echoing voices faded, and I felt enveloped in silence. I waved my arms as I had been taught, tried to look up, not down, and launched myself into the air. For a brief moment, I felt like I was flying. When I hit the water, I collapsed awkwardly, my legs flailing. The instructor looked at me with disdain and shook his head. But even he couldn't dampen my excitement. ""That's what they mean by 'free as a bird',"" I thought.

**The Traveller**

For those of us who value a comfortable bed, running water, and the likelihood of living to see tomorrow, the idea of the traveller is both puzzling and fascinating. These are people who are drawn to the dangerous allure of the unknown, who choose to risk their lives by climbing icy, avalanche-prone mountains; who sail alone in fragile boats through towering seas; who will eat maggots and river insects if nothing better is available, and who can live for months in the shadow and promise of the unknown. It's easy to dismiss such people as oddities, as indeed they are, belonging to the ranks of the truly eccentric: hermits, freefall divers, or even writers. Their existence is undeniable, but the strange, uncomfortable world they inhabit is far removed from our everyday experience and can be dismissed, we tell ourselves, as irrelevant. We can shrug and return to our world of microwave ovens and answering machines, grateful that the only risks to our health are predictable ones, like dashing across a busy street.

**Sailing**

Jonathan Raban is afraid of the sea, saying it is not his natural environment, which is probably why he spends so much time on it. He doesn't claim to be a world-class sailor, though he is clearly competent. His main reason for sailing is that, as a writer, he enjoys writing about his sailing experiences. Sailing provides plenty of challenges and achievements for him to write about. Raban's small boat is equipped with an electronic device that gives sailors their exact position anywhere on Earth. While he appreciates this tool, Raban has a somewhat primitive view of other navigational aids. He believes the invention of the compass was a disaster, causing a ""fundamental rift in the relationship between man and sea."" Raban argues that since the compass came into use about a thousand years ago, it has become the main focus for sailors, meaning they no longer need to study the waves and feel the sea. The ocean, once full of activity, is now just a space to cross. Since the helmsman's job is simply to maintain a course, he can be replaced for long periods by an autopilot. This might be why Raban had time to observe the waves so closely."
CPE_62,"**Holiday Reading**

Summer offers us two of life's great pleasures: leaving home and reading books. These joys are closely linked. Books help us feel more connected to the world. We can relate our experiences to those in books, whether they were written long ago or in faraway places, because there are fewer types of people than there are individuals. In books, we find our own thoughts, embarrassments, and dramas. Authors can describe situations we thought were unique to us or express our thoughts with clarity and accuracy that we might struggle to achieve. What is unclear and confused within us is clearly and confidently expressed in their words, which is even more impressive if the work was written by someone from a distant place or time. We feel thankful to these authors for helping us understand ourselves. Through reading and travel, we break free from the dullness of routine. Our senses are most alert during our first days in a new place, similar to when we read a great book that highlights things we previously overlooked. Our mind becomes more aware, noticing the colors of the sky, the changes in a face, the insincerity of a friend, or a hidden sadness about a situation we didn't realize we could feel sad about.

**Author's Note**

These travel reflections were originally published as articles in the Observer newspaper over seven years. I have restored some small cuts made by the editor to fit the page, but otherwise, I have added very little. I corrected a few obvious mistakes, but only if they were details I should have gotten right initially. While hindsight could have led to more improvements, the process would never end. For example, in the second article about China, it seemed likely at the time that the Hong Kong dollar would remain stable, but it fell a year later. If I rewrote the piece to predict this, it would seem like I had foreseen it, which wasn't the case. Like any traveler, I was there at that moment, unaware of what would happen next, and focused on understanding what had already occurred. This is the real story of mass air travel: the world opening up to people who only need the price of a ticket to explore it. But I believe that not all travelers are unaware. Even a postcard can have a purpose.

**Ecotourism**

If there were awards for tourism phrases that have been overused and misused, ""ecotourism"" would win first prize. The term appeared in the early 1980s, reflecting a rise in environmental awareness and a realization by tour operators that many travelers wanted to believe their trips wouldn't harm the environment. It quickly became a popular marketing term for holidays. Today, the ecotourism label includes anything from a two-week stay with remote tribes to a one-hour motorboat trip through an Australian gorge. Any tour involving cultural interaction, natural beauty, wildlife, or a bit of adventure is likely to be labeled as ecotourism. The original intentions behind the movement were noble, aiming to help those who cared make informed choices. However, the lack of regulations and a clear industry definition left many travelers confused in an ecotourism maze.

**Transylvanian Journey**

The notebook from my journey in Transylvania was lost for 50 years and only found a few years ago by chance. It has helped me reconstruct that time and write it down, but it wasn't as reliable as it should have been. In Transylvania, I had an easier time than expected, moving from one welcoming country house to another, often staying for weeks. When I stopped moving, I stopped writing, thinking there was nothing to record in a travel journal. I was slow to start writing again when I moved on, and sometimes only made brief notes instead of a detailed narrative. Worried that some details might be out of order when I started writing this book, I added many disclaimers. But then I realized that these pages weren't a guidebook, so I let the story unfold naturally without unnecessary warnings."
CPE_49,"**Fashion**

Fashion is often thought of as a modern concept, linked to the capitalism of the 19th and 20th centuries. However, historians emphasize that fashion, in terms of style and design, has a long history. They often start with the rise of markets and trade in the 16th and 17th centuries. As societies have become more complex, populations have grown, and new technologies for making different types of clothing and accessories have been developed, the meanings of clothing have also become more complex. Today, it is hard to say exactly what any piece of clothing or accessory means. For instance, a man's suit, which seems to be a symbol of uniformity, can have very different meanings in different situations and to different people.

**Writer**

Reports of publishers fighting over promising manuscripts have given a distorted view of a novelist's life. For those not topping best-seller lists, there are two ways to make a living. The smartest among us write in the evenings and have full-time jobs that remain secure even if the book isn't immediately successful. Others, like me, are literary odd-jobbers, getting by with some teaching, occasional workshops, and articles like this one. I've heard of writing jobs at a chocolate factory, but I've never landed anything like that. Somehow, by juggling part-time jobs, credit cards, and often with the help of those mentioned in Acknowledgements, the novel gets written.

**Sudden Fame**

The small venues we performed at were starting to sell out, and extra security was needed to manage the growing number of screaming fans. We had to use secret entrances to avoid being mobbed. On nights off, it was hard to leave the house without being chased by fans. In just a few days, we became celebrities. Our fans watched our every move, and our management and others took care of all our needs. Although my usual shyness never completely disappeared, it was replaced by a strange over-confidence that only naturally shy people in similar situations can understand. In short, I was emotionally overwhelmed."
CPE_31,"**Music - The Challenge Ahead**

Technological advances are changing how we live, work, and enjoy our free time. Susan Hallam explores how these changes affect music in Britain. In the late 20th century, we gained many new ways to listen to music, like radio, TV, records, tapes, CDs, videos, and other multimedia. However, live music performances and full-time jobs for musicians have decreased. It's clear that access to music will keep growing because it meets many human needs. Music is essential for national events and personal activities, both formal and informal. A society without music is unimaginable. The question isn't whether music will exist in the 21st century, but what it will be like and if people will still want to learn instruments.

I believe people will continue to learn instruments. The music industry is a major source of income in Britain, and musical skills will remain important for many jobs, especially in media. Besides job opportunities, playing an instrument can help develop skills early on. Research in the USA shows that listening to or making music can improve spatial reasoning, a part of intelligence. Although these findings need more support, European studies suggest that group music lessons can improve social relationships and concentration in children, including those with behavioral issues. Further research is looking into whether playing an instrument can help develop skills that can be used in other areas, like good study habits and punctuality.

In the short term, there will likely be a demand for music lessons. But what about the long term? I see two possibilities. First, people will listen to more diverse music, with new genres mixing different styles. Second, technology will play a bigger role in composing and performing music, making it easier for more people to create music without needing technical skills. This might reduce the need for live performances and musicians focused only on performing. At the same time, more people of all ages will want to make music, often in community settings that reflect local traditions.

To prepare for this future, the music profession needs to adapt. Instrumental teaching must change to help more people learn various instruments throughout their lives. This will affect the music curriculum and how progress is measured, requiring updates to stay relevant for a wider audience. Musicians will need training to inspire and teach learners of all ages, work with diverse groups, and develop communication, social, entrepreneurial, and management skills for community work. This is a big shift from traditional methods and will require accountability. Positively, it offers a chance to show the high quality of music education available.

Finally, we must raise the profile of music. Music is vital in our lives but often overlooked. Everyone in the music profession should work together to change this."
CPE_58,"**The Actor's Craft**

Actors often face criticism and mockery. This is partly because they sometimes talk about their work in ways that seem pretentious or self-centered during interviews. They could learn from the dancer Pavlova, who, when asked to explain her dance, simply said, ""If I could tell you, I wouldn't dance it."" Instead, actors often fall into using clichés or get caught up in gossip. Paul Scofield, a respected actor, once wrote to a friend that an actor's work is only alive and interesting when performed. Discussing it makes it seem empty and theoretical. Acting has no strict rules, except perhaps being audible. With each new play, actors start fresh, learning and growing with the characters and the writer's insights. Once a play ends, they feel empty until the next project. This emptiness is evident when discussing theatre work.

**A Review of Hamlet**

Adrian Lester's portrayal of Hamlet is a delicate balance between youth and maturity, marked by simplicity and confidence. His mastery of the text and his control over his body and mind elevate him to a top-tier actor. Lester plays a tense, irritable young man with a deep-seated anger, using sharp wit and humor to make him both intimidating and endearing. His performance is subtly brilliant. Watch how his arms hang stiffly, suggesting a figure ready to come to life. Handy's portrayal of Horatio gives a similar impression of being moved by an inner force. This raises questions about acting and behavior: Is acting an imitation or an evocation of real behavior? What drives these performances, both morally and physically? This is a key question in theatre.

**One Director's Approach to Rehearsal**

This director's rehearsal process begins with ""dropping in."" The stage manager projects the script onto a screen. Actors sit quietly, absorbing the words. When it's their turn, they look at the screen, understand the phrase, think about its meaning, wait for the impulse to speak, and then deliver the line. For example, with the line ""Queuing all night, the rain, do you remember?"" they breathe, let the thought sink in, and visualize a scene, like waiting in line for a concert. They find the impulse to speak, which the director calls ""The pathway to the line."" Impulses can come from external or internal sources. Actors should look into each other's eyes and consider their character's situation. The director encourages actors to approach this with an open mind, trusting that something will happen.

**The Perfect Theatre**

The perfect theatre should make you feel that your presence matters. Attending a live performance is an event, and the staff should recognize this. It's disheartening if the staff treats it as just another job. The theatre should create a connection between the performer and the audience. No audience member should feel they have a poor view of the actor. It's important that they are close enough to hear, see, and feel connected to the stage. The auditorium's design is crucial; it should complement the human voice and body. If it overwhelms the human form, it's flawed. Many late 19th-century theatres got this right by designing spaces that embrace the stage. I prefer theatres with a sense of history, like worn stone steps in a church, which suggest layers of human presence. Regarding plays, you can't cater to everyone. You can't predict what the audience will want. When you go to the theatre, you want to see something unexpected, something you couldn't imagine, or else you might as well stay home."
CPE_37,"**Paul Simon**

In the 1950s, rock and roll was mainly a trend among young people, but its true significance was the huge impact it had on middle-class and older people. It also set the stage for the next wave of rock stars, who listened to it with amazement, knowing that this new, exciting music would be a big part of their lives. For Paul Simon and other young people in the US, the main way to hear this fresh and energizing music was through Alan Freed's radio show, Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party. Freed's show was essential listening for many future rock stars. Like young John Lennon, who was in Liverpool, 3,000 miles away, listening to Radio Luxembourg—the only place in Europe to hear rock and roll—Paul Simon was captivated by the music from Freed's show. He was getting ready to move from just listening to music to creating his own.

**Snow**

There was no clear path, but I thought I would be safe if I walked carefully. The wind was strong, pushing me down as I slipped on the icy surface. Suddenly, the snow, which seemed harmless, collapsed under me. I fell, surprised, into a hole about four feet deep. The snow had formed a cover over a gap between two rocks, melting away to leave only a thin layer that I broke through. I pulled myself out, feeling shaken and worried, thinking about what I would have done if the hole had been thirty feet deep. I leaned against the top of a pine tree sticking out of the snow to assess my situation. In an hour, I had only covered about half a mile. It was clear that I needed to change my plan.

**Qualitative Research**

There are many books now that try to guide researchers on qualitative research. While a lot has been written about collecting data, these books often don't explain much about how to analyze the data. There is a lot of mystery around how researchers do this analysis. So, we asked various social scientists who have done qualitative research to talk about the methods they used. The goal was to share insights and understanding of the process of analyzing qualitative data, not to create a guidebook for new researchers. This involves making hidden procedures more clear. While this might seem easy, we found it quite challenging. We allowed our contributors to present their work in different styles, including personal stories and more formal approaches."
CPE_2,"**Screen Learning**  
Recently, I saw my six-year-old eating noodles in a strange way. He was pulling them up with his teeth and trying to look fierce, saying, ""I'm a little dinosaur."" He was copying a scene from a TV show, so I asked him what he remembered about dinosaurs. He didn't remember much. There's a trend to use the internet and computers for learning, but is learning from screens effective? One writer shared his experience with an interactive program he tried with his son. The father read the words carefully, while the son played with the pictures. The father thought that if his son had spent ten minutes with a book, he might have learned more. Television, as shown by my son and his noodles, is a medium that gives impressions and suggestions. Research shows that learning happens best in environments where there is dialogue with teachers or parents. It needs guidance. While new technology can be useful for teaching, formal education still plays a crucial role.

**Hollywood**  
By 1918, most of the world's film-making had moved to Hollywood. Locals didn't like it, seeing their Los Angeles suburb changed by these newcomers. But eventually, they accepted it because of the success it brought. In Hollywood, success is measured by box-office earnings. Hollywood recognizes a good film as one that might make a star but will definitely make money. In less than a century, Hollywood transformed from a small village to a town as famous as New York, Rome, or Paris. Physically, it has changed a lot; a century ago, you could walk through orange groves to the village store. Yet, in some ways, it remains like a village, with limited horizons, just a part of Los Angeles. For those living and working there, the main topic is films: how much they earn, who is dating whom, who has been betrayed, and who is involved in which project. Successful people often try to leave: they work there but live elsewhere. Still, it is the place where almost everyone in show business eventually goes.

**Photography**  
Photography was created by 19th-century artists as a new art form. These artists wanted a lasting and accurate record of their surroundings, and they found it. The combination of light, lens, shutter, and a chemical-coated surface created images more lasting and detailed than paintings. This caused concern among other artists, and after initial excitement, art critics argued that photography wasn't true art. They believed that because photography relied on mechanical means, it couldn't be considered a product of human creativity. Despite this, photographers knew they had discovered a new form of art and expression. They used photography like other artists used brushes and pencils, to interpret the world and present a vision of nature and its elements.

**Book Illustration**  
In the era of black-and-white book illustration, it was common for every children's book to have illustrations. This included novels for older readers, although these saw fewer illustrations as print runs decreased. Children's publishing was active but often operated on low budgets, leading to some routine and mediocre work. However, the best artists always delivered high-quality work. The black-and-white archive is a mix of ordinary and exceptional work, a great resource for research or browsing. The true treasures are likely to be rediscovered, either through reissues of individual titles, new publications about the artists, or exhibitions of original books and drawings. There are signs that interest in this period is returning, and the process of stylistic revival is underway. An innovative publisher might see the potential for a series of classic children's book illustrations from this period, either as facsimile reprints or newly designed editions using the original artwork."
CPE_68,"Text: 'Blogging: Sharing with the World

A while back, a website warned about the dangers of public check-ins—telling everyone online where you are. The message was clear: you might think you're just saying, ""Hey, I'm here,"" but you're also letting everyone know you're not at home, which might not be safe. This highlighted the potential downsides of sharing too much online. The internet offers huge opportunities to share every part of our lives with a global audience, promising things like wealth and fame. So, we dive into the online world, sharing confessions, photos, and stories. But soon, we realize it's a crowded and risky place, and we might get lost. 

Feeling down? Don't be. There's a guide to this future, created by early internet users. In the early days of the web, they explored these challenges. They lost jobs, made and lost friends, and dealt with the ups and downs of fame—long before social media existed. These early bloggers have already experienced what many of us are now facing. Before we forget their stories, it's worth learning from them. As the saying goes, those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.

In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started posting online. Back then, the web was mostly used by students, scientists, and a few curious teens like him. The web was created at CERN in Switzerland to help researchers share their work. But Hall saw it as a way to share his life. He built a detailed online autobiography with words, photos, and art. In January 1996, he started a daily blog, and people were drawn to his bold use of this new medium. Hall's rule was simple: if you crossed his path, you might end up on his site; nothing was off-limits. While it was certainly exhibitionist, his work had a discipline and beauty that could be considered art.

One day, visitors to Hall's site found it replaced with a video titled Dark Night. He shared that he had fallen deeply in love, but when he wrote about it online, he was given an ultimatum: ""either the blog goes, or I do."" He realized that sharing his life online made people not trust him. He chose to stop blogging, but the issue remains. Sharing online is great, but if you expect it to make people like you, you'll be let down.

In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a web worker in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job at a software company. One day, a colleague anonymously sent her blog to all the vice presidents, including those she had mocked, and she lost her job. Experts call this the 'online distribution effect': the feeling that we can say things online that we wouldn't say in person. But our online and real lives are connected. Ignoring this can lead to serious mistakes.

Armstrong's story ended well. Though she was upset and stopped blogging for a while, she got married and restarted her blog, focusing on her family. Now, she's a successful 'mommy blogger,' and her writing supports her family. Once an example of online mistakes, she has become skilled at sharing her life carefully. Armstrong learned an important lesson: just because the web lets us say anything, doesn't mean we should.'"
CPE_23,"Text: 'Enough Sleep? Many people today feel tired all the time. In busy, wealthy countries, sleeplessness and anxiety are common. In the USA, research shows that 40 million people suffer from chronic sleep problems. In Britain, some popular novels feature characters who can't sleep or are set in sleep research labs. People are interested in sleep: its patterns, benefits, and issues. A key concern is that people need more sleep. A leading sleep researcher says, 'People cut back on sleep when they're busy. They wake up early to avoid traffic.' A sleep researcher conducted an experiment where participants could sleep up to 14 hours a night for a month. It took them three weeks to settle at an average of eight-and-a-quarter hours, showing they needed more sleep than they were getting. In Europe, a university sleep research lab in the English Midlands tests these ideas. They study the effects of tiredness on sailors, airport noise on sleep, and the risks of driving when tired. They recruit participants through student newspapers, pay them £5 an hour, and ask them to change their sleep patterns. Dr. Louise Reyner reassures participants who worry about electrodes on their heads, explaining that the lab focuses on physical aspects of sleep. In a dark room, a motorway simulator tests drivers. Participants arrive at 2 pm, during the body's natural afternoon slump, after little or no sleep. They drive while answering questions. The simulator shows a long road, bright sunlight, and warm air. Many deny they'll fall asleep, but Dr. Reyner has a video of one trying not to. At first, the driver sits upright, eyes wet and tired. Then he blinks more often, his head droops, and eventually, he experiences 10-second blackouts. Each time, he wakes up suddenly, but the car has already veered off the road. Coffee might help. Dr. Reyner says two cups can make you a safe driver for over half an hour, even without sleep. She suggests using alertness products like tablets, energy drinks, and caffeinated gum, especially for shift workers. But what do we really know about sleep? Humans, like other mammals, sleep in daily cycles. During sleep, they move through four stages, from light to deep sleep. Dreams usually happen in the lightest stage, and the brain prevents movement to avoid injury. Beyond this, there are theories. Some suggest sleep repairs the body, restores muscles, or rests the brain's creative areas. But these might also happen during relaxed wakefulness, so it's unclear. Scientists agree that women sleep about half an hour longer than men and that older people need less sleep, though the reasons are unknown. When asked about sleep's purpose, some researchers say, 'Sleep is a way to pass time safely.' Sleep patterns may have been different in the past. A history professor found that between 1500 and 1850 in Britain, people had different sleep routines. They went to bed at nine or ten, woke up after midnight for an hour, and then had a 'morning sleep.' This break was a time for reflection, remembering dreams, or even stealing. The poorest benefited most from this quiet time, free from daily struggles. By the 17th century, with more artificial light, the rich began to sleep in one block, which was more efficient. The industrial revolution extended work hours for most people, except some in rural areas. Outside Europe and America, the old sleep pattern was common until recently. In some non-western cultures, there are no strict bedtimes. People sleep for a few hours, then get up. Continuous sleep isn't the norm. In some tribal societies, noise and the need to watch for danger make uninterrupted sleep impossible. It seems people everywhere need more sleep.'"
CPE_60,"I was wearing expensive cowboy boots, each costing $800, standing on the rocks in the Arizona desert. I had the full cowboy outfit, but I didn't feel like a cowboy. As I looked at the Arizona mountains in the morning sun, I realized I wasn't meant for this life. I had flown in from Denver, thinking I might look like a cowboy, but that feeling vanished when I saw a real cowboy at the Phoenix airport. He wore a sweaty T-shirt, needed a shave, and carried a dirty bag. He glanced at my new boots, raised an eyebrow, and walked away.

I wished there was an outfit for an ex-racing driver that made me feel like I belonged. I loved being a racing driver, but I can't do it anymore. Now, I wonder what to do next. I thought I had backup plans, but they disappeared. I considered being a commentator at races, but there are already many former drivers doing that. I also tried selling classic cars, but it didn't work out.

Being an ""ex"" anything is tough. People don't want to hear about how I almost became World Champion. Even if I had won, the story would only interest people for a short time. I don't want sympathy; I had a good career and saved money. But I miss the thrill of racing, the speed, and the danger. I miss the attention and the people who cared about what I said. Now, my phone rarely rings, and I have too much free time.

Looking at the sky, I noticed there were no buzzards, just some small birds in a cactus nearby. They seemed to be telling me to leave. I realized I had a lot to learn, even in the desert."
CPE_1,"**Vancouver**  
In the past decade, hundreds of thousands of people from around the world have moved to Vancouver, located in western Canada. In the evenings, residents often take leisurely walks through the city streets. If you join them, you'll likely hear a different language with almost every step. People are drawn to Vancouver for its mild weather, beautiful location between the ocean and mountains, clean and safe environment, and opportunities for education and work. Although some locals complain about the rapid construction of new buildings, it's clear that the influx of new residents and a booming tourism industry have contributed to the city's revival. Vancouver was once called 'Terminal City' because it served as a gateway to other places. While the name is less popular now, Vancouver is more of a gateway than ever before.

**Putting Pen to Paper**  
Journalists, like myself, are often not great at writing personal letters. Some say it's because we dislike writing without getting paid, but I don't think we're that money-driven. It's more likely that, since we're always trying to make a strong impact in our work, we lose the natural flow needed for letter writing. True creative artists, who don't focus on the impact of their words (even if they rewrite a passage many times), don't have this issue. I believe that understanding the effect of one's words is the true mark of a real artist. When Shakespeare wrote his famous lines, he probably didn't consciously think about how the mix of long words made them powerful, yet it showed his greatness as a writer.

**Supermarket Opening**  
In the past, the opening of a new supermarket in Britain was a notable event. You could expect a soap opera star, a radio DJ, or a minor royal to cut the ribbon. Nowadays, new supermarkets seem to open every day, making celebrities unnecessary. Why pay a famous person when anyone can do it for free? Last week, waiting pensioners didn't care who opened the new Superbuy store, as long as they were first in line. According to one customer who knew an employee, the first five men would receive a bottle of aftershave, and the first five women, a bunch of flowers. This information quickly spread through the crowd, making those at the front feel pleased and those who arrived later feel envious."
CPE_53,"**Citizen Kane**

When the film *Citizen Kane* was finally released in 1941, it faced a lot of controversy. The release was delayed because distributors were worried about the reaction of William Randolph Hearst, who was thought to be the inspiration for the main character. Despite receiving mostly rave reviews, the film was not a commercial hit at first. It was television that later brought it back into the spotlight. *Citizen Kane* is perhaps the most influential film, inspiring many to become filmmakers. This is especially impressive because it was Orson Welles's first film. Welles believed its success came from not knowing what he could or couldn't do, so he just did what he wanted. He had an exceptional team, including cameraman Gregg Toland, screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, and special-effects expert Linwood Dunn. When Welles and Mankiewicz decided to create a story about a newspaper tycoon similar to Hearst, Welles saw it as a perfect opportunity for himself as both director and actor, and he took it with great enthusiasm.

**Dermot and Carmel**

Dermot noticed that Carmel seemed a bit unusual that morning. He mentioned twice that he might be late and not to worry if he stopped by the golf club on his way home. He needed to chat with someone, and it was the best place for it. Carmel nodded in agreement but seemed distracted, as if she hadn't really heard him. ""Will you be okay? What are you planning to do today?"" he asked. She smiled and said, ""It's funny you ask. I was just thinking I have nothing to do today, so I might walk downtown and look at the shops. It feels almost sinful to just spend the day doing nothing."" Dermot smiled back, ""You deserve to enjoy yourself. And as I said, if I'm late, I won't need anything to eat. So don't go to any trouble."" ""No, that's fine,"" she replied.

**Title Race**

Human nature can be quite amusing. A recent study showed that job titles are a major source of envy and tension at work. A survey by a top recruitment firm found that 90% of employers and 70% of employees agree that titles create divisions among colleagues. Surprisingly, the survey revealed that 70% of office workers would prefer a more 'motivational' or 'professional' job title over a pay raise. If our desire for impressive titles is so strong that it surpasses even our basic greed, we are in a difficult situation. In today's world, no one wants to be seen as inferior. The job titles being discussed focus on skills (like specialist or coordinator) but are often just fancy terms."
CPE_55,"I was in Vienna to take photographs. That was usually why I traveled anywhere. Photography was more than just my job; it was a big part of my life. I was always fascinated by how light fell on surfaces and how a single photo could capture the essence of a moment, a place, or a person. I always hoped to take the perfect photograph, and as long as I had film in my camera, there was a chance I might. My routine was simple: finish one roll, load another, and keep looking for that perfect shot. This had been my approach for a long time.

I once got lucky with a photo of a smoke plume from a burning oil well, which became very popular in newspapers and magazines worldwide. It was a brief moment of fame, but it was mostly luck. After that, I decided to work freelance, which seemed like a smart move. However, life outside photography didn't go as planned, and the mid-nineties weren't as successful as I had hoped, even though my photo had made it to the cover of Time magazine. That's why I was in Vienna, not somewhere more newsworthy. But I was still taking photos and getting paid for it, which wasn't bad.

The Vienna assignment came by chance. I had taken photos in London for a picture book called ""Four Cities in Four Seasons,"" which included London, Paris, Rome, and Vienna. The publishers liked my work, and when the Austrian photographer, Rudi Schussner, left the Vienna job, they offered it to me. I was available, unlike the French and Italian photographers, and I was happy to go because things at home weren't great.

They put me up at the Europa Hotel in the heart of Vienna. I had been to Vienna before with my wife during a busy summer, but this time, in cold January, it felt different. I knew I would enjoy it and take great photos. On the first day, I didn't take any pictures. Instead, I rode the trams around the city, getting a feel for the place. The weather was cold and set, much like the grand old buildings of the city. I hadn't seen Schussner's work from other seasons because I wanted this to be my Vienna.

Photography is about capturing the right moment, so I waited and observed until I was ready. The next morning, I went out at dawn. Fresh snow had covered Stephansplatz, making it look untouched and almost empty. I struggled to capture the cathedral in one shot because its spire was tall and elegant, while the base was large and imposing. I realized I might have to settle for capturing just a part of it, but even that could be magical in the right conditions.

Photography has always had a magical quality, even for the pioneers of the 19th century before they fully understood the process. Watching a blank sheet of paper turn into a photograph in a darkroom is a mysterious experience, and even when you know how it works, the magic remains. That's why what happened at Stephansplatz that morning didn't completely surprise me."
CPE_50,"**Kinetic Art Rejoice**  
Something remarkable has happened: London's serious Hayward Gallery has become a place of wonder. This change wasn't due to a big-budget, heavily promoted multimedia show, but rather a unique exploration of a nearly forgotten art form from the past 60 years. The new exhibition explores the history of kinetic art, which is art focused on movement, in the 20th century. It shows that creating art that moves or explores movement has been a consistent, though often overlooked, theme in fascinating creative work of this century. Curator Guy Brett, who has dedicated his life to studying kinetic art, has gathered a wonderful collection of paintings, drawings, documents, and films. These are presented with minimal text, allowing visitors to enjoy making their own connections and discoveries.

**David Hockney**  
David Hockney's art appeals to many people who might not usually be interested in art. This could be because his work is figurative and easy to understand, or because it offers an escape from everyday life. Some might be drawn to Hockney's charming personality and witty comments, which make him popular in the media. Some critics think Hockney is overrated, but this might be because being popular is not always seen as a good thing today. Hockney himself knows his limits and doesn't claim to be a great artist. He believes that only time will tell how his work is judged.

**Window-shopping - an art exhibition**  
In recent years, I've seen many contemporary art exhibitions, some brilliant and some mediocre. What bothers me are shows that push a hidden agenda, suggesting a common attitude among artists. Sometimes this works, revealing new trends, but often it feels forced. As a curator, I wanted to create a show that was the opposite of this. With seven artists, I took over a space in an empty warehouse. ""Window-shopping"" was a collection of individual artworks connected only by their claim to be art. For example, Sam Cole's knitted cats chased each other on a toy train track, while Matthew Crawley's video camera experiment flickered on a monitor. These works didn't fit into a themed exhibition, but they complemented each other through their contrasts. I didn't make any grand statements about contemporary art, but perhaps there aren't any to make about an activity where artists set their own rules.

**Art History**  
People who enjoy paintings sometimes hesitate to analyze them, fearing it might spoil their experience. Some say art historians, who focus on theory, ignore the pleasure of looking and the creativity of art. This is like thinking that knowing a recipe's ingredients and cooking method takes away from enjoying the dish. Understanding something doesn't stop us from enjoying it; it might even enhance our pleasure. Enjoyment is complex, and how we perceive it can be questioned. Our preferences are influenced by societal values, not just our genes or personalities. While it's important to appreciate the sensory and instinctive responses to art, the idea that intellect undermines these responses is outdated."
CPE_25,"**Metals**  
Stone Age people might have first been interested in metals because they wanted to decorate themselves. Imagine sitting by a river, waiting to catch a fish, when one of our early ancestors found a shiny yellow pebble. It wasn't like a regular stone; it was attractive. This is how gold might have become part of their lives. Gold is easy to shape, so it quickly became a valuable material. Copper might have been discovered by accident too. Once people realized how useful copper tools were, they eagerly searched for copper ores and learned how to extract the metal. This marked the beginning of metalworking, an important skill for our ancestors.

**St Ives**  
We walked down the winding, cobbled lane into the town, carrying our bags and struggling against the strong wind. The icy waves crashed over the promenade, and the streets were empty. Every cottage by the waterfront had its shutters tightly closed against the storm. We had seen the weather getting worse as we arrived in St Ives on the small railway. The dark grey skies made us question our decision to visit Cornwall in the off-season without a car. I had convinced my friend to come with promises of beautiful coastal walks and cozy evenings by the fire.

**Computer Modelling**  
Studying the past is challenging because it is gone. The people who lived through peaceful times and hardships are no longer here. The reasons they settled in certain places or formed communities have been forgotten. Archaeology gives us some clues, but we can't test our ideas with experiments on past cultures. We can't watch the past like a movie. However, computer modelling offers a solution. We can recreate ancient landscapes and fill them with virtual communities. These digital people have some needs and abilities like real humans. We can set rules for their behavior and simulate changes, like less rain or more people, to see how these virtual societies react."
CPE_34,"**Vervet Monkeys**  
Cheney and Seyfarth observed a group of vervet monkeys. One day, the dominant male noticed a strange male monkey nearby. This stranger wanted to join the group, which could mean trouble for the current leader. To prevent this, the dominant male used a clever trick. Whenever the stranger tried to approach, he gave an alarm call that vervets use to warn of a leopard. This scared the stranger back into the trees. The plan worked well until the dominant male made a mistake: he gave the alarm call while casually walking in the open, revealing his deception.

**What Cats Catch**  
In the English village of Felmersham, residents collected prey caught by their cats. Over a year, 70 cats caught over 1,000 animals. An American professor estimated that, based on these numbers, cats in Britain might be killing 100 million birds and small mammals annually. However, this calculation is misleading. Most cats live in towns, have smaller territories, and catch less prey than rural cats. The important question is whether these numbers are sustainable. The answer seems to be yes. Many people feed birds in winter, and gardens provide nesting sites, keeping bird populations higher than natural levels. The survey showed that while cats are significant predators, they are not destroying Britain's bird population.

**Buffalo's Day**  
Buffaloes are essential to marshmen and are well cared for. Each morning, the buffaloes leave their resting places slowly and with groans, heading to the reed beds. They stand at the water's edge, complaining about the day's work, until the leader finally steps into the water. Once in, they seem to forget their purpose and wallow for a while. Eventually, they move so gradually that it's barely noticeable. They spend the day in the reeds, grazing on green shoots, appearing almost submerged and exhausted.

**PICASSO, Pablo - The Soles, 1940**  
In early 1940, Picasso painted several still lifes of fish while staying in the fishing port of Royan. One painting shows a fishmonger's slab with a crab and some soles. Despite their situation, the sea creatures appear alive. The painting is complex, with overlapping and interlocking transparent planes. The thin, delicately brushed paint and cool colors create a calm, underwater feel. However, this is disrupted by a sense of an impending battle between the fish and the crab. The sharp forms and even a chain around one fish add a sense of menace and tension, giving the painting a symbolic depth."
CPE_12,"Photography has been a powerful tool for capturing human life and activities for the past 150 years. It allows us to see moments that are brief or visualize things that are either very large or very small. Photography has shown us images from faraway places on Earth, distant parts of the solar system, and the complex social issues of modern life. It has become a crucial way to express the human experience.

However, using images to record events is not new. It dates back to the Upper Palaeolithic period, about 35,000 years ago, with early cave paintings. We don't know exactly why these paintings were made—whether they depicted real hunting events, served as magic to increase animals for hunting, acted as religious symbols, or simply decorated living spaces. But images have always been a part of human culture.

Throughout history, people have questioned how accurate visual images are and their importance in society. The saying ""seeing is believing"" has given visual images a special status. When photography was invented in the mid-19th century, it promised to provide a truthful visual record automatically. The camera, much like the human eye, was seen as a machine that could capture a fixed image, closely resembling what we see. This was a significant cultural achievement, as artists had long worked to develop the skills to create such images manually.

Photography's realism led to the belief that everyone could understand photographs, raising the question of whether photography is a ""universal language."" In 1933, photographer August Sander suggested that even isolated people could understand a photograph of the sky. However, with the rise of global communication in the late 20th century, we must consider whether photography can truly bridge cultural differences or if it is as culturally bound as language.

Photography is often seen as providing clear evidence, making it seem transparent and blurring the line between reality and its photographic representation. It's common for someone to show a photo and say, ""this is my grandson."" Since its invention in 1839, photography and attitudes towards it have changed significantly. Initially a tool for recording, photography has become a historical document, revealing much about the people and society that created it.

The camera is not just a silent recorder of events. Photography can inspire social and political change. Just as the development of perspective was crucial to the cultural changes of the Italian Renaissance, photography has played a major role in shaping our media culture and bringing the world's harsh realities into our homes."
CPE_26,"**How to Write Poetry**

Writing poetry is like walking through a minefield: you need to be spontaneous, but one wrong move can ruin everything. Claiming to know everything about poetry is risky, so instead, I suggest that beginners focus on reading a lot, writing often, and freeing their imagination in any productive way, without causing chaos. Some people need stability in their lives to write poetry, while others can write even when they're unhappy. Some follow a schedule, while others wait for inspiration. All methods are valid as long as they aren't just copying someone else's style. The key is to find your own voice, nurture it, and let it grow until it can stand on its own.

**The Short Story**

In a short story, there's no space for too many characters or long narratives. Flashbacks should be brief and only used if necessary to clarify something. A good way to do this is through a quick memory in the main character's mind, which can help move the story forward. Dialogue is very useful because it can show different sides of a situation quickly and keeps the reader interested. Overwriting can ruin a short story, but that doesn't mean it should be as short as a summary. A short story needs to maintain conflict and action like a novel, but every word must be meaningful in a limited space.

**Screenplays**

Writing a screenplay is like playing chess. Many chess players make moves without knowing the outcome, seeing only a few moves ahead. As they learn more, they realize chess is about long-term strategy, not just short-term tactics. They start to see the whole game and recognize patterns, like openings and endgames. Similarly, the more you write screenplays, the more you understand their complexities.

**Looking at Writing**

Charles Darwin noted that humans naturally speak, as seen in children's babbling, but writing is not instinctive. Language exists in all societies and doesn't necessarily improve over time. Children learn to speak without formal lessons, and if they lack a language, they create one. Writing, however, has been invented only a few times in history, in complex societies, and has evolved slowly. Many children still struggle to read and write, even with education. Unlike speaking, writing is a skill that must be learned and understood, requiring effort to master."
CPE_8,"I have never started writing a novel with more uncertainty. I call it a novel only because I don't know what else to name it. I have a small story to share, and it doesn't end with a death or a marriage. Instead, I leave the reader hanging. This book is about my memories of a man I met only occasionally, and I don't know much about what happened to him in between those meetings. I could make up details to fill the gaps and make the story more complete, but I don't want to do that. I just want to write down what I know. To avoid embarrassing people who are still alive, I've given the characters in this story made-up names and taken care to ensure no one recognizes them. The man I'm writing about isn't famous. He might never be. When he dies, he might leave no more trace than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the water's surface. If my book is read at all, it will be for its own interest. But maybe his chosen way of life and his unique character will influence others, and long after his death, people might realize he was a remarkable person. Then, it will be clear who I'm writing about, and those interested in his early life might find something useful in my book. I think my book, despite its limitations, will be a helpful source for his future biographers. I don't claim that the conversations I've included are exact quotes. I never took notes, but I have a good memory for things that matter to me. I've written these conversations in my own words, but I believe they accurately reflect what was said. I mentioned earlier that I haven't invented anything, but like historians, I've added speeches to my narrative that I didn't hear myself. I've done this to make the scenes more lively and realistic. I want my book to be read, and I think it's fair to make it engaging. Intelligent readers will easily spot where I've used this technique, and they can choose to ignore it if they wish. Another reason I'm nervous about this work is that the people I'm writing about are from a different culture. It's hard to truly know people, and I think you can only really understand your own countrymen. People are shaped by where they were born, the places they grew up, the games they played, the food they ate, the schools they attended, the sports they followed, and the poets they read. These experiences make them who they are, and you can't fully understand them just by hearing about them; you have to live them. You can only truly know them if you are one of them. Because you can only observe people from a foreign culture, it's hard to portray them convincingly in a book. I've never tried to write about anyone but my own countrymen, and if I've done so in short stories, it's because you can describe characters more briefly there. You give the reader broad hints and let them fill in the details. In this book, I don't claim that my characters see themselves as I describe them; they are seen through my eyes, just like the main character."
CPE_4,"At any point in history, the literary world can seem confusing to those experiencing it. It's only later, when we look back, that we see clear patterns and recognize which writers were truly important. Today, poetry is especially complex, with many different styles and debates about how poetry should be presented, criticized, and taught. There is a general divide between 'literary' poets, who write for their work to be read on the page, and 'popular' poets, who prefer performing their poetry to an audience. However, this division isn't strict. Public poetry readings have become more common over the past twenty years. These events happen in various places, like small town halls, schools, colleges, and arts festivals, where poets read and discuss their work with audiences.

For poets who write specifically for live performances, these events are beneficial. Their poems are often simple and easy to understand in one hearing, but might seem lacking when read on the page. On the other hand, poets who focus on crafting complex and thoughtful poetry might not be fully appreciated in a live setting, especially if the audience is hearing their work for the first time. The risk is that these poets might choose to read only their simpler, more accessible poems, which might not represent their best work.

Listening to poetry readings is not a replacement for reading poetry on the page, but it can be a valuable and enjoyable experience. Hearing poets read their own work can help listeners understand the emphasis and rhythm intended by the poet. It's helpful if the audience can follow along with the text or is already familiar with the poems. The main benefit of popular poetry recitals, sometimes mixed with music, is that they help people associate poetry with enjoyment, making it feel accessible to everyone, not just a select few."
CPE_30,"**Oral History**

Historians are increasingly using oral evidence, but this method has challenges. It's a mistake to think that someone's spoken account is a perfect reflection of past events. During an interview, both the historian and the person being interviewed influence each other. The historian chooses who to interview and what topics to cover. Even if the historian just listens, their presence can change how the person remembers and talks about the past. The final account is shaped by the historian's social status compared to the interviewee and the way the historian has been trained to think about history, which might affect the interviewee's responses. Historians must acknowledge their role in shaping new evidence. Even without the historian, the interviewee's memories might be influenced by other sources, like the media, or altered by nostalgia or later life experiences. Emotions and attitudes can make the testimony seem convincing, but they might not accurately reflect the past.

**Animal Science**

Animal science can be approached in two main ways: focusing on physiology or on the whole animal. Physiologists study how the body functions, such as how nerves and muscles work together to create complex behaviors. Those who study the whole animal look at the behavior of the entire animal and what influences it. Within this approach, psychologists and ethologists are distinguished. Psychologists usually work in labs, studying how animals like rats and pigeons learn. Ethologists focus on natural, instinctive behaviors, often in wild settings. Although these fields are merging, physiologists often claim their methods are more fundamental. However, understanding every nerve cell's function doesn't eliminate the need to study behavior as a whole. Behavior has its own structure and must be studied at its own level. Describing a bird's nest-building by looking at nerve cells is like trying to read a book with a microscope.

**The Social Sciences**

New social science students face the challenge of learning both the content and the methods of their subject. They need to understand the knowledge and research findings in textbooks and the methods used to gather and organize this knowledge. These two aspects are closely linked. While social life might seem like common sense because of our daily experiences, social sciences go beyond this. Each social science focuses on a specific part of social life, uses particular study methods, and has its own concepts. These concepts form the 'logical basis' of the subject, allowing social scientists to move beyond everyday understanding and distinguishing each discipline.

**Classical Architecture**

In Ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was more than just building structures. According to the Roman architect Vitruvius, architecture involves order, arrangement, proportion, symmetry, propriety, and distribution. He used Greek terms for some of these ideas, likely from an earlier Greek source. While utility and function aren't part of his definition, Vitruvius does discuss the best designs for different building purposes. However, he emphasizes architecture as an art form. Classical architecture has complex origins, with a long history of simple constructions in Greece and Italy that didn't meet Vitruvius' artistic standards. These early structures, though not artistic, contributed to the development of classical architecture. Despite its elaborate appearance, a classical temple is essentially a simple, single-roomed hut."
CPE_7,"The two sisters, Lily and Mui, kept Lily's driving a secret from Chen for a while. Lily would drive around the allotments, near the railway line and gasworks, even jumping a small bridge with all four wheels off the ground, which was her only mistake. She would finish her drive near the gasworks, surrounded by the smell of sulphur. When Chen found out, he was amused rather than upset. ""So you can really drive, Lily? Well done!"" he said. Mui thought men were strange; she expected Chen to be angry, but instead, he was excited and started planning a trip with Lily. They decided on a Monday at the start of the next month, the quietest day of the week, to leave early and return by midday, so they wouldn't lose any customers. Meanwhile, Lily would practice driving around the allotments. Mui, despite her doubts, bought a road map and got a ten percent discount, which impressed Chen. Lily, however, felt a bit insulted by Mui's lack of trust in her navigation skills.

On the day of the trip, they left the house and, within an hour, were looking at the English Channel. Lily drove perfectly. Even Mui, who was ready to give directions from the back seat, had to admit this. Lily overtook a few slow vehicles with great skill, and Chen even applauded. After passing through the gasworks of a seaside town, they drove along the empty promenade. Lily parked in a street full of empty parking spaces, unsure of the road markings, and preferred to pay a fee rather than risk being towed or fined. She hoped this caution would reassure Mui. Lily had noticed Mui's tense face in the mirror during the drive and thought it best not to mention worries that hadn't occurred to her sister.

Lily locked all the van doors carefully. Chen joked, ""Don't worry, no one will want that heap of tin."" The sisters were annoyed. Lily accused Chen of being ungrateful, and Mui scolded him for being too easily fooled by appearances. Surprised, Chen took their son, Man Kee, to look at the sea. He lifted Man Kee onto the railing and held him close. Man Kee, warm and increasingly responsive, put his small hand on Chen's sleeve. In that moment, Chen decided to raise Man Kee his way, ensuring he got a good education in business and eventually owned many restaurants.

The sight of the sea made Chen feel thoughtful as he planned Man Kee's future. He saw a ship on the horizon and used a telescope to get a better look. At first, he couldn't find it, but then he saw it clearly: a small, old, rusty tramp steamer. He lifted Man Kee to the eyepiece. ""Do you see the ship, Son?"" he asked. ""It's a special ship for people like us. It will take us back home when we're done here, to your homeland, which you've never seen."" Chen kissed Man Kee's head. Lily and Mui joined them, and Chen let Lily look through the telescope. But by then, the ship had disappeared over the horizon, and all Lily could see were seagulls following the ship's wake."
CPE_43,"THE WELL

I had read somewhere that if you looked up from a deep hole, you could see the stars during the day. I convinced you to help me test this idea. You watched nervously as I pulled up the well bucket, steadied it, and climbed in. I asked you to lower me down. I didn't consider how much heavier the bucket would be with me in it, or that you might not be strong enough to hold it. You tried to hold the handle but let go, and I fell into the well, hitting my head. At that moment, I didn't realize I had, in a way, achieved my goal. I saw strange lights, like the stars and planets in cartoons when a character gets hit. At first, I was dazed, then scared, then relieved, and finally angry at you for letting me fall and worried about what Mother would say. You called down to see if I was okay. I was about to shout back when your voice, filled with panic, stopped me. I lay still, watching you through my eyelashes. You ran off to get help. I quickly climbed out of the well and hid in the shadows near the moat bridge. I heard voices from the castle. Mother and Father came out with you and Arthur. Mother was frantic, and Father told Arthur to use the winch. You looked pale and shocked. I felt a mix of excitement and fear. Then I noticed the trail of water drops I had left from the well to my hiding spot. I was horrified that no one had seen them. Father shone a flashlight into the well, and the drops glistened in the sunlight. Mother was screaming, a sound that shook me deeply. I realized my prank had gone too far and would lead to serious consequences. I regretted not thinking it through. In a moment of desperation, I came out of hiding, pretending to be weak and disoriented. I claimed I had found a secret tunnel from the well to the moat and had crawled and swum through it. I thought I might get away with it until Father asked me to repeat my story. I hesitated, and his eyes narrowed. Trying to cover my lie, I said the tunnel had collapsed, making it pointless to check. Father looked at me with disbelief, as if seeing me for the first time. His words, ""Don't be ridiculous, boy,"" were filled with contempt. He walked away, leaving me feeling exposed. Arthur looked at me with pity, not because of my adventure, but because he saw through my lie and worried about my character. His pity was a harsh rebuke, confirming the seriousness of my actions. It affected me deeply."
CPE_51,"**REMOVAL DAY**

Susan, now a widow, is leaving her family home as her children have grown up. The moving van had ""Removers of Distinction"" written on it, and indeed, everything unique about the house was being packed away. Fred, the removal man, with his large, gentle hands, was carefully packing fragile items, while his team was less gentle. Susan was leaving a beautiful four-storey house overlooking a small harbour. The memories of her children growing up there lingered like dust in the air. 

When they first bought the house, her son Robert, then five, had asked, ""Mum, when you buy a house, how do you get it home?"" Now, Robert was there helping with the move, especially making sure Susan didn't mention the piano. Francesca, her daughter, was also helping, insisting that only she could handle the Steinway piano with enough care.

Fred, the removal man, noted that Susan didn't seem like she was going to cry. Susan asked if people often cried during moves, and Fred explained that they do, but they feel better once everything is at the new place. Susan could understand this feeling. She would have warned the movers about the piano, but Robert insisted it was their responsibility to notice any issues.

The piano was in the best room of the house and would be moved last. Sitting on the bottom stair, as all the chairs were gone, Susan remembered when they first moved in. The piano had been brought in first and got stuck on the stairs. The movers struggled for hours, and Francesca, then a child, cried, ""We can't live in a house without a piano!"" Her husband Peter had solved the problem by hiring a builder to remove a window and using a crane to bring the piano in. It was an expensive process, and they couldn't afford to tune the piano for months. Peter had said, ""That's there forever,"" but forever is a long time.

Now, the children were busy, and Susan found it hard to move around the house. She thought about the stairs and the slightly misaligned banister rails from the piano incident. She should have warned the movers, but it was too late. Fred reassured her that only the piano was left to move. Susan, feeling emotional, moved from the stair. Robert and Francesca watched as the piano was carefully carried down the stairs and out the door. 

Once the piano was safely outside, they all laughed with relief. As they walked down the path for the last time, arm in arm, Susan's only tears were tears of laughter."
CPE_11,"Online Literary Criticism For Everyone

The idea of open access to the Internet was always about letting anyone share their thoughts. In the beginning, you needed some technical skills to do this. But one area that really opened up to everyone was literary criticism. With Amazon.com, the first big online bookstore, anyone could write a book review. Amazon's approach was simple: anyone could say what they thought about a book and give it up to five stars. This seemed like a great idea because it allowed readers to see what others thought about a book, not just the publisher's description or professional critics' opinions.

Other online bookstores also offered similar features, but Amazon, being the largest, attracted the most reviews and, consequently, the most issues. With so many reviews submitted daily, it was impossible to check them all. Amazon had a team to ensure reviews followed their guidelines, like not allowing single-word reviews, personal attacks, or spoilers. However, since reviewers were anonymous, some mischievous activities went unnoticed. For example, authors could write positive reviews of their own books. Lev Grossman, an author, did this to counteract negative reviews of his first novel until he confessed in an article, leading to the removal of his fake reviews.

Authors could also comment on their books through a special link, but Amazon didn't verify if the comments were truly from the authors, except for famous ones. A fake comment pretending to be from John Updike was removed because it was clearly not genuine.

The real drama came from readers' reviews. When James McElroy's book about a cheerleading team was published, it got good reviews from the press, but people mentioned in the book felt betrayed and expressed their anger on Amazon. Many critical reviews appeared but were later removed.

Despite these issues, Amazon saw the high number of reviews as good for business. They monitored bestselling books closely to ensure reviews followed the rules. For less popular books, like ""The Story about Ping,"" some reviews were humorous, using the book's plot to make jokes about Internet technology. However, most reviews were serious, and they provided a reliable indication of whether a book was worth buying.

The writer George Orwell once said that reviewing too many books meant inventing feelings about them. This makes the open and democratic process of online reviews a positive development."
CPE_14,"**Art in Modern Times**

In the last two hundred years, we've started to think that every artist must rebel against the art of their time. We praise art for being unique, revolutionary, and even shocking. We admire artists whose work was not appreciated a hundred years ago. But when it comes to contemporary art, we often hesitate and say an artist has gone too far, questioning if it can still be called art. The media often voices these doubts for us, and we tend to agree because we expect art to be puzzling and new. This expectation makes us overlook the old themes, methods, and virtues present in today's art. We see artists as separate from the rest of us, with special talents and energy that break conventions. In the past, people commissioned art for specific purposes, making it part of everyday life. Today, we leave artists to their own devices and get annoyed if they try to be more relatable.

**Picture This**

Let me describe a situation and ask an important question about it. An artist selects a piece of text from an art book. The text talks about the variety of pictures, asking, ""What are they all about?"" and concludes, ""There is no end to the number of different kinds of pictures."" The artist then asks someone to prepare a canvas and take it to a sign painter. The sign painter is instructed to write the text on the canvas in simple black letters, without any fancy lettering. The question is: Is the finished product a painting?

**Underground Encounters**

At the Mercury Gallery in London until June 26th, there is an unspoken rule in the art world that once an artist finds success in a particular style, they should stick to it. Collectors expect consistency, and trying something new can upset them. Gallery owners prefer safe bets, and the art-buying public often seeks comfort in continuity. However, some artists, like Picasso and Hockney, have successfully broken this mold. Eric Rimmington is another artist challenging expectations. His new show moves away from the still lifes that made him famous to paintings of the London Underground. Railways have always fascinated Rimmington. After drawing the railway land of King's Cross Station in the 1980s, he naturally turned to the underground world. His exhibition, ""Underground Encounters,"" features 40 paintings and drawings capturing the unique charm of this hidden world.

**Extract from a Novel**

I have come to this island with a few books. The villagers joke that only a sick person would choose such a remote place to rebuild. So, I am here to heal myself, if you want to put it that way. Apart from an old peasant woman who comes daily to clean, I am alone. I am neither happy nor unhappy; I feel suspended in memories. I spoke of art's uselessness but didn't mention its comforts. The solace in my work as a painter or writer is that in silence, reality can be reimagined and shown in its true form. Our everyday actions are like a rough covering hiding the true meaning beneath. For artists, art offers a way to reconcile with life's challenges, not to escape destiny like ordinary people, but to fulfill it through imagination. Otherwise, why do we hurt each other?"
CPE_63,"Text: 'Family Business'

""Look here, it's no good!"" said my Dad. We were driving back to London. My father, with my brother Maurice, had just picked me up from the fancy girls' school I attended. He had also just sat through Parent's Day, where I received the Latin prize and the prize for doing best in my final exams. He had a long talk with my headteacher, and now we were heading home for the holidays.

""What isn't?"" I asked, though I had a feeling I knew what he was thinking from his unusual silence. He was usually very talkative. ""You can't fool me. You'll do what you want now,"" he said. ""With all those certificates, I was told you'll get a scholarship to Oxford.""

""So?"" I said, trying to act confident. ""Mightn't that be useful?""

""I also hear,"" he continued, and I knew a confrontation was coming, ""that you want to be a barrister. A barrister of all things!"" My father knew a lot about barristers and the law.

""I just said that,"" I replied. ""I couldn't think of anything else to say!""

""And apparently,"" he went on, ""you have the right personality - you can quickly understand complex information, you have the gift of talking, and you enjoy performing.""

""I don't know about that,"" I said. ""All I know is what I see in TV dramas.""

""Be that as it may,"" he continued, pulling himself together, ""I feel your heart's never going to be in the family business now. Obviously, you'll go to Oxford University, and after that, I can't see you wanting to join us.""

The problem was that, like many children in family trades, I felt trapped by family expectations. I saw other career options and wanted to explore them. At the same time, I didn't want to upset my father. I wasn't as scared of him as Maurice was - I was the favorite - but I found him intimidating.

""It's too soon to know,"" I said weakly.

""I tell you, you're not going to want to join us,"" said my father, who was annoyingly often right about such things, ""and it's a pity because you've got the gifts - the brains, the nerves, the vision.""

""There's still Maurice,"" I said, sulking. My father snorted. We both knew Maurice hated the business.

""Anyway,"" I continued, ""you could always use me as a sort of consultant.""

My mother wasn't around to help - she had died when I was young, and my father raised Maurice and me. Maurice was two years younger, and because he was motherless, I got used to taking care of him. It wasn't a hardship. I loved Maurice. Because the business was successful, we lived in luxury - a big house in London, posh schools, nice clothes, parties, theatres, operas. My father knew all kinds of people - politicians, actors, businessmen - and our house was full of interesting conversations and encounters.

""I tell you what,"" my father continued. ""You can help us out during holidays until you leave Oxford, and then if you decide to leave us, you can. It will give you some pocket money and be a real help to me.""

""OK,"" I said, relieved to avoid immediate decisions and especially the depression and sulks my father would fall into if I opposed him. This was how he controlled us.

So it happened. In my last term at school, and then during university vacations, I helped out, never more than twice a year, and always on the safer tasks. I became one of the smarter undergraduates, with a little house of my own, a small but powerful white car, designer clothes, and a black dress with a Paris label that I planned to wear for my final exams.

In my last term, my father visited me and took me to a village for a meal and a chat. There were only a few weeks left. My tutor predicted I would get a First Class degree in Law, and I knew that if I stayed focused and used these last days wisely, he might be right. I felt poised, confident, and concentrated.

This was not to be. My father told me that, in about a week, he needed me for one last assignment, the most important business the family firm had ever attempted, and that it would be worth my while.

""But Dad,"" I protested, ""I've got my final exams coming up, and I need to focus on that. It's really important that I do well, and I don't want to think about anything else right now.""

I could tell that such pressures were beyond my father's imagination (or maybe he was jealous of my life away from him?) and that he would see a refusal as a betrayal in his time of need. That wasn't all. As he described the procedures, I saw more clearly than ever his single-mindedness - the clarity and resourcefulness with which he approached his work, his dynamic energy, his perfect self-control. In his way, he was a sort of genius, and I respected that. It made my own plans and hopes seem less important.

""All right,"" I said. ""I'll do it."""
CPE_56,"Simon Costello realized that buying the house in Pembroke Square was a mistake within a year of moving in with his wife, Lois. They could only afford it by being extremely careful with their money, which wasn't ideal. Initially, it seemed like a good decision because Simon had been successful in his legal cases, and Lois had returned to her advertising job with a salary increase to thirty-five thousand. Lois was the one who pushed for the move, arguing that their flat wasn't suitable for a family, and they needed more space, a garden, and a place for an au pair. These needs could have been met in a less expensive area, but Lois wanted more than just space. She felt their old address, Mornington Mansions, wasn't prestigious enough for their careers. 

To save money, Lois decided one of them should use public transport, and since her job was far away, Simon had to take the crowded tube. This commute left him feeling resentful and thinking about his grandfather's house in Hampstead, where he was treated with care and respect after a long day. His grandmother was a traditional 'lawyer's wife,' involved in legal causes and content with her role. But times had changed, and Lois made it clear that her career was as important as Simon's. Their lifestyle depended on both their incomes.

Now, their situation was threatened by Venetia, who had confronted Simon with intense anger. She accused him of knowing that a client, Brian Cartwright, had bribed jurors in a past case and of accepting shares for his fiancée. Simon denied the accusations, but his denial felt weak even to himself. He was filled with guilt and remembered feeling similar shame in his school days. He wished he had been prepared and could have responded differently, but he lied, and Venetia saw through it. He wondered why she was so angry and what right she had to judge him. He feared that if the accusations spread, even as rumors, his career would be over."
CPE_36,"I chose to live here because I thought I could be anonymous among people who didn't mind if their rented houses fell apart or if their gardens were overgrown. But I was wrong. People in the shops soon start to recognize you, even if you're not living your ""real"" life. The roses next door remind me that the gardens were once cared for. Usually, I stay inside, trying to ignore the summer outside, but tonight I'm watching the swifts fly between the treetops and roofs. I've cleared some space in the garden for a chair, and my arms are scratched from cutting back rosemary and lemon balm. It's a small London garden where plants have to grow tall or spread out to survive. 

My upstairs neighbor, Jaz, leans out of the window. She's written several unpublished manuscripts, and as an English teacher, I sometimes have to pretend to be interested. I have her latest one now. ""How's the work going, Jaz?"" I ask. ""In no other job do you have to explain yourself a thousand times a day,"" she replies, then adds, ""I'll bring something to drink."" I don't really want Jaz in the garden, and I realize it looks messy. The only way to the garden is through my flat, and Jaz is knocking on my door. ""You're on holiday now,"" she says, lounging in shorts and a vest. ""I should've been a teacher. Writers don't get holidays. But you know what they say, those who can, do; those who can't, teach."" And some can't do either. ""What are your plans for the holidays?"" she asks. 

I dread the end of the school year. Empty days, hot pavements, the walk to the shops, and loneliness in the park. ""I'm going to Stonebridge tomorrow. Can you feed the cats?"" I ask, my heart racing. ""Of course,"" Jaz says, knowing she will be around. ""Where will you stay? A nice B&B?"" ""No, with my oldest friend, Ruby, at the Rising Sun. We've known each other since we were eight."" It's not true, but I often deal with fiction. ""Going back to your roots. What do you think of my manuscript?"" Jaz asks about her book, The Cruelty of Red Vans, which I haven't finished. I like the title and tell her so. Red vans can seem cruel, always bringing gifts to others and rejection letters to her. I decide to be honest. ""Try writing about nice people for a change,"" I suggest. ""Less focus on yourself, more fiction."" ""Teachers!"" Jaz responds like a rebellious student. ""I keep a journal,"" I say, ""writing something good about each day."" My words sound old-fashioned. ""Keep a journal! Nice people! Get a life, Ann."" 

Oh, I have a life. I have my work, and I go out sometimes, reading on the tube. When we go inside, my calm kitchen reassures me. Then I remember my school geography teacher, Miss Tarrantine, winking as she said, ""I've had my moments."" We nearly died laughing."
CPE_6,"**Heritage**

Heritage is important because it connects people and communities to their past. We often feel linked to our personal heritage, knowing about our grandparents and their lives. Beyond this, there is a broader need to understand our past to help us interpret our individual and national futures. Heritage fulfills a basic desire for continuity, providing assurance about the past and, in turn, our future. Just as you inherit genes, you also inherit a culture passed down through generations. There may be parts of your national heritage you dislike, but it is still yours, and it is comforting to belong to something. Heritage teaches us a lot and is crucial for our well-being, influencing everything from customs to material culture. Traditionally, our connection to the past came from stories and legends passed down by ancestors. However, Western industrial society disrupted communities and families, leading to the loss of much oral tradition. Now, places and architectural 'memories' offer clues to our past. It is essential to preserve these links as a testament to our ancestors' identity.

**The Fens**

I started a novel, ""Waterland,"" where the landscape of the Fens in England became significant. People often ask why I, a Londoner with no personal connection to the Fens, chose to write about it. The short answer is that I was drawn to the Fens because they seemed unobtrusive—a flat and empty stage for my book's drama. However, I learned that the Fens are neither flat nor empty. They are as richly English as any other part of England but also strangely compelling and haunting. It's remarkable that in the middle of England, there is a region that many English people find foreign, even when other unique areas of Britain have become part of the nation's cultural and literary heritage. The Fens are both empty and full, cultivated yet wild, seemingly open and obvious yet deeply mysterious. My research for the novel wasn't extensive; I haven't visited places like Wisbech or Prickwillow. As a fiction writer, I prefer imagining worlds and making inspired guesses rather than seeking documentary proof. Imagining the Fens has its logic because, as Edward Storey's book shows, the Fens are not just a landscape but a state of mind.

**Museums**

Museums must make their collections accessible. In the past, this meant putting items in display cases with long labels that were hard for the average person to understand. Today, accessibility means more. Displays should be lively and interesting, using theatrical or architectural techniques to capture visitors' attention and evoke emotions. Museums should do more than just display items; they should make their collections available to the widest community. For example, they can provide loan boxes of objects for teachers or use similar materials to help elderly people with memory loss. Museums focus on 'artefacts and specimens'—not replicas. They offer encounters with authentic items that existed and had meaning in history. This is their strength and what sets them apart from heritage centers, theme parks, books, and CD-ROMs. Museums that embrace this challenge and offer exciting, accessible displays, catalogues, and outreach programs will find that their competitors in 'virtual history' are actually allies, creating a desire for the 'real thing' that only museums can satisfy.

**Architecture and Environment**

The desire to preserve things is not new, but now changes in our towns happen so quickly and on such a large scale that most of us are affected. This turns some people into strong preservationists and encourages others to think more about the nature of towns today and their future. It can be argued that generations who have lived through events like world wars are more inclined to preserve things than those before them—anything that represents stability becomes important. If there is a psychological need for preservation, it is part of the planner's job to consider it. Change is not an enemy if we learn how to manage it. Physical change in our towns reflects social change—changes in our population, welfare, and demands."
CPE_33,"**Einstein**  
If you ask someone on the street to name a scientist, they will likely mention Albert Einstein. His image is often used to promote products that are associated with intelligence, like computers and encyclopedias. Most people don't know much about what Einstein actually did, except that he developed theories called 'relativity', which are known for being hard to understand and making strange predictions that seem to contradict everyday experiences. Einstein was part of a major change in scientific thinking, marking the start of modern science in the 20th century. Scientists were trying to create a new, more logical way to describe the universe by studying how matter and natural forces interact. Einstein made significant contributions by re-examining the basics: time, space, matter, and energy. Before him, scientists relied on Isaac Newton's idea of a universe where stars and planets moved in a fixed framework of space and time. Einstein challenged this idea, suggesting that time and space are not fixed but relative.

**Young Readers**  
When we were children, Lydia and I avoided any book that won a prize because we thought it would be 'worthy', which to us meant 'boring'. Our mother disapproved of our attitude, but our father would happily give us small amounts of money to encourage us to read these 'improving' books. He would also sneak in a few high-quality books among our Christmas and birthday gifts, marking them with a note saying, 'This Book is NOT Literature'. Although we often dismissed his choices as 'boys' books', he did manage to introduce us to some good short stories and, on one occasion, a well-known collection of poems.

**Language**  
In 1851, Jacob Grimm wrote that 'the origin of human language is truly secret and marvellous'. This mysterious origin has led to many strange theories. In 1928, Charles Caller suggested that early humans might have made sounds like ""meuh"" when they felt danger. ""Meuh"" sounds sad, and humans in a dangerous world full of scary animals might have made desperate noises. Some languages have kept echoes of these sounds, like the word malaria meaning ""fever"" or the Latin mors meaning ""death"". Because of such odd ideas, many people avoided discussing the topic, thinking it was for eccentric thinkers. However, recently, the origin and evolution of language have become important research areas. Language likely developed in East Africa around 100,000 years ago. It was mainly used for friendly communication and played a key role in power dynamics. Sharing information was probably not its original purpose, contrary to philosopher John Locke's view of language as a 'great conduit' for sharing knowledge."
CPE_20,"Text: 'Writing Reviews Frank Kermode explores the art of writing reviews from the perspective of someone who does it. Most reviews are written and shared in ways that make them relevant for only a short time. There are deadlines and strict limits on their length. Once published, they are only relevant for as long as the newspaper or magazine they appear in—usually a day, a week, or at most a month. The temporary nature of reviews often defines their literary value. Many people, including the writers themselves, often think that reviewing is a job done out of necessity, like needing extra money, or because they can't spend all day working on a novel or a serious book. However, reviewing is a skilled and complex task. Writing a concise and fair review in 600 to 800 words for a newspaper is different from writing a detailed 6,000 to 8,000-word piece for an international journal. A 1,500-word article in a weekly magazine combines challenges of both short and long reviews. Length isn't the only factor. Reviewers must consider their audience, from casual weekend readers to those deeply interested in the subject. A reviewer needs to know a lot about various topics and write in a way that intelligent readers can understand and enjoy. This means reviewers often write other things besides reviews. The American novelist John Updike, who isn't fond of criticism—calling it ""hugging the shore""—still enjoys writing reviews between his major novels. He collects all his reviews, even the short ones, into books with modest titles. While some might think less famous writers should accept the temporary nature of their reviews, there's no reason they shouldn't enjoy some recognition if they believe their best work is in their reviews. I feel this way about my own work. My main job has been academic, and most of my serious books are academic, the kind professors are expected to write. In the English-speaking world, unlike in some other cultures, there's no strict separation between reviewing and literary study, so it's common for the same people to do both. The days when academics criticized professors for writing reviews are mostly over, and complaints from non-academics about professors taking their work are less common, partly because there's more reviewing work available now. I believe this is good for readers, who can trust the reviewer knows what they're talking about, and for professors, as it helps them stay grounded. It also reminds them to communicate clearly with non-academics. While they might use complex language with each other, they need to be clear when addressing intelligent non-academics. Ultimately, reviewing is a secondary job. You can only do it well if you are also doing something else well.'"
CPE_40,"Ralph unlocked the door to his apartment and, as he stepped into the dark, still hallway, he felt a brief moment of doubt about owning the place. Even after three years, this feeling sometimes came over him when he returned home alone at the end of the day. When he first bought the flat, he would come home eagerly, often as early as possible, curious about what the flat had been like while he was away. It felt like a welcoming place where he was in control. He thought he should worry about things like intruders or plumbing issues, but the flat always seemed to be waiting for him, either looking independent or neglected, depending on whether he had left it tidy. Over time, he began to see it as just another part of himself, a space where his thoughts and feelings spilled over. He became frustrated that it couldn't change. Sometimes, there would be a small pile of letters by the door or the answering machine would be blinking with messages. He was thankful that the windows hadn't been broken or the place vandalized, though he wondered what it would look like if that happened. From his dull office on Holloway Road, Ralph often looked forward to his few evenings alone at home each week. Once he left the artificial world of the office and started to feel like himself again on the bus ride home, he realized he didn't need to be alone, a fact he often forgot when planning his social life. At his desk, he longed for solitude and time with his belongings, but once he escaped, he felt drained and waited in vain for a sense of self to return. Instead, he felt empty, suspecting that working in a job that didn't suit him had changed him, moving him away from who he thought he was. He would read or listen to music as the night went on, but he found himself questioning why he did these things. His sense of direction was unclear, and ideas would come and go without connecting. He remembered a time when he didn't feel so powerless, when he might have escaped if he had realized his own worth. But he had been eager to settle into something and followed the first opportunity that came along, as if it was meant to be. After university, he tried to make a plan for his future, but he wasn't surprised to find that he only wanted to survive quietly. He applied for jobs he heard about from friends, following their paths without imagining he could find work that would make him happy. He went to his only job interview with gratitude and didn't think to evaluate the position—a vague editorial role at a free local newspaper. He was relieved to have a pleasant conversation with Neil, his boss, and didn't consider the long meetings he would face daily. Neil offered him the job on the spot, saying Ralph was the only graduate who applied, which Ralph took as a compliment at the time."
CPE_45,"**Goat Racing**

I was about to see a goat race on Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. The place was crowded with ice-cream vans, lots of people, food stalls, and loud music. Everyone was moving towards the racecourse, and I pushed through the crowd to find a good spot. A section was marked off for the race. It wasn't like a professional racecourse, but the idea was the same: spectators stood on either side of the track where the goats would run. Keeping the goats in order was a challenge since they are known to eat almost anything.

**Canoe Trip**

As the day ended, I started worrying about the night. The canoe was too wet to sleep in, and we hadn't seen any villages or huts since morning. In the dim moonlight, with our torch, we could barely see the cliffs. The torch batteries were dying, so we replaced them, but the new ones didn't work. It was clear we wouldn't find a camping spot. A few miles later, Lesley thought she saw a light, and we got hopeful, but it was just moonlight on the waves. Soon, we heard the loud noise of fast-moving water, but we couldn't see what was happening. Time seemed to stop as we continued on.

**How to be Presentation Perfect - we answer your questions**

I am not naturally good at making presentations, but as a managing director, I often have to present to my colleagues and major shareholders. How can I improve my presentation skills and confidence? 

You're not alone. Presenting requires different skills than running a company, but many senior executives need to be good at it. To convince your audience, you must first convince yourself. Show your belief through passion and enthusiasm in your presentation. This means you need to prepare well. Test your ideas in advance and ask colleagues to think of tough questions the audience might ask. Start by creating a positive atmosphere. Begin with something everyone can agree on and gradually lead to your conclusion."
CPE_64,"Some activities simply cannot be rushed; they take the time they need. If you're late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you're impatient while making mayonnaise and add the oil too quickly, it will curdle. Similarly, if you pull too hard on a tangled fishing line, the knot will only get tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some mental tasks are done very quickly, while others take longer—seconds, minutes, hours, days, or even years. Some tasks can be sped up, like solving crossword puzzles or doing mental math faster. However, other tasks cannot be rushed. If you try to hurry them, they might fail, like the mayonnaise, or become more complicated, like the fishing line. The idea of ""Think fast; we need the results"" can be as unrealistic or counterproductive as trying to fit a full night's sleep into half the time. We learn, think, and understand in various ways, and these mental processes work at different speeds, each suited to different tasks. ""He who hesitates is lost,"" says one proverb. ""Look before you leap,"" says another. Both are true. Generally, the mind has three different processing speeds. The first is faster than thought. Some situations require an immediate, instinctive reaction. For example, when my motorbike skidded on a wet road in London, my brain and body quickly coordinated a series of movements that kept me from falling. Only after the incident did my conscious mind and emotions catch up. A concert pianist or an Olympic fencer doesn't have time to think about their next move. This type of quick, physical intelligence can be called our ""wits."" Then there is thought itself: the kind of intelligence that involves figuring things out, weighing pros and cons, constructing arguments, and solving problems. A mechanic diagnosing an engine issue, a scientist interpreting experimental results, or a student working on an assignment all use this type of reasoning and logic, which we often call ""intellect."" People who excel at these tasks are often described as ""bright"" or ""clever."" Below this is another, slower mental process. It is often less focused and more leisurely or dreamy. In this mode, we are reflecting or contemplating. Sitting on a seaside rock, absorbed in the sound and motion of the waves, or hovering between sleep and wakefulness, we are in a different mental state than when planning a meal or writing a letter. This slower, seemingly aimless way of thinking is just as intelligent as the faster ones. Allowing the mind time to wander is not a luxury to be cut back when life or work becomes more demanding. On the contrary, slow thinking is an essential part of our cognitive abilities. We need the slow, thoughtful mind just as much as the quick, analytical one. Some everyday problems are better approached with a slow mind. Some mysteries can only be understood with a relaxed, open mental attitude. Recent scientific studies show that these patient, less deliberate ways of thinking are particularly good for understanding complex, unclear situations. Deliberate thinking works well when the problem is straightforward. For example, when deciding where to go on vacation, the options may be clear. But when we don't know what to consider or which questions to ask—or when the issue is too subtle for conscious thought—we need the slow mind. If the problem is how to manage a difficult team at work or whether to change careers, it might be better to sit and think rather than rush for answers. This type of intelligence is linked to creativity and even ""wisdom."" Poets have long recognized the limits of conscious, deliberate thinking and have tried to nurture these slower, more intuitive ways of knowing. Philosophers have written about the parts of the mind beyond conscious intellect. Only recently have scientists begun to explore these slower, less deliberate ways of knowing. The field of ""cognitive science"" is discovering that the unconscious mind can accomplish many complex and important tasks if given time. It can learn patterns too subtle for normal consciousness, make sense of complex situations, and solve difficult problems more effectively than the conscious mind."
CPE_29,"Surviving in a Foreign Land

I have been warmly welcomed here. It's a friendly and well-equipped base camp in a very remote area. At any given time, there are about forty people - scientists, students, weather experts, and satellite trackers - forming a close-knit community where everyone helps out. My basic French is just enough to communicate, but not for casual conversation or jokes. I miss the subtle meanings, and my phrasebook is useless at breakfast. This isn't a practical problem for me, but at first, it affected my self-confidence. I found myself slightly dreading mealtimes. I would hesitate, unsure of which table to choose, and felt anxious when everyone went silent as I spoke, a feeling I hadn't experienced since my early school days. I still smile awkwardly or panic when people talk to me. I think this occasional sadness isn't about missing company or communication, but because I've lost the social advantage my ability to talk has always given me.

Elliot

When I first met Elliot, I was just another young author, and he didn't pay much attention to me. However, he never forgot a face, and when we met again, he would shake my hand warmly, but didn't seem interested in getting to know me better. If I saw him at the opera with someone important, he often pretended not to see me. But then I had a surprising success as a playwright, and I noticed that Elliot started to show more interest in me. One day, he invited me to lunch, and I thought he was testing me out. After that, as my success brought me many new friends, I began to see him more often.

Alfred Hitchcock

The film director Alfred Hitchcock always said he didn't care much about the story or the acting in his films, but he did care about the photography, the soundtrack, and all the technical details. For Hitchcock, it wasn't the message or a great performance that moved the audience; he believed that people are affected by pure film, no matter their cultural background. So, if a film is designed correctly to have an emotional impact, audiences from Japan and India should react at the same moment. Hitchcock's view of himself was always clear, logical, and seemingly undeniable. He was a man of reason and a genius craftsman who enjoyed hearing an audience scream. He didn't deal with speculation, abstract ideas, or intellectual hints, and he didn't explore his screen characters deeply. He focused on film, pure film, and the precise, calculated beauty of what a strip of film can do to an audience."
CPE_57,"**Amateur Astronomy**

Astronomy has changed a lot in the last 50 years. About 30 years ago, there were not many charts or catalogues. Telescopes were basic, and there were few books on how to do astronomy. Now, you can buy almost any telescope or equipment you need. Electronic calculators and computers have made it easier to create almanacs and charts, analyze observations, and publish results. This should be a great time for amateur astronomers. However, some things have been lost. You might need to travel 80 km to find a sky as clear as it was in cities 50 years ago. During the day, airplane trails can last for hours and turn into clouds, making it hard to observe the sun and stars.

**Too Much Choice**

Today, society has too many choices. There are too many things to do and too many options. In the modern economy, people always want the newest product or service, and technology speeds up these changes. New products come out quickly, making it hard to keep up. This can be stressful and disconnects people from life. More choices mean more stress, less time, and more complexity. People are now looking for 'simplexity'—simple things that bring meaning in a complex world. But simplifying life is hard when there are so many products and services. There are more types of detergent and breakfast cereals than we need, and too many software updates and phone plans to follow.

**McAndrews Hotel**

Every summer, we spend two weeks at McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. It's a family tradition started by my grandmother and has become very important to us. We don't let anything disrupt this ritual. The guests at McAndrews are similar: old-fashioned, maybe a bit odd, and some might say snobbish. I dislike the rude behavior of shop assistants today, which is seen as being equal. I also don't like overly friendly waiters who seem like they might slap you on the back. I know most of the other guests' names because they have been coming here since they were children, like me. But I can be sure that when I see them around the hotel, we will only exchange polite greetings. Such respect for privacy is rare in hotels these days."
CPE_9,"**Othello**

The transfer of an outstanding production of Shakespeare's play ""Othello"" from Stratford to London gives me a chance to correct a previous unfair review I wrote when the show first opened last spring. At that time, I criticized Ray Fearon for being too young for the role of Othello and underestimated his acting skills. Although I still believe that the age difference between Othello and Desdemona is important to the story, I must admit that Mr. Fearon's performance is truly remarkable. In fact, the entire cast is excellent. Notable scenes include Cassio's competitive games with other young officers, which become dangerously intense, and the moment when Iago starts to lose control and struggles to regain it. I dare anyone not to be moved to tears during the scene where Emilia helps Desdemona prepare for bed. The pace and tension throughout the play are incredible. Don't miss this production.

**Lake Vostok**

In the center of Antarctica, everything is still. While the edges of the continent are full of penguins, seals, and birds, the vast white plateau in the interior is lifeless. However, beneath nearly 4 kilometers of ice lies Lake Vostok, a huge hidden freshwater lake directly below the coldest place on earth. This water has been cut off from air and sunlight for up to 25 million years. Biologists are eager to explore its depths and find out what unusual organisms might live there. Geologists and glaciologists are also very interested. For the past two years, researchers worldwide have been planning how to uncover the lake's secrets. If successful, the coming years could be known as the decade of Lake Vostok.

**Scientists**

There was an interesting discussion on the radio last week. It seems that a group of scientists is debating what motivates them to pursue science. The phrase ""because it's there"" comes to mind. We all know it's the timeless quest for knowledge and the desire to understand everything from atoms to black holes. But these scientists are curious about why we want to know all this in the first place and why science can't explain our curiosity. Surely, it's more important to consider whether what scientists are doing is right, rather than getting caught up in debates about the purpose of it all. I believe the key issue is not why we pursue science, but recognizing that science is a tool, and we should decide how, where, when, and why to use it."
CPE_42,"**Food**

Our connection with food is basic and deeply satisfying. Many people who love cooking might already agree with this, as they often buy cookbooks like this one. We sometimes think that cooking is only worth it for special occasions or complex dishes, but that's not true. You can make a delicious soup just by putting some roughly chopped carrots, a leek, celery, and a few herbs into water. This is much more rewarding than buying a packet or opening a can. Instead of purchasing a chocolate mousse filled with preservatives and additives, you can make a delightful dessert in five minutes that both adults and children will enjoy. Cooking is also a way to show care and love by bringing your own creation, no matter how simple, to the table. Sharing food is rich in symbolism and meets our deepest human needs, which is why all our celebrations, like birthdays, anniversaries, and engagements, happen around tables. No one would have a takeaway for a wedding or anniversary party, and few would discuss a business deal over canned soup.

**In the Elevator**

This morning, Alistair tried to tidy up his office, but papers were still everywhere. Tax forms were overflowing from desk drawers and boxes, waiting for a day when he felt like filing. Owning an apartment building added even more paperwork. Books and journals were piled near the new bookshelves. As the elevator took him to his floor, he knew Mallory would be punctual for their meeting. She would knock on his office door exactly on time. She was as precise about time as she was about cleanliness. How would she react to the mess? She might think his office had been vandalized. He could pretend to be shocked when he walked in behind her. Mrs. Wilson, his cleaning lady, arrived while he was trying to clear some space on the carpet. He smiled at her hopefully as she unlocked his apartment door. Her expression was firm, indicating she had no intention of cleaning his office. She believed he was like a visitor from another world, far removed from her own familiar streets of Brooklyn.

**KAREN**

Karen's simple wish not to be like her mother led her to create her own story, a story of difference and strength. In her personal tale, there were key moments, like when she was twelve and her brother accidentally hit her in the eye with a golf club. At first, she thought she was blind, but the bone protected her, as the doctor later assured her. The club missed her eye, leaving only a few stitches that healed as a reminder of past pain. When she opened her eyes in the doctor's office and saw her mother talking about miracles and small mercies, she realized she was saved for a purpose.

**Miss Fogerty**

Miss Fogerty, walking quickly across the wet grass of the village green, felt both excited and sad about what she had just seen. It's thrilling to be the first to know something important, especially in a small community, and Miss Fogerty's quiet life had little excitement. However, she was deeply saddened by Dr. Bailey's condition. He had been her doctor for many years, and she appreciated his care during her annual bouts of laryngitis, which were her only health issues. His most valuable quality, she thought, was making patients feel he had plenty of time and genuinely wanted to hear their concerns. This quality made him beloved in the village. He was always willing to give his time, knowledge, and humor, and in return, he received loyalty and affection."
CPE_59,"Joanna MacGregor is a busy concert pianist, yet she has taken on the task of writing books for young children learning the piano. Her performances are captivating, showcasing her incredible skill and energy. At a recent concert for children, after playing a wide range of music styles, a young boy asked her to play the theme from ""Match of the Day."" For Joanna, this was amusing, and she easily fulfilled the request, understanding that in the boy's eyes, this was the true test of her abilities.

Joanna is unique among top pianists because she is deeply interested in how young children learn the piano. She has published a piano tutor for children called ""Joanna MacGregor's Piano World,"" despite her demanding schedule. She is involved in numerous festivals, collaborates with young composers, runs her own recording label, and is always eager to start new projects with other artists. So why add writing a book to her list of activities? Joanna believes that the first lessons in music are crucial. She feels that the music profession often focuses too much on creating child prodigies, while most people's interest in music is more everyday and accessible.

Her experience teaching beginners and growing up in a home where her mother taught piano to children of all backgrounds has shaped her approach. She believes everyone should have the chance to learn the piano, just like learning to swim or speak a little French. Some children progress quickly, but she is particularly interested in those who take their time and enjoy the process, even if they eventually stop. She worries that some parents push their children to achieve in music, rather than letting them enjoy it.

Joanna's books aim to make learning fun and engaging. They include storylines and CDs with accompaniments in various styles, so children can enjoy playing along. She emphasizes the importance of improvisation and exploring the piano. As children progress, they need encouragement to read music rather than just play by ear. Joanna understands this challenge, as she relied on her ear during her own childhood. However, she believes practice is the key to improvement. She didn't practice rigorously until she attended the Royal Academy of Music, where she developed a contemporary repertoire that required it. Now, she values practice as the core of her musical life, even more than performances.

Joanna advises that whether practicing for twenty minutes or five hours, it's important to have clear goals. She suggests rewarding yourself by playing through a piece, regardless of mistakes, and mixing difficult pieces with easier ones."
CPE_54,"**Writing by Hand and on Screen**

Dr. Johnson once said that writing without effort is often not enjoyable to read. This suggests that good writing is challenging. When I look back at my handwritten school essays, I notice there were few mistakes. Today, I would rewrite them many times. I think this is because writing by hand was physically demanding, which made me think more carefully. The slow pace of handwriting disciplined my mind. What was hard to change or erase was written with care. In contrast, the ease of using a computer can lead to carelessness. Many writers find that the time spent editing drafts on a computer is similar to the time spent writing by hand. Similarly, emails, unlike handwritten letters, can be emotionally heavy. Some say that emails have revived the art of love letters, with millions being sent where there was once only casual conversation. That's a positive change. At least these emails are written in some form of English and grammar. However, words on a screen can feel monotonous. Writers often don't realize the power of written words and may exaggerate their meaning. Words typed quickly lack the care and personality of handwriting.

**The CD**

I put down my cup and looked at the CD. The case was not impressive, but the shiny disc inside was interesting. ""Wonderful little things, aren't they?"" Mr. Warriston said as he returned to the room. I agreed and carefully handed the disc to him. ""It's amazing they can hold seventy minutes of music,"" he said, as he turned on the hi-fi system. Lights came on, and he pressed a button to open a small drawer. He placed the disc inside and closed it. ""Some people say they sound sterile, but I think they..."" ""Do you have to turn them over, like records?"" I asked. ""What? No,"" Mr. Warriston replied. ""You only play one side."" ""Why?"" I asked. He looked puzzled, then thoughtful. ""You know,"" he said, ""I have no idea. You could have two lasers or just turn it over by hand... hmm."" He smiled at me. ""Yes, good point."" He gestured to my chair. ""Come on, let's get you sitting in the best spot for the stereo effect, eh?"" I smiled, happy to have asked a technical question Mr. Warriston couldn't answer.

**Books versus Electronic Text**

When comparing books and electronic text, author Malcolm Bradbury was right when he said that if matches had been invented after lighters, we'd be amazed by the improvement. Many people, excited by new technology, claim that electronic text is as revolutionary as the invention of printing and that this change is almost complete. They ignore that changes in how we think take generations. This kind of thinking is self-centered, believing our generation is at a historical turning point. For example, a book from 1979 predicted that the 1980s would see the decline of books as we know them. This prediction was wrong. Reading long texts on a screen is often unpleasant, so most people don't do it. Computers encourage people to skim text. Some argue that this leads to new forms of storytelling, but non-linear reading isn't new. Many books, like religious texts and dictionaries, aren't read from start to finish. What's new is that computers don't encourage reading a text in its entirety.

**The Office**

Charles walked into the office, which was perfectly organized. The carpet was clear of the papers that had once covered it, and the desk was the dark wood he remembered from an auction five weeks ago. Neat file-holders were being placed in drawers. Twelve years of trade journals filled the shelves on one wall. Kathleen struggled to close the filing cabinet and then turned to him. ""You need to switch to computers, Charles. This is too much."" ""Hello, Kathleen. This is amazing,"" he said, admiring the room and its antique furniture. He wasn't thinking about adding a computer or any other device, not even a pencil sharpener. ""Simply amazing,"" he said, avoiding the topic of computers. Over the two years he had known her, they had this conversation many times. She couldn't understand why he resisted technology when he was skilled with computers and had even published an important paper on computer-related talents. She had inspired that paper. With a keyboard, she could transform any software into something new and exciting."
CPE_32,"""You don't take sugar, do you?"" his secretary shouted, more as a statement than a question. She had been making Lancelot coffee for months, so she should have known. Her excuse for forgetting was that he wasn't usually supposed to be there. But now, he was there all the time because he realized that staying away would lead to chaos. He thought about how he had gone from being a respected advisor, meeting authors and playwrights over lunch, to a stressed worker trying to prevent disasters, with no parking space when he arrived at work.

""This came,"" she yelled, waving a manila folder before placing it in front of him. ""From that guy in Los Angeles. You said you wanted to see it."" The label read: ""A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert."" Below it, ""An Expanded Synopsis."" Lancelot didn't want to see another synopsis; he wanted a first draft. Ian Cuthbert had received a large advance for this book when Lancelot bought the company. Ian was one of several old friends Lancelot had mistakenly commissioned to write books. Ian was a prime example of how someone with an unpredictable nature becomes even less reliable when given a chance.

Lancelot skipped the introduction, which he had read many times, and looked at the synopsis. He recognized almost every phrase. He closed the folder and set it aside, realizing Ian's manuscript might never come. The synopsis lacked the brilliance Ian was known for and felt like it had lost its conviction. Lancelot remembered stories of a famous author whose last book was published incomplete after his death, with payments made chapter by chapter. But in that case, the payments were for a hypothetical advance that was never given. Ian's advance was huge, a reversal of the usual business practice where authors deliver a manuscript before being paid.

Lancelot, who studied modern languages at Oxford, remembered when Ian was the most promising talent at Cambridge, a place so full of promise it made other places seem unimportant. Ian's peers had taken over British theatre quickly, but Ian's energy made them seem lazy. He wore his coat like a cape and talked about famous French writers as if he had met them. Yet, Ian's creative potential remained untapped. While others succeeded, Ian withdrew further. At the peak of his influence, he was difficult to work with. Appointed to edit an arts magazine, he failed to produce even one issue despite using the budget for twelve. His contract with a fashion magazine resulted in stories about his large salary, which increased in hopes of making him produce more, but he produced nothing. At editorial meetings, Ian was critical and dismissive of others' ideas. Ten years later, he was unreliable even for his own funeral. Lancelot was close to admitting that commissioning ""A World History of the Short"" was a mistake from the start."
CPE_65,"Text: 'The evolution of breakfast in England

Health experts agree that having a good breakfast is very important. However, historically, breakfast is a relatively new concept in England. In medieval times, breakfast was rarely mentioned in literature. There are a few references to travelers eating at dawn before long journeys and to sick people having breakfast for health reasons. But generally, only kings or nobles had breakfast. 

In the sixteenth century, breakfast started to become common for everyone. Some believe this was because food became more available. However, they often overlook other important social changes. For instance, new work patterns might explain why breakfast became more important. People began working set hours, often starting very early. So, having a meal in the morning became necessary and was no longer just for the wealthy.'"
CPE_61,"**Photography**

When a photographer takes a picture, they choose what to include based on their skills, personal views, and cultural influences. This book will explore how these factors shape the style, content, and expression of a photograph, and how viewers interpret these images. For instance, a newspaper reader might think they understand the photos they see. However, instead of accepting the image as it is, we might ask if it truly shows the scene as it was or if it reflects the photographer's perspective. Is the exact moment captured important, or is the photo meant to symbolize something broader about the world?

**More than a Game**

For me, sport is more than just a game. The most successful athletes have complete self-confidence. To succeed, you need to focus entirely on your goal, putting everything else aside. Sport is tough, and no one will do it for you. It's a matter of survival. Sport has taught me discipline and determination, and it also shows the value of teamwork. My sport allows individual excellence but is also a team effort, requiring a balance between the two. Like life, you can achieve personal success, but you must remember others around you. Sport has given me a lot, not just money. It has opened opportunities and shown me things worldwide that many never see. However, you must sacrifice a lot for these benefits.

**Tuning In**

Some experiences are so vivid that they stand out in our memories. For me, one such moment happened years ago in California. I lay awake, listening to a mockingbird singing beautifully from a hidden spot in the trees. I don't usually have trouble sleeping, but the bird's skill kept me awake. Its complex melodies drew me into a new artistic experience. To follow the bird's patterns, I relied on my knowledge of jazz and Indian classical music. The bird's performance felt like an amazing improvisation. I reacted with awe and delight as each unexpected musical variation came through my window until I finally fell asleep."
CPE_52,"Birds have always been a significant part of human culture, inspiring a range of emotions from love to fear. But what does our fascination with birds reveal about us? Paul Evans explores this idea. 

In a greenhouse, a small brown bird, a wren, is repeatedly hitting the glass. This bird has long been seen as a symbol of omens and messages. Is it trying to communicate something mysterious, or is it simply trapped? Both interpretations could be valid. Wrens have been part of British culture for centuries. In medieval times, people believed the direction a wren flew could predict their luck. Today, images of wrens are common in British homes, showing that even if old beliefs have faded, the wren still holds a place in our hearts. A forest without wrens feels empty and lacking.

This connection to birds is rooted in folklore, which dates back to when humans relied more directly on nature for survival. People developed a cultural language to express the importance of animals. However, cultural views can change, altering how we see these creatures. For instance, in the early 1500s, red kites were common in London and valued as scavengers. But they were later seen as pests and nearly disappeared, except in Wales. Over time, red kites became symbols of conservation and have been reintroduced to restore their numbers.

Our bond with birds goes beyond culture and is linked to human evolution. Early humans watched birds closely for signs of danger, weather changes, and food availability. Birds also connected them to the spiritual world. Our interest in birds reflects our own identity, as we admire their flight, song, and freedom. Some might say these feelings are outdated, but like the appendix or wisdom teeth, they remain part of us, and losing them is painful. This is why birds are now seen as indicators of environmental health. In Britain, 30 bird species are endangered, which is concerning not only for the loss of these birds but also for the cultural heritage they represent. Birds like the skylark, turtle dove, and lapwing symbolize spiritual love, romantic love, and magic. Their decline is a cultural loss, as seen in the works of poets like Shelley and Shakespeare.

Folklore plays a crucial role in our connection to birds. Stories and legends, with their mysterious origins and constant evolution, create a stronger bond with birds than scientific terms can. They evoke feelings and attitudes buried beneath modern life. Whether watching wildlife films or observing birds in our gardens, the joy we feel is not easily explained by science. Birds captivate us in ways we struggle to understand, and the stories we tell about them help us interpret their messages. The wren in the greenhouse creates a link between the present and a distant past, holding its song as it flies into the future, leaving us to ponder its mystery."
CPE_28,"Maps are tools that show how different points and features on the earth's surface relate to each other, mainly through distance and direction. In the past, people often measured distance in terms of time, like ""a day's journey,"" which told more about how easy it was to travel through an area than the actual distance. Direction was less important for travelers who just wanted to know where to go and how far it was. Because of this, written travel guides were popular alongside maps for a long time. Even today, some maps, like those of railway systems, don't always show true directions. Early maps used signs to mark important landmarks, and these signs varied in size to show their importance. The style of these signs depended on the map's purpose and where it was made, so understanding these styles is crucial when studying old maps.

The history of map-making, or cartography, is about improving the accuracy of distance and direction and making maps more detailed. Cartography has used other sciences to help with this. For example, instead of using shadows or stars to find direction, people started using the magnetic compass, which allowed for more precise measurements. As people explored more of the world, they tried to map it more accurately. Astronomers found out that the earth is slightly flattened at the poles, which led to more precise mapping of large areas.

Over time, the needs of map users changed. Maps were no longer just for travelers and merchants. Soldiers needed accurate maps for artillery use, which required showing the land's surface features accurately. This led to the invention of contour lines. Archaeologists, historians, and modern geographers also had specific needs, leading to new mapping methods for things like geological layers and climate patterns. Today, maps are valued for their ability to help coordinate and interpret information across many sciences, leading to a modern revival in map-making.

However, the development of cartography hasn't been a smooth, continuous process. There have been times of slow progress and times of rapid change, with old ideas sometimes persisting alongside new ones. Cartographers often knew what needed to be done but had to wait for better tools to implement their ideas. Since making a map by copying an old one is easy, and because of the investment in printing, map publishers have sometimes resisted new ideas. Therefore, maps should not be taken at face value as evidence of the knowledge and techniques of their time. The many maps we have today are the result of much human effort and thought, making them a valuable record of human history. This is what makes the study of historical cartography so interesting and educational."
CPE_35,"TIM RICE

I was invited into a young man's drawing room, a calm and cultured space amidst a chaotic cluster of rooms where the less ambitious family members lived. Moving from the kitchen to his parlour felt like upgrading from economy to business class. This room housed the largest collection of records I had ever seen, the first stereo record player and tuner I had encountered, and the surprising evidence that a teenager had invested in Georgian wine glasses, pictures, and furniture. His name was Andrew Lloyd Webber. He had won a scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford, to study history, and had nine months before starting, during which he planned to become England's answer to the composer Richard Rodgers. My own dreams were just as wild; I wanted to be a pop star for the usual reasons: women, money, and fame. The difference between Andrew and me was that my dreams weren't a matter of life or death, though it's easy to say that now. They might have been if I had failed. So, when Andrew suggested a new crazy ambition for me—to become as famous a lyricist as Oscar Hammerstein—I had no hesitation in trying. This was partly because within ten minutes of meeting, he played me three tunes he had composed—I could tell he was very talented. As he confidently played selections from the many shows he had written and produced at school, I was reminded of the best show albums from my parents' LP collection. He needed a new lyricist for the outside world. I had little to impress him with, other than instant praise for his music and a genuine, released seven-inch single of a song I had written (both words and music) that an unknown pop group had recorded three months earlier, ending their failing career. We parted, promising to meet again and write something together. I was still more interested in the music charts than in West End theatre, but on the bus back to my flat, I told myself I had just met someone with rare talent and determination, and I would be foolish to miss the chance to work with someone who was clearly going to make a big impact on musical theatre, probably very soon. And even if we didn't succeed in challenging the top musical composers, we could try to compete with the Beatles and Rolling Stones later in the summer. The Everly Brothers had just made a comeback and would likely need new material. The next day, back at my desk in the office where I was training to become a solicitor, the brief certainty I had felt about a life in show business with Andrew Lloyd Webber had faded somewhat. I would, of course, continue to look at the small ads in Melody Maker for groups needing a vocalist and would write a few more simple songs that wouldn't reveal the limitations of my voice, but it was still likely that I would eventually pass my exams and become a respectable lawyer by the time I was twenty-five. By then, I would surely have outgrown pop music, as my father confidently predicted I would by the time I was twenty-one. This was worrying—if he was right, I only had a few more months to enjoy it. But in the meantime, I felt I had nothing to lose by seeing Andrew again. It would be fun to see a musical with him and to write lyrics that imitated musical lyricists rather than pop stars. Andrew was a fascinating person who talked about Good Food Guides and Victorian architecture, besides supporting Leyton Orient football team. I wasn't convinced by the idea for a musical he had been working on for the past year, but in 1965, I was rarely convinced about anything. His talent was undeniable, and he claimed to have all the contacts. I was soon back in his drawing room. The idea was about the life of Dr. Thomas Barnardo, the nineteenth-century philanthropist who founded the orphanages that bear his name. His story was indeed worthy, but it didn't truly inspire me. The hero was too perfect, at least in Andrew's version of his life, and the project was unoriginal in both concept and execution, owing too much to Lionel Bart's hit show, Oliver. On the other hand, Andrew's belief in his score's brilliance was infectious and not entirely unjustified. What did I know about musicals? As David Land, who later became my agent for over twenty-five years, memorably (and repeatedly) said, if there's a demand for one hamburger bar on the block, there's room for two. We could be the second hamburger joint. I set to work with great enthusiasm, especially for the songs meant to be funny. Andrew outlined the plot, played me the tunes, and often gave me the title as well, most of which had likely been thought up by his former school friend who had already tried. I skipped a day at the solicitor's office, pretending to be ill, to write my first batch of theatrical lyrics. I didn't know it that day, but I had changed careers."
CPE_5,"**Language**  
Humans have an amazing ability: we can influence each other's thoughts with great accuracy through language. Language is so integral to our lives that it's hard to imagine living without it. If you see two or more people together anywhere in the world, they are likely to start talking. Even when alone, people often talk to themselves, their pets, or even their plants. I like to think of language as an 'instinct'. This suggests that people know how to speak in a way similar to how spiders know how to spin webs. Spiders didn't learn web-spinning from a genius spider or need special training; it's a natural ability.

**Climate and Weather**  
Climate and weather, mainly created by the air around us, have a big impact on where animals and plants live. Climate can greatly influence the look of landscapes. For instance, warm and wet conditions all year support the growth of tropical jungles, which are rich in species diversity. On the other hand, cold and windy areas can only support a few living things. The daily weather patterns that form the climate over time are caused by large air masses rising and mixing, as the atmosphere is always moving. Some of this movement is because the air, being thin, doesn't move as fast as the spinning Earth. However, the sun is a more significant cause of air movement.

**Coffee**  
As a bar-person, I had to serve drinks and, more importantly, make coffee. In Lygon Street, Melbourne, a restaurant's success can depend on its coffee. I went through several days of intense coffee-making training, learning more than I ever wanted to about maintaining the restaurant's shiny espresso machine. I also learned the key steps to making a perfect cappuccino. By the end of the first week, I realized making good coffee wasn't as easy as it seemed, and I thought I might be demoted to cleaning ashtrays. Fortunately, my boss was patient. ""Making coffee is both an art and a science,"" he said, ""and you need time to get the hang of it."""
CPE_41,"**Art on TV**

Why does television often struggle with programs about visual arts? Painting and sculpture seem perfect for TV, as cameras can show an entire artwork and then zoom in on details. However, few TV series successfully capture both the enjoyment and complexity of viewing art. A good example of this issue is Robert Hughes's series ""American Visions,"" which explores American art. Hughes is a reliable critic with a captivating presence, and he had nearly eight hours to introduce British viewers to American art, which is often overlooked by British galleries. I expected the series to focus on major artworks, but it instead explored how American history and culture are reflected in its art and architecture.

**Dealing in Metals**

For 20 years, I worked as an international metals dealer and became known as a speculator. The metals market is less regulated than others. With some luck, a willingness to take risks, and a good understanding of the market, one can make a lot of money. Risk-taking is essential in this industry, which aligns well with a free-market global economy. However, free-trade economists who believed the market would keep metal prices stable have found the opposite. More minerals are being extracted, and raw material costs are dropping. Adjusted for inflation, most metal prices are about half of what they were 20 years ago. Recently, I was asked to investigate claims against a multinational company benefiting from these cheap raw materials.

**Extract from a Holiday Brochure**

Abaco and its offshore cays are part of the 700 islands of the Bahamas, stretching from Florida past the Tropic of Cancer to Cuba. Each island has its own character and offers something unique. To explore the islands and cays of Abaco, a boat is essential. If your accommodation doesn't include one, don't worry. There are plenty of ferries and water-taxis, or you can rent a boat to travel independently. Sailing is the most popular way to get around here. Abaco is called 'The Sailing Capital of the World' for a reason. Its calm, naturally protected waters are perfect for fishing, diving, snorkeling, and swimming. The cays and their beaches stretch for 200 miles like a string of pearls. On land, the lights of the restaurants and cafes in Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay shine brightly at night."
CPE_69,"**Build Your Own Bamboo Bike at the UK's First Workshop**

At the Bamboo Bike Club, run by engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan, you can spend a weekend building your own custom-designed bamboo bike frame. Located in Hackney Wick, east London, this is the only place in the UK where you can take such a course. The atmosphere is lively and fun, quite different from a typical woodwork class.

Bamboo bikes are becoming popular again, with companies like Calfee Design in California and Bamboo Bikes in Yorkshire leading the way. However, their ready-made frames can be expensive, costing around $2,995 or £1,868. James and Ian wanted to make bamboo bikes more affordable and spent years developing their idea in a shed in Brecon, Wales. They realized they didn't just want to sell frames; they wanted to share the joy of making something unique and sustainable. This led to the creation of the Bamboo Bike Club, which they run alongside their full-time jobs—James works with wind turbines, and Ian is a civil engineer.

The course is reasonably priced and includes a custom-designed bike frame and a weekend of bike-building. Participants learn how to select strong bamboo and form joints, starting with the front triangle and then moving to the seat and chain assembly. Alloy tubes are used for parts that need extra strength, like the handlebars and wheel forks. The process involves using jigs, power tools, and design blueprints, which can be challenging for those not used to DIY projects. However, James and Ian are there to help and ensure everything is done correctly.

Most participants enjoy the hands-on experience, and many are engineers. But even if you're not, Ian reassures that mistakes are okay—you can always try again with another piece of bamboo. The bamboo is pre-checked for quality, allowing you to focus on the look of your frame, choosing from plain, black, or mottled bamboo.

On Sunday, the focus is on building the lugs, or wraps, using hemp bindings and epoxy resin to create strong joints. A final polymer coating makes the bike waterproof, and then it's ready for wheels, brakes, gears, and other personal touches. The finished bike is strong and durable, comparable to metal bikes. Ian has used his for over a year on a 16-mile commute, and James has tested one off-road for three months without damage.

While bamboo bikes might look a bit rough compared to professional frames, they have a unique charm. James and Ian believe this individuality is what makes them special. Personally, I think bamboo bikes are perfect for a relaxed ride rather than racing. I chose a 'Classic English' frame for a smooth, easy-going ride. Bamboo bikes are light and absorb vibrations well, making for a comfortable ride.

The workshops are most rewarding when you finally take your bike on the road. They're light, easy to ride, and a lot of fun. And the best part? The cost is less than £500."
CPE_38,"**Self-help Books**

Dione Reverend was just an editor at Random House in New York when she came across a manuscript by an unknown pop psychologist, Dr. John Gray. She immediately knew it would be a bestseller, and she was right. Dr. Gray is now a multimillionaire, and Dione Reverend has her own company. Dr. Gray's book on improving communication between men and women is a key part of the growing self-help industry. This industry claims to address Americans' desires for self-improvement, while also creating new desires and supporting the New York publishing world. In Britain, the genre is also popular, with many books being published, though many are rejected for being too similar or too niche. Editors focus on marketability, asking questions like, ""How promotable is the author? What's the 'hook'? Is it universal enough?"" According to Reverend, a catchy title is crucial for success.

**Autobiographies**

There is an unspoken agreement between an autobiographer and the reader that the truth will be told. However, this agreement is often not fully kept. Writers might avoid sharing certain actions or thoughts they find too embarrassing or unimportant. Some writers might even invent stories to better convey the truth about themselves, believing that these stories capture their essence more effectively than strict facts. Others might label their work as an autobiography to gain the reader's trust, even if the story is fictional. This can be done without any cynical intent.

**Dashiell Hammett's Detective Stories**

Detective stories have been seen as reflecting the conflicts of late 19th and early 20th-century society. These stories are allegorical, with the crime symbolizing human impulses like lust or greed, and its resolution representing the restoration of order in society. In Hammett's stories, society is restored, but it is shown to be corrupt. The detective and the criminal are two sides of the same coin, understanding each other well. The private detective is both a crook and a competitor, sometimes feeling conflicted about his role.

**Science Writing**

Stephen Jay Gould is considered one of today's greatest scientific essayists. When discussing the art of writing, he emphasized the importance of understanding the culture you are writing about. He believes that only scientists can effectively present science because they understand its community and rules. Gould advises never to underestimate the reader. While you can simplify the language, you should not simplify the argument. Patronizing the reader will ruin the piece."
CPE_17,"**Air-conditioning**

At Cannons Gym, a popular spot for City of London workers during lunch, the air feels very cold. To combat this summer's unusually high temperatures, the gym has used a lot of air-conditioning. In fact, when it's not busy, the gym feels as cold as the Arctic. This is just one example of how modern society often misuses air-conditioning. It has become a key part of both work and leisure, symbolizing humanity's ability to control or change the climate. However, many air-conditioned buildings could use other cooling methods. They could use natural light and ventilation and have thicker walls that absorb less heat during the day and release it at night. These simple measures can be very effective and would greatly reduce the need for air-conditioning.

**Sundials**

It's likely not a coincidence that the start of a new millennium has brought renewed interest in sundials, which measure time based on the sun's position. A hundred years ago, sundials were essential for keeping clocks accurate. But as clocks and watches became more advanced and reliable, sundials became garden ornaments—romantic and intriguing, but outdated in a modern technological age. Now, interest in them is growing again. David Harber, a sundial maker, believes their charm comes from their direct connection to the planets. He says there's a magical moment when a sundial starts working. They are still, calm, and romantic objects that remind us of our place in the universe.

**Paint Your Own China**

My idea of china-painting came from a visit long ago to an arts and crafts show where serious-looking older women showed how to paint delicate flowers on a teacup with precise brushstrokes. It was fascinating because each stroke created a perfect petal or leaf. Their hands were steady, the paint never smeared, and it seemed like these women had either practiced for decades or had a natural talent for precision. Remembering this, I wondered what kind of people would join a china-painting course. Would even beginners show natural artistic skill? In reality, the atmosphere was not intimidating at all. The students were there to have fun, and even the teacher didn't want to paint petals on teacups with the robotic speed I had remembered."
CPE_47,"Uncle arranged a package holiday for Keith and Dawne at a good price: a flight from Gatwick Airport and twelve nights in Venice at the Pensione Concordia. When they went to book the trip, the travel agent mentioned that the other travelers were a school group learning Italian. However, something went wrong. Due to a mistake at the travel agency, the check-in desk, or a computer, Keith and Dawne ended up in Switzerland at the Edelweiss Hotel, Room 212.

At Gatwick, they gave their tickets to a girl in a yellow-and-red uniform. She confirmed their details and said everything was fine. On the plane, they were surprised to hear people speaking with North of England accents. Keith thought there might have been a cancellation or that the Italian class was on another plane. They ordered drinks and relaxed.

When they landed, a woman with glasses told everyone to stay together. There was no mention of an overnight stop in the brochure, but Keith assumed it was part of the plan. Tired and not wanting to argue, they accepted the beds offered to them. The next morning, they realized they were staying there for the entire holiday and became worried.

The receptionist explained they could enjoy the lake and take a steamer to Interlaken. Keith calmly explained there was a mistake; they were supposed to be in Venice. The receptionist didn't know about any mistake. Dawne described the travel agent who booked their trip, hoping it would help.

A woman named Mrs. Franks, who they had seen at Gatwick, approached them. Dawne asked if she was in charge because they were in the wrong hotel. Mrs. Franks explained that Your-Kind-of-Holiday offers many trips, and all tickets and labels look similar. She laughed, saying they couldn't end up in a wildlife park by mistake.

Keith insisted they weren't meant to be in Switzerland. Mrs. Franks left them standing there, and the receptionist was gone. Dawne whispered that Mrs. Franks seemed kind, but Keith was lost in thought, trying to remember everything that happened.

An elderly couple, Mr. and Mrs. Nottage, interrupted Keith's thoughts, saying they had a great night's sleep due to the lakeside air. Keith and Dawne left the reception area. Outside, they didn't mention the irony of their situation: on their first holiday since their honeymoon, they ended up on a tour with elderly people, when they wanted to escape the demands of the elderly. Uncle had insisted on this trip, even though they tried to convince him to join them."
CPE_48,"American executives are looking to the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton as a model for good management. Eluned Price reports. In Britain, many people know who Sir Ernest Shackleton was and have a general idea of his achievements. However, in America, he is only now being recognized, despite the Wall Street Journal's claim that Shackleton was an Antarctic explorer whose feats were largely unnoticed for most of the 20th century. Now, Americans are showing great enthusiasm for him. Biographies and accounts of his voyage on the Endurance are being produced and are expected to sell quickly. The American Museum of Natural History is planning a major exhibition, and Columbia Tristar is making a film about Shackleton's life. Some American managers have also adopted Shackleton as a role model. They admire his actions and draw lessons in leadership and communication from his story, referring to each other as ""speaking Shackleton."" The determined and resourceful Shackleton, with his reindeer sleeping bag and blubber-stove, has become a model for modern management consultants. Jim MacGregor, managing partner of Abernathy MacGregor Frank in New York, has used Shackleton as a role model for years. His firm specializes in communication during mergers, acquisitions, and corporate crises, such as when a company's plant explodes or when half the workforce must be laid off. MacGregor believes Shackleton is a model for management because of his leadership and communication skills. Shackleton was at his best when he and his team had a lot to lose, like their lives. One of Shackleton's most fascinating decisions was to turn back when only 97 miles from the South Pole during his 1908 expedition. This decision showed his credibility for future expeditions, as he prioritized the lives of his men. In a crisis, people want to know someone is in charge. While many managers today avoid responsibility, Shackleton was willing to take it on. His 1914 expedition became legendary when his ship, the Endurance, was trapped and crushed by ice. Shackleton assured his men they would reach safety if they trusted him and did their best. From their accounts and diaries, it's clear Shackleton was always in charge. He planned for every possibility, kept his men informed, and sought their opinions. He was adaptable and willing to start fresh when needed. Shackleton believed an explorer needs optimism, physical endurance, and patience. MacGregor notes that in desperate situations, doing nothing can be the hardest thing, especially in America, where people are eager to act quickly. If you buy bonds and guess wrong on interest rates, holding on can eventually recover your money, while selling would mean a big loss. Similarly, don't be afraid to change plans if they're not working. Shackleton led by example. On the return voyage from the Endurance, he noticed the expedition photographer, Hurley, was gloveless and forced his own gloves on him, threatening to throw them overboard if Hurley didn't wear them. He did something similar with a biscuit during the 1905 expedition when they were near starving, showing his selflessness. Caroline Alexander, author of ""Endurance,"" says the public's appetite for heroic endeavors is growing, and Shackleton stands out as a genuine embodiment of the ideals we long for today."
CAE_15,"In the forests of Madagascar, there is a primate called the aye-aye that has a unique way of finding food, similar to a woodpecker. Both the woodpecker and the aye-aye search for insect larvae hidden in wood. The woodpecker uses its beak to drill into the wood and its long tongue to catch the insects. The aye-aye, however, uses its sharp incisor teeth to gnaw into the wood and its long, thin third finger to reach and scoop out the insects.

Although scientists described the aye-aye's feeding method over a hundred years ago, they have only recently discovered how it finds the insects inside the wood. Dr. Carl Erickson from Duke University studied the hunting skills of some captive aye-ayes named Nosferatu, Poe, Samantha, and her daughter Annabelle. He tested if they found insects by looking for visual signs, like holes on the wood surface where insects might have entered. He gave them logs with drilled holes, some leading to mealworms and others to empty spaces. The aye-ayes went directly to the mealworm cavities, showing they didn't rely on visual clues.

Dr. Erickson also tested if the aye-ayes used smell or sound to find the insects. Even when the smell was blocked or the insects were dead and silent, the aye-ayes still located them. It turned out that the aye-ayes could sense the cavities themselves. They tap the wood with their middle finger and use their large ears to listen for echoes that indicate a hollow space. They might also hear insects moving when disturbed by the tapping.

The idea that aye-ayes take the place of woodpeckers in Madagascar is interesting, but there are birds like the Sickle-billed and Nuthatch Vangas that also search for insects in wood. So, the woodpecker role might not be entirely empty. The aye-aye is not only like a woodpecker and an echo-locating bat but also behaves like a squirrel. Its incisors grow continuously like a squirrel's, and it has been seen in the wild gnawing through nut shells and using its long finger to extract the nut meat."
CAE_19,"Text: 'Ordinary people, ordinary lives Most of us have photos of our grandparents, but how many of us know what their lives were like when they were young? Diaries give us small, incomplete glimpses, and family stories are often only half remembered. What will our grandchildren know about us? We often plan to write things down but never do. We might leave videos instead of photos, but those are still just images. Hannah Renier has a solution: she writes autobiographies for other people, creating a hardback book of at least 20,000 words, with illustrations if wanted. These books are not about famous people, but about ordinary ones. The idea came to her when she talked to her family and realized how much of the past was disappearing. ""When I started, I didn't take it as seriously as I do now,"" she says. ""I've met people who have led interesting lives. They say they do it for their children or for the future, but they also enjoy it themselves."" The promise of confidentiality helps people be honest. ""I had the confidence to be honest,"" says a 62-year-old man who made and lost a fortune before making another. ""I was surprised at what came out. Some things were painful, like my divorce, and the pain was still there."" ""I did it for my family, so they might learn something, but I haven't let my children read it yet. They were hurt by things in my life, and there are details I don't want them to know right now. If they insist, I'll let them. But I'd rather they read it after I'm gone."" He also saw patterns from his childhood that led to repeated mistakes. Ms. Renier has noticed this in others too. ""It's amazing how many people are influenced by their parents,"" she says. ""The things parents say and do in childhood affect people for the rest of their lives. They repeat behaviors, marry people their parents would approve of, or rebel against them."" ""Many disappointments come out. Even sixty years later, people regret or resent things unresolved with their parents. There's no age of reason. If people had issues in their youth, they still have them in middle age. They try to impress a parent who wasn't impressed, and if that fails, some seek permission to say 'I can't stand my mother.'"" Ms. Renier is more of a recorder than an inquisitor, keeping her distance. ""It's not for the public, and I'm not there to be nosy. People sometimes tell me things and then say, 'I'm not sure if that should go in.' I include it anyway—they can remove it when they see the draft. But generally, people want to be honest, warts and all."" ""It's not vanity publishing. It's not people saying, 'I've had such an interesting life, the world needs to know.' Things are changing faster than ever, and we're losing sight of the past. It's a way to connect with our roots. We need a link to our ancestors because families don't sit together as they used to. People want a little immortality."" Each book involves up to 30 hours of recorded interviews, which Ms. Renier uses to write the life story, rearranging and interpreting the events. Modern technology allows her to produce everything except the binding with its gold lettering: you can choose your own color and title. Fascinating to the private audience each book is for, the results are not about exposing secrets. Ms. Renier organizes her material logically and writes well, so the final content is as good as its subject. The book looks high-quality and costs nearly £3,000, with extra copies at £25 each. She gets about 10 inquiries a week, but the cost, due to the time involved, deters many people. ""I thought it would be a more affordable product,"" she says. ""But the people I've worked with are all from well-off backgrounds, readers of Harpers & Queen, where I advertise. They're the kind of people who would have had their portraits painted for their descendants.""'"

The Museum of Classical Archaeology is one of the few places in the world where you can see a large collection of casts of Greek and Roman sculptures, with over six hundred pieces. It's important to note that none of the sculptures are original; they are all precise replicas made from the originals, mostly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The museum is located in a specially designed gallery with great natural light. The benefit of these plaster casts is that sculptures originally displayed together but now separated across different museums in Europe can be seen together as they were meant to be. You can view nearly all the famous Greek and Roman sculptures in just one afternoon.

The University has its own aircraft at Cambridge Airport and conducts photographic work throughout Great Britain. The photographs are interesting as they provide a detailed, year-by-year record of the landscape, showing both natural features and human impact from prehistoric times to today. There is a small display in the entrance hall, and the knowledgeable library staff can help with inquiries. The photographs cannot be borrowed, but copies can be ordered and usually take about a month to produce.

**E. Cambridge Medieval Brass Rubbing Centre**  
The Cambridge Brass Rubbing Centre is the second oldest and longest-running center of its kind in the world, and it's a unique tourist attraction in the region. Visitors can enjoy creating wall hangings by rubbing one of over a hundred different brass plates from the tombs of medieval knights and ladies. By making resin copies, known as facsimiles, the center preserves the originals while allowing everyone to enjoy brass rubbing. Brass plates, used as an alternative to tomb statues, spread from Germany across medieval Europe and Scandinavia. Many were destroyed during various revolutions, but most of the surviving brasses are in Britain, and the Cambridge Centre has the widest range of examples."
CAE_13,"**From Here to Paternity**

**A. The Theatre Director**

I've had 35 years of raising young children due to my unusual personal life, and I've loved every moment. This morning, I fed the baby, and to me, that's what being a father is all about. I'm very lucky with my children; we all enjoy opera, theatre, books, and music, which has created a strong bond. Now that they're mostly grown, I've become more of a friend than a father. I don't believe in physical punishment. I've slapped my children in anger before, but I don't support it. I may not have been the most attentive father, but I've always tried to be available. I'm here if they need me, but I let them contact me. If you start chasing them to ask why they haven't been in touch, it creates a burden of guilt. My parents did that to me, and I would never do it to my children.

**B. The Advertising Executive**

I was young, about 25, when my children were born, and I found the responsibilities challenging. It made me feel older quickly, but it also kept me young, which I value. As they became teenagers, they introduced me to music, youth culture, and fashion, which has been invaluable for running the agency. I never felt out of touch. I missed some events like first concerts and sports days because I was busy building my business, which makes me sad. But now, I can take them on holidays to the south of France. They get along well with our friends and join us at parties and advertising award ceremonies without feeling intimidated. I think it's an advantage that they see my work as glamorous and interesting.

**C. The Politician**

My first child was born just as I was about to be elected to the Greater London Council, and the others came soon after. My wife and I promised to make time for them, but as I became more politically active, time became a problem. I only accept weekend meetings and public appearances if there are facilities for the kids to come with me. This way, they understand what I do when I'm not with them, and there's no feeling of me disappearing. I've noticed more MPs bringing their kids to the House. Maybe we're all becoming more aware of the need to involve our children in our lives.

**D. The Writer**

My first marriage ended when Kate and Bonnie were young, so I had to think more about fatherhood. I made great efforts to stay in touch with them. My ex-wife and I even tried living next door to each other so the kids could come and go as they wished, but Kate and Bonnie found it confusing. Kate has said in interviews that I was always there for her, but I'm not sure I was a very good father. I was around a lot, but like many parents in the Seventies, I treated the kids as adults too soon. Kate recently complained that we were too liberal. I think I could have introduced more structure. I regret that now. I still worry about my older daughters as much as my youngest. In that way, your kids never leave you.

**E. The TV Presenter**

I was ready for kids. I was 30, met my wife, and we had a lovely house, so we thought, ""Why keep spending money on new sofas when we could have a child instead?"" Having my daughter Betty has made me understand who I am. You feel special when you have a child, and you are, but you're also just one more parent in a long line. It's a great equalizer. I sometimes resent it, but any irritation disappears with just one look at her. A baby's smile is the greatest way to melt a grown man."

CAE_46,"Title: 'Science Defying Gravity'

Journalist Tom Mumford joins students testing their theories in weightlessness. From the outside, it looked like a regular aircraft. The pilot informed the young passengers that it was a Boeing KC-135 refueling tanker, built in 1964, based on the Boeing 707. However, the inside was transformed into a long white tunnel with few windows, lit by lights along the padded walls. Most seats were removed, leaving a few at the back where 13 students from Europe and America sat, looking nervous. They had spent a year competing with other students to join this flight, a challenge by the European Space Agency to propose creative experiments in weightless conditions. The best ideas earned a spot on this unique flight, which was like an extraordinary roller-coaster ride.

For two hours, the Boeing would fly like a giant bird, soaring up and then diving down. The goal was to create a weightless state at the top of each curve. At 3,000 meters, the pilot cut the engines, and the plane continued upward by momentum before gravity pulled it back down. In those few silent seconds between rising and falling, everything inside became weightless, and the students felt closer to the moon than Earth.

The takeoff was smooth, but any illusion of a normal flight vanished when the pilot put the plane into a steep 45-degree climb for about 20 seconds. The engines roared, blood rushed from our heads, and bodies were scattered across the cabin floor. Then the engines cut out, and weightlessness was almost immediate. For 20 seconds, we floated in silence: the floor felt like a trampoline, and a single step sent us towards the ceiling. We drifted aimlessly; directions like left, right, up, or down lost meaning. Only gravity, by anchoring us, allows us to understand movement.

After ten seconds of freefall, the pilot pulled the plane out of its dive. Gravity's return was less sudden than its loss, but still abrupt enough to cause some students to land with a thud. With the first curve done, some students turned pale at the thought of 29 more. Thirty curves meant ten minutes of 'space time' for experiments. Dutch students studied their robotic cat, Leonardo, to understand how cats always land on their feet. They released the device, and one student managed to turn it belly-down using radio controls. However, during the next curve, another student accidentally landed on it.

Nearby, a German team from the University of Aachen studied how metal joins are affected by the lack of gravity, important for future space station construction. Another team from Utah State University explored creating solar sails from thin liquid films hardened by ultraviolet sunlight. They spent the flight trying to produce these films in microgravity, believing that perfected solar sails could use the sun's radiation like a yacht uses the wind.

After two hours of swinging between heaven and Earth, breakfast felt unsettled, but the main feeling was exhilaration, not nausea. This sensation would last a long time. ""It was an unforgettable experience,"" said one student. ""I already wanted to become an astronaut, but now I want to even more."""
CAE_3,"Jonathon Porritt, author of ""Seeing Green - The Politics of Ecology,"" shares his unique experience of spending nine consecutive winters in New Zealand. He traveled there every summer from the UK, which is winter in New Zealand, and enjoyed the cold season. His parents bought a small piece of land near Auckland for him and his siblings to manage. They were encouraged to plant trees on it, giving them a lasting connection to New Zealand, where their father grew up.

The land, located in Rangitoupuni, was not very fertile but suitable for tree planting. Jonathon, who had experience working on farms in Australia, was excited about the project. He began planting trees in 1968, and by 1972, he and his siblings had planted all 70 acres. Despite the constant rain and cold during that first winter, Jonathon remembers it as a happy time. Each day involved preparing for planting in wet and muddy conditions, which led to deep reflections on life.

An experienced tree-planter helped Jonathon in the beginning. They used a planting bag to carry as many trees as possible, and the hardest part was keeping the planting lines straight. Once the lines were set, planting became a rhythmic process. This repetitive work allowed Jonathon to think deeply about the natural world, sparking ideas that influenced his later life.

Jonathon has returned to New Zealand four times to see the trees grow, which he finds very rewarding. He worries about natural disasters affecting the trees but is pleased they are now thriving after 20 years. In 1984, he took a break from teaching to spend three months alone on the tree farm, where he wrote his first book, ""Seeing Green."" The simple cabin on the farm became his writing retreat. This place holds a strong connection for Jonathon, symbolizing the bond between people and the land."
CAE_10,"Text: 'BRINGING UP BADGERS'

When one of my helpers handed me a cardboard box, my first thought was, ""What now?"" My husband Derek and I had turned our dairy farm in Somerset into an 'open farm' six years ago, and we had become known for caring for orphaned animals. The noise from the box—a mix between a cackle and a bark—was unfamiliar to me. Curious, I looked inside and found three small grey badger cubs, each about eight inches long. Their coats, which later turned out to have fleas, felt like velvet, and their milky eyes looked up at me from their tiny black-and-white striped heads. I had never seen badger cubs before. Most are born between mid-January and mid-March and spend their early life underground. If orphaned, they usually die of starvation and are never found. These three were brought in by building contractors who accidentally dug into their sett while laying drain pipes. The mother was found dead with her babies still nursing. The cubs were healthy but cold and whimpering. After removing their fleas, I took them into the farmhouse kitchen and placed them by the stove for warmth. There were two females, Primrose and Bluebell, and a male, Willow. At first, I fed them with a syringe, but I had to wipe each cub with a warm cloth to mimic the mother's licking, which helped them relieve themselves. For the first few days, they were fed every four hours. Within a week, they were drinking from a bottle and moving around, though unsteadily. With each other for company and a heated pad as a substitute 'mum,' they seemed content. 

Three weeks later, I noticed Willow was lethargic, though he was still eating normally. It was a warning sign I didn't recognize, and the next morning, I found him dead. The vet's post-mortem revealed Willow had died from a lung infection. When bottle-feeding any animal, it's important not to let it drink too fast, as liquid can enter the lungs. In Willow's case, this caused an infection that would have been hard to treat, even with antibiotics, in such a small animal. Disheartened by my failure, I continued caring for the others. Then, six days later, a local farmer who heard about our cubs brought me another male cub he found abandoned. The area had been disturbed too much, and the cub was cold and hungry. We named him Willow II. At six weeks, he was about two weeks younger than the females, and I soon discovered why his mother left him. He was very difficult to feed. I had to keep moving the bottle's teat around in his mouth and squeezing it to get him to drink. After ten minutes, he would finally latch on as if he hadn't drunk all day. By the end of April, the females were weaned onto creamed rice and then anything else. Willow was different. He was happy to give up the bottle but couldn't eat without walking through his food, tipping it over, or sitting in it. Eventually, I offered him a sausage, which he slowly chewed, played with, and finally ate. After a week of sausages, he was ready to try other foods. 

At nearly five months old, they were all eating cereals for breakfast, a meat and vegetable meal for lunch, and fruit, nuts, cheese, hard-boiled eggs, and sunflower seeds in the evening. Badgers usually eat 60% earthworms, plus beetles, bugs, baby rabbits, mice, voles, and even plant shoots or roots. My badgers were better off than others that year; the summer was very hot, making it hard to dig for earthworms. By August, my foundlings had become nocturnal and would only go for walks at dusk or late at night. We often walked through the cider orchard, where the cubs would get excited, fluff up their fur to look like snowballs, and chase each other's tails. As 'human badgers,' we were part of this game. I learned to avoid their playful nips, but Derek, who joined us less often, never did and sometimes reacted colorfully to being caught. During these late-night walks in the dry period, I saw other badgers in our field. They were likely expanding their territories to find food, as badgers are very territorial and will kill intruders. We were warned they might climb into our badger pen and harm the cubs, so we covered the gate with sheet metal to keep it secure. The local press took pictures of me walking the badgers, and the response was so great that we started an appeal to build a sett on the farm for them. With advice, we designed a new home for the badgers. Our son Daniel drew up the plans, and we built a sett with tunnels, an enclosure, and a badger gate facing their usual walking direction. It had three chambers, one larger than the others, with a glass side for viewing from a darkened enclosure. As the sett took shape, the badgers explored it before their walks. Eventually, they forgot about the walks, excited by the tunnels and arranging bedding. The building cost more than expected, but a local bus company, Badgerline, sponsored part of the appeal, and local firms donated materials. Everyone wanted to see the badgers with a home of their own. One evening, they finally moved in. After watching them for a while, we left them to settle. Half an hour later, I returned to find them curled up asleep in their chambers. These days, I don't walk with them as often, especially since they wake up at midnight. We see Primrose occasionally, as she has joined a neighboring sett, but Bluebell and Willow II still greet us before rushing off into the night. This is their territory now, a place they know well and a home they have accepted."
CAE_67,"Text: 'In search of true north - and the man behind Halley's comet Dr. Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, plans to follow Sir Edmund Halley's journey to map compass variations. Anjana Ahuja reports. Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) is famous for the comet named after him. However, one of his major achievements was mapping 'compass variations' during his sea voyages on the warship Paramore. These variations, now called 'declination', refer to the angle between magnetic north and true north. Without understanding declination, sailors couldn't accurately correct their compasses, making it difficult to determine longitude and navigate the seas. Halley, one of the few people paid to do scientific research at the time, set out for the Cape Verde Islands to map declination in the North and South Atlantic. The first trip was cut short due to crew issues, but Halley tried again. This second voyage took him to Rio de Janeiro, South Georgia, Newfoundland, and back to England. From these travels, Halley published a 'New and Correct Chart showing the Variations of the Compass in the Western and Southern Oceans' in 1701. This chart and its later versions were crucial for sailors for over a century until changes in Earth's magnetic field made them outdated. Dr. Clark, an enthusiastic sailor, wants to honor Halley's achievements by retracing the Paramore's route for its three-hundredth anniversary. He needs to raise £70,000 for the journey, and Sir Vivian Fuchs, known for leading the first cross-Antarctica expedition, is supporting him. Dr. Clark became interested in Halley during a two-year stay at Halley Station in Antarctica, where he read about the scientist's life. 'Halley led a remarkable life,' Dr. Clark says. 'He was a respected scientist and explorer. He wasn't just an astronomer; he also did geophysics research. As Astronomer Royal, he mapped stars and pursued other interests.' During this time, Halley invented a diving bell and advised Sir Isaac Newton on his Principia Mathematica, a key work in classical physics. Dr. Clark believes recreating the voyage will give Halley the recognition he deserves. The expedition, called 'In the Wake of the Paramore', will also have scientific value. It will involve taking the same measurements Halley did, but with more accurate instruments. These measurements are important because Earth's magnetic field is always changing. The data will help improve the international geomagnetic reference field, a model of Earth's magnetic field. 'It's common to measure the size but not the direction of the magnetic field. You need to know true north to measure direction,' says Dr. Clark. 'On our expedition, we can use global positioning satellites for that.' The British Geological Survey and the United States Navy will provide instruments. A Danish satellite will also be taking similar measurements globally. Dr. Clark hopes his data will fill any gaps in the satellite's coverage of the Atlantic Ocean and provide useful ground-based comparisons. It's easy to forget how important Halley's Atlantic journey was. It was the first scientific sea expedition, and Halley was the first civilian naval captain focused on declination. Does Dr. Clark have what it takes to succeed in his voyage? Besides his two years in Antarctica and work with the British Geological Survey's geomagnetic group, he has already sailed 13,000 kilometers from Rio de Janeiro to England. He plans to complete the expedition in four stages with different crews. Does he share Halley's passion? 'I'm willing to dedicate eight months of my life to this, so some might say I'm obsessed. But I wouldn't cross the Atlantic again without a good reason. Halley and his fascinating life have given me a real sense of purpose.'"
CAE_27,"Every summer, peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire show off their beautiful tails to the female peahens, who often look at them critically. This behavior puzzled Charles Darwin because, in a world where survival is tough, it seemed strange that birds would evolve such extravagant features. Darwin believed that evolution happened through natural selection, where the fittest individuals survive and reproduce. However, the peacock's tail seemed to be a disadvantage, so Darwin suggested another idea called 'sexual selection.' He thought females chose mates based on beauty alone.

Darwin's friend, Alfred Russel Wallace, disagreed. He believed that if peahens chose the most beautiful males, there must be a practical reason. The males with the best tails might have other qualities that help them survive, even if humans can't see them. Wallace thought the tail was a sign of these hidden qualities.

Today, scientists like Marion Petrie are studying peacocks at Whipsnade to understand this better. They want to know if peahens really prefer males with the showiest tails and if these males have other advantages. Observations suggest that peahens do prefer males with more eye-spots on their tails, which are linked to tail length. However, it's still unclear if these males are better in other ways.

William Hamilton from Oxford University proposed that showy male birds might be healthier and free of parasites, which their plumage could indicate. While this is true for some birds, Petrie and her team haven't been able to test this in Whipsnade peacocks yet. This year, they are comparing the offspring of attractive and less attractive males to see if the former grow faster or are healthier, which would support Wallace's idea.

There's another theory by R.A. Fisher called 'Fisher's Runaway.' It suggests that if females start preferring males with slightly better tails, their offspring will inherit these traits. Over generations, this preference could lead to increasingly extravagant tails, supporting Darwin's idea of 'beauty for beauty's sake.' Modern computer models show that this feedback loop could explain the peacock's tail."
CAE_66,"Text: 'THE BOAT OF MY DREAMS The best boat design should blend old and new, says Tom Cunliffe. He did this with his own boat, 'The Westerman'. This week, the Summer Boat Show in London is full of impressive yachts with the latest technology. Most of these yachts are based on design changes from 25 years ago. In contrast, my boat is quietly moored on a tidal creek on the south coast. It was designed last year, but it looks like it could be 100 years old, making people think I'm a romantic dreamer. Maybe I am, but I doubt it. This boat uses the charm of traditional design, but modern technology made it easier to build. However, while modern technology is essential in today's boat design and building, it often shields sailors from the true experiences of sea life. These are often the experiences they seek when they go to sea. I'm not saying sailors should suffer through every hardship. I always make sure my boats have a coal stove for warmth and dry comfort, and cozy sleeping areas. But why go sailing if every sail operates automatically? Sometimes, dealing with a flapping sail is part of a sailor's life. And why should we give up common sense and move our steering positions from the safe back of the boat to a risky spot halfway to the front? Sadly, this is done to create a cabin as spacious as an ocean liner, with a bed bigger than the one at home. For me, a boat should always be a boat, not a floating cottage. When I bought my previous boat, Hirta, which I sailed around Britain for a TV race series, the previous owner said she had every comfort but no luxury. During my time with her, Hirta showed me how wise he was. Her sails were heavy, and she had no pumped water, no significant electricity, no fridge, no central heating, no winches, and no electronics, especially for navigation, yet she was the kindest, easiest boat I have ever sailed. However, classic boats need a lot of care because they are old. After a serious back injury, I realized my 15-year love affair with her had to end. I couldn't find a suitable younger boat, so I decided to build a new one from scratch. The Westerman has never let me down. Although designer Nigel Irens and his assistant Ed Burnett are skilled with computer design programs, Irens first sketched this boat on a paper napkin and later used the computer. After creating a set of lines, he carved a model, just like in the old days. We reviewed the initial model, then adjusted the design on the computer. The next version was almost perfect, and the final one was just right. The finished boat has crossed the North Atlantic and won four out of her first six races. She looks timeless, moves beautifully at sea, and her interior, made mostly of reclaimed pitch pine, feels peaceful. This might be because she was designed purely as a sailing vessel, without considering any furniture. This is the traditional way of the sea. In her timeless calm, she proves that this method works; that you don't need to follow trends to find satisfaction, and that sometimes it's wise to learn from history. Built with wood treated with a special glue, she is completely waterproof. So, she has all the advantages of a fiberglass boat but looks, feels, and sails like a traditional one.'"

Health farms and country house hotels with spa facilities are thriving. We asked five journalists to review some of these places.

**A. HENLOW GRANGE**

I was thrilled to spend six days at Henlow Grange as I needed a break. My room in the large 18th-century house was extremely comfortable, and I felt relaxed immediately. On the first day, I rested and slept a lot. From the second day, I joined various classes like body conditioning, yoga, and body alignment. The instructors are very skilled, and I felt more flexible as the week went on. They offer many treatments, including aromatherapy, seaweed baths, manicures, and pedicures. The hour-long facial made me feel rejuvenated. The staff were friendly and professional, creating an energetic and enthusiastic atmosphere. Henlow plans to renovate, adding a half-size Olympic pool and a Light Diet Room. You can also ride bicycles around the grounds or enjoy a peaceful walk in the garden. My mood and appetite improved during my stay, and I left feeling energized. This is an ideal getaway for a stressed working woman. Save Room 5 for me! - Marcella D'Argy Smith

**B. SHRUBLAND HALL**

The calm atmosphere of this stately home was clear as soon as I entered. The Hall has a beautifully decorated library, a lovely conservatory, and plenty of space for solitude. Upon arrival, everyone gets a medical check-up, including weight and blood pressure. We were called patients, which felt odd since I was healthy. However, a shoulder issue was found during the check-up and addressed in group workshops and a personal session. Each person follows a specific diet. I lost weight without fasting but had a headache on the second day from hunger. My daily menu included grapefruit and honey for breakfast, salads for lunch, and exotic fruit with yogurt and broth for dinner. If not fasting, you eat in the main dining hall, where the food is tasty. Massages or water therapy are given on alternate days, and extra treatments are reasonably priced. - Liz Gregory

**C. CAREYS MANOR**

Careys is not a health farm but a charming old manor with cozy log fires and a spacious lounge. If you're watching your weight, you might skip the gourmet food, which includes rich sauces and creamy desserts made by the French chef. Luckily, there's a gym and pool to burn off the calories. You can choose a health-conscious diet if you want to lose weight. The spa includes a bath, steam room, Swiss shower, sauna, and treatment rooms. A highlight is the sports injury clinic, where I got advice on an old shoulder injury. The physiotherapist suggested good posture, exercises, and massage. Careys is both comfortable and luxurious, relaxed and calm. If you want to explore, the surrounding countryside is beautiful. - Beverly D'Silva

**D. CLIVEDEN**

Cliveden is a grand country home and a five-star hotel that treats guests like royalty. It offers health and beauty treatments, a gym, saunas, a pool, tennis, horse riding, and more. The 376-acre National Trust estate has beautiful woodland walks and gardens. Waldo's, a renowned restaurant, offers a menu that took me half an hour to read. The meal was fantastic, especially the sticky-toffee pudding with banana ice cream. I went to bed happy! The next morning, I spent time in the gym to burn off calories before my next meal. In the Pavilion, I enjoyed a facial with essential oils and an aromatherapy massage. Cliveden offers fitness assessments, workouts, and beauty treatments if you want them before indulging at Waldo's. - Kay Letch

**E. SPRINGS HYDRO**

The best and worst thing about Springs Hydro is the carrot cake. It's delicious but has 360 calories, which isn't great if you're trying to lose weight. You've been warned! The second best thing is the aromatherapy massage. I chose relaxing oils, fell asleep twice during the massage, and had a refreshing night's sleep. The modern facilities are efficiently run, with luxurious bedrooms. There are many therapists and beauty rooms, so scheduling appointments is easy. They offer a variety of treatments, from manicures to deep-cleansing facials. Guests range from football teams to mothers and daughters, friends, and singles. Ideally, I'd visit once a month. - Eve Cameron"
CAE_22,"**NATURAL TALENTS**

In the seven million years since humans split from chimpanzees, we haven't changed much genetically; we're still over 98% the same as chimps. On the evolutionary timeline, what makes humans different from animals is a recent development. Our biological history suggests that our ability to create art and other uniquely human traits must come from a small part of our genes. This means that the differences between us and animals are mostly small. For instance, both humans and animals use tools: chimpanzees use sticks, and sea otters use rocks. Monkeys have simple language systems with different sounds for different predators like leopards, eagles, and snakes. These findings show that there are few absolute differences between us and animals, except perhaps art.

If human art comes from a unique genetic trait, it's curious that our ancestors didn't create art for most of the time since we diverged from chimps. Early art might have been wood carvings or body painting, but these don't survive over time. Clear evidence of human art appears with the Cro-Magnons around 35,000 years ago, with cave paintings, statues, necklaces, and musical instruments.

If we claim that our recent artistic development sets us apart, we need to consider how our art differs from animal creations. Three main differences are often suggested: human art is non-utilitarian, made for aesthetic pleasure, and learned rather than instinctive.

First, as Oscar Wilde said, ""All art is quite useless."" This means that human art doesn't help us survive or reproduce, unlike most animal behaviors. While human art can communicate ideas, it's not the same as passing on genes. Birdsong, for example, helps birds defend territory or attract mates, directly aiding in gene transmission. By this measure, human art is different.

The second claim is that only humans create art for aesthetic pleasure. We can't ask birds if they enjoy their songs, but they mostly sing during breeding season, suggesting they sing for practical reasons, not just for pleasure. Again, this makes human art unique.

The third distinction is that human art is learned, not instinctive. Different human cultures have distinct art styles that are learned, not inherited. For example, songs in Tokyo and Paris are different, but people can learn each other's music. In contrast, some birds are born knowing their species' song and would sing it even without hearing it. It's like a French baby raised in Japan spontaneously singing the French national anthem.

The role of learning in human art is also evident in how quickly art styles change. Geese honked 2,000 years ago as they do today, but human art evolves rapidly. Even casual museum-goers can tell a 20th-century painting from the Mona Lisa. Experts can often identify when and who painted a work. However, they might mistake the works of two mid-20th-century artists, Congo and Betsy, for human abstract expressionists. In reality, Congo and Betsy were chimpanzees. Congo created up to 33 artworks in a day and got upset when his pencil was taken away. Their paintings were exhibited in 1957 at London's Institute of Contemporary Art, and most were sold, a feat many human artists can't claim.

These paintings by our closest relatives blur some lines between human art and animal activities. Like human art, the ape paintings weren't made for practical purposes but for the artist's satisfaction. You might argue that human art is different because it's often meant to communicate. However, even some famous human art was created for the artist's personal satisfaction."
CAE_39,"Title: An Epic Adventure

The Taklamakan Desert in western China is one of the last places on Earth that remains largely unexplored. It is also extremely dangerous. Charles Blackmore managed to cross it and survive to share his story. 

In the past, children's stories often featured brave explorers with sunburnt skin and eyes squinting into the distance as they ventured into unknown lands. Nowadays, such characters are rare in both fiction and reality. That was my belief until I met Charles Blackmore.

Blackmore led an expedition across the Taklamakan Desert, one of the last unexplored regions on Earth. Its name means ""once entered, you never come out,"" and locals call it the Desert of Death. He recounted the dangers and excitement of this incredible journey from the comfort of his home.

The team he led included four Britons (one was the medical officer), an American photographer, four Chinese experts on the area, 30 camels, and six camel handlers. However, it turned out that the camel handlers were actually long-distance truck drivers who had never worked with camels before. This misunderstanding could have endangered their lives and the success of the expedition.

This diverse group set out to cross 1,200 kilometers of one of the world's harshest deserts. Charles Blackmore has written a captivating account of their journey. At the time, he was about to leave the Army after 14 fulfilling years. He organized the expedition for fun, to fill a void in his life, and to prove something to himself. ""I always thought I'd spend my whole life in the Army. I was offered a promotion, but suddenly I wanted to discover who Charles Blackmore really was, outside of that life. It was a huge risk. My wife, Tina, was very worried I wouldn't return because no one had ever completed that route; we went into it blindly. In the end, it took us 59 days to cross from west to east, and the desert was very kind to us.""

Anyone reading his extraordinary account might question his use of the word ""kind."" The team faced severe challenges: dysentery, extreme temperatures, severe thirst and dehydration, and the loss of part of their precious water supply. ""But,"" Blackmore explains, ""when we were at the limits of our endurance and the camels hadn't had water for seven days, we managed to find some. We didn't encounter the Taklamakan's legendary sandstorms, and we never faced the biting cold that could have stopped us completely. That's not to say we weren't constantly battling obstacles. The fine sand got into everything, especially blisters and wounds. The high dunes were torture to climb, for us and the heavily loaded camels, which often rolled over onto us.""

""What drove me more than anything was the need to survive. We had no backup plan. Our budget and time didn't allow for one. No aircraft flew over us. Once we entered the sandhills, we were completely on our own. I knew I had the mental strength for the trip, but I was very worried about my physical ability. I remember the first day—we sat at the edge of the desert, and it was so hot you couldn't breathe. I thought, 'We have to do it now!' At that moment, I was very scared.""

If it was like that at the beginning, how did they feel towards the end? ""When you've walked 1,000 kilometers, you're not going to give up. You've endured so much; you've come so far. We were very thin but muscular and strong despite our exhaustion. My body was well-toned, and my legs were like pistons. I could walk over anything.""

Midway through the book, Blackmore describes lying in the desert, looking up at a full moon, and thinking of his family. How aware was he of the ordeal it must have been for them? ""Inside me, there's someone trying to find peace with himself. When I doubt myself now, I think back to the desert and remember that we managed to pull that off. As a personal achievement, I'm prouder of that expedition than anything else I've done. But in terms of a lifetime's achievement, I think of my family and the happiness we share—compared to that, the desert doesn't measure up.""

Has Charles Blackmore found peace? ""I long for the challenge, the open spaces, the resolve of it all. We were uplifted by our sense of purpose. I find it hard now to be part of the uniformity of modern life."""
CAE_18,"Susan Harr decided to unplug her gadgets and rediscover the joys of doing things by hand. Everyone seems to love technology because it gives us gadgets that make life easier and supposedly give us more free time. We've been subtly convinced that technology is essential, but is it really? Susan had a bad experience with her word processor, which cost a lot to fix, and it made her question if gadgets are worth the trouble and expense. She started letting her household gadgets go as they broke down, wondering what ""extra time"" they really give us. Is it just time to buy more gadgets? 

When her sewing machine started acting up, she left it in the backyard and began sewing by hand. She found it freeing not to be tied to a noisy machine and enjoyed the process more. She realized she could take her sewing anywhere, unlike the machine. While she appreciates some gadgets, like the washing machine, she found joy in losing others. For example, she returned her rented color TV and went back to a small black-and-white one, which made her more selective about what to watch. This change led to more time spent walking the dog, reading, talking, and enjoying hobbies like sewing.

Sewing by hand, she discovered, is not tedious but rather soothing and satisfying. It allows her to listen to the radio or talk with family and friends. She can even watch TV while sewing, feeling productive. Sitting by the fire with a pot of tea while sewing gives her a cozy feeling. She used to think sewing by hand was a chore, but now she finds it calming and rewarding. It slows down her life to a more natural pace, freeing her from the rush of modern life.

Susan also enjoys washing dishes by hand, finding it a pleasant, if forgotten, activity. Now, she looks around her house and questions the need for things like the freezer, microwave, or powered lawnmower. She even wonders if they could save money by doing without electric lights."

Hurst is disappointed by some modern furniture, criticizing mass-produced items and low-quality craftsmanship. His pursuit of perfection and his talent are key to his success. Hurst is confident in his abilities, claiming he has a natural talent for making things. He learned his craft by asking the right questions and teaching himself.

Most of his work comes from private clients, and some return for more pieces. He finds it satisfying to furnish entire homes but admits that not all client relationships are smooth. He prefers clients who know exactly what they want. While Hurst is confident, he also praises others when deserved, acknowledging that some craftsmen are better than him. He criticizes those who take too long to make a single piece and dislikes degree shows where students try to make fashion statements with their work. For Hurst, furniture should be practical and usable.

An eccentric is someone whose behavior is unusual and doesn't follow the typical norms of society. This raises the question, ""What is normal?"" Most people have their own quirks, like a love for entering newspaper contests, collecting beer mats, or writing letters to the press about various topics. Eccentricity is about expressing our individuality. Inside us, there's a constant struggle between wanting to be unique and wanting to fit in. It's like having two trains on the same track, one called individualism and the other conformity. For most people, conformity is stronger. We want to be accepted, loved, and feel connected with others more than we want to stand out.

People with unusual hobbies or strong opinions often gather together. They form clubs and hold meetings to share their interests, which others might see as odd. Being part of a group, even a small one, is comforting. We all feel a tension between wanting to be unique and wanting to fit in. Even when we follow the crowd, we don't like to admit it. We feel the need to show our individuality, like when someone at a bar says, ""I say what I think,"" or when a new acquaintance says, ""You must take me as you find me.""

At any time, we can choose to emphasize our individuality. Many successful people have done this. For example, Bob Dylan, the American singer, said, ""When you feel in your gut what you are doing and then dynamically pursue it - don't back down and don't give up - then you're going to mystify a lot of folk."" But this self-conscious assertion of individuality isn't eccentricity, at least not at first. When a pop singer wears strange clothes for attention or a society hostess makes shocking comments to get noticed, that's not eccentricity. However, if they continue these behaviors until they become a natural part of who they are, then they might be considered eccentric.

The key to eccentricity is its naturalness. Eccentrics don't try to be odd; they just are. They aren't concerned with public opinion; they simply act according to who they are. This makes them different from enthusiasts, practical jokers, brilliant criminals, exhibitionists, and recluses, who are all very aware of the world around them. These people act in response to society, either to make an impression or to escape it. Eccentrics, on the other hand, continue on their path without regard for society."

We asked four well-known naturalists to share the wildlife book that has influenced them the most.

A. Geoffrey Lean
Choosing the author was easy for me. As an environmental journalist, I've been lucky to meet some of the pioneers in this field. None impressed me more than Barbara Ward, a small, frail woman who was central to environmental issues in post-war Europe. She combined her experiences into a powerful philosophy. As a young journalist, she helped me understand the field better than anyone else. Choosing the book was harder. It could have been ""Only One Earth"" or ""Progress for a Small Planet."" But ""The Home of Man,"" despite its old-fashioned title even in 1976, is her most important work to me. It focuses on the rapid growth of cities and the themes she dedicated her life to. It's a passionate plea for what we now call 'sustainable human development.' I've read hundreds of books since, but none match it.

B. Linda Bennett
When I read ""Signals for Survival"" by Niko Tinbergen, I can almost hear the calls of herring gulls and remember the smell of guano in the sun. This book brilliantly explains animal communication with words and pictures. After reading it, watching a gull colony changes from chaos to a well-organized social structure. You can see which birds are partners and recognize families later in the season. Niko Tinbergen was a distinguished behaviorist who wanted to share his findings with everyone. His collaboration with wildlife artist Eric Ennion was inspiring, creating a book for anyone who loves wildlife. Ennion's painting style, developed from years of observing birds, uses minimal lines and colors to show how one gull is aggressive and another is appeasing. This is the work of a true field naturalist.

C. Lee Durrell
""My Family and Other Animals"" by Gerald Durrell is the book that has most influenced my life. It led me to a wonderful husband and a career in conservation. This extraordinary book cemented my love for the natural world. I was researching animal vocalizations in Madagascar when I first read it. After two years of setbacks, reading this book at the end of the day made the world seem brighter. It beautifully weaves together animals, people, joy, and beauty, showing a world worth saving. Many say humans are the worst species because of the harm we've done, but I think of Gerald as a boy in the book, seeing the world's inhabitants as a family, intertwined and inseparable. This is a concept we all need to understand.

D. Bruce Pearson
I found ""The Shell Bird Book"" by James Fisher in my school library soon after it was published in 1966. I was immediately drawn to the 48 color plates of birds by Eric Ennion, described as painted with skill and charm. These images captivated me. I already had other bird books and had spent holidays learning to identify birds, which encouraged me to start sketching them. But ""The Shell Bird Book"" offered much more. It included chapters on bird migration, the history of birds in Britain, and birds in music, literature, and art. This wide range of information and exciting images led me to appreciate birds and nature more broadly. The book showed me that my emotional and creative response to nature was as valid as a scientific one. Since art was a stronger subject for me than math or physics, I saw new opportunities opening up."
CAE_37,"**DO REVIEWS SELL BOOKS?**

We asked five top British publishers about how book reviews affect a book's sales. Here's what they said:

**Publisher A**  
Reviews are crucial for publishers; they're the first thing we look at in newspapers. The Book Marketing Council found that more people buy books because of reviews than any other reason, like ads or word of mouth. Authors and publishers react differently to reviews. Both dislike getting no reviews, but publishers are more relaxed about bad ones. They believe that any mention, whether good or bad, can boost sales as readers want to form their own opinions. Publishers enjoy reviews that match their own views of a book since they are often the first to read it.

**Publisher B**  
Publishers and the press both care about book reviews, but their needs differ. Newspapers want to entertain their readers, while publishers want their books reviewed positively. Book reviewing is better now than 40 years ago—more varied and less elitist. However, paperbacks, which most people read, are often overlooked. Weekly reviews aren't enough, and original paperbacks rarely get serious attention. Still, publishers need reviews as they help make books and authors known. A lively review by a trusted critic can boost sales, especially if there are several such reviews. Fame helps get books into readers' hands.

**Publisher C**  
Reviews are vital for literary publishing. Without them, we'd lose a key source of support. We publish books by lesser-known authors who rely on reviews since we don't advertise much. Good reviews are more valuable than ads because they are seen as unbiased. Reviews can launch a book and a career, but they need to be combined with other factors like word-of-mouth, strong bookshop support, and smart marketing.

**Publisher D**  
The link between publishing and reviewing in Britain is unclear. In the U.S., a review in the New York Times can make or break a book. Here, bookshops don't always pay attention to reviews. It can take years of great reviews for a writer to gain readers, while poorly reviewed books can still sell well. It's unpredictable. Non-fiction reviews often focus more on the reviewer's knowledge than the book itself.

**Publisher E**  
All publishers and writers hope for long, positive reviews. But do they sell books? I once published a biography that got great reviews, but it didn't sell because people felt they didn't need to buy it after reading the reviews. Does the reviewer's name matter? Thirty years ago, certain reviewers could influence public opinion. Now, it's more about the unexpected choice of reviewer or the review's power, wit, or originality that draws buyers to the bookshop."
CAE_2,"The craft of making weathervanes dates back to ancient Egyptian times. Today, Graham Smith keeps this tradition alive in his workshop. He is one of the few people in the country who still make hand-cut weathervanes. Each of Graham's designs is unique and made to fit the specific needs of his customers. ""This way, I can create a personalized item,"" he says. Many of his customers are women looking for special gifts for their husbands, often reflecting the man's work or hobbies. This is quite different from the traditional cockerel design, which is the most common weathervane. Graham's first weathervane was a witch on a broomstick, made as a surprise gift for his wife. Friends admired it and started asking him to make weathervanes for them too. ""I realized there are endless possibilities for designs,"" he says. Graham decided to focus on a weathervane business. He had trained as a precision engineer and worked in that field for 15 years. Then, he and his wife, Liz, decided to switch roles—she went to work as an architectural assistant, and he stayed home to care for their children and grow the business. That was five years ago, and he has no regrets. ""My previous job lacked creativity, but this is exciting and artistic,"" he says. ""I love the design aspect."" Graham has now created over 100 original designs. He pays close attention to detail and always gets customer approval for the silhouette design before cutting it by hand. He also keeps many traditional designs in stock, as they are just as popular as custom ones. ""People are drawn to handcrafted items,"" Graham says. ""They like having something a bit different."" He has no plans to expand, preferring to keep the business a rural craft. ""I've found my niche. People appreciate the uniqueness, and I enjoy turning a simple shape into something almost lifelike,"" he says. ""For centuries, weathervanes have helped communities understand weather changes by showing wind direction,"" he explains. ""Now, with more people moving to the countryside, they want unique touches for their homes, which benefits crafts like mine."" Graham is busier than ever, sending flat-packed weathervanes to clients worldwide, especially in America and Denmark. ""Prices depend on how complex the design is,"" he says. His latest request was for a curly-coated dog. Whatever the occasion, Graham can create a unique gift."
CAE_68,"**Beginner Takes All**

Before it was even published, *The Horse Whisperer* was the most talked-about book of the year. This first novel by British screenwriter Nicholas Evans brought him record-breaking earnings. Here, he shares his inspiration and success story.

The start of the year was tough for Nicholas Evans, who was a screenwriter, producer, and aspiring director. His film project, *Life and Limb*, which he had worked on for months, suddenly fell apart. This left him worried because he hadn't earned any money for two years, and the film was his only hope to appease his increasingly frustrated bank manager.

In a situation like this, most people would find a job. Evans could have returned to being a television executive or started a TV project he had put on hold. Instead, he made a bold decision that seemed crazy even to him. He bought a ticket to America and spent three months researching his first novel.

The idea for the story had been with him for a while, inspired by a farrier he met on Dartmoor. The farrier told him about a calm horse that suddenly became wild. Its owners were desperate until they found a gypsy who calmed the horse just by talking to it. Such people were called ""horse whisperers,"" and this story captured Evans' imagination.

Initially, Evans thought of writing a screenplay about it, as he was a filmmaker. But after *Life and Limb* failed, he decided to write a book instead. So, he traveled across the US, visiting ranches and learning about horses and the people who work with them. ""It was a strange time,"" he recalls. ""I was observing people, but I felt alone, like my life was falling apart. I had tried for ten years to succeed as a filmmaker, and now I was in debt, worried about feeding my children, and wondering if it was all a mistake.""

By August, he had returned home and written half of the book. The bank manager was pressuring him, and he needed to know if it was worth continuing. He showed the draft to a friend who was a literary agent. The friend said it was ""fine"" and estimated Evans might get $30,000 as an advance. Evans needed more than that to pay off some debt and support his family. He had already spent seven months on the book and needed at least two more. $30,000 was not enough. He was also advised to write a 12-page summary of the rest of the book.

In October, the first 200 pages and the summary were sent to seven UK publishers just before the Frankfurt Book Fair. Within days, his agent called to say he had turned down an offer of $75,000. ""I said, 'You what?' And he said, 'It's OK, I just sense something is happening.'""

What happened next became publishing history. Within a week, after intense bidding, the novel was sold to Transworld Publications in the UK for $550,000 and to Delacorte in the US for $3.15 million, both record-breaking advances for a first novel. ""We couldn't believe it; we were shocked. We never sent the manuscript to New York, and we still don't know how it got there,"" Evans says. They also didn't send it to Hollywood, but major studios were soon competing for it. ""My UK agent wisely involved an agent there, and when he called to say, 'I think we can get $3 million outright,' we laughed in disbelief.""

The studios agreed to this amount, and each wanted to present their case to Evans. So, one night in October, he sat in his study while four top filmmakers called, one after the other, to ask for the chance to pay $3 million for an unfinished novel.

Evans shared this story while we drank coffee on the verandah of his home. He mentioned that he had turned down an offer to write the screenplay for *The Horse Whisperer*. ""It's been such a fairy tale so far. I don't want to ruin it. Writing at that level is tough, and I don't want to become an employee of people I like and who have paid me so much. I'd hate to write a draft or two and then have them say, 'Thanks, Nick, but now we'll bring in someone else.'""

He said he would be involved, but from a distance. The success of his novel also brought new offers to back *Life and Limb*, but he wasn't sure he wanted to make it anymore. ""I think it would be foolish not to write another novel,"" he said."
CAE_23,"Text: 'Young Masters

Bobby Fischer is trying to make a comeback in the world of chess, but age is not on his side. Chess has become a game dominated by younger players. After 20 years away from the game, Fischer is playing against his old rival, Boris Spassky. Fischer's win in the first game was impressive, showing his skill. However, he is now 49 years old, not as fit or practiced as he was in 1972. Spassky is even older. 

Chess has changed a lot in the last 20 years. Fischer himself helped make chess more popular, leading to a new era of professional players. Now, the focus is on winning, with less emphasis on the artistic and scientific aspects of the game. In international chess, a player's nerves and stamina are just as important as their intelligence. The pressure is intense: players must make a certain number of moves in a set time, or they lose the game. Games are longer now, often played without breaks, which benefits younger players. In the last 30 years, each new world champion has been younger than the one before. Of the top ten players in the world, eight are under 30.

The way chess is played has also changed. Much of the game happens off the board, with players preparing extensively before matches. Computers have had a big impact, as they can store millions of games and help players study their opponents. In one recent match, both players had teams working nonstop to find weaknesses in each other's strategies. The opening moves of a game are now analyzed in great detail, and being well-prepared can decide the outcome.

Today, there are more top-level players than ever before, all competing for modest prize money. Success requires both physical and mental effort. A single game can last up to eight hours, demanding constant focus. Losing concentration can lead to disaster, and the chess clock adds to the tension. The end of a game often involves a frantic rush to make moves before time runs out. In these moments, players must act quickly and decisively, relying on nerves and determination to win. 

At the highest level, losing is very painful, while winning brings great satisfaction and a chance to recover. But one win is not enough to win a tournament. Chess competitions usually last 9-11 days, with games every day, and there is a year-round tournament circuit. World championship matches are even tougher. In 1984, a match between Anatoli Karpov and Gary Kasparov in Moscow had to be stopped because both players were exhausted. Karpov lost about 10kg during the match.

Can Fischer overcome these challenges? He once said, ""All I want to do, ever, is play chess."" This makes his long absence from the game puzzling, but it also adds to his legend. If he has returned for the money, he will earn a lot, regardless of the outcome against Spassky. But if he truly believes he can still be the best, the result could be disappointing.'"

**A** Nick Grosso, in his early 30s, is a playwright with three highly praised plays. He is now turning his first play, ""Peaches,"" into a film script. ""It's a low-budget project, but we're not sure how low,"" he says. ""It definitely won't exceed £30 million, but it could be as little as £30."" Remarkably, before writing ""Peaches,"" Nick had never seen or read a play. ""When I wrote it, I never thought it would be performed,"" he admits. ""It's set in a car, which I wouldn't do now because of the practical challenges. I knew nothing back then."" He left school at 16 but returned a year later. After finishing his A-levels, he joined the Young People's Theatre. ""I realized I wanted to write for actors. I wanted my writing to be heard, not just read, because of its rhythm and rhyme,"" he explains. ""Being around like-minded people was the first time I enjoyed an educational setting. It was very inspiring.""

**B** Comedian Simon Pegg, 28, has advanced significantly since studying drama at Bristol University. He is currently writing a TV comedy series and has just completed a demanding tour with comedy star Steve Coogan. Simon has always been dedicated. Even at Bristol, he was refining his skills in comedy clubs. ""University was very theoretical,"" Simon recalls. ""It made me realize I didn't want to be a traditional actor and that I was more interested in comedy. People think comedy is the hardest job, but it isn't. If you have courage and good material, making people laugh is wonderful."" He has performed with the comic group Funny Business, but his collaboration with Steve Coogan has been the most rewarding. ""He saw my show, and since I was a big fan of his, he probably noticed me imitating him,"" Simon admits.

**C** Ciaran McMenamin, 24, became well-known when he starred in the series ""The Young Person's Guide To Becoming A Rock Star."" The show received great reviews, and his career has taken off quickly. ""It's been a great opportunity for me,"" he says. ""Now I can choose what I do, which is what I've always wanted."" This is a rare position, especially since he just graduated. Looking at Ciaran's early career, it's clear he was destined for success. Encouraged by his mother, he went from school plays to the Ulster Youth Theatre, where he stayed for four years. ""I used acting as an excuse to avoid homework,"" Ciaran laughs. ""But I decided to pursue it because I was good at it and passionate about it."" Now, he is waiting for recognition but is thoughtful about fame. ""At 18, you think you'll love the photos and interviews, but you soon realize that's not why you act. It's about earning respect for good work.""

**D** Neil Taylor, 25, is the lead singer of the pop band Matrix, which has signed a three-album deal with Domino Records. Neil and his bandmate Rick Brown are expected to be very successful when their single ""Chimera"" is released. ""The record company has high expectations, but I don't know what to expect. If two people buy it, I'll be happy,"" he says. Unlike many new pop stars, Neil has worked hard for his success. He left school at 16 and has been trying to break into the music industry ever since. ""It's funny how things happen,"" he says. ""I was doing student gigs for eight years and was about to give up when I met Rick Brown, who had contacts at Domino, and we formed Matrix. It couldn't have happened at a better time. I've been in some terrible bands, but hopefully, it will all be worth it.""

**E** Poet and author Stephen Richards, 27, has won more prizes and awards than many twice his age. He is well-known on the poetry circuit, giving several readings a week for the past six years. His first novel, ""Hidden,"" will be published in March. ""It's a story of obsessive love. It was a strong idea that I couldn't express in a poem."" Stephen loved creative writing in school but became disillusioned with education later. ""I decided not to go to university, but when I got bored with stuffing envelopes at a theatre, I changed my mind."" After university, he published a children's book in 1992. ""My parents didn't expect me to be a writer—they thought I'd be a reader because that's all I did as a child."" With his poetry receiving critical acclaim, moving into novels is bold. ""There's a structure in poetry, so there's less chance of making big mistakes,"" he explains. ""A novel can be any length, so there are more chances for bad writing. My main goal is to avoid just producing work without caring about its quality."""

Despite this, she remains hopeful, which helps her and others in the story. The author writes with great energy, using a fast-paced style similar to early silent films, with chapter titles like 'Our Hero Feels Inspired.'

B. This story celebrates the rise and near fall of a local radio station in America. It’s told from the perspective of Francis With, a smart but frail child. He works for WLT (With Lettuce and Tomato) Radio, a station started by Roy and Ray Soderbjerg to promote their sandwich shop. The station broadcasts a mix of singers, preachers, soap-opera stars, and announcers. The small-town setting allows the author to use his well-known dry humor and simple writing style. He takes readers back to the 1940s and 1950s, a time of dime stores, oilcloth, old Ford cars, and, of course, the radio.

C. In this story, it's normal for a second husband to chat with his wife's first husband. So, when professor Richard Vaisey falls for a Russian poetess, he talks to his wife's ex about it. The poetess writes bad poetry, which bothers Richard, and she wants his help for her brother, who is wrongly imprisoned. The author skillfully untangles these complications with humor and insight into relationships, making it a sophisticated and witty read.

D. This novel follows two pairs of best friends—two women and two men—who meet in 1960s London and stay connected for 25 years. At the start, one of them, James Hudson, an American businessman, is launching a newspaper with his friend Richard Blake as the editor. The launch is important, but so is the fact that the woman they both loved (and one married) was killed years ago. The story is filled with murder, ambition, love, and jealousy, and the writing is excellent. It's a book where you can really get to know the characters and become absorbed in their lives.

E. Written by a top American fiction writer, this touching and funny story is about Ian Bedloe, who, feeling guilty for a past mistake, becomes a 'father' to his brother's three orphaned children. At 40, Ian is slowly becoming an eccentric bachelor, surrounded by the chaos of family life. The story explores deep emotions, especially the tender relationship Ian forms with the youngest child, Daphne. It's a warm, lovely book with the perfect mix of sadness and humor."
CAE_53,"**Volunteer Tourism: Perspectives from Four Academic Writers**

**A.** The direct impact of volunteer tourism on development is often questioned. While volunteers may help build homes or schools, they usually pay a fee to participate. This money, if given directly to local communities, could fund more labor than the volunteer provides. This is especially true for gap year volunteers, who often lack technical skills or professional experience. Many studies question whether these volunteers are motivated by a genuine desire to help or by the chance to gain 'cultural capital' for their careers. However, these projects might still help volunteers develop a lifelong commitment to ethical behavior and support for less privileged communities.

**B.** Volunteering can foster international understanding, improve conflict resolution skills, and encourage global participation through civic organizations. It can also create international social networks among ordinary people. Ideally, both volunteers and host communities benefit, contributing to the global good. However, if volunteering is mostly done by people from wealthier regions, it may only provide them with an international perspective and career advantages, without significantly helping the communities they visit. These volunteers might use the experience as a stepping stone for personal growth, rather than truly benefiting the host communities.

**C.** At its worst, international volunteering can be seen as imperialistic or self-serving, focused on personal and career development for affluent Westerners. Alternatively, it can be a straightforward way to provide technical assistance for development. At its best, it benefits both volunteers and the organizations they work with, allowing for an exchange of skills, knowledge, and cultural experiences. Importantly, volunteering can raise awareness and foster a lifelong commitment to addressing power imbalances, poverty, injustice, and unsustainable development.

**D.** Volunteer tourism aligns with the trend of life strategies aimed at helping others. These strategies, focused on 'making a difference,' can seem positive in an anti-political climate. The personal approach is appealing as it avoids big government and business. However, it also bypasses the democratic role of government and reduces development to individual charity acts, often working around rather than transforming poor, rural societies. Criticism of volunteering is misplaced if it involves simple, commendable charity. But when volunteer tourism is marketed as sustainable development, it can degrade the discourse of development. This approach reflects a shift away from understanding global inequalities and the poverty experienced by many in developing countries."
CAE_55,"Sound the Alarm by Stuart Harris

Many of us use a radio to wake up in the morning, often needing an external push to get out of bed. That's where the clock radio comes in. But how do you choose a good one? Our panel, including myself, inventor Tom Granger, and broadcaster Paul Bridges, tested five models currently available.

One model advertised a 'dual alarm function,' which I initially thought would let you snooze and then wake up again. However, the instructions suggest setting two different wake-up times, one for weekdays and one for weekends. But who lives by such a strict schedule? This model is priced similarly to the second one we tested, but it includes a cassette player, which is a great deal. You can fall asleep to your favorite tapes and wake up without news. We all agreed the radio quality was excellent, though the device is quite large, about the size of a rugby ball. Paul Bridges mentioned, 'Any clock radio I buy needs to leave room on my bedside table for my keys, wallet, glasses, and phone. Plus, I'm paranoid and always book a wake-up call in case the alarm fails.' This model was voted the most attractive and overall winner. Paul Bridges said he 'fell in love with it,' although the clock on his test model 'kept getting stuck at 16.00'. I was impressed by the digital display, with its elegant grey numbers on a soft green background. The wide snooze bar is easy to tap even with your eyes closed. However, the smooth buttons, like pebbles on a beach, tempted me to play with them like piano keys, which was a problem when I finally looked at the 50-page instruction booklet. The clock has a self-power backup, so you don't need to reset it if someone unplugs it to use a hairdryer or vacuum cleaner; we all liked this feature. However, setting it up was technically challenging, though mastering it made us feel 'cool' and sophisticated.

Tom Granger described another model with an extra built-in lamp as 'unbelievably tacky.' 'You have to yank the light out of its socket to make it work, which makes me question the quality of the rest of it.' He had to read the instructions twice to get it working; the clock kept jumping from 12.00 to 02.00, so he had to start over. The light was hard to position; you couldn't read by it as it only shines on the clock, which is already lit. Paul Bridges found the lamp idea amusing but agreed the radio was hard to tune. The buzzer sounded like a submarine alarm, making me want to throw it across the room. Interestingly, this model is the third most popular on the market.

Aimed at young people, with its bright colors and matching strap, this model appealed to the child in Tom Granger and me. 'I would choose this one because it stands out,' he said. The traditional controls made it the only one we set up without reading the instructions. Unfortunately, the alarm has a 20-minute margin for error; the manual notes, 'the alarm may sound about 10 minutes earlier or later than the set time.' Paul Bridges dismissed this, calling the model 'terribly fiddly' and 'completely useless.'

The simplest and cheapest model scored points with Tom Granger because it 'seemed very standard and took up little space,' and it has old-fashioned dial tuning. 'It's more intuitive to set up. With modern push-button tuning, you're never sure if you've pressed the buttons in the right order, so you can't trust it to work.' He admitted that manufacturers had to improve radio quality due to button-tuning. I found the tuning crude, as did Paul Bridges, but we agreed the radio quality was fine. The buzzer on this model certainly works; it got me out of bed in just two beeps!"
CAE_50,"Hedgehogs

A hedgehog is a small mammal known for the sharp spines covering its body. Hedgehogs live in many parts of the world, but they are not native to America or Australia. All hedgehogs can roll into a tight ball when they feel threatened, making their spines stick out as a defense. How well this works depends on how many spines the hedgehog has. Some hedgehogs that live in deserts have fewer spines because they have evolved to be lighter. These hedgehogs might try to run away from danger first and only roll into a ball if they have no other choice. Hedgehogs are mostly active at night and sleep during the day, usually under bushes or in holes in the ground. Although all hedgehogs can hibernate, not all of them do. If the conditions are right, some hedgehogs stay awake all year."
CAE_25,"Title: Great Sportswomen on a Winning Streak

Excelling in sports is challenging for anyone, but women often face additional hurdles. Training and competition demand significant sacrifices, leaving little room for a typical lifestyle. Despite these challenges, many women are overcoming biases and setting new records. Here, we highlight a few remarkable British sportswomen achieving their dreams.

A. Jill, 27, Skier
""Flying through the air and landing smoothly is exhilarating, though sometimes frightening. Conditions aren't always ideal, but you push through. Skiing requires ten months of training each year, making it hard to pursue other careers. Social life takes a backseat, but it's a choice I made. Our British team has six men and three women, and we compete equally on the same courses.""

B. Caroline, 22, Cyclist
""Two years ago, I borrowed a bike for a charity race and won, even though I had never cycled before! As a professional, I'm well-paid, and there are opportunities for endorsements. However, I worry people might think my success is due to my looks rather than my skills. I focus on cycling, training at least four hours daily, plus stretching, swimming, and running. My boyfriend is also a cyclist, so he understands the commitment required.""

C. Annabel, 26, Rower
""Rowing is tough for girls to start because few schools offer it, so most begin at 19 or 20, making international success harder. Coaches often change, leading to a lack of continuity in the women's squad. Despite this, rowing is fun, and I enjoy being fit and the social aspect.""

D. Ffyona, 24, Long Distance Walker
""At 13, I dreamed of walking around the world, not realizing its size! Britain felt too small and safe. I was headstrong and disliked being controlled. Now, I'm more tactful. Each walk is unique. Crossing Australia was the most painful experience, walking 50 miles daily with little sleep and many blisters. I set a record because my sponsorship was running out. Sponsoring women is seen as riskier, as men often doubt our success.""

E. Lisa, 26, Saloon Car Racer
""Some men have big egos when driving. If I'm doing well, they avoid talking to me. Being a woman has drawbacks; men often try harder to beat me, leading to many collisions. Racing requires competitiveness and aggression. It's hard to earn money, and what I make goes back into racing. Women have raced since the 1920s, often seen as eccentric. It's great to see more women joining each year. I love aiming for the perfect lap in saloon car racing.""

F. Alison, 28, Triathlete
""I wake up at 5:30 a.m. three times a week to swim, using Tuesdays and Thursdays to catch up on sleep. In the evenings, I cycle or run. Sometimes I fall asleep at my desk! There's a lot of pressure before races, and you push yourself hard. I've questioned why I do it, but I enjoy staying fit, and racing is social. Men and women usually compete together, but media coverage often focuses more on men's events. Prize money is also less for women. We've formed an International Triathlon Women's Commission to address these issues."""
CAE_34,"Title: The Day I Met Picasso

Richard Cork shares his experience of meeting the famous artist Picasso when he was 18 years old. While traveling around Europe and Morocco in an old van, Richard ran out of money and took a job painting boats in Cannes. One day, he saw Picasso having lunch at a restaurant in the harbor. Picasso was known to be a private person, so Richard was surprised to see him there with his wife, Jacqueline, and friends.

Encouraged by a friend, Richard approached Picasso to ask for his autograph. To his surprise, Picasso not only signed his sketchbook but also added a lively drawing. Richard, excited by this encounter, returned to his boat to show his friend. His friend urged him to go back and draw Picasso's portrait.

Richard returned to Picasso's table and began sketching him. Picasso noticed and playfully made funny faces, making it difficult for Richard to draw. Eventually, Picasso settled down, allowing Richard to capture his likeness. Richard observed Picasso's youthful appearance and intense eyes, which seemed to hold a deep seriousness despite his playful behavior.

After finishing the portrait, Richard was hesitant to show it to Picasso, but Picasso insisted. He looked at Richard's drawing and then, with a few quick strokes, added his own playful version of Richard's face. Picasso's drawing was lighthearted and imaginative, contrasting with Richard's careful work.

Richard asked Picasso to sign the drawing, but Picasso declined, saying Richard already had his signature. Despite this, Richard felt incredibly lucky to have met Picasso and received his attention. This encounter with the legendary artist was a significant moment in Richard's life."
CAE_12,"**Talking Shop: How Stores Make You Spend More**

Have you ever gone into a store and left with more than you planned to buy? Here, we explain the strategies shops use to encourage you to spend more money.

**A. The Image of Freshness**

Supermarkets know that customers value fresh produce. To create this impression, they often place fruits, vegetables, or even house plants at the store entrance. They might also have an in-store bakery, filling the air with the smell of fresh bread. The store's colors, like green, can also enhance this fresh image. However, most of what supermarkets sell, like frozen foods and cleaning products, doesn't fit this fresh image.

**B. Displaying to Advantage**

The placement of products in a store is crucial for sales, especially in supermarkets. With computerized stock control, supermarkets know which areas attract the most shoppers. They place high-profit or fast-selling items in these spots. The saying ""eye-level is buy-level"" means that shelves at eye height are prime spots for products. Special offer bins attract bargain hunters. Another tactic is ""complementation,"" where items like salad dressings are placed near related products like ice creams or burgers.

**C. Spreading Staples Around the Store**

Supermarkets often place essential items like bread, tea, and sugar far from the entrance. This forces shoppers to pass by other tempting, higher-profit items. Similarly, chain stores might place popular products far from the entrance, relying on customer loyalty to lead shoppers past other products that might catch their interest.

**D. Less Sells More**

Chain stores have changed how they display products. The Next chain, for example, moved away from the ""pile them high, sell them cheap"" model. Their stores have a ""boutique"" feel, displaying limited items to create an exclusive impression. Despite this, Next's clothes are as mass-produced as their competitors'. Their success is due to both good store design and well-designed clothing.

**E. Tempting Totals**

Food shoppers often focus on the total cost of their shopping rather than individual item prices. Supermarkets use this by offering a mix of low and high mark-up items. Not everything in a supermarket is cheap. Some items, known as ""loss leaders,"" are sold at a loss to attract customers. More often, low prices come from buying in bulk, offering manufacturers prime display spots, or meeting sales targets, which earn discounts from manufacturers.

**F. The All-Important Price Tag**

In chain stores, shoppers buy fewer items and are more aware of individual prices. Pricing a blouse at £14.99 instead of £15 can make a difference. This pricing strategy also helps reduce theft, as staff must record sales to give the correct change.

**G. Lighting to Effect**

Both supermarkets and chain stores carefully consider lighting. Chain stores aim for lighting that resembles natural light, so clothes look the same as they would in daylight. Supermarkets use special lighting and mirrors to make fresh produce look more appealing.

**H. Walk This Way**

Some chain stores use different carpeting to guide shoppers through the store. One pattern marks the main paths, while another defines sales areas. These paths, known as the ""Yellow Brick Road,"" aim to lead shoppers naturally. However, not all shoppers follow these paths. Marks and Spencer, for example, use wood or marble for paths, encouraging shoppers to step onto the more inviting carpet in sales areas.

**I. In-Store Promotion**

As you enter a supermarket, large photos of delicious foods greet you, especially tempting if you're hungry. In the U.S., some supermarkets are testing ""video trolleys"" with screens that advertise products as you shop. Sensors trigger ads relevant to the section you're in, like an ad for ready-made meals near the cook-chill cabinets. These trolleys target impulse shoppers, and their makers claim they boost sales by about 30%."
CAE_26,"Chris Bonnington, a renowned mountaineer, is famous for climbing Everest in 1985. He has also created new climbing routes in Britain and the Alps and authored books like ""Quest for Adventure"" and ""Everest the Hard Way."" Robin Knox-Johnston, who started his career in the Merchant Navy, was the first person to sail solo around the world in 1968-69 on his yacht, Suhaili. He also set a record for crossing the Atlantic in 10 days. Together, they embarked on a sailing and climbing adventure in Greenland, which they documented in their book ""Sea, Ice and Rock.""

In 1979, while working on ""Quest for Adventure,"" I contacted Robin for an interview, and he invited me to sail with him. I would teach him climbing, and he would teach me sailing. It was my first time on a yacht. After sailing for a while, we anchored, and Robin's wife and daughter stayed on the boat while we went ashore to climb. The climb was challenging, but Robin handled it well despite being new to climbing. At one point, he wanted to descend using a technique from sailing, which made me nervous, but he managed safely.

During our trip to Skye, Robin and I formed a strong friendship. His idea to combine our skills for a Greenland expedition was a natural progression from our Skye adventure. Robin impressed me as a leader by involving everyone in decision-making, even though most were hesitant to advise him. I found the sailing part of the trip tedious, as I prefer land and am not handy with repairs, unlike Robin, who enjoyed fixing things on the boat. I sometimes felt unnecessary, which was frustrating. The yacht was cramped, with six people on a boat meant for four, unlike a mountain expedition where you can have space.

In Greenland, when it was my turn to lead, I felt the weight of responsibility for Robin's safety. Climbing the Cathedral, Greenland's highest mountain, was tougher than expected. Robin, not a natural climber, showed great determination. Our first attempt lasted 24 hours, and we were exhausted, sleeping on steep slopes. Despite the challenges, Robin trusted me completely. He was also concerned about the boat's condition but supported another attempt to climb the mountain.

The only tension between us occurred on the yacht home. I missed a watch shift because Robin didn't wake me, thinking he could manage alone. I felt he didn't trust me, but he reassured me it was a misunderstanding. By the end of the Greenland expedition, I discovered that beneath Robin's tough exterior, he was a kind and sensitive person."
CAE_8,"**A History of the Apple**

Apples have been around since ancient times, coming in many colors, shapes, and sizes. However, in the late 20th century, we risk losing this rich heritage.

**Prehistoric Wild Apples (8,000 BC)**

Humans have been eating apples since prehistoric times. In Neolithic Britain, people spat out apple seeds, and 10,000 years ago, they left apple remains near their homes in Switzerland and Italy. In Switzerland and near the Caucasus mountains, ancient people even stored dried apple halves for winter. These were wild crab apples, small and shriveled, known in Ancient Britain as 'windings.' They were quite different from the apples we know today.

**Norman Knowledge (1000 AD)**

The French learned fruit-growing skills from the Romans, which were further developed in monasteries. This knowledge, including cider-making, was brought to Britain, along with the dessert apple, Decio, introduced by the Roman general, Etio. However, most Roman apple varieties didn't suit the British climate, so Norman varieties became more popular. British monks continued to experiment and develop new apple types, which are the ancestors of many Western apples today.

**Medieval Favorites (1200)**

In the 13th century, several apple varieties became popular in Britain. The Old English Pearmain, recorded in 1204 and named for its pear-like shape, was the main dessert apple until the 18th century. Its cooking counterpart was the Costard, sold in Oxford markets from 1296 until the late 1600s, giving us the word 'costermonger' for a street fruit and vegetable seller. However, prosperity declined due to droughts, the Black Death, and the Wars of the Roses, leading to fewer apples being produced and more being imported. This changed in the 16th century when Henry VIII sent his chief fruiterer, Richard Harris, to France to learn about apple cultivation. Harris returned with many grafts, including the famous Pippins, and established the first modern-style orchard in Teynham, Kent.

**Settler Treasure (1750)**

By the 17th century, apples were so popular in Britain that settlers took them to Canada, Australia, the US, South Africa, and New Zealand. Captain Bligh took the first apples to Australia, Jan van Riebeeck brought them to South Africa, and the Pilgrim Fathers carried them to America. In North America, the most famous apple-planter was John Chapman, or 'Johnny Appleseed.' Born in 1774, he planted apple nurseries from Pennsylvania to Indiana. The Native Americans saw him as a medicine man, and his passion for apple trees, unique clothing, and religious devotion inspired many folktales. He was even said to be so kind that he slept with bears.

**Modern Delicious (1850)**

Around this time in Iowa, a Quaker farmer named Jesse Hiatt found a new apple tree sprouting from a dead tree's roots. This tree produced a new apple variety, which Hiatt named 'Hawkey.' At a fruit show, a judge tasted it and exclaimed, 'Delicious, delicious!' In 1895, the apple was introduced to the market as 'Delicious' and became one of the most widely grown apples worldwide.

**Granny Smith (1850)**

Another famous modern apple was discovered in Australia by Maria Anne Smith. The daughter of convicts, Maria was independent and worked as a midwife in Eastwood, New South Wales. Known as 'Granny Smith,' she managed the family farm and orchard. In 1868, she found a small tree growing from discarded fruit. She transplanted it and soon harvested the first major crop of green apples, which became famous worldwide. When asked about the tree, she said, 'Well, it's just like God to make something useful out of what we think is rubbish,' referring to both the fruit and her convict origins.

**Uniformity (1950)**

Today, apples are grown worldwide, from northern India to small orchards in Africa. Most are grown commercially and come from just a few varieties, chosen for their red skin or ability to travel well, rather than taste. This uniformity is reducing the variety and gene pool of apples. While amateur gardeners in the UK have preserved many old apple varieties, the US has lost most of its apples from 100 years ago. Consumers are now demanding more variety. We can't rely on amateur gardeners alone to preserve apple diversity. We must value and protect natural diversity for everyone's benefit."

CAE_30,"Richard Nerurkar, a top British 10,000-metre runner, visited a high-altitude training camp in Kenya. Located ten miles south of the equator, a mountain track leads from a quiet road from Nairobi to Mount Kenya, the highest peak in Kenya. This beautiful but isolated place is Nanyuki, where I have trained during the winter for the past three years. However, I had never trained with Kenyan runners on their home ground until my fourth trip. During this visit, I competed in my first race in Kenya's thin air and stayed at the national team training camp. I was invited by Kenya's national team coach after finishing fifth in the World Championship 10,000 meters race, behind three Kenyans and a Moroccan. It was an opportunity I couldn't miss. Training at high altitudes increases red blood cells, improving oxygen capacity, which has contributed to the success of many Kenyan runners. My first race in Africa, held in Nairobi, was also the continent's first international cross-country race. It was a humbling experience, as 41 runners finished ahead of me, all but three of whom were Kenyan. Despite this, I felt I had a good race. I don't think Kenyan success is only due to altitude. Kenyan runners have a simple approach to the sport. Their running style is effortless, their diet is simple, and they enjoy competing. The least discussed aspect of their success is their training methods. During my stay at the Kenyan team training camp, I learned about their training. The camp is at St Mark's College, 6,200 feet up Mount Kenya, surrounded by playing fields and tropical vegetation. It's basic, with few comforts. Athletes live with regular students, six to a room in dormitories. Their days include three workouts: an easy morning run, interval training mid-morning, and a steady run in the late afternoon. The daily routine starts at six. We got up from our bunks and were briefed by the coaches for the morning run. ""Run easy, you have a hard job today,"" the coach who invited me said. We covered about 40 kilometers each day, just short of a marathon. Sundays were different, with only one 20-kilometer run, a welcome break from the usual three workouts. Life outside running was simple. A splash of water and brushing teeth were enough before breakfast. Breakfast was tea, bread, and boiled eggs in a small dining area. Lunch and dinner were similar: ugali (a maize dish), stew, cabbage or spinach, and tea. After the day's running, we drove to bathe in streams from Mount Kenya's glaciers. By the time I left the camp, I appreciated Kenyan success even more. It can't be attributed to genetics, upbringing, or altitude alone. I thought about another explanation: the simple lifestyle, tough workouts, and passion for success might be the real reasons behind Kenya's rise in world distance running."
CAE_7,"Advertising is struggling, and it's not just because of the recession. The decline started in 1989, before the recession hit hard, and it's a global issue. The main problem is that advertising hasn't kept up with economic changes. Advertisers still think in terms of mass markets and mass media, but as more brands and media options have appeared, target markets have become more fragmented. Major brand campaigns should focus on smaller, specific audiences, but they often don't. This is where advertising has gone wrong.

Consider your own shopping habits. When you go to a supermarket, you might buy 30 to 50 items, but only a few of these are advertised brands. Out of the 15,000 products available in a store, you might buy a few hundred brands in a year. For bigger purchases like cars, you might only buy one every three years, and it might be provided by your employer. Even with clothes, you don't buy as many advertised brands as you might think.

In total, you probably don't buy more than 400 different brands a year. Compare this to the 32,500 branded goods and services advertised, according to Media Register. If we focus on the 9,500 brands that spend more on advertising, Mr. and Mrs. Average buy only 400 of these, and not all because of advertising. That's about 4 percent. So, the idea that half of advertising is wasted is outdated; it might be more like 96 percent is wasted, but no one knows which part.

When you watch TV, count how many commercials are for brands you buy or might buy. For most people, it's about one in 16, meaning the rest are wasted. People think they're not influenced by advertising, but the truth is, most brands advertised are not bought by most people. Waste is part of using media for advertising because not everyone who sees an ad will buy the product.

However, advertising can still be cost-effective. It needs to reach many people to find the few who will respond, as advertisers can't predict who will be interested. Media advertising works because it's a cheap way to communicate with the masses, despite its costs. Smart targeting can reduce waste by increasing the number of people who respond, but it's never 100 percent effective.

This is different from face-to-face selling, where a salesperson might succeed with every client. With media, that's impossible. If advertisers knew exactly who would respond, they wouldn't need media; they could contact those people directly. This applies to all types of ads, from personal notices to soft drink commercials.

An advertiser who gains one million new customers (2 percent of the adult population) is doing well. For soap powder, the top brands would be thrilled with a million extra customers. Any campaign that wins over 2 percent of the population is very successful, but that's still a small part of the population. To succeed, advertising needs to target its message more precisely than ever before."
CAE_43,"Charles Clover explores Britain's most eco-friendly home in Southwell, Nottinghamshire, a place full of surprises. One is Southwell Minster, an ancient cathedral known for its 'green' men carvings. Another is the 'autonomous house' by Robert and Brenda Vale, the greenest home in Britain. The Vales use rainwater for washing and drinking, recycle sewage into garden compost, and heat their home with waste heat from appliances and body heat from themselves, their children, and their cats, Edison and Faraday. The house looks traditional with its clay tile roof and blends with the town's historic architecture, even though it's in a conservation area. 

The house is super-insulated with triple-glazed windows, making it very quiet inside. Visitors must remove their shoes, and the house feels peaceful. On a sunny day, the conservatory warms the air before it circulates through the house. The Vales open ventilation shafts and windows to create airflow because the house is very draught-proof. Even the cats have their own air-locked door. The Vales, who teach architecture, have been committed to the environment since the 1970s, when they wrote a book on green architecture. They designed the house to emit no carbon dioxide and decided to do without mains water. They use composting toilets, rainwater tanks, and copper gutters to protect drinking water, which is filtered before use. Water from washing goes into the garden, and they avoid dishwashers to prevent using strong detergents.

The Vales wanted to show that a house could be environmentally friendly without sacrificing comfort. The house's only medieval feature is its aesthetic: the hall, with a hearth and staircase, spans the building's full height. The Vales pay no water bills, and last winter, they used only nine units of electricity a day, costing about 70p. Soon, solar panels will reduce this even further, and the house will generate surplus electricity, enough to charge an electric car. The only heating is a small wood-burning stove, rarely used. In winter, the house remains warm due to its insulation and lack of draughts. Robert claims that perceived temperature depends on these factors, noting that people in the early 1900s were comfortable at lower temperatures due to their clothing.

The house is low-tech, with few things that can go wrong. Most materials were sourced from a builder's merchant and installed by local craftsmen, making it affordable to build. However, commercial builders are resistant to this idea."
CAE_51,"Arthur Conan Doyle, who created the Sherlock Holmes stories, considered himself a logical and scientific person. However, in 1920, he saw photos of fairies taken in a garden and believed they were real evidence of these tiny creatures. He published the photos with an article he wrote, claiming fairies were supernatural wonders. It wasn't until 1939 that the two women who took the photos admitted they were fake. They had simply cut out pictures of fairies from a book and placed them among flowers. The photos are undeniably beautiful, but the simplicity of the trick challenges the idea that the camera always tells the truth. In reality, it never did. Today, we are familiar with using computer software to edit our digital images, and it's a myth that photography ever had a time when it was completely honest. From the start, as soon as cameras began capturing reality, that reality was being changed."
CAE_11,"Throughout history, iron has fascinated people, and blacksmiths have been seen as more than just skilled workers. Before the Industrial Revolution, blacksmiths were as respected as doctors and astrologers because they made weapons, armor, and farming tools. They were also celebrated as artists. In the 18th century, blacksmiths created the intricate ironwork for St Paul's Cathedral. The flowing metal designs of French and Belgian Art Nouveau buildings were crafted by talented blacksmiths. However, by the late 1960s in Britain, blacksmithing was almost extinct because heavy industry no longer needed them, and modern architecture rarely used elegant wrought-iron designs. 

In the past decade, there has been a revival of interest in decorative architecture and innovative interior design. Despite this, much of the work still looks old-fashioned, with gates and balconies often described as 'classical' or 'Victorian-style'. Trendy design stores are filled with rusty candlesticks with decorative bits. Fortunately, there are new options, and upcoming events aim to promote blacksmithing. One such event is an exhibition by the British Artist Blacksmiths Association (BABA) at the Fire & Iron gallery in Leatherhead, Surrey. Alan Dawson, BABA's secretary, believes we might be entering a new Iron Age, as both the public and blacksmiths are seeing things differently. Power tools have made it easier for blacksmiths to work with metal, allowing them to bend, split, twist, and weld with ease. Dawson says, 'These artists now have a material that lets them express themselves.'

The exhibition features about 250 pieces, from bookends to a spiral staircase, with prices starting at £90 and going much higher. Most of the money will go to the makers, but a portion will support the promotion of quality ironwork. Dawson's own pieces include an eight-foot gate and a lamp with a glass shade. He describes his style as letting steel bend and flow when hot, like drawing with metal in space. Many artists are fascinated by iron. Unlike most metals, which are easy to shape when cold, iron and steel are tougher and more challenging. Susan May, a jeweler, finds it magical because it's soft when hot but becomes rigid when it cools. Ann Catrin Evans creates door-knockers and handles inspired by horror film castles, with designs like a ball and chain or a Celtic cross. She loves that steel feels permanent and solid. Iron has provided visual pleasure and a sense of security for centuries, and it will likely continue to be used decoratively for a long time, as long as we avoid more rusty candlesticks."
CAE_14,"The day I quit smoking, I thought everyone would be happy, but one of my colleagues was really angry. She said, ""If it was that easy, why didn't you stop years ago?"" I couldn't explain how I went from being a heavy smoker to a non-smoker in just four hours, and I found it puzzling myself. The session I attended was a mix of group therapy and hypnotherapy, and it happened about two months and three weeks ago. I hadn't planned to quit and didn't even want to. I was annoyed by the constant pressure from anti-smoking campaigns, and I still am. I had low blood pressure, a healthy family, and I didn't feel sick or cough. I seemed to recover from colds faster than my health-conscious friends. 

On that ordinary Thursday afternoon, I went to a session called The Easy Way to Stop Smoking in Birmingham to write an article about others trying to quit. I told them, ""I won't be trying to stop myself; it wouldn't be fair."" My reason for being there was to write, not to quit, so I didn't expect their method to work on me. I enjoyed smoking; it gave me pleasure. The counselor seemed to look at me knowingly. We were allowed to smoke as much as we wanted, and the room was so filled with smoke that we had to open the windows. I noticed that when I was told to smoke, I didn't want to, and neither did the others. 

The messages about quitting made sense to me. Just as smoking had become a challenge against opposition, the idea of stopping started to feel appealing. The thought of not being a smoker made me feel strong. It was a personal feeling, just for me. Could I also conquer the world? In many ways, it was easy. The physical craving for nicotine, which felt like hunger, faded after a minute or two and lasted only four or five days. The one thing I thought would be hardest without cigarettes—my work—wasn't a problem at all. I believed I couldn't meet deadlines without nicotine and would fail to write a story. Surprisingly, the hardest part was spending weekend mornings at home, and it still is. I think smoking was a way to avoid boredom; having a cigarette was an activity. Yes, I miss my cigarettes, but not too much. Each new experience as a non-smoker, like eating out, waiting for a plane, checking into a hotel, or during a theater break, is a moment when I used to smoke."
CAE_63,"Dorothy Hodgkin is the only British woman scientist to have won a Nobel Prize, yet she is not well-known in her own country. Georgina Ferry, who is writing Hodgkin's first biography, has noticed that many people in Britain are unaware of Hodgkin's achievements. Hodgkin, who passed away in 1994, was an extraordinary person. Her life mirrored significant changes in the 20th century, such as the progress of women's education and the globalization of science.

When Ferry started her research, she looked into scientific biographies and was surprised to find that even Linus Pauling, a famous chemist and Nobel laureate, was not well-represented in British bookstores. This reflects a broader issue where scientific biographies are often undervalued compared to those of artists or writers. Some scientists, like the late Peter Medawar, have even suggested that scientists' lives are not interesting enough for biographies. This attitude contributes to the idea that there is a divide between the arts and sciences.

However, this perception is changing. Scientists are becoming more visible in the media, and scientific biographies are becoming more engaging. Books like Richard Feynman's ""Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman?"" have shown that scientists can have fascinating personal lives. Even famous scientists like Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein are now portrayed with their personal flaws.

Dorothy Hodgkin's scientific achievements include solving the structures of penicillin, vitamin B12, and insulin, which earned her the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1964. She managed to balance her groundbreaking work with a family life, having three children and a husband who was often away. Her ability to integrate her personal and professional life is inspiring.

Communicating the passion for science is a challenge for biographers because many readers lack the scientific background to understand complex ideas. However, understanding science is not more difficult than learning a language or reading Shakespeare; it just requires effort. It is unfortunate that many educated people remain unaware of the contributions of scientists like Dorothy Hodgkin."
CAE_56,"Margaret and Her Water-Finding Skills

Margaret Wilkins is known for having a 'sixth sense'. She can use a forked hazel rod to find water underground. Many farmers, whose wells have dried up, seek her help. Margaret and her husband run a well-drilling business, using equipment like drilling rigs and air-compressed hammers. However, to find water, Margaret only needs a forked hazel stick. Their success rate in finding water is over 90%.

Dowsing is the ability to find water, minerals, and lost objects underground. It is often called a 'sixth sense'. There are many theories about how dowsing works, from physical explanations like magnetism to spiritual ones. One credible theory is that everything on Earth vibrates, and water vibrates more than other materials. Dowsers might have a special ability to sense these vibrations. Some say they can 'sense' water, while others claim they can smell it, as smell is a very strong sense.

In recent drought years, the Wilkins have been very busy, with a waiting list of almost six weeks at one point. Most of Margaret's clients are farmers with dry wells. She says, 'We usually see customers only once because wells last a long time.' Other clients include owners of remote cottages or barns, now used as holiday homes, where running water pipes over long distances is too costly. Some clients are golf-course developers needing water for clubhouse facilities.

Margaret aims to find water between 50 and 70 meters deep. 'You can't drill a well where there's any risk of farm or other waste contaminating the water supply. The water we find flows through cracks in solid rock, and if we bring it straight up, it should be clean. However, in Cornwall, you have to watch out for minerals like iron.' Another requirement is electricity to power the pump, which is too expensive to run over long distances, so the well should be near existing power supplies.

After considering all these factors, Margaret starts looking for water. On large sites like golf courses, she begins with a map and a pendulum. 'I hold the pendulum still and move it over the map. It swings when it's over an area with water.' Once the map shows possible areas, Margaret walks over the fields with a forked hazel stick. 'When I'm above water, I feel something strange; I sway a bit. When it passes, I use the stick to find the exact spot to drill.' She grips the stick's forks with both hands and pulls them slightly outward for tension. 'When water is directly below, the stick's straight part rises. It's crucial to drill exactly where the stick indicates. A small mistake, and you might miss the water completely. My husband also dowses the same area; usually, we agree on where to drill. If we don't, we keep looking until we do.'

Margaret Wilkins is not alone in practicing this unusual tradition in the west of England. Anthropologists and writers have long been intrigued by this mysterious intuition. Margaret calls it an 'intuitive perception of the environment', which is the closest explanation for her accurate water-finding ability. Without this 'sixth sense', how else could her family sustain their well-drilling business year after year?"
CAE_36,"We changed lives for a day! Have you ever thought about swapping lives with someone else for a day? Maybe you think it would be fun to try something different for a change? We arranged this for four people - read about their experiences.

Amanda's Story: Amanda, a 23-year-old mother with two daughters, swapped lives with her friend Cindy, a 30-year-old waitress at a busy London restaurant. Amanda had never been in such a lively place before. It was dark, noisy, and full of people, which was very different from her hometown. She had to learn quickly how to carry a tray of drinks with one hand. It seemed easy for the other waitresses, but Amanda struggled and ended up dropping the drinks. She was embarrassed, but the other waitresses laughed it off, saying everyone makes mistakes at first. By 11:30 am, a line had formed outside, and Amanda was nervous about remembering orders, but luckily everything was automated. After a few hours, her feet hurt, and she found the loud music hard to handle. She had to keep asking customers to repeat themselves, which was embarrassing. By the end of her shift at 5 pm, she was exhausted and wanted to soak her feet. She was surprised to hear it had been a 'quiet' day. Amanda realized waitressing was more tiring than she expected and required a bubbly personality and the ability to handle lots of customers. She was glad to return to her children, finding it easier than waitressing.

Cindy's Story: Cindy was nervous but excited to be a 'mum' for the day. She was warned that Amanda's daughters were cheeky, but she thought she could manage. After Amanda left for work, Cindy had to dress and feed the girls, drop Sophie at school, and Katie at nursery. She thought she'd have some free time, but Amanda left a note with chores to do. After picking up Katie and shopping, she brought Sophie home, and the girls started jumping on the sofa and screaming. Cindy hoped they'd tire themselves out, but they didn't. She managed to get them to bed by 8 pm, but they kept asking for water to stay up longer. Cindy found it exhausting to negotiate with them all evening. She didn't realize how tiring it was to look after two small children and felt the responsibility was overwhelming. Despite this, she enjoyed the day.

Rosemary's Story: Rosemary, a 42-year-old dairy farmer, swapped with Hilary, a 30-year-old primary school teacher. On the farm, Rosemary usually wakes up at 5:30 am, so sleeping until 7 was a treat. She was unsure about what to wear to school. At assembly, she hoped to blend in among 400 pupils. She helped with a maths class and a nature project. By lunchtime, she was tired but found teachers only have a short break. She attended a staff meeting and helped with athletics trials. After lunch, there was a silent reading lesson and a French lesson, where the children practiced on her rusty French. Finally, they had Physical Education, and Rosemary was exhausted, but the children were full of energy. She found speaking in front of the class daunting. Despite teachers having more holidays, she preferred farming.

Hilary's Story: Hilary arrived at White House Farm at 8:30 am, surprised that Rosemary had been up for three hours. The farm has 100 Jersey cows, 15 calves, and about 800 ewes. Besides milk, Rosemary makes ice-cream, yoghurt, and cream. Hilary spent the morning in the ice-cream parlour, bottling milk and packaging ice-cream. At lunchtime, she checked the sheep and helped a fallen ewe. If sheep are left down for too long, they could die, so they need daily checks. After feeding the calves, she started milking, which took two-and-a-half hours. Hilary found the day lonely and missed the children. The hardest part was not being able to take time off, as cows need milking twice a day. Rosemary only gets about three days' holiday a year. Farming seems romantic, but it's tough, with irregular income and dependence on the weather."
CAE_6,"A trumpet isn't just for Christmas... It's interesting how many musicians, even famous ones, come from homes without music. Hakan Hardenberger, the only son of non-musical parents in southern Sweden, has become a standout trumpet player at the age of 30. His recordings introduce new music, including concertos by lesser-known baroque and classical composers, as well as new compositions. When you meet him, he appears youthful and energetic, much like the sound of his trumpet. Recently, he performed the Hummel Trumpet Concerto in one of London's top concert halls, and a TV feature highlighted his work and growth, filmed in both the UK and Sweden.

Hardenberger was born near Malmo and owes his career to a Christmas gift he received at age eight. His father, who liked Louis Armstrong's music, decided to give him a real trumpet, not a toy. The gift was a hit, and Hardenberger played it constantly. His mother found a teacher for him, the second trumpet player in the Malmo Symphony Orchestra, Bo Nilsson, who quickly recognized his talent. Hardenberger is grateful for having such a dedicated teacher from the start. Nilsson was passionate about the trumpet and sought out players worldwide, always looking for the perfect mouthpiece. However, Hardenberger notes that the trumpet is an imperfect instrument, and it's about understanding and working with those imperfections.

From the beginning, Hardenberger had a knack for finding the right balance with the trumpet. Even as a child, his unique sound was noticeable. Unlike John Wallace, a great British trumpet player who started in brass bands and orchestras, Hardenberger always saw himself as a solo artist. He admired the French trumpeter Maurice Andre, who also focused on solo performances. Hardenberger collected Andre's records and looked up to him. His parents supported his dream of becoming a professional trumpet player.

At 15, Hardenberger needed to decide where to study. America was considered too far and risky, so at 16, he went to Paris to study with Pierre Thibaud. Thibaud reinforced his desire to avoid orchestras, comparing it to gardening. Hardenberger knew he played better than others his age, but it was during his first competition at 17 in Paris that he realized he had a special ability to connect with audiences. Thibaud encouraged him to enter the competition for experience. Hardenberger only prepared for the first round but advanced to the second, where he knew most of the pieces. In the final, he faced a challenging concerto and didn't win first prize, but he enjoyed performing and noticed that people listened to him despite his mistakes.

Hardenberger's honesty about his talent might seem arrogant, but that's not the case. He thoughtfully avoids analyzing his gift for communication, believing that trying to explain it could ruin it. He believes the power of music lies in its ability to move people."
CAE_33,"**New In Paperback**

A. The story of Tristan Smith takes place in the made-up country of Efica. It's a unique tale about human power, history, and humor.

It's a challenging but rewarding read.

B. Harriet is a middle-class woman with an architect husband and her own business. Normally, she wouldn't meet someone like Sheila, a working-class woman who cares for her elderly father and has raised her grandson, Leo, since he was three. Their lives change when Leo attacks Harriet's son, Joe, in the street. After the court case, neither boy talks about the incident. Leo, who was a good student and never fought before, won't explain his actions. Joe recovers physically but becomes withdrawn. Harriet is deeply affected by her son's situation, and caring for him consumes her life. Sheila feels so guilty that she asks to meet Harriet, leading to an unexpected friendship.

C. This book, shortlisted for the Booker Prize, tells the story of one of the most remote Scottish Orkney islands and its people over a long, quiet history. It connects this story with important moments in Scottish history, imagined through the daydreams of the young main character, Throfinn Ragnarson. He disappears at one point but returns after World War II, having learned to value the simple lives of his ancestors.

D. After a recent hit, the author has written a sequel with the same gentle irony and sharp observations of family life that made the first book popular. Fifteen years after her daughter's death, Aurora Greenway is nearing her seventies with her lively friend, Rosie Sunlap. Aurora's approach to life is still a mix of vanity, charm, and reluctant kindness, and Rosie helps her in her enjoyable manipulation of suitors and friends. By the end, Aurora must face the passage of time as a new generation takes the spotlight. The author is good at revealing the deep sadness beneath the ordinary aspects of life, focusing more on the shadows than the bright moments and highlighting the randomness of events.

E. Six different people are brought together by millionaire Logan Urquhart to sail around the South Pacific islands on his yacht, the Ardent Spirit. The author, with her impressive use of descriptive language, explores the personal journeys of self-discovery each person experiences.

She begins operating at 8:30 am, with surgeries scheduled all day on Mondays and Wednesdays, and some Friday afternoons. Standard head operations last about three hours, but some can take all day. Anne has worked ten hours straight without breaks. Deciding when and how to operate can be stressful, but the success of a surgery is very rewarding. From 10 am to 1 pm, she holds an out-patient clinic to explain operations to patients, which she enjoys. She leaves work between 6 pm and 8 pm and is often on call during nights and weekends. On holidays, she worries about her patients and dreams about operating.

CAE_40,"**Careers: Six People Talk About Their Typical Working Day**

**A. Credit Card Executive**
I wake up at 6 am and get to the office by 7:30 am. I handle customer development programs for our regular credit card users. My job includes launching and managing the Membership Rewards scheme in major European markets. I keep in touch with current card users, find new ones, and build relationships with partner companies. I spend the first 45 minutes organizing my day and answering emails. I manage advertising for the membership program across Europe, so I meet with marketing staff and advertising agencies to plan strategies and future developments. I have meetings most of the day, but I keep my door open for questions. I travel to different markets in Europe once or twice a week to discuss issues. When I'm in London, I leave work between 6:30 pm and 7:00 pm.

**B. Record Company Executive**
I start work at 10:00 am and go through the mail, which includes demo tapes, letters from producers, concert information, and invoices. The phone starts ringing around 10:30 am with calls from producers and publishers. I have meetings throughout the day about campaigns or projects for artists, involving the press, marketing, and the managing director. When I listen to demo tapes, I try to be constructive because it's important work for the artists. I know instinctively if the sound fits our label. After signing a band, we work on the first album, choosing songs, producers, and musicians. I share my vision of the album with the company for marketing and sales. I also manage budgets and spending. I leave work at 7:00 pm at the earliest and often go to gigs, sometimes seeing up to five new groups a night. After gigs, I might visit an artist in the studio. My social life revolves around work, and I often get home at 1:00 am, where I listen to a record to relax.

**C. Sales Director**
I wake up at 8:00 am and drive to work, arriving by 9:30 am. I open the mail, check the diary for client visits, and wait to see who comes in. I enjoy showing people around the showrooms and selling furniture, knowing it's going to a good home. We sell antiques priced between £1,000 and £6,000, buying from London salerooms, country house sales, private clients, and overseas. Many items need restoration, so I work with gilders, picture framers, and paper repairers. I read the Antiques Trade Gazette while having coffee to stay updated on the business, and I often visit the Victoria and Albert Museum to compare furniture. I do the accounts monthly and the tax returns every three months. I go home at 5:30 pm, and it takes about an hour to unwind.

**D. Air Traffic Controller**
I work set shifts, leaving home at 6:00 am for early shifts. At 7:00 am, I take over one of the four control positions in the tower. We rotate stations, working for about an hour and a half, then taking a half-hour break before switching stations. The team includes air traffic controllers, a supervisor, and a watch manager, and we control aircraft movements together. In winter, we handle about 1,000 movements a day, and even more in summer. Night shifts are quieter, allowing time to read up on new air traffic requirements. It's crucial to be alert in this job, so I don't hesitate to take sick leave if needed. The work is stressful, and it takes time to relax after a shift. I aim to become a watch manager and eventually a general manager of the airport.

**E. Shop Manager**
If I'm on an early shift, I leave home by 8:00 am. I start by setting up the electronic point-of-sale system. I ensure someone is at the till and coordinate staff lunches and breaks. I spend the morning helping customers and ordering books for them. I enjoy serving customers, though it can be frustrating when they expect you to gather many books based on reviews. Between 2:00 pm and 4:00 pm, publishers' reps visit the shop, and I discuss new titles for the upcoming months. I decide how many copies of a title the shop might sell. When featuring a new title, I ensure timely delivery. The early shift ends at 5:45 pm. I work late shifts twice a week, closing the computer system, locking up, and going home.

**F. Financial Analyst**
I listen to the news at 7:00 am, then get up and take a taxi to work, arriving by 8:45 am. I contact our freelance reporters to learn about events in my region. I assess financial risks for multinational companies abroad, warning clients of potential issues. I provide three services: an online executive preview, a security forecast, and a travel information security guide. From 9:15 am to 9:30 am, I meet with editors to discuss stories. My first executive preview is due online by 10:00 am, and the second by 11:00 am, so I quickly gather stories. I type them, send them to my editor for approval, and make any necessary changes before they are published. I travel to Africa about three times a year to report on events or stay updated. I leave work around 6:00 pm, but it's hard to switch off, and I'm often awake until 1:00 am."
CAE_45,"Text: 'Career Power: Gain the Advantage - Motivate Yourself to Take Control at Work. A. What makes a good leader? A leader is someone who inspires and guides change. Leadership isn't about your background or height, as early theories suggested. It's not just about intelligence either. Pat Dixon, author of ""Making the Difference: Women and Men in the Workplace,"" says leadership is about 'making things happen through people who are as enthusiastic and interested as you are.' Enthusiasm is crucial, and to share it with others, a good leader should speak clearly and with confidence. Dixon says, 'It's having the confidence to say ""I believe"" instead of ""I think."" B. John van Maurik, director of a Leadership in Management course, says, 'Most people have more potential for leadership than they realize. Becoming a leader involves recognizing, developing, and using those hidden talents.' In a way, we are all born leaders; we just need the right environment to grow. While it's easy to see leadership in famous figures like Emmeline Pankhurst, Mahatma Gandhi, or Richard Branson, it might be harder to see it in our own workplace. Yet, leadership is now seen as essential for effective management. C. Think about the best and worst boss you've had. They might have been equally good at setting goals and meeting deadlines. But how did they achieve them? The best leader motivated and supported you. The worst made you feel unimportant and withheld information, blaming you when things went wrong. The first led well; the second just managed poorly. D. Leaders and managers are different. Managers like working within set rules. Leaders create new paths. 'A good manager can keep a struggling company running smoothly,' writes Michael Shea, author of ""Leadership Rules."" 'But a good leader can transform a demoralized organization, whether it's a company, a sports team, or a nation.' E. Whether you're the boss or a middle manager, improving your leadership skills can help. Here are some lessons: * Leadership is best when you choose to do it. Find out what you're passionate about. When you feel inspired to lead, use that energy and act. * Think of yourself as a leader. Recognize your ability to lead. * Collaboration is good, but sometimes firm leadership is needed. Try different styles. If you're a natural negotiator, try being more decisive. See how this changes the outcome. * Set goals and exceed them. Look at your job's demands and identify where leadership can improve your effectiveness and career prospects. F. * Leadership doesn't just happen. It develops from taking the lead, taking risks, and learning from mistakes. Learn to delegate, motivate, organize, and give feedback. * Don't assume your leadership style will immediately win over colleagues. It might even push them away. Keep improving your communication skills. You don't have to be liked, but your ideas and achievements should be. * Be visible and accessible to those who matter. But remember, * You don't have to lead all the time. Know where your contribution is crucial and how you can help others become leaders.'"
CAE_64,"**Films on Video: Reviews by Film Critic Nick James**

**A. Abyss**  
Before Titanic, director James Cameron created this intense Cold War thriller. It follows oil rig workers and navy experts trying to save a nuclear submarine deep underwater. The characters, especially foreman Bud, remind us of the cool heroes in Howard Hawks' films. The production design and special effects are very impressive, but the dialogue and character development are not as strong. Despite the skilled filmmaking, the story feels like a typical B-movie.

**B. The Thin Red Line**  
This video release of Andrew Marton's adaptation of James Jones' novel about the battle for Guadalcanal offers an interesting contrast to Terrence Malick's new film. While Malick's version is mystical and poetic, Marton's is a more traditional war movie, staying closer to the book. It focuses on a single soldier and his tough relationship with his sergeant. Although Malick's film is richer and more complex, Marton's version has its highlights, like the flashback of the soldier dreaming of his wife, which is portrayed with a starkness that might be more effective than Malick's softer imagery.

**C. On Guard**  
Loosely based on Paul Feval's 1875 novel, this entertaining swashbuckler stands out among musketeer adventures. Fabrice Luchini plays a perfect villain, a scheming politician causing chaos behind the scenes. Vincent Perez is a lively, though short-lived, hero, and Daniel Auteuil, despite being a bit too serious for this type of film, shines as an acrobat-turned-swordsman. The filmmakers use costume-drama clichés with such wit and energy that it remains enjoyable.

**D. Character**  
Set in early 20th-century Rotterdam, this film is visually detailed but feels like a museum piece. Jan Decleir plays the grim bailiff Dreverhaven, who is ruthless in evicting tenants. The story focuses on his tense relationship with his son, but the filmmakers seem more interested in the period details than in fully exploring the dark and intense story.

**E. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly**  
This digitally re-mastered video highlights director Leone's skill, especially in sound editing. Every sound, from footsteps to barking dogs, is clear and impactful. The story is harsh, and whenever it slows down, Morricone's powerful music brings it back to life. Morally, there's little difference between the good (Clint Eastwood), the bad (Lee Van Cleef), and the ugly (Eli Wallach), as they all act unscrupulously in the post-Civil War West.

**F. The Longest Day**  
This three-hour war epic, promoted with 'forty-eight international stars,' is directed by four directors and features 23,000 extras. The early scenes, where soldiers wait for the invasion, feel as long for the audience as for the characters. Logistically impressive, it is best suited for the big screen. On video, the experience is lessened."
CAE_29,"**BOOK A**  
""Compelling Evidence"" by Steve Martin is a gripping story. The narrator is a lawyer trying to start a new practice after leaving a big law firm. He ends up defending his boss's wife, who is accused of murdering her husband. The trial scenes are intense, with the verdict uncertain until the end, and there's a surprising twist in the final pages. This is an impressive debut in a competitive genre.

**BOOK B**  
""Curtains for the Cardinal"" starts with excitement and throws Sigismondo, a problem-solver for the Italian Renaissance aristocracy, into a mix of politics, church intrigue, and murder. We are confident he will solve the mystery. The plot is complex and the book is a bit long, but it's still very enjoyable.

**BOOK C**  
""File Under: Deceased"" introduces a new detective, Leah Hunter, created by first-time author Sarah Lacey. Leah is a tax inspector who starts investigating when a man suddenly dies at her feet. Despite facing challenges and the disapproval of a local detective sergeant, Leah is determined and successful.

**BOOK D**  
""Double Deuce"" by Robert B. Parker features Spenser, a smart private investigator, helping his friend Hawk to remove drug dealers from a poor area in Boston. The dialogue is quick and sharp, and there is more philosophy than violence. As always, Parker delivers high-quality entertainment.

**BOOK E**  
""False Prophet"" by Faye Kellermann features detectives Pete Decker and Marge Dunn. They investigate an attack and burglary at the home of a famous film star's daughter. Kellermann's easy writing style and insight into human behavior make this an entertaining mystery.

**BOOK F**  
In ""Blood Red, Snow White,"" written by Diane Henry and Nicholas Horrock, a lawyer defends a female client, but the action happens outside the courtroom. As the plot unfolds, the lawyer becomes a victim. The novel combines romance, money, and violence to create a captivating suspense story.

**BOOK G**  
""Dead for a Ducat"" by Simon Shaw features actor Philip Fletcher, who becomes a target. A funny group of characters gathers to film a Robin Hood story, but Philip feels his career is not going in the right direction. While Shaw usually entertains, this shift from dark comedy to farce is not his best work.

**BOOK H**  
""Fall Down Easy"" is Lawrence Gough's best book in a while. Canadian police are on the trail of a clever bank robber who targets female bank tellers. The slow, well-paced build-up of tension and the portrayal of the intelligent, troubled robber make this a standout detective novel."
CAE_57,"At 34, Tim Pozzi decided to leave his stable job and go backpacking in Southeast Asia for a year. He reflects on why he and others his age are making such bold decisions. Although he has traveled before, spending two years in the Americas after university, life took over with a career, a relationship, and a home. Over time, he realized he was sacrificing personal fulfillment for a paycheck. Quitting his job felt like reclaiming his life. Unlike many of his friends who are married with children, Tim has no ties or career ambitions, which gives him a sense of freedom they envy.

Tim is nervous about the logistics of renting out his flat and choosing a travel destination. He admits to procrastinating, delaying his plans to enjoy the English summer and the start of the football season. Emotional ties make it harder to leave, and he wonders if he can still adapt to the backpacking lifestyle and fit in with younger travelers.

However, Tim is not alone. Many Britons in their late twenties and thirties are seeking adventure, realizing they can seize opportunities if they are brave and organized. For some, like Danny and Tammy, it's a chance for one last adventure before settling down. Others, like Matt, use travel as a way to transition from structured lives, like the military, to civilian life.

The modern workforce is more flexible, with short-term contracts making it easier to take breaks. Some companies even support career breaks, preferring employees return rather than join competitors. Dan Hiscocks notes that many thirty-somethings are reevaluating their lives, realizing jobs aren't permanent and travel offers a chance to reassess.

Jennifer Cox argues that this trend isn't about avoiding adulthood but about seeking a balanced life. Ben, another traveler, sees it as running towards something he wants, despite the fear of leaving behind a comfortable routine. Tim shares this fear but acknowledges that dissatisfaction with his boss pushed him to take this step.

Despite initial hesitation, Tim is excited about the year ahead. He feels proud to embrace life fully, a sentiment shared by many older backpackers."
CAE_42,"Georgina McGuiness had taken a long break from her journalism career and felt disconnected from the technological advancements. She shares how she turned her home into an efficient workspace. At 37, she realized she needed to revive her journalism career, which seemed outdated. Her resume was stuck in the 1980s, when typewriters were the norm. She felt unqualified for jobs requiring desktop publishing skills, which she lacked. As a self-proclaimed technophobe, even simple gadgets confused her. She knew she had to act fast to save her career.

Unexpectedly, she won a computer package in a local newspaper competition. This included a laptop for her husband and a personal computer for the family. They quickly adapted to the digital world, learning terms like cyberspace, Internet, and surfing. The children preferred computers over TV, and Georgina set up a home office in the kitchen with a phone, fax machine, CD-ROM, and modem for internet access. This setup allowed her to work from home while managing family duties.

Initially hesitant, Georgina feared losing her work with a wrong button press. However, she learned the basics and found it logical and user-friendly. Over time, she improved her skills and started freelancing for a magazine, writing two articles a month. The computer helped her become organized, especially with office tasks. Spreadsheets tracked income and expenses, and pre-formatted documents saved time.

For a journalist, internet access meant researching stories, seeking information, and discussing work-from-home pros and cons with people worldwide. Despite the benefits, working from home had downsides, like isolation and household distractions. There were also family disputes over computer use.

Many people were buying multimedia PCs for education, leisure, and convenience, avoiding daily commutes. A report on UK home PC usage described the typical computer user as 38 years old, well-educated, with a personal computer, CD-ROM, laser printer, and modem. Georgina felt ahead of the curve and dreamed of emailing a column to a newspaper in Melbourne or publishing her own magazine from home. The possibilities seemed endless, with cyberspace as the limit."
CAE_59,"The Tartan Museum in Edinburgh is a striking modern building with a unique design, featuring a large yellow sandstone tower and a hanging garden. Its architecture has received mixed reactions, ranging from praise to criticism. Inside, the museum aims to tell Scotland's story through a collection of historic objects, like Mary Queen of Scots' jewels, without overwhelming visitors with national pride. Dr. David Clarke, the head of exhibitions, emphasizes that the museum is designed for everyone, not just experts, and focuses on presenting the truth about history without relying on imaginative reconstructions.

The museum uses explanation panels, captions, and multimedia to tell the stories of its objects, but it remains to be seen if this approach will engage visitors enough to encourage repeat visits. The interior of the museum is impressive, with interconnected galleries and plenty of natural light, allowing visitors to appreciate each display.

A special feature of the museum is the Discovery Centre, created with input from a Junior Board of children aged 9 to 12 from across Scotland. Although the children wanted to ride through the displays, they instead got a hands-on center for kids. The top floor houses the Twentieth Century gallery, a temporary exhibition showcasing objects chosen by Scots and notable figures for their impact on life in Scotland. While the idea is entertaining, it may seem superficial until the accompanying computerized personal stories are available.

Overall, Dr. Clarke believes that objects can vividly connect us to the past. The museum's modern architecture is impressive from the inside, but its suitability for the historic location is debatable."
CAE_54,"The end of print media might take longer than expected. The idea of ""transition"" suggests a smooth change from one state to another. However, the shift from print newspapers to online versions is not straightforward. While print sales are dropping, online visits are increasing. For example, The Daily Telegraph and The Guardian have seen print sales fall by 8-10% annually, but their websites are gaining more visitors. This trend varies depending on factors like timing and location. 

Globally, newspaper circulation actually rose by 1.1% last year, with Asia compensating for declines in the West. News magazines, expected to suffer in the digital age, reported a 5.4% increase. Similarly, while e-readers like Kindle are popular, physical book sales only dropped by 0.4%. This suggests that both digital and print formats are thriving.

Claims that young people are abandoning newspapers are exaggerated. Nearly 5 million people aged 15 to 35 still read major national newspapers. Different countries show different trends: the UK has seen a 10.8% drop in print sales, while Germany and France have experienced smaller declines.

The assumption that online advertising would support digital newspapers is proving false, as digital ad revenues are decreasing. Many US newspapers have introduced paywalls, but the most successful strategy combines print and digital subscriptions. Print remains important for attracting online subscribers and generates significantly more advertising revenue than digital.

Maintaining both print and online editions is challenging and costly for newspaper companies. However, print still plays a key role in maintaining a newspaper's visibility and brand recognition."
CAE_32,"**Photographing People**

People are fascinating subjects for photography. A photo with a person in it is usually more interesting than one without. However, capturing people well in photos can be challenging. Besides technical and artistic aspects, photographers must pay attention to actions, gestures, and expressions. Sometimes, the presence of a camera can negatively affect these elements.

**A. Grouping People**

Avoid arranging people in straight lines for group photos. Have them stand at different angles and distances, or on different levels. You can also have some people sit or kneel in front so all faces are visible, or take the photo from a higher angle.

**B. Posing for Pictures**

People often become stiff and unnatural in front of a camera. Help them relax by suggesting comfortable positions, like folding their hands or putting them in their pockets.

**C. The Right Approach**

Don't pretend you're not taking a photo when you clearly are, as this can create tension. Most people will agree to be photographed, even if they initially protest. They might become self-conscious, so you may need to guide them. Ensure they aren't looking aimlessly out of the frame, as this can detract from the photo.

**D. Eye Contact**

A photo has more impact if the subject looks at the viewer. Ask them to look into the lens, but they don't need to smile. They might not maintain this for long, so remind them just before taking the shot. You can also say something funny or unexpected to capture a genuine reaction.

**E. Candid Concentration**

Instead of direct eye contact, have the subject focus on something within the picture. This can make them more comfortable, and the viewer can follow their gaze. Candid shots are intriguing, and the subject's expression is crucial.

**F. Expressions and Gestures**

Expressions and gestures reveal a lot about the subject. A laughing child can make the viewer smile, while a sad expression can evoke sympathy. Look for familiar expressions like shrugs, winks, or thumbs-up, as they communicate instantly.

**G. Situation Interest**

While close-up shots of faces are impactful, including the background can add interest and context. Exclude irrelevant details or blur them by focusing selectively. Ensure the subject isn't overshadowed by the background; a wide-angle lens can help balance the subject and background.

**H. Interaction**

When people are interacting—talking, arguing, or working together—there are great photo opportunities. Capture moments of eye contact or physical contact, like a handshake. Show reactions with animated expressions or gestures.

**I. People and Places**

Many photos of people are taken on holidays to show the places visited. To capture both people and background, use a standard or wide-angle lens and step back to include the entire scene. Position the group close to the camera to create foreground interest without blocking the background. An elevated camera position can help balance the subjects and the place.

**J. To Pose or Not to Pose?**

Decide why you want the photo. If it's to remember someone you met briefly, ask them to pose against a nice background. Family photos can be dull if they're all formal poses. Candid shots of events are more lively and capture genuine moments. A spontaneous photo can evoke memories better than a posed one."
CAE_65,"**Under Sarah's Spell**

Sarah Janson is a trompe-l'oeil artist, which means she creates paintings that trick the eye into seeing something that looks real. In this interview with Joanna Watt, we learn more about her and her work.

Unlike most artists, Sarah doesn't sign her paintings unless someone asks her to. She believes the artwork is more important than the artist. Sarah is very modest and almost makes it seem like her paintings create themselves. This attitude doesn't make her an easy interview subject. She admits, ""I just don't like to talk about myself,"" and is embarrassed when asked to be photographed.

However, once comfortable, Sarah becomes engaging and funny. She has been a trompe-l'oeil artist for sixteen years. She studied drawing for two years at art school, earned a degree in graphic illustration, and worked at a publishing house. But illustration didn't fulfill her, so she joined a decorator named Jim Smart, who introduced her to trompe-l'oeil. This changed her career path. She decided to work independently, trusting her instincts.

Sarah's skills in observation and attention to detail, honed through illustration, are crucial for trompe-l'oeil. She believes you can't be taught trompe-l'oeil; it's about observing life. She insists she's still learning and says, ""The moment you think you've mastered something, you might as well stop.""

Sarah is honest about her limitations, like struggling to paint bread, and admits to difficulties with math. When working on a large project for a chapel ceiling, she doubted herself, thinking, ""You're not Michelangelo.""

Despite her self-doubt, Sarah's work stands out. Her trompe-l'oeil projects are unique and highly regarded, with many corporate and private commissions. Her art often draws inspiration from architecture, like a dining room designed to look like a Venetian palace or a painting that makes a corridor seem to lead to more rooms.

Sarah knows that trompe-l'oeil must first trick the viewer and then engage their imagination. She believes the art should be personal to the client, and she enjoys collaborating with them to create ideas. Many clients become friends because she spends so much time with them during projects. She appreciates her clients, saying, ""I'm grateful for the ones who let me work on their walls.""

Even though Sarah downplays her talent, she is always busy with work. She repeats, ""I don't like to talk about myself,"" preferring her work to speak quietly. But her art is anything but boring, and it deserves more recognition."
CAE_61,"**Emotional Intelligence - The Key to Success**

**A** The way we evaluate work performance is changing. We are now judged not only by our intelligence or skills but also by how we manage ourselves and interact with others. This new standard helps decide who gets hired or promoted and who doesn't. It predicts who will excel and who will remain average. These skills are crucial for future job opportunities, regardless of our current field. Unlike what we learned in school, doing well in exams is not important here. This new measure assumes we all have the necessary intelligence and technical skills. Instead, it focuses on social skills and personal qualities like initiative, empathy, adaptability, and persuasiveness. These are known as emotional intelligence.

**B** In today's world, where job security is uncertain, personal qualities are becoming more important at work. These qualities, often called 'soft skills', are now better understood and referred to as emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence is the ability to understand and manage our own and others' emotions, using them to guide our thoughts and actions. It includes self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills. It's not just about being nice; sometimes it requires confronting uncomfortable truths. It also doesn't mean expressing all feelings freely. Instead, it involves managing emotions so they are expressed appropriately, helping people work together towards common goals.

**C** Many businesses now see emotional intelligence as a key part of management. The more complex the job, the more important emotional intelligence becomes. A lack of these skills can hinder the use of technical expertise or intelligence. While some people succeed despite flaws in emotional intelligence, as work becomes more complex and team-oriented, companies that foster these skills gain a competitive advantage. In today's workplace, with its focus on teamwork and customer service, emotional intelligence is essential for success in any job worldwide.

**D** Unlike IQ, which changes little over time, emotional intelligence can grow as we learn from life experiences. Studies show that most people become better at managing their emotions, motivating themselves, and improving their empathy and social skills. This growth in emotional intelligence is often called maturity. Emotional intelligence can be learned, and we can develop these skills to help us adapt and succeed, especially in uncertain job markets. While it isn't a magic solution for struggling organizations, ignoring the human element can prevent everything else from working as well as it could."
CAE_52,"Text: 'Is it right for the media to make money from content they don't own? Digital cameras and camera phones have made it easier to capture important events, but social media has changed citizen photography even more. News often breaks on social networks, so some journalists use them to find images during fast-moving events. Unfortunately, some reporters have used user-generated content (UGC) without asking for permission. Even though there is guidance saying images from social media can be used without permission in special cases or if there is a strong public interest, there is still debate about whether this is ethical. Research shows that about one in ten people would film or photograph a news event, indicating that UGC will be important for the media's future. However, to keep a good relationship with the public, the media must ensure people are properly rewarded for their work and always ask for permission.'"
CAE_28,"**Ancient Chinese Medicine in the West: Acupuncture**

**Introduction to Acupuncture**  
Acupuncture is a practice that is over two thousand years old, originating from traditional Chinese medicine. This system includes herbal remedies, massage, diet, physical manipulation, and exercise. Acupuncture is used to treat various conditions, but it is most recognized in the West for its role in pain relief. Some general practitioners, midwives, and physiotherapists use it regularly for this purpose.

**Understanding Traditional Chinese Medicine**  
In traditional Chinese medicine, health is seen as a balance of energy in the mind, body, and spirit. This energy, known as Qi (pronounced ""chee""), flows through the body along pathways called meridians. There are twelve main meridians, each connected to an internal organ, and many smaller ones that distribute Qi to every cell. If the flow of Qi is disrupted, it can lead to weakness or illness. During an acupuncture session, the practitioner identifies imbalances in Qi by checking your pulse, examining your tongue, and assessing your overall appearance. They will also ask about your medical history, current health, and lifestyle habits. Acupuncture involves inserting fine needles into the skin, sometimes with added heat or pressure, to stimulate Qi flow.

**Acupuncture Points**  
The points used in acupuncture are related to meridians and may not be near the area of pain. Patients often feel a dull ache or tingling when the needle is manipulated, either by hand or with an electro-acupuncture machine. This sensation indicates that the needle has reached the Qi in a meridian. There are over three hundred main acupuncture points, with many more used less frequently.

**Scientific Perspective**  
Even without fully accepting traditional Chinese principles, Western doctors acknowledge that acupuncture can relieve pain. Scientific explanations suggest that acupuncture may work by stimulating nerves to block pain signals or by releasing natural pain-relieving substances called endorphins.

**Types of Pain Treated**  
Acupuncture is often sought by people with chronic pain, such as back pain, sports injuries, arthritis, headaches, migraines, and post-operative pain. It is also claimed to help with menstrual pain, facial nerve pain, and pain in terminally ill patients.

**Modern Use of Acupuncture**  
While acupuncture has been practiced in China for over 2,000 years, its use as an alternative to anesthesia in surgery began in the 1950s. This development helped convince some Western doctors of its effectiveness. In China, acupuncture is used in various surgeries, sometimes with electrical stimulation or drugs. It is said to eliminate pain without the side effects of conventional anesthetics, allowing quicker recovery.

**Effectiveness of Acupuncture**  
Clinical trials on acupuncture are challenging to conduct, but existing studies show that 50 to 80 percent of people find it effective for chronic pain. Acupuncturists report similar success rates, acknowledging that it may not work for everyone. For chronic pain, noticeable relief usually occurs after six or seven sessions, with some improvement after two or three visits.

**Different Approaches to Pain**  
Western and Chinese medicine have different views on pain. Acupuncturists take a holistic approach, considering not just symptoms but also underlying weaknesses in Qi and external factors like weather conditions. This comprehensive diagnosis is not typically part of Western medical practice.

**Choosing an Acupuncturist**  
Some medical professionals have traditional acupuncture training, while others, including many general practitioners, prefer scientific explanations. Traditional acupuncturists believe that only by following Chinese medicine principles can deep, lasting changes be achieved. When choosing an acupuncturist, ensure they are qualified and willing to refer you to a medical doctor if necessary."
CAE_35,"P.D. James, whose full name is Phyllis Dorothy James, is a famous crime writer known for her complex and imaginative stories. Despite her calm and authoritative presence, she is actually quite shy. She admits that her detective character, Adam Dalgliesh, is somewhat based on herself, imagining how she might have been if she were a man. Like Dalgliesh, she prefers to work alone, especially when writing, needing complete privacy to focus.

James is humble about her success, even though her 12 detective novels are loved by millions worldwide. She admires the works of her friend Ruth Rendell, especially those written under the name Barbara Vine. Her reading preferences include books by women authors like Iris Murdoch and Anita Brookner, but she also appreciates male authors like Graham Greene and Evelyn Waugh.

James's success came later in life. She was 42 when her first novel, ""Cover Her Face,"" was published. Born in Oxford and raised in Cambridge, she met her husband, Connor Bantry White, there. Her life has had its challenges; her husband returned from World War II very ill, and she had to work hard to support him and their two daughters. Her in-laws helped care for her children during these tough times.

While working full-time for the National Health Service and later at the Home Office, she used her organizational skills effectively. Her work in forensic science exposed her to the realities of crime, but it was the structure of writing crime novels that attracted her. She always wanted to be a writer and saw detective stories as a way to learn the craft of serious writing without drawing directly from her own life experiences.

James believes that writing detective stories is about creating order from chaos. Solving a crime in a story affirms the value of life, even if the life in question is not particularly likable. She emphasizes that nobody truly enjoys violence."
CAE_5,"The pen is mightier than the psychoanalyst

The study of handwriting, known as graphology, is gaining popularity as a way to understand a person's character. In some countries, when you apply for a job, you might be asked for a handwriting sample. This sample can be as important as other factors in deciding if you are suitable for the job. Graphology is considered a real science in many places. Researchers claim it can help identify illnesses like heart disease and cancer, and reveal psychological and emotional issues. It is increasingly used for career guidance and during job interviews. Many large companies hire graphologists to analyze the handwriting of candidates for important positions. However, most doctors and psychiatrists are skeptical about graphology's value.

Patricia Marne, a graphologist with over 20 years of experience, believes that handwriting can show psychological traits and medical conditions. She argues that handwriting reveals social class, intelligence, mental ability, and potential. It can also indicate whether someone is more suited to arts or sciences, and whether they have an honest or deceitful character. According to Ms. Marne, graphology is useful in identifying criminal tendencies. She says criminals often have disturbed handwriting, which is usually poorly shaped and shows signs of arrested emotional development. This can appear as childish writing or repeated letters. She claims she can determine if someone is honest, manipulative, or a reliable employee.

Ms. Marne also notes that young male offenders often have high ascenders in their writing, suggesting they live in a fantasy world and dream of success. Graphologists can detect signs of potential violence, unbearable pressure, or psychopathic tendencies. Handwriting might even predict suicidal tendencies. Health issues like heart and lung problems can also be indicated. A single sample might not be enough for a diagnosis unless the writing is clearly shaky or disturbed. However, changes over time, such as a break in the signature, could signal serious issues. Emotional upsets can temporarily alter a signature.

Ms. Marne explains that handwriting can reveal other psychological traits. For example, people with 'threaded' letters are seen as devious and clever, while those who write in all capitals may be hiding their true selves. Light pressure suggests sensitivity and low energy. Original handwriting shows confidence and artistic talent, while disconnected writing is a sign of a loner. Small signatures may indicate inhibition and inferiority, circles over the 'i' suggest a need for attention, and heavily crossing the 't' shows intolerance and a patronizing attitude.

Ms. Marne says it takes six years of study and experience to analyze handwriting accurately, along with empathy and intuition. She believes more research is needed to establish graphology as a scientific discipline. She claims it is more accurate than psychoanalysis because it reveals a person's history and emotional crises without needing to ask questions that might get incorrect answers. Despite these claims, there is little solid evidence to support them, and some psychiatrists criticize the idea. They argue that handwriting is influenced by education, artistic ability, and the style of writing taught, and has no deeper meaning."
CAE_41,"Text: 'Is your office working well? Fresh air and comfortable chairs are essential for a happy, healthy workforce, according to a new survey. We visited four different offices to see how healthy and happy they were as work environments. Our expert panel included a building health consultant, an ergonomist who studies people's working conditions, and an occupational psychologist. Here are their findings.

Office A: Advertising Agency
Building Health Consultant: This office is very simple; no central heating or mechanical ventilation, with windows opening directly onto the street. Despite this, the small, dynamic team seems content. They adapt to the seasons by opening doors and roof panels or using electric heaters, much like they would at home. This homely atmosphere, free from external bureaucracy, might be why they are happy.

Ergonomist: The furniture is mismatched and often leads to poor working postures. Chairs are old, mostly non-adjustable, and many are broken. However, the varied work schedule, which includes office tasks, client meetings, and presentations, helps reduce fatigue, boredom, and muscle problems.

Occupational Psychologist: Staff enjoy the variety of work and the flexible office space. They find the office 'just the right size'—small enough to know what colleagues are doing, yet large enough for personal focus. The office is both attractive and fun, promoting efficiency and creativity.

Office B: News Service
Building Health Consultant: The office is comfortable and not disliked by staff. Air quality and maintenance are good, helped by a No Smoking policy.

Ergonomist: The company has used an ergonomist before. Chairs, lighting, and computer equipment are excellent. Space is adequate, though the layout could be better. The environment is impersonal and dull, with grey, bare walls.

Occupational Psychologist: Walls are bare except for year planners and a maternity rights poster. Most staff have been there for over five years, and relationships are satisfactory. The office could improve by rearranging desks for easier information sharing and displaying project successes.

Office C: Bank
Building Health Consultant: The office feels like a glass case, with many similar setups. Despite smokers and non-smokers sharing a small space, the air is not stale, and cigarette smoke is not noticeable.

Ergonomist: The office is standard and uninspiring. Desks are just adequate, and not all chairs meet requirements, but this is by choice. Computer screens are on small desks with lowered keyboard shelves, which is outdated.

Occupational Psychologist: Staff support each other well and are aided by technology. Many communication awards are displayed. The wood paneling and brown carpet give a somber feel, but the office is busy and active.

Office D: Newspaper
Building Health Consultant: This building has many issues. The air-conditioning is poorly controlled, causing temperature swings. The space is cluttered, with inadequate desk space and lots of dust. The roof collects dust, which falls on people below.

Ergonomist: The furniture is more suited to a carpentry workshop than a high-tech office. Most chairs are unsuitable for keyboard users, especially those shorter than 1.75 m. Many chairs are old, lack adjustments, and have armrests that prevent getting close to the desk.

Occupational Psychologist: The office has old brown chairs, dirty carpets, and dust everywhere. It needs a tidy-up, better recognition of individual success, and improved air conditioning due to many smokers. Few conversations were happening during our visit; everyone seemed stressed and focused on deadlines. The company should adopt team-working policies.'"
CAE_38,"Chewing gum is a popular and classless product, with Americans consuming 12 million sticks daily. It has evolved from an ancient practice into a major industry. Each stick of gum has fewer than ten calories and is considered a food, so it must meet the American Food and Drug Administration's standards. Modern gum is mostly synthetic, with added pine resins and softeners to enhance flavor and texture. 

Historically, the ancient Greeks chewed a resin from the mastic tree, mainly found in Greece and Turkey, to clean their teeth and freshen their breath. In America, colonists learned from the Amero-Indians to chew spruce tree resin, which was sold commercially in the early 1800s. The modern chewing gum industry began in the late 1860s with the discovery of chicle, a substance from the sapodilla tree in Central America. Chicle made gum smoother and more elastic, leading to the growth of the industry. However, attempts to cultivate sapodilla commercially have failed, so synthetic alternatives were developed as demand increased.

Today, the few remaining chicle gatherers, known as chicleros, face harsh conditions. They trek through humid forests, dealing with dangerous wildlife, to collect sapodilla sap. The work is tough, and their diet is basic, but they worry about losing their jobs as synthetic gum becomes more common. In the past, the U.S. imported 7,000 tonnes of chicle annually, but now only 200 tonnes are tapped in Mexico's Yucatan peninsula.

Chewing gum manufacturers are finding creative ways to market their products. Gum is said to help with relaxation, energy, and tension relief. It also claims to reduce tooth decay by increasing saliva flow, which neutralizes plaque acid. Research continues on new textures and flavors, with most being artificial, though some still require natural ingredients. In the U.S., 137 square kilometers are dedicated to growing mint for the two most popular gum flavors."

CAE_47,"Sue Brown is a hotel inspector. She checks hotels to see if they meet certain standards. Christopher Middleton watched her inspect the Globe Hotel. Right from the start, things didn't go well. The receptionist was busy on the phone and didn't notice Sue, which is a common mistake. Sue expected better because the Globe Hotel has three red stars, meaning it's one of the top 130 hotels out of 4,000 in the guide she works for.

The entrance to the hotel was also disappointing. It was through an unmanned door and a long, empty corridor. When they reached the reception, the hotel had no record of Sue's booking, even though most rooms were empty. The room they offered her was stuffy and had a hole in the wall behind the wardrobe.

Sue has a reputation for being tough, but she insists she's fair. The next morning, after paying her bill, she revealed her identity to the hotel manager, Robin Greaves. He was worried, especially about a bad smell in the lounge. Sue suggested fixing the plumbing and not taking guests to that lounge.

Not everything was bad. Sue praised Emma, the assistant manager, and Trudy, a waitress, for their good work. The dinner was good enough to keep the hotel's two-rosette food rating. Greaves asked how to get three rosettes, and Sue advised not serving desserts that fall apart.

Sue's job is to point out problems that guests might not mention. Sometimes people complain about her feedback, but she has to be honest. She gives a verbal report and a written one, as hotels pay to be in the guide. Despite the issues, Sue decided not to remove the Globe's red stars. However, another inspector will visit in two months to check if improvements have been made. Greaves pretended to be happy about this."

Doug Scott, a renowned mountaineer, shares his experiences of climbing the highest peak on each continent, known as the Seven Summits. Here is a summary of his adventures:

A. Mt. Everest, Asia (8,848m)
Doug and his partner, Dougal Haston, faced challenges like oxygen deprivation and extreme cold. Despite these, Doug felt confident with Dougal by his side and managed to reach the summit by maintaining a steady rhythm.

B. Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)
Known as one of the most dangerous mountains, Doug and Dougal climbed it in April 1976. They carried all their gear on their backs, a first for a new route on this mountain. The low air pressure made it feel like they were at a higher altitude, but they successfully reached the summit.

C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,895m)
In September 1976, Doug and Paul Braithwaite intended to climb Mt. Kenya but ended up on Kilimanjaro. They got lost in the jungle but eventually found their way. After facing falling rocks and ice, they chose a safer route and reached the summit.

D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)
In January 1992, Doug and his wife, Sharu, climbed Aconcagua. They avoided the busy standard route and joined a group on a different path. Despite strong winds, they reached the summit and camped before descending.

E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)
In November 1992, Doug's team traveled to Antarctica. Despite harsh weather conditions, they reached the summit in eight hours. The experience was uplifting, even though visibility was poor due to a storm.

F. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)
In the summer of 1994, Doug's team climbed Elbrus. After acclimatizing, they took a cableway partway up and then hiked to the summit. Initially mistaking a false summit, they eventually reached the true peak and descended the next day.

G. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)
Doug's team aimed to establish a new route and interact with the local Dani people. Despite warnings of danger, they climbed the mountain, reaching the summit by 11 am. This marked Doug's completion of the Seven Summits, earning him a standing ovation.

Doug Scott's journey across these peaks highlights the challenges and triumphs of mountaineering, showcasing his determination and passion for adventure."

Ned Ingham creates dreamy, romantic wedding dresses. He advises against traditional, stiff dresses and the 'frilly' look, suggesting simpler styles instead. Ingham has been designing wedding dresses since he was a schoolboy. At 16, he attended fashion school to learn the technical skills needed for cutting and constructing clothes. But you don't have to be a bride to wear an Ingham dress; he also designs long, classic evening dresses with modern colors and fabrics. For those who prefer something less daring, Ingham offers a classic summer navy-blue suit, a staple in English women's wardrobes throughout the 20th century, but with a fresh, modern twist.

FCE_19,"Title: Luxury and Modern Technology at the Merrion Hotel

The Merrion Hotel, a new five-star establishment in Dublin, combines luxury with modern technology. It was created by transforming four large 18th-century houses, a project that took nearly two years and involved extensive research into what customers want. This transformation allowed the hotel to install the latest technology for both staff and guests.

General Manager Peter MacCann expects his staff to know guests by name, but for specific preferences, he uses the hotel's advanced computer system. This system, which cost £250,000, helps provide personalized service, such as remembering a guest's music preferences for future visits. MacCann believes the system will be cost-effective over time due to its efficiency.

Room temperature, a common complaint among hotel guests, is managed by a high-tech system. Guests can adjust the temperature within a small range themselves, or request more significant changes from the front desk.

Business travelers, who are expected to make up 65% of the hotel's clientele, will appreciate the in-room business facilities. Each room includes three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that also works as a photocopier and printer, and video-conferencing capabilities. The hotel has prepared for future technological advancements by installing extra cables and renting TVs, allowing for easy upgrades.

Despite the advanced technology, the hotel aims to make guests feel comfortable and not overwhelmed. The 145 spacious and well-furnished rooms are designed to be welcoming. The hotel also features a swimming pool, gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a beautiful garden.

The hotel's dining experience is enhanced by Chef Patrick Guilbaud, whose restaurant already had two Michelin stars before moving to the Merrion. This move benefits both the chef and the hotel, offering a modern kitchen and better parking facilities, while providing the hotel with a popular dining option without financial risk.

With its blend of technology and skilled staff, the Merrion Hotel is poised for success."

When he first felt a headache and chest tightness, his wife, Molly, urged him to see a doctor. But Pelham, believing the police needed him, ignored her and kept working. This only made him more forgetful and irritable. Eventually, his colleague, Sergeant Lloyd, took him to the doctor. By then, he was too weak to argue. Soon, he was getting antibiotics from the pharmacy and heading home to his wife, who sent him straight to bed. On Thursday morning, when Molly told him the walnut tree in their garden had fallen, he couldn't process it. That evening, he asked if the house was damaged, was relieved to hear it wasn't, and went back to sleep. By Saturday, the antibiotics were working, his fever was down, and he got up, realizing the walnut tree's absence had changed the living room's look. The Pelhams' large house, with its big garden, had been expensive, but Pelham didn't regret buying it because the garden gave them privacy. The walnut tree had been a key part of the view from the living room, creating light and shadow patterns that hid the worn-out furniture they brought from their old house. Without the tree, the room was too bright, showing the shabby furniture. The view now included the tall, unattractive house next door, with its purple bricks and many windows, which seemed to watch the Pelhams. ""Doesn't it look terrible?"" Pelham said to Molly. But she, standing in the doorway, seemed more happy than upset. ""I've been saying that since we moved here. We need a new sofa, no matter the cost,"" she replied."
FCE_16,"Living in the Valley

We had been living in our valley for sixteen months when we first realized the dangers from the surrounding hills that could threaten our survival. It was the year when the storms came early, even before November ended. Until then, we felt safe in our valley, protected by the hills. Soon, snow began to fall, and within a day, it was about 15 centimeters deep. It almost blocked our lane and made the path by the stream slippery and dangerous. On the nearby hills, the snow was much deeper and lasted longer. Up there, the wind was fierce, but in our valley, we only felt sudden gusts; the trees swayed, but the branches stayed firm. Still, we knew we had reason to worry.

The snow and wind were inconvenient, but they didn't trouble us much. It was the river, the Ryburn, which usually flowed gently, that posed the biggest threat. It reminded us of what could have happened if the water from the hills hadn't been controlled by a series of dams many years ago. Soon, the snow started to melt. Day after day, we watched dark clouds gather over the hills to the west. These grey clouds spread over the valleys, twisting and turning, warning us of what was to come. We had seen enough of the sky; now we began to watch the river, which was becoming fuller and wilder each day. The snow was gradually washed away as more rain fell from the clouds, but high in the hills, the reservoir was filling and nearing danger level.

Then it happened - for the first time in years, the reservoir overflowed. Up in the hills, it was like Niagara Falls, as water surged over the dam and into the stream below. The river seemed wild as the waters rushed down to its lower parts. Just a couple of meters from our cottage, the stream was wild beneath the bridge. It was deeper than we'd ever seen it so close to our home, fiercely hitting its banks. For three days, we hoped it would stay below its wall. Fortunately, our hopes were answered as the dam held, and the waters began to go down.

In the past, before the dam was built, the river often flooded nearby villages in such a rage. Now, the dam controls the river's flow, and usually, everything is fine; the large amount of water from the hills, from snow and heavy rain, stays behind the dam with only occasional overflows. Because of this protection, we can enjoy the large clouds over the valley and be amazed by the river's power. Thanks to this, we feel our home in the valley is still secure and safe."
FCE_21,"Film Critic Mark Adams reflects on his decade-long career writing for a newspaper called The Front Page. This was his first serious job, although he had previously reviewed novels, films, and other media for various outlets. He met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page, through radio work. Tom, who wasn't mainly a journalist, hired Mark. Tom's initial plan was to have a team of critics cover art forms that didn't need specialized knowledge, like books, TV, theatre, film, and radio. They would meet weekly over lunch to decide what to review, with guests to keep things lively. It felt like a dream to Mark, being part of a new newspaper in a competitive market. He even doubted the paper's success, thinking it was as likely as a millionaire personally supporting him. When he first saw someone reading his review on the London Underground, he was unsure how to react.

Tom's idea for a team of critics didn't work out as planned, and they ended up coordinating by phone. The public preferred critics to focus on one area, so Mark chose film. Thanks to Tom's initial push, Mark now writes a detailed weekly piece on one film, which suits him. He wouldn't have enjoyed the typical critic's job of reviewing every film, as it would quickly become monotonous. The freedom he has allows him to explore his arguments more deeply or find something interesting to say even in a dull week.

Mark questions his role in influencing the public. He believes people choose films based on stars, publicity, or directors, and rarely change their preferences because of a review. For instance, someone who dislikes westerns is unlikely to watch one after reading a review, and a fan of romantic films won't avoid one because of critics. So, if reviews aren't just consumer guides, what are they? Mark doesn't feel he needs to be 'right' about a movie or that there should be a set number of 'great' or 'bad' films each year. His job is to present an argument, not to act as a judge, which he has no desire to be."
FCE_46,"Why would a schoolgirl want to swim 1500 meters, cycle 40 kilometers, and then run 10 kilometers? Because she thinks it's fun. A teenager with a passion for endurance sports is looking for a training partner. Ideally, this person should be female and interested in becoming an Olympic champion. They should love long-distance running (regular 15 km sessions), swimming (enjoy training in cold rivers during winter), and cycling (enjoy 100 km rides). They must be able to do all three activities without resting.

The triathlon is becoming one of the most popular Olympic sports. It attracts large crowds who are both fascinated and shocked by athletes swimming 1500 meters, cycling 40 kilometers, and running 10 kilometers without stopping. It might be exciting for spectators, but why do triathletes push their bodies so hard? And why would a talented 17-year-old with excellent grades give up everything for this challenging sport?

Melanie Sears hasn't yet learned the usual phrases about personal satisfaction and mental challenges that athletes often use. She says, ""You swim 1500 meters, then jump on your bike while still wet, which makes you cold. After cycling 40 kilometers, you have to run 10 kilometers, which feels long when you're tired. But it's great fun and worth it in the end.""

Melanie entered her first triathlon at 14 and won the junior section, although she was the only junior competing. Feeling confident, she entered the National Championships. Despite having the second-fastest swim and the fastest run, she didn't place well. She got lost during the cycling part and ended up riding 20 kilometers too far, crying through the run. But she didn't give up and is determined not to. ""Sometimes I wish I could stop to end the pain, but I'm afraid if I stop once, I'll be tempted to do it again.""

Her determination impresses Steve Trew, the sport's director of coaching. He says, ""I tested her fitness, and she worked so hard on the running machine that it threw her off into a wall. She gave it everything, but unlike most people who stop when they can't go further, she kept going.""

Melanie was the top junior at this year's European Triathlon Championships, finishing 13th. She was almost as good as the top three in swimming and running but slower in cycling, so she's working hard to improve. She's trying to convince her parents, who are paying £1,300 for her trip to New Zealand for the World Championships, to buy her a £2,000 bike (with a £1,000 discount) so she can compete in national 25 km and 100 km races later this year.

However, her intense training has made her a bit of a loner. ""I don't have a social life,"" she says. ""I'm not a party person anyway. After two hours of hard swimming on Friday nights, I just want to sleep. But I keep in touch with the other girls on the team by phone and letters."" What do they talk about? Boys? Clothes? ""No, we talk about the times we're achieving.""

Where will all this focus lead? Melanie has tried other events, like the triathlon 'sprint,' which involves swimming 750 meters, cycling 20 kilometers, and running 5 kilometers. She wants to try even tougher events than the triathlon. ""The big problem is, I have no one my age to train with,"" she says. It's surprising, isn't it?"
FCE_70,"Amanda Roy discusses her love for collecting and why many people share this hobby. Collecting is a popular pastime, with one in three adults participating. It's a world filled with passion and excitement. But remember, only collect items you truly love. 

Since ancient times, humans have collected things. Early humans collected pebbles for their beauty, wearing them as necklaces. This was one of the first instances of collecting for intellectual and spiritual reasons. Today, children still collect stones and seashells for their beauty.

I've been a collector all my life, gathering everything from tulips to pottery and paintings. My first collection was stones from my parents' garden. At six, I went to a school in a remote, windy part of England. My parents would visit and take me to a local museum filled with historical collections, which fascinated me.

Many people share my interest in collecting. The reasons vary, but some find it gives them a sense of control. For me, it's simply enjoyable. Historical figures like the Duc de Berry in France and Catherine the Great of Russia were famous collectors. The Duc de Berry had a 'room of wonders' with items like coconut shell cups and Oriental china. Catherine the Great collected over 4,000 paintings. But you don't need to be wealthy to collect. I've collected tulip bulbs and china cups with great determination. I once convinced another tulip collector to give me a bulb, only to have it stolen later.

I also collected 350 American rag dolls, searching across the USA for different designs. Unfortunately, this collection was lost in a house fire. The next day, I stood in the ruins, unsure if I was more upset about the furniture or the dolls.

I'm intrigued by how collections change hands. A silver spoon once owned by a king or poet gains value because of its history. As items become popular among collectors, their prices rise. Toys from the 1950s are now valuable investments, especially if you kept the original boxes. Sadly, I threw mine away, along with the toys."
FCE_3,"Text: 'My line of work Four people talk about their jobs. Lisa - Exhibition Programmes Organiser, Science Museum I organize temporary exhibitions. This involves planning, designing, and promoting them. I research the exhibition topic and talk to experts to decide on the main themes and goals. I plan what objects and pictures to display and ensure the public understands the exhibition's message. This includes planning interactive displays, workshops, and theatre. I also coordinate with engineers and electricians to ensure safety. Before the exhibition opens, I help design and write brochures and leaflets to inform the public. Janet - Teacher of London Taxi Drivers I start my day at 7.30 a.m. by checking the accounts. Then, I see what new maps and documents are needed for students to learn the routes for the London taxi-driver test. By midday, about 50 students are in school, figuring out the best routes using the correct streets and turns. I help when there's a disagreement, like whether a right turn is allowed at a junction. As they get closer to the test, I challenge them by giving them a route and then telling them it's blocked, so they have to find another way. This is to make them think. Sarah - Marine Conservationist I live by the coast and work from home. My job includes answering phone enquiries, creating educational materials, and setting up training courses. I sometimes go to the main office but mostly work on the coast. I work with schools and study centers and run courses for coastal managers and decision-makers about the seas. I take them out to sea to help them understand marine life better, which often changes their views. I love my job because conservation is my passion, but working for a charity means I always need more funding and can't do everything I want. Chris - Map and Atlas Publisher My job is varied. I ensure our publishing program meets market needs and maintain stocks of about 300 books. We have high standards for information and content. We get many letters from readers about issues like international boundaries, which need careful responses. I discuss future projects and current sales with co-publishers. I work with an enthusiastic team, which makes the job enjoyable. The downside is the excessive administration, which leaves less time for interesting tasks like product development and design.'"
FCE_10,"We always went to Ireland in June. Since we started going on holidays together, the four of us spent the first two weeks of June at Glencorn Lodge in County Antrim. It's a big house by the sea, near the village of Ardbeag. The English couple who own the house, the Malseeds, have expanded it, but they've done it very tastefully. Strafe found Glencorn for us. He saw an advertisement back when the Malseeds still needed to advertise. ""How about this?"" he said one evening and read out the details. The summer before, we had gone to a hotel recommended by friends, but it wasn't great because the food was terrible. The four of us have been playing cards together for a long time: Dekko, Strafe, Cynthia, and me. They call me Milly, though my real name is Dorothy Milson. Dekko got his nickname at school because Dekko Deacon sounds nice, I guess. He and Strafe went to school together, which is why we call Strafe by his last name, like the teachers did. We're all about the same age and live near the town where the Malseeds lived before moving from England to Ireland. We always think it's quite a coincidence. ""How very nice,"" Mrs. Malseed said, smiling as she welcomed us again this year. She seems to know when guests are about to arrive because she's usually waiting in the large, low-ceilinged hall that always smells of flowers. ""Arthur, take the luggage up,"" she told the old porter. ""Rose, Tulip, Lily, and Geranium."" She was referring to the names of the rooms reserved for us. Mrs. Malseed painted flowers on the doors instead of using numbers. In winter, when not many people come to Glencorn Lodge, she takes care of little details like that, while her husband handles redecoration and repairs. ""Well, well, well,"" Mr. Malseed said, entering the hall from the kitchen door. ""A hundred thousand welcomes,"" he greeted us in the Irish way. He was smiling broadly, his dark brown eyes twinkling, making us feel like we were more than just hotel guests. Everyone smiled, and I could feel the others thinking that our holiday had truly begun. Nothing had changed at Glencorn; everything was as it should be. Kitty from the dining room came out to greet us. ""You look younger every year, all four of you,"" she said, making everyone in the hall laugh again. Arthur led the way to the rooms, carrying as much of our luggage as he could and then returning for the rest. After dinner, we played cards for a while but didn't stay up too late because we were still tired from the journey. In the lounge, there was a man on his own and a French couple. There were other people at dinner, of course, because in June, Glencorn Lodge is always full. From where we sat by the window, we could see some guests strolling on the lawns, others taking the cliff path down to the seashore. In the morning, we'd do the same: walk along the sands to Ardbeag and have coffee at the hotel there, returning in time for lunch. In the afternoon, we'd drive somewhere. I knew all that because, over the years, this routine had developed. Since we first came here, we had all fallen in love with every variation of its beautiful landscape."
FCE_67,"Text: 'Keeping the holiday-makers happy A chalet girl's work is never done, Sarah Sutherland-Pilch tells Veronica Lee - in between making beds and delicious dinners. This is the second year as a chalet girl for Sarah Sutherland-Pilch, a 24-year-old from West Sussex. Known by her nickname, Pilch, Sarah works for a company in Val d'Isere, France, cooking and cleaning for visitors who come to ski and stay in the wooden houses, known as chalets, that are characteristic of the area. Sarah graduated in French and History of Art from Oxford Brookes University last summer. Being a chalet girl isn't a career, she says, but an enjoyable way to spend a year or two before settling down. 'It's a good way to make contacts. I meet successful people every week.' Sarah does not 'live in'. She gets up at 7a.m. to walk the mile or so to the chalet, which sleeps up to 18 guests each week. She has her own breakfast before preparing that of the guests. 'They get the works - porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit and croissants.' When the last of the guests has had breakfast, by about 9.30 a.m., Sarah clears up and either makes the afternoon tea, which is left for the guests to help themselves, or cleans the rooms - 'the worst part of the job,' she says. By about 11 a.m. she is ready to go on the slopes herself. She skis as much as possible. 'On a good day we can be up there until 4.30 p.m.' Sarah returns to the chalet in time to prepare dinner and takes a shower before doing so, but does not sleep. 'It's fatal if you do,' she says. Dinner, a three-course affair, is served at 8 p.m. and coffee is usually on the table by 10 p.m. Sarah clears away the dinner things and fills the dishwasher. 'There's nothing worse than coming in to a messy kitchen the next morning.' Sometimes she will stay and chat with the guests, other times they are content to be left alone. 'Good guests can make a week brilliant - breakfast this morning was great fun - but some weeks, for whatever reason, don't go quite so well.' Sarah meets her friends in the chalet where she lives - and they go out at about 11 p.m. 'We usually start off in Bananas, might go to G Jay's and perhaps Dick's T-Bar at the end of the evening,' she says. But Sarah never stays out too late on Saturday night as Sunday is her busiest time of the week. 'A frightful day,' she says, 'when you certainly don't want to be cooking breakfast with a terrible headache.' Work begins earlier than usual on Sunday, since breakfast for guests who are leaving has to be on the table by 7 a.m. As soon as the guests are gone, Sarah starts cleaning madly. 'We just blitz the place - clear the breakfast, strip the beds, get everything ready.' If she hasn't already done the week's shop on Saturday, Sarah does it now. At around 3 p.m., the cleaning work done, Sarah then prepares tea for the new guests. 'They get here at around 4.30 p.m.' Sometimes they are disorientated and full of questions. I'm sure it's the mountain air that does something to them.' Between tea and dinner, Sarah takes any guests needing boots or skis down to the ski shop and then gets a lift back to the chalet from one of the ski shop staff. It is soon time for dinner duty again and perhaps a drink later, but not always. 'Sometimes I'm so tired I just have an early night,' she says. '"
FCE_27,"Miss Rita Cohen, a small, pale-skinned girl who looked much younger than Seymour's daughter, Marie, but said she was about six years older, visited his factory one day. She wore overalls and big, unattractive shoes, and her pretty face was surrounded by a bush of wiry hair. She was so small and young-looking that Seymour found it hard to believe she was studying at the University of Pennsylvania, researching the leather industry in New Jersey for her Master's degree. A few times a year, someone would contact Seymour to ask if they could see his factory, and sometimes he would help a student by answering questions over the phone or, if they seemed very serious, by giving them a short tour. Rita Cohen seemed almost as small as the children from Marie's third-year class, who had visited the factory years ago to see how Marie's father made gloves. They especially liked the laying-off table, where the men shaped and pressed each glove by pulling it over steam-heated brass hands. These hands were very hot, shiny, and stood straight up from the table, looking thin and flat. As a child, Marie was fascinated by them and called them the 'pancake hands'. Rita asked, 'How many pieces come in a shipment?' Seymour replied, 'Between twenty and twenty-five thousand.' She kept taking notes and asked, 'Do they come directly to your shipping department?' He was pleased that she was interested in every detail. 'They go to the tannery first. The tannery is a contractor. We buy the material, and they prepare it for us to work with. My grandfather and father worked in the tannery here in town. I did too, for six months, when I started in the business. Have you ever been inside a tannery?' 'Not yet.' 'Well, you need to visit a tannery if you're going to write about leather. I can arrange that for you if you'd like. They're primitive places. Technology has improved things, but what you'll see isn't much different from hundreds of years ago. It's tough work. It's said to be the oldest industry with remains found anywhere. Six-thousand-year-old tanning relics were found in Turkey, I believe. The first clothing was just skins tanned by smoking them. I told you it was an interesting subject once you get into it. My father is the leather expert; he's the one you should talk to. Start him on gloves, and he'll talk for two days. That's typical: glove makers love the trade and everything about it. Have you ever seen anything being made, Miss Cohen?' 'I can't say I have.' 'Never seen anything made?' 'I saw my mother make a cake when I was a child.' He laughed. She made him laugh. An innocent with spirit, eager to learn. His daughter was at least 30 cm taller than Rita Cohen, fair where Rita was dark, but otherwise, Rita reminded him of Marie.

A. Raquel Graham
Raquel Graham calls from a taxi on her way to the airport. She can't meet me tomorrow because her boss needs her in Los Angeles. As a personal assistant to a pop star, she often has to travel at a moment's notice. Raquel loves her job and gets along well with her boss, but there's one small issue - she hates flying. 'On a nine-hour flight to California, I usually take sleeping pills to calm myself,' she admits. Her worst experience was flying on Concorde. 'It felt so cramped with those tiny windows.' When she's not traveling, she works in offices in Manchester and London. Her tasks include organizing the diary, attending meetings with lawyers and accountants, planning schedules, and making more travel arrangements. She didn't apply for the job; she got it after meeting a pop group's manager by chance and took a secretarial course in the evenings. Five years later, she was in the right place when her boss needed a PA.

B. David Brown
David Brown has been both an accountant and a golf caddy, someone who carries a golfer's bags. Overall, he preferred being a caddy, especially since golf is his passion. However, there are downsides. Caddies earn a small flat fee plus a percentage of the golfer's winnings, with average earnings between £25,000 and £35,000, much of which goes to travel and hotels. He started caddying for golfer Greg Norman at age 31. 'It's not just carrying bags. You give advice, use your knowledge against the weather, and try to understand the course.' His accountancy skills were recognized by European Tour Productions, who made him a statistical data administrator. He compiles and analyzes daily play statistics from cards brought in by caddies, which are used by TV commentators, golf magazines, and golfers.

C. Martin Fern
Martin Fern is the editor of the 'Food and Drink' section of a daily newspaper, and one of his easier tasks is trying food at top restaurants. What does he think about expensive restaurants? 'For those who can afford it, it's their choice,' he says. 'I'd rather spend £120 on a memorable meal than buy a microwave.' His cooking talent led to a food column offer from a friend who edited a Saturday Review. At the time, Martin was a creative director at an advertising agency, and the column was a useful extra income. He was 42 when another newspaper offered him a full-time job. 'It meant a 50% cut in guaranteed income,' he says. 'But it was a chance to turn my passion into a career.' He still cooks at home and tries to keep fit by cycling a few miles to the nearest tube station.

D. Dick Prince
'I started writing children's stories about 20 years ago,' says Dick Prince, one of Britain's most popular children's authors. 'Before that, I loved words and enjoyed using them, but mostly wrote poetry. Then I had an idea for a story. I had been a farmer and knew about the problem of foxes killing chickens. So I wrote a story with a twist called The Fox Busters, which became my first published children's book.' Where do his ideas come from? 'Well, it's not easy, I have to work at them,' he says. 'That's what I usually do in the mornings. I'm not an early riser. After lunch, I spend a couple of hours typing out the morning's notes - all with one finger on an old portable typewriter instead of a laptop. I get between 50 and 100 letters a week, and that's the part of being a writer I enjoy most. I try to answer them all, but now I have some secretarial help.'"
FCE_66,"In the lumberyard by the lake, where trees were turned into boards for building, there was an old two-story brick building. Around it were big piles of soft sawdust, like golden mountains, reaching down to the blue lake. That afternoon, with nothing else to do, Michael and his friends climbed a ladder to the roof of the old building. They sat with their legs dangling over the edge, looking at the lake. Suddenly, Michael said, ""I dare you to jump down,"" and without thinking, he jumped off the roof, landing in the sawdust and laughing. ""I dare you all!"" he shouted. ""You're all cowards,"" he teased, urging them to follow. Laughing, he watched them hesitate, but one by one, they jumped and stood up, relieved and smiling. In the hot afternoon sun, they lay on the sawdust, telling jokes until one of them suggested, ""Let's go back up and jump again."" They weren't very excited, but they climbed back up and jumped off again, determined, until only Michael was left on the roof. The others were below, grinning and calling, ""Come on, Mike. What's wrong?"" Michael wanted to join them but stayed on the roof, nervous and unsure why it seemed so much higher this time. At first, they thought he was joking, but then they saw him clenching his fists, trying to count to ten and jump, or take a deep breath and close his eyes. Eventually, they got tired of waiting and started laughing at him. ""Come on, you're a coward. Do you think we'll wait all night?"" they shouted, and when he didn't move, they began to leave, still shouting. ""Who started this? What's wrong with you?"" he called after them. But he stayed on the roof, staring unhappily at the ground. He was alone for nearly an hour as the sun, like a big orange ball, slowly set beyond the lake. His clothes were wet with nervous sweat. Finally, he closed his eyes, slipped off the roof, fell heavily into the sawdust, and lay there for a long time. The yard was silent; the workers had gone home. As he lay there, he wondered why he couldn't jump earlier. Then he got up slowly and walked home, feeling ashamed and wanting to avoid everyone. He was so late for dinner that his stepmother said coldly, ""You're old enough to get home on time. If you can't, you should stay in tonight."" She was a strong woman with fair skin, a touch of grey in her hair, and a patient smile. She spoke with controlled sternness, but Michael, with his dark, gloomy face, barely heard her. He was still thinking about the grinning faces and their laughter."
FCE_44,"Careers Advice

Are you unhappy with your current job but unsure how to make a change? Kitty Doherty offers some helpful advice. Many people looking to switch careers are turning to careers advisers for guidance. The process usually involves writing a brief personal history and taking several tests called 'psychometrics'. These tests help identify your strengths and suggest possible career paths, along with any retraining you might need.

I decided to try Career Analysts, a major career advice organization. The experience reminded me of taking science exams. I was in a group of about ten people, answering timed questions. It was important to remember that the goal wasn't to pass or fail. The psychometric tests included tasks like finding mistakes in lists of names and numbers and matching similar shapes. After the tests, I had a detailed conversation with an adviser. Based on this discussion and the test results, the adviser created a report with observations and recommendations. I agreed with most of the conclusions, although I was surprised to learn I didn't do well in scientific, technical, and practical areas. It's probably a good thing I didn't become a nurse. However, it was reassuring to hear that journalism was a good fit for me.

Changing your career doesn't always mean a complete shift. Last March, Donna Laney, 25, lost her job as a marketing manager at a large insurance company after five years. Her friends suggested she visit Career Analysts. ""Losing my job was a chance to step back and review my career,"" Donna says. Some results were unexpected. ""I didn't realize I had a talent for design, but I had to consider the cost of retraining against my financial obligations,"" she explains. Other options included taking a year off to work in the Far East. Ultimately, she decided to use her existing skills and moved into Public Relations. Donna believes she would have reached this decision on her own, but Career Analysts helped her see her options clearly. She has recommended the service to several friends, who are also satisfied.

Some people feel they wouldn't have made progress without help. A visit to Career Counselling Services led 26-year-old Juliet Greene to make significant life changes. ""After six years at a major bank, I found my job boring and wanted a new challenge. I had no idea what to do, so I went to Career Counselling Services with an open mind,"" she says. The tests showed her interest in sciences. After four sessions with an adviser, she decided to pursue a degree in geology. Juliet feels the advice was worth the cost and is now much happier and more positive.

However, careers advice doesn't work for everyone. Amanda Margetts, a 24-year-old sales representative, says, ""I was at a point in my career where I didn't know what to do next. I hoped a careers adviser might suggest something new. Although I received many ideas, I rejected them because they required a big salary cut or extensive retraining. I didn't learn anything new about myself,"" she says. ""You have to share a lot of personal information with the adviser, and I felt a friend could have given me similar advice."""
FCE_22,"Title: 'A New Experience at the Dentist's'

When you visit W. Lloyd Jerome's dental office in Glasgow, you'll notice bright, modern art on the walls and a stylish blue couch for patients. Jerome explains that half of the people only visit the dentist when they are in pain because they are scared. To change this, he has created a welcoming environment. He doesn't wear a white coat because it reminds people of pain. Jerome believes dental visits should be relaxing and even enjoyable.

This approach is surprising for many who associate dental visits with pain or clinical settings. Jerome says that if patients are relaxed and entertained, they will forget past negative experiences. One of his new techniques is using virtual-reality headsets. His practice was the first in Britain to use them, and they are very popular. During the initial check-up, patients sit on the blue couch and watch a film about underwater wildlife while Jerome examines their teeth. Then, the headset shows a camera view inside their mouth, which most patients find interesting.

The dental office also smells pleasant, like a perfume shop. Today, it smells of orange. Jerome believes that smell is important because the typical dental smell can make people anxious. I found the scent in the office very nice.

Although Jerome is known as a fashionable dentist, he emphasizes that he takes his work seriously. Relaxation is important, but the quality of treatment is the top priority. For example, he uses a tool that sprays warm water to clean teeth instead of scraping them. It feels unusual at first, but it's not painful if you're relaxed.

Five years ago, Jerome went to the U.S. to learn about dental techniques. He discovered that making things easier for patients also makes it easier for dentists. He sees his patient-focused approach as a step towards less formality in British dentistry.

As a patient arrives, Jerome offers him tea, asks what video he wants to watch, and gently leads him to the chair. The patient seems to enjoy this luxurious treatment, and it's easy to see why. The office feels more like a beauty salon than a typical dental practice."
FCE_39,"Title: The Rise of Chocolate

Chocolate, originally from South America, is now a huge global industry. In the UK, people spend over £230 million on chocolate during Easter, with 8% of all chocolate sales happening at this time. Only Christmas sees more chocolate consumption. While large-scale chocolate production started in the 19th century, the cacao plant was first grown by the Aztec, Toltec, and Mayan civilizations in Central America over 3,000 years ago. 

The cacao tree is a tropical evergreen found in Africa, the Americas, the West Indies, and Southeast Asia. Its fruit is the size of a melon and contains 20-40 seeds. When dried, these seeds become cacao beans, often called cocoa beans due to a 17th-century spelling error. The Aztecs used these beans as currency and to make a drink called xocoatl, meaning 'bitter water' in their language, Nahuatl. This drink was spiced and used in ceremonies and to welcome guests. The Spanish later added cinnamon and sugar to make it more enjoyable, but it took another century for the recipe to spread across Europe.

In the late 1600s, chocolate houses opened in European capitals, where people gathered to drink chocolate. Until the 19th century, chocolate drinks were made from solid blocks of chocolate melted in hot water. In 1826, CJ van Houten from the Netherlands created chocolate powder by removing most of the cocoa butter from the beans. The chocolate bar as we know it began in 1847 when Fry and Sons in Bristol combined cocoa butter with chocolate liquor and sugar to make a solid, edible block. A Swiss company later added milk solids, creating milk chocolate.

By the early 1900s, French companies dominated the British chocolate market. In 1879, Cadbury named their Birmingham factory Bournville, hoping to add a touch of French elegance. However, Cadbury's Dairy Milk bar, launched as Dairymaid in 1905, became popular due to clever advertising linking it to the health benefits of English countryside milk. Today, chocolate consumption in Britain is stable at about four bars per week, prompting manufacturers to innovate with products like chocolate-flavored ice creams, drinks, and desserts to attract customers.

Meanwhile, cacao farmers have struggled since a price crash in the late 1980s. Many small-scale farmers went out of business. So, next time you enjoy a chocolate bar, consider the challenges faced by those who grow the cacao."
FCE_18,"**THE SHELL ARTIST**

Peter Cooke, at 83, has mastered the art of creating unique objects from shells. Although he is interested in trying other crafts like paper-making and feather-work, he is currently focused on his shell art, which he has been perfecting for the past ten years. As he shows me around his apartment, he worries about being boring, but his enthusiasm and the beauty of his work are captivating.

Cooke points out a pair of shell-covered ornaments above his fireplace, saying he wouldn't mind if they don't sell because he finds them adorable. He never intended to sell his work, but friends encouraged him to hold an exhibition. This led to a successful show in London, where 70% of his pieces were sold. His second exhibition just opened, featuring 86 pieces with prices starting at £225 for a shell-flower in a crystal vase. Some pieces, like the ornaments, sell for around £2,000.

Cooke is open about the high prices, explaining that his work is unique. The gallery owner told him that once he stops creating, his pieces will become even more sought after. Cooke wishes he had started this craft earlier, as he feels physically limited now, but he continues to produce remarkable work.

His creations are far from the typical shell souvenirs found in seaside shops. He has developed his own techniques, using materials like cardboard from laundered shirts and a special glue from a sail-maker. He washes the shells with washing-up liquid. Cooke describes his process as having an idea that ""just does itself,"" but the precision and detail in his work suggest otherwise.

To find beautiful and tiny shells, Cooke has traveled beyond his local Norfolk shore to places like France, Thailand, Mexico, South Africa, and the Philippines. He only collects dead shells and defends himself against accusations of harming the environment. He argues that many shells are crushed by people or broken by the sea, so collecting empty ones is harmless. His work, which often enhances the natural beauty of the shells, supports his argument."
FCE_62,"The Schoolgirl Model

When 15-year-old Kira Langer isn't traveling to amazing places and appearing on magazine covers, she's likely studying for her school exams. Jane Laidlaw learns more about her.

The receptionist at the agency told me, ""Kira will be a little late."" I said, ""That's fine, no problem."" I was trying to ignore the negative stereotypes about models being difficult, vain, and unintelligent. Now, she was late. How late would she be? An hour? Three hours? Maybe she wouldn't come at all. What if she decided to go to the hairdresser instead of meeting me? If she was late, she might be in a bad mood and not want to answer my questions.

But when Kira, the winner of the Looks magazine supermodel competition, arrived, she was smiling, relaxed, and apologetic, and she came with her mother. Kira wasn't wearing expensive designer clothes, just a simple black dress and trainers. She didn't seem selfish at all; she was just a friendly, tall, and pretty girl. Kira explained that all models under 16 must have an adult with them when they work. Her mother looked like a normal, proud mom of a successful daughter.

Kira seems a bit surprised by her sudden fame, which makes sense since it was unexpected. Her older sister was the one who suggested she enter the model competition. ""She saw the competition and said I should enter,"" Kira recalls. ""I said no, but she sent some photos in anyway."" When Kira found out she was a finalist, she was at school. Being selected for the final gave her the confidence to go through with it, and she performed perfectly. She won easily, and the Select model agency in London offered her work right away.

Kira now finds it challenging to balance her two separate lives. But her friends and teachers are used to having a star among them. ""They're really proud of me,"" she says. However, some unkind people at her school make rude comments about her success. ""They say I think too highly of myself."" This must be tough for Kira, as she is not self-important. She says, ""They think that because I've become a model, I can't stay the same. But the only thing that's changed is I've become more confident—not in a bad way, but I can stand up for myself more.""

As a busy model, her social life is affected. The Select agency can call anytime and tell her she has a job the next day. ""If my friends are going out, I can't say I'll come because I don't know what I'm doing the next day. I can't really make plans, and if I do, they sometimes get canceled, but my friends are understanding. They don't say, 'Oh, you're always off modeling now, you never have time for us.'""

Kira has the looks, talent, and support for a great career ahead of her. Not many people can say that before they even finish their school exams. As I finish the interview with this successful girl, I ask what she would like to do if she didn't have the beauty that seems to promise a top career in modeling. She pauses and replies, ""I'd like to do what you're doing."""
FCE_49,"Father and son, Terence and Chris Madden, have traveled from Canada's cold north to Africa's heat in search of gold. Terence, an explorer, and Chris, a mineral expert, believe their mine on a Welsh mountain might have up to 10,000 ounces of gold. After ten years of digging, they think they are close to finding a gold vein worth five million dollars. Terence, 68, from Liverpool, said they are finding high levels of gold and need to dig a few more meters to reach the concentrated area.

Their gold search began when Terence read about valuable gold deposits in the 'Dolgellau gold belt' near the Welsh town of Dolgellau. They studied 19th-century mining journals and newspapers at the Welsh National Library in Aberystwyth to choose the best land to explore. After clearing the area and finding gold bits in the rocks, they spent ten years getting permission from landowners, taking earth samples, and removing old cars and rubbish. They dug out 150 tonnes of greenstone rock to make a tunnel and a 10-meter shaft. Now, they are running out of money and need to find someone to invest £50,000 to dig a few more meters to reach the gold. Chris Madden says finding a backer is uncertain, but they have some contacts.

As news of their dig spread, the allure of gold caught the attention of locals and gold diggers. Dolgellau depends on tourists, and residents are hopeful. Peter Woolven, manager of the Royal Ship Hotel, said more people might visit if the Maddens find gold, but he hopes it won't lead to many people damaging the hillside. The Welsh gold industry has declined since the late 1880s when many mines employed thousands. One of the last mines, Clogau-St David's, which made wedding rings for the Queen and the Princess of Wales, closed recently. However, individual gold diggers are returning. George Hall, another prospector, plans to dig a tunnel on the other side of the ridge from the Maddens. Hall, 70, says searching for gold is emotional, adventurous, and exciting, with the hope of finding hidden treasure."
FCE_31,"IN HOT WATER

Rachel Mills is a scientist who loves exploring the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She works at Southampton University as a lecturer and researcher in marine geochemistry, studying the chemical processes in the sea. When she's not teaching, she dives three kilometers down into the Atlantic Ocean in a small steel vehicle, about the size of a car, to study underwater volcanoes. Inside the vehicle, space is so tight that she can touch the two pilots. They are used to these cramped conditions, where they can't stand or move, and must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive lasts 16 hours: three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours collecting rock and water samples, and three hours to return to the surface. If there's an emergency, they can press a panic button, which releases a small escape vessel that quickly rises to the surface, like a ping-pong ball in water. No one has tested it yet, but Rachel thinks it wouldn't be a pleasant ride.

Rachel remembers her first time in the vehicle. She was on a ship's deck with an instructor who explained the emergency procedures, including what to do if the pilot had a heart attack. They wanted to see how she would handle being in such a small space. Now, Rachel has made six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian crew to a site five days' sail west of the Canary Islands. There, on the ocean floor, is a large area of underwater volcanoes with chimneys blowing out black smoke. The Russian team was setting up scientific equipment to study the effects of a project that would drill a 150-meter hole through a volcano.

When she's not at sea, Rachel is in her office at the Oceanography Centre in Southampton. She spends two-thirds of her time teaching, which she enjoys, but she does it to support her research on ""black smokers."" These are underwater volcanoes where water comes out of the rock, looking like black smoke. It flows out at one meter per second and at a temperature of 350 degrees Celsius. The only time Rachel felt scared was during a dive with an American team. They were towing equipment on a 50-meter rope when there was a sudden explosion. The shock waves hit their vehicle, and Rachel thought she was going to die. They waited in silence, and when nothing happened, they were incredibly relieved to be alive.

Diving to the deepest part of the ocean is an adventure for Rachel. Every time she looks out of the porthole and sees the chimneys, she feels a sense of wonder. She is at the bottom of the sea, seeing something no one else on Earth has seen before. After studying the black smokers for three years for her PhD, seeing them in person was an amazing experience."
FCE_58,"I was dirty, smelly, hungry, and somewhere under all that, suntanned. It was the end of my Inter-Rail holiday. My body couldn't handle any more stress. My mind was tired of dealing with foreign timetables, currencies, and languages. ""Never again,"" I said as I stepped onto home ground. I said the same thing the next year. And the year after that. All I had to do was buy one train ticket, and because I was under twenty-five, I could spend a whole month traveling anywhere in Europe. Once you've learned to sleep in a train corridor, ordinary beds never feel the same. The train's rhythm rocks you into a deep sleep. Carrying everything you own in a backpack makes you travel simply and can lead to burning socks that have become too smelly and getting rid of books when you're done with them. This way of living fits the spirit of Inter-Rail, where common sense and reasoning can be tossed out along with the paperback book and the socks. All it takes to feel this carefree is one of those tickets in your hand. Any system that lets young people travel through countries at a rate of more than one a day must be special. On our first trip, my friends and I didn't realize the potential of this train ticket. We thought it was just a cheap way to get to and from our chosen campsite in southern France. But the idea of non-stop travel was too tempting because there was always one more country over the border, always a little further to go. And what did the extra miles cost us? Nothing. We weren't completely uninterested in culture. But this was our first holiday without parents, like it was for most other Inter-Railers, and we only included the most accessible sights in our schedule. This was our chance to escape the guided tour and do something different. I was proud that, in many places, all I bothered to see was the view from the station. We were just there to get by and have a good time doing so. In this, we were no different from most of the other Inter-Railers with whom we shared corridor floors, food and water, money, and music. The excitement of travel comes from the sudden reality of a place that was just a name before. It's as if the city you arrive in never existed until the train pulls into the station and you see it with your own tired eyes for the first time. Only by actually seeing Europe, by watching the changing landscapes and noticing the differences in attitudes and lifestyles, can you really have an accurate picture of the continent in your mind. Everyone knows what's there, but it's meaningless until you see it yourself. This is why other people's holiday photos are so boring. While the train trip won't let you discover anything new in a global sense, it is a valuable personal experience. Europe is a big place, and Inter-Rail gives people the best chance to realize this, though in our case, it didn't happen immediately."
FCE_37,"Arriving at an airport in another country only to find out your baggage is missing is very frustrating. At best, you'll have to wear the same clothes for hours or days until the airline returns your luggage. At worst, you might be in a completely different climate, far from home, and stuck with unsuitable clothing. Airlines don't often disclose how many bags they lose, but frequent travelers will eventually face this issue. Even top airlines make mistakes, and no airline can guarantee your checked luggage will be on the same flight, especially if you have to change planes.

Here's how the system works: Airlines require you to check in early to give enough time for your baggage to be processed and loaded onto the plane. Minimum connecting times (MCTs) are set to ensure there's enough time to transfer luggage between flights. Usually, this system works well. However, extra security checks and air traffic issues can delay flights, causing the baggage system to fail. Human error or accidents, like a torn-off destination label, can also cause problems. These issues are more common at large transfer airports, or 'hubs', due to the high volume of bags. For example, last year, London's Heathrow airport handled over 41 million passengers, with nine million changing planes. British Airways alone managed two million transfer passengers at Heathrow, often between Terminal 1 and Terminal 4. Even efficient airports like Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Singapore, and Zurich have their off days. The risk of losing baggage is higher at certain airports. In the U.S., Miami airport is known for losing luggage when passengers connect to Latin America.

To avoid losing your luggage, choose direct flights when possible and check in early. If you must change planes or want a cheaper flight, try to stick with the same airline. Allow extra time for connections by taking an earlier flight to the transfer airport, and label your luggage inside and out with your home and holiday addresses, including flight numbers. If your luggage still goes missing, contact the airline official in the baggage hall and fill out a property irregularity report (PIR) before leaving the airport."
FCE_2,"Charlie James is a wildlife photographer who specializes in kingfishers, which are beautiful blue-green birds that live near streams and rivers and eat fish. These birds are often seen in areas where old trees hang over the water, creating a mix of soft greens, browns, and yellows from the sunlight. The kingfisher moves quickly and directly through this scene, like a flash of light, leaving a lasting impression despite its small size.

Charlie fell in love with kingfishers when he was young. He can't quite explain why he is so drawn to them, but they are legendary birds. In Greek mythology, the kingfisher was a moon goddess who became a bird. Another story says the kingfisher flew so high that its top turned blue like the sky, and its underside was burned by the sun. Scientifically, kingfishers don't have blue pigment in their feathers. Instead, the structure of their feathers reflects light in a way that makes them look blue, and they can appear green depending on the light.

Many wildlife photographers are fascinated by kingfishers because of their colors and the fact that, while they are shy, they can be observed from a hidden spot. Charlie's first hideout was an old blanket he used to cover himself while waiting for a kingfisher. The bird came close, but it took him four years to get a good picture. During this time, he became very focused on the European kingfisher, the only one of its family that breeds in Europe. He spent as much time as possible by streams rich with kingfishers, even skipping school, which led to him being considered an 'academic failure.'

However, his passion was noticed, and at 16, he was hired as an advisor for a nature magazine. He later worked as an assistant to the editor and eventually became a freelance wildlife film cameraman. Now, he dreams of making the ultimate kingfisher film, with no words, just beautiful images. He loves the simple approach and enjoys photographing parts of the kingfisher's wings. His photos express his deep connection with the bird, but he knows there's more to his relationship with kingfishers than his work can show."
FCE_68,"**Conducting an Orchestra: Insights from Five New Conductors**

**A. Anne Manson**  
Anne Manson, 30, had an unexpected opportunity when she asked to observe conductor Claudio Abbado's rehearsals in Vienna. She ended up filling in for an absent assistant and was later invited to assist with another opera. Manson, who is American, works with a London-based opera company that focuses on modern pieces. She is gaining recognition in Europe, supported by the British Arts Council, and has worked with Abbado on several occasions since her first experience.

**B. Andrew Constantine**  
Andrew Constantine, 31, believes the hardest part of conducting is convincing people to give you opportunities. He won a major competition in 1991 after failing in two others. He feels the timing was perfect, as earlier success might have led to obscurity. The competition opened doors for him, including a role as an assistant to a renowned conductor. However, he is concerned about being permanently labeled as a ""competition winner."" He notes that orchestras like the English Chamber Orchestra, which hired him post-competition, are inviting him back, which is crucial for sustaining his career.

**C. Wasfi Kani**  
Wasfi Kani, founder of Pimlico Opera, enjoys the extensive rehearsal periods in opera production. She began conducting seriously in her late twenties. After university, she worked in London's business sector until Pimlico Opera became fully professional. Lessons with Sian Edwards were pivotal for her, as Edwards was similar in stature, unlike her previous teachers. Kani appreciates the complexity of opera, including managing singers' personalities and frequent disagreements.

**D. Roger Vignoles**  
Roger Vignoles, 48, found conducting unexpectedly intriguing. His background as a resident musician at an opera house and experience with skilled conductors prepared him for this role. Last year, he directed Handel's ""Agrippina"" from the piano at a festival, which was less challenging than anticipated. He realized he knew the music well and aimed to achieve his desired performance. Vignoles values the respect he has earned as a musician and is open to exploring various opportunities to discover his preferences.

**E. Wayne Marshall**  
Wayne Marshall, now 32, was noticed by conductor Simon Rattle in 1986, which led to his first conducting job in London on short notice. Despite the challenge, including dealing with musicians who were not fully engaged, he maintained a firm approach and clear direction. Marshall, who has never formally studied conducting, believes in expressing his needs confidently. He acknowledges the kindness of others in his journey and is determined to pursue what he enjoys."
FCE_23,"**Variations on a Theme**

If you're planning to take children to a theme park in Britain, there are many options available. We asked five families to try out some of the best ones.

**Fun Island - The Burns Family**

Last year, we visited a large theme park in the US, so we thought Fun Island might not be as exciting. However, we were pleasantly surprised. The park is great for younger children, so our three-year-old felt included. The kids loved the Crocodile Ride and the Giant Wheel. There’s a special dodgems ride for very young kids, which was a big hit. For older children, there are more thrilling rides like Splash Out, where you end up in a pool! After five hours, Steve and I were ready to leave, but the kids wanted to stay because they were having so much fun. Our only complaint is that the park lacks a bit of atmosphere, and the scenery could be better. However, the staff are very helpful, and the park is clean, well-organized, and focused on safety.

**Wonderland - The McMillan Family**

None of us had been to a theme park before, so we didn’t know what to expect. We thought Oscar might be too young, but he loved it. He was thrilled with the Mountain Train and especially liked Little Land, which has small models of famous buildings at his height! The older kids enjoyed the ferris wheel and driving toy cars on a real road layout. We spent six hours there and appreciated the places to rest. The landscaping is beautiful, and the staff are friendly and helpful. There’s something for everyone, including adults.

**Adventure World - The Jeffree Family**

After seven hours, we still had more to see. The children loved the Big Top Circus, which had an amazing trapeze act that kept us excited. We went on the Terror Line, and although the girls were scared and kept their eyes shut, they said they enjoyed it. Their favorite ride was Running River, where you think you’ll get wet, but you don’t. For younger kids, Toy Land is great fun. The children looked at the new ride, Fear Factor, but we were relieved they were too small to go on it! The park is well-designed, so even waiting in line isn’t too boring. It’s very clean, and the staff are excellent. On one ride, I couldn’t sit with both girls, so a staff member offered to go with one of them.

**The Great Park - The Langridge Family**

We arrived at 1 p.m. and were disappointed that the park closed at 5 p.m. This is a great theme park for younger children because the rides aren’t too scary. I’m usually scared, but I enjoyed myself. We all loved Exotic Travels, a boat ride that starts calmly and then becomes really fun. We waited for half an hour for Lightning River, and it was over quickly! I didn’t go on the Big Leap, but it looked exciting if you’re brave enough. If the kids were older, they might have found it a bit tame, but they were the right age and loved it.

**Fantasy World - The Break-all Family**

The park advertises 'No Limit to the Fun,' and we felt that was true. Europe’s tallest roller-coaster, the Rocket, stands out, and Ben thought it was the scariest ride, although Jennie said the Hanger, where you hang upside-down 30 meters above the ground, was even scarier! There are about a dozen main rides, which the older kids went on several times. Sarah was too small for a few of them but enjoyed the Long Slide. We found the staff’s attitudes varied. Some were great with younger kids, but the welcome wasn’t always warm. You need a full day to enjoy Fantasy World. We wouldn’t have dared tell the kids we were leaving early."
FCE_60,"Running a business in the countryside: Five women share their experiences.

A. CHRISTINE HOGAN runs a computer-aided design business with a yearly turnover of over £200,000 and employs four full-time staff. She says, ""My customers are friends."" Christine and her husband moved from London to the countryside when their children were young. She wanted a job she could do from home, so she started a computer-aided design business, using her previous experience with computers. It required a lot of money initially, and the start was tough. She was careful with finances, always informing the bank manager if she might overspend. Working from home saves money, and she can work in the evenings if needed. The business remains small, with local clients often picking up their work.

B. MAGGY SASANOW, a greetings card designer, enjoys her independence. She studied art at university and initially wanted to work in a museum. After marrying and moving to the countryside, where museum jobs were scarce, she started her own business. She creates 50 different greetings cards, selling them to museums. She works from a large room at home. The downside of working from home is the constant distraction of household chores. Her business grows through word of mouth, without advertising. Although she misses exchanging ideas with others, she finds more benefits than drawbacks in her work.

C. DELIA TURNER runs a curtain-making business that has faced ups and downs. She started eight years ago when the industry was growing, and her turnover increased from £24,000 to £80,000 in two years. She once managed six full-time staff but had to let them go due to economic decline, which was difficult as jobs are scarce in her area. Now, she makes curtains at home with her husband's help and employs women who work from their homes. She adapts by lowering prices when needed and exploring new opportunities.

D. TESSA STRICKLAND manages the editorial and production side of her children's book publishing business from her farmhouse. She moved to the countryside three years ago for financial reasons and her love of the country. She enjoys flexible working hours, as 80% of her income comes from international deals, requiring her to take calls at odd hours. The challenge is maintaining discipline to stop working. Her business publishes children's books from various cultures, collaborating with authors and artists. Initially, she felt isolated, having worked in London before.

E. MEG RIVERS runs a cakes-by-post business and a shop with a turnover of £250,000 a year, employing six people, some part-time. She started at home ten years ago, focusing on healthy fruit cakes with quality ingredients. As demand grew, she began sending cakes nationwide. Seven years ago, she rented a small building for production, employing a baker, assistant, and professional cake decorator. She now manages the business side and no longer bakes. Her biggest challenge has been financial, as they started with limited funds."
FCE_1,"Meet the Amazing Watkins Family

The Watkins family is unique because not only are the sons talented musicians and composers, but their father, John, also makes musical instruments. When John and Hetty Watkins, both schoolteachers from South Wales, needed a cello for their ten-year-old son Paul, they found the cost too high. John decided to try making one himself. He attended evening classes at the Welsh School of Instrument Making for about three years. After practicing on violins and violas, he successfully made his first cello for Paul. Paul used this cello until recently, as John improved his skills and made another one for him.

John has since retired from teaching to become a full-time craftsman, making up to twelve violins a year. Selling a violin to the famous American musician Jaime Laredo was a highlight for him. Both Paul and his younger brother, Huw, were encouraged to play music from a young age. Paul started with the piano and then moved to the cello, inspired by a cellist in his father's music group. Although his parents wanted him to play the violin, Paul preferred the cello. Huw, on the other hand, chose to play the piano and compose music.

Huw, now 22, is making a name for himself as a pianist and composer. Paul, with his father's cello, won the string final of the BBC Young Musician of the Year competition. At just 20, he became the principal cellist of the BBC Symphony Orchestra, a position he held until last year. He now plays a Francesco Rugeri cello, on loan from the Royal Academy of Music. John admits that the Rugeri has a special quality, but believes his own cello will improve with age.

Paul will soon perform Elgar's Cello Concerto on television with the Rugeri cello. However, he won't be able to watch himself, as he will be performing at the Cheltenham Festival the same night. Huw will also be busy, as his String Quartet will premiere in London at the Wigmore Hall. John and Hetty will need to be both diplomatic and energetic to keep up with their sons' busy musical schedules in the coming weeks."
FCE_53,"The National Trust is an organization that aims to protect the British countryside. Gill Page visits the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales and talks to Gareth Roberts, a warden for the Trust. According to Gareth, a warden needs common sense and good people skills because they work with farmers, visitors, conservationists, and builders. Gareth grew up on the Lleyn Peninsula and worked on his family's farm before becoming a warden. Although he didn't have formal training, his local knowledge and farming experience helped him get the job. 

Gareth finds it useful that he still farms with his parents, as it helps him understand farmers' issues. His farming background also makes him physically fit for tasks like building fences, planting trees, and constructing walls. Working with the Trust has taught him more about nature conservation. He remembers collecting flowers and bird nests as a child and realizes how farming has changed the countryside. He believes it's not the farmers' fault, as they were following government advice.

Initially, farmers and conservationists disagreed, but now they communicate better and understand each other's perspectives. Gareth believes they are close to working together. His job involves conservation, managing public access to Trust land, planting trees, and meeting tenant farmers. He ensures tasks are completed efficiently and enjoys seeing projects finished, although he spends a lot of time on paperwork.

Gareth loves his job, even though he's always on duty. He enjoys talking to the public, except for those who act entitled. He finds dealing with such attitudes frustrating but believes common sense is key. If you have common sense and like outdoor work, you might consider becoming a warden like Gareth. However, don't expect a job opening on the Lleyn Peninsula anytime soon!"
FCE_55,"Text: 'The Netball Captain In our series on women in sport, Suzie Ellis met with England's netball captain. Kendra Slowinski leads England's netball team. When I met her, she was having a typical day leading up to next month's World Championships: teaching at a local school and then training in a supermarket car park. 'Don't you get strange looks?' I asked. 'I'm too focused on my movements and my feet to notice anything else. I might see cars slow down from the corner of my eye, but that's it.' 'My whole life now is about being at my best for the Championships,' says Kendra. 'I'm on a strict schedule to get as fit as possible.' These are her fourth World Championships, and they will be the biggest ever, with 27 countries participating. 'We'll have home support, which is special,' she says. 'It's important to improve netball's reputation in this country. Playing here means more pressure. A home crowd will have expectations and give more support. People will expect us to start the tournament well.' Their first game is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. 'As far as I know, we've always beaten them, but they'll be exciting to play. They have a lot of skill.' The England team is currently ranked fourth in the world. But, as Kendra points out, the World Championships will be tough. 'You have to push yourself to play every day, there's no rest between games like in a series. You can still win a series if you lose the first game, but the Championships are different because there's only one chance, and you have to be ready to make the most of it.' In the fifteen years she's been playing at the top level, the sport has become harder and faster. On the court, players are more aggressive. 'You don't train so hard not to win,' says Kendra. 'But once the final whistle blows, you become a different person. We're all friendlier after the game.' Netball is also using a more scientific approach to fitness testing. 'It's essential that we all think and train like world-class players,' says Kendra. 'As captain, I think it's important to have a strong mental attitude and lead by example. I see my role as supporting and encouraging the team.' 'From the start, my netball career has been carefully planned,' she says. 'I decided some time ago that this competition would be my last as a player.' She will likely coach young players in the future, but for now, she is focused on her last big event. As she leads her team in the opening candlelight ceremony, she might have a tear in her eye.'"
FCE_50,"Text: 'SPECIALIST MUSIC SCHOOLS How should parents handle a child with exceptional musical talent? It's not always obvious how to nurture and support their gift. Some parents might not even notice their child's needs until frustration leads to difficult behavior. While most schools can support academically gifted children, musically talented ones need special attention that regular schools might not provide, especially if music is seen as a secondary subject. These children, along with those encouraged by parents or teachers, might benefit from attending a specialist music school. In Britain, there are five such schools, which are relatively new. They offer a supportive environment for gifted children aged seven to eighteen to fully develop their skills with guidance from professional musicians. At these schools, students spend one-third to half of their day on music activities, such as individual lessons (up to three hours a week on their main and secondary instruments), orchestras, chamber groups, voice training, conducting, and music theory. They also practice for several hours daily in well-equipped private rooms, sometimes with a teacher. The rest of their time is spent on a limited academic program focusing on essential subjects like English, math, basic sciences, and languages, though students can study more subjects if they wish. All five British specialist schools are independent, with small classes and a high teacher-to-student ratio. Most students are boarders, living at the school full-time, which means they grow up with peers who share similar goals and interests. What are the downsides? One major issue is the cost; boarding fees range from £12,000 to £17,000 a year. However, schools try to help parents of exceptionally talented children with scholarships and financial aid. Another concern is that not all parents want to send their children to boarding school, especially at a young age. Many school directors question the wisdom of admitting children as young as seven into such a demanding environment. They emphasize, though, that their goal is to develop 'well-rounded and balanced individuals'. Separating musically gifted children early can be stressful. Musical talent might fade during teenage years, and the pressure to succeed can lead to a sense of failure. However, specialist schools closely monitor each student's progress and provide help and advice if needed. While most former students feel they gained a lot from the high-quality music education, many question the limited academic program, which is secondary to music activities. Many musically talented young people are also very intelligent and can handle academic challenges, feeling frustrated if their intellectual needs aren't met. For these reasons, it might be better to wait until the child is old enough to decide for themselves before considering specialist education. Those who are also academically gifted might thrive in a less specialized setting, like a school with an excellent music department, or by combining regular schooling with music training at junior departments of music colleges. These colleges offer Saturday morning lessons with top teachers and orchestral and chamber music experience. However, this option isn't feasible for families living far from London or other major cities.'"
FCE_25,"Artist Susan Shepherd is famous for her flower paintings. Her house is surrounded by a large garden, which provides many of her painting subjects. The garden is filled with her favorite flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some plants grow wildly and spread throughout the garden. The garden has a beautiful mix of colors, shapes, and structures, especially in the two long flower borders along the path that goes from east to west. This beauty is partly thanks to the previous owners, who loved gardening and left plants that Susan liked. She also inherited their gardener, Danny. Susan says, ""It was really his garden."" They got along well, and although Danny initially doubted some of her choices, he understood her vision when she explained she wanted to paint them.

Susan prefers to paint detailed studies of individual plants rather than the whole garden. Sometimes she paints groups of plants in their natural setting, but usually, she picks them and takes them to her studio. She explains, ""I don't set everything up at once. I paint one flower, which might take a few days, then add another, building the painting over time. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish."" Her busiest time is spring and early summer when tulips and poppies bloom. She finds the process of flowers decaying fascinating. For example, tulips change shape and open up when left in water, becoming more interesting over time.

Susan has always been interested in plants. She studied botany in school and collected wildflowers from the countryside. She wasn't interested in gardening back then and didn't like garden flowers, thinking they looked artificial. She admired wildflowers for their ability to grow in difficult places, like rock cracks or cliff tops. Today, her garden includes plants from distant lands, which thrive as if they were in their native China or the Himalayas. She has a relaxed approach to gardening, similar to an aunt who lets children play freely as long as they don't cause harm.

With two upcoming exhibitions and plenty of subjects to paint, Susan finds it hard to spend time gardening. She now has an extra gardener to help, but she believes that to stay connected to her work, ""you have to get your hands dirty."""
FCE_34,"Text: 'Keeping the holiday-makers happy A chalet girl's work is never done, Sarah Sutherland-Pilch tells Veronica Lee - in between making beds and delicious dinners. This is the second year as a chalet girl for Sarah Sutherland-Pilch, a 24-year-old from West Sussex. Known by her nickname, Pilch, Sarah works for a company in Val d'Isère, France, cooking and cleaning for visitors who come to ski and stay in the wooden houses, known as chalets, that are characteristic of the area. Sarah graduated in French and History of Art from Oxford Brookes University last summer. Being a chalet girl isn't a career, she says, but an enjoyable way to spend a year or two before settling down. 'It's a good way to make contacts. I meet successful people every week.' Sarah does not 'live in'. She gets up at 7 a.m. to walk the mile or so to the chalet, which sleeps up to 18 guests each week. She has her own breakfast before preparing that of the guests. 'They get the works - porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants.' When the last of the guests has had breakfast, by about 9:30 a.m., Sarah clears up and either makes the afternoon tea, which is left for the guests to help themselves to, or cleans the rooms - 'the worst part of the job,' she says. By about 11 a.m. she is ready to go on the slopes herself. She skis as much as possible. 'On a good day we can be up there until 4:30 p.m.' Sarah returns to the chalet in time to prepare dinner and takes a shower before doing so, but does not sleep. 'It's fatal if you do,' she says. Dinner, a three-course affair, is served at 8 p.m. and coffee is usually on the table by 10 p.m. Sarah clears away the dinner things and fills the dishwasher. 'There's nothing worse than coming in to a messy kitchen the next morning.' Sometimes she will stay and chat with the guests, other times they are content to be left alone. 'Good guests can make a week brilliant - breakfast this morning was great fun - but some weeks, for whatever reason, don't go quite so well.' Sarah meets her friends in the chalet where she lives - and they go out at about 11 p.m. 'We usually start off in Bananas, might go to G Jay's and perhaps Dick's T-Bar at the end of the evening,' she says. But Sarah never stays out too late on Saturday night as Sunday is her busiest time of the week. 'A frightful day,' she says, 'when you certainly don't want to be cooking breakfast feeling exhausted.' Work begins earlier than usual on Sunday, since breakfast for guests who are leaving has to be on the table by 7 a.m. As soon as the guests are gone, Sarah starts cleaning madly. 'We just blitz the place - clear the breakfast, strip the beds, get everything ready.' If she hasn't already done the week's shop on Saturday, Sarah does it now. At around 3 p.m., the cleaning work done, Sarah then prepares tea for the new guests. 'They get here at around 4:30 p.m. Sometimes they are disoriented and full of questions. I'm sure it's the mountain air that does something to them.' Between tea and dinner, Sarah takes any guests needing boots or skis down to the ski shop and then gets a lift back to the chalet from one of the ski shop staff. It is soon time for dinner duty again and perhaps a chat with friends, but not always. 'Sometimes I'm so tired I just have an early night,' she says.'"

Mandie Currie, a zoo-keeper, spent a day at the magazine Marie Claire. ""Choosing what to wear was hard because I usually wear a uniform. I visited a photo studio and press previews before lunch. The zoo is calm, but here I was rushing around. Some fashion team members seemed stressed, unlike my job, which isn't pressured. At a fashion shoot, I laughed thinking I'd usually be cleaning cages or handling rats. I'm interested in how magazines work, but I love my zoo job, so I'll stay.""

Alice Cutler, a fashion assistant at Marie Claire, spent a day at London Zoo. ""I arrived in leather boots and dark trousers, but the zoo gave me a green polo shirt, which was good because I got dirty. As I stroked an elephant, I thought Mandie was probably packing clothes. By five o'clock, I smelled bad but had a great day. When I retire from fashion, I might work with elephants, maybe in Africa.""

Karen Hodson, a nurse at Hammersmith Hospital, joined the TV gardening show Ground Force. ""I was excited to meet the team, and Alan Titchmarsh, the presenter, was nice. I liked being in the fresh air since I sometimes don't see daylight due to my shifts. It was hard work but fun. I thought I was strong, but I felt weak compared to the team. My idea of gardening didn't include hard work or planning. I'm more enthusiastic than effective, so I won't leave my nursing job.""

Charlie Dimmock, a landscape gardener with Ground Force, worked at Hammersmith Hospital. ""I made beds and gave out tablets. I thought I'd faint, but I was fine. The nurses' friendship was great, and it felt very 'girlie' compared to my usual male environment. My job feels like a waste compared to nursing. My day at the hospital wasn't pleasant, but it was satisfying.""

Lucy Harvey, a personal trainer, spent a day with Ryanair as cabin crew. ""I changed into the uniform and felt different—people respected me. Before the flight, we learned about safety and handling heart attacks, which I knew from fitness training. On the flight to Paris, I gave out magazines and felt self-conscious. On the return, we had 80 schoolchildren who wouldn't sit still. I wished I was back in the gym with one adult.""

Sonia McDermott, an air hostess with Ryanair, spent a day as a personal trainer. ""I was nervous because I don't exercise. I was surprised by the attention given to one person. In my job, I meet 130 passengers four times a day. At lunch, I was surprised some trainers didn't eat super healthy, but they drank lots of water. I wouldn't swap my job, but it inspired me to join a gym and be healthier."""
FCE_26,"**On the Rails: Five Celebrities Share Their Favorite Train Journey Memories**

**Andrea Thompson - Newsreader**  
I fell in love with the south of France a long time ago and try to visit as often as I can. There's a local train from Cannes that travels along the coast and crosses into Italy. It offers stunning views of the sea, no matter the weather or season. On the other side, you can see some of the most beautiful gardens and homes in France, making you feel like you're peeking into the lives of the rich and famous. The passengers are always lively, a mix of tourists and locals, all enjoying the breathtaking journey.

**Raj Patel - Explorer**  
I've enjoyed many train journeys, but my favorite is the Nile Valley Express, which travels across the desert in northern Sudan. Growing up in South Africa, I missed a family train trip from Cape Town to the Kruger National Park because I was considered too young and troublesome. When I moved to England as a teenager, I had never been on a train. London Waterloo was the first real station I saw, and its great glass dome amazed me.

**Betty Cooper - Novelist**  
I'm especially grateful to the Blue Train, which took my husband and me on our honeymoon across France to catch a boat to Egypt. On the train, my husband gave me a pink dress, which I loved. Someone mentioned that pink is good for the brain, and I've worn it ever since. The journey through France and then by boat up the Nile to Luxor was the perfect way to relax after the wedding preparations.

**Martin Brown - Journalist**  
We were working on a series of articles about a round-the-world trip and had to cross a desert in an African country. There was no road, so we took the Desert Express. The timetable was unreliable; we were just given a day. We heard the driver would often wait for days if he knew people were still coming. When the train arrived, hundreds of people climbed into and onto the carriages, with some even traveling on the roof for free. At night, the train crossed some of the most beautiful landscapes I've ever seen, like traveling across the moon.

**Arisu Mezuki - Actress**  
Most people form their favorite train memories as children, but not me. I grew up in Singapore and Cyprus, where I saw few trains. It wasn't until I was a teenager that trains became important to me. I made a film featuring a railway in Yorkshire, mostly filmed on an old, disused line maintained by volunteers. That's where my love for steam trains began. When we weren't filming, we rode the train whenever we could. When I returned last year, it felt like time had stood still; everything was still in place, even the gas lights on the station platform!"
FCE_8,"Are you trying to get published? If you're wondering where to send your story, our expert Margaret Stubbs has the advice you need. Many readers ask us, ""I've written a story or book. Who should I send it to?"" The first thing to know is that you should research the market and learn about publishers while improving your writing skills. Selling your writing requires understanding the publishing world. No matter what you write, you need to know the markets you're targeting. The best way to do this is by reading everything relevant. Visit your local library, bookshops, and newsagents. Reading widely will help you understand what publishers are currently accepting. Keep updating this knowledge because new publications appear, editors change jobs, and magazines shift focus. Publishers are always looking for new talent, so writers must provide what they want. 

If you're unsure what to write, start by exploring different options. For example, if you want to write short love stories, first find out which magazines publish them. Get recent copies and study the stories they buy, paying attention to the readers. Editors focus on meeting their readers' needs. Writers often ask me, ""My story has been rejected three times. Am I wasting my time?"" As a former teacher, I never discourage anyone, but if the work isn't publishable, I give honest feedback with a positive outlook. Many new writers send their work out too soon, often before they're ready. If you've only written one story or article, it's unlikely to be published. Success usually comes after years in publishing or journalism. 

When you send your work for the first time, keep writing more stories while waiting for a reply. Write ten or even twenty more. Each one will improve, and you'll start seeing yourself as a writer. Your fluency and confidence will grow. Don't throw any work away—improve it instead. I also suggest not showing your work to others, especially early on. Remember, every successful writer has faced many rejections. Do everything you can to advance your writing career. Look for a creative writing course nearby or join a local writers' group to gain ideas and confidence from other aspiring writers. Think of yourself as a writer and practice writing every day if possible."
FCE_4,"On the last day of a difficult year, I was at the Baltimore railway station, waiting for the 10.10 train to Philadelphia. The station was busier than usual, losing its usual clean and airy feel. Elderly couples with matching luggage filled the benches, and college students sat on the floor with their bags. A well-dressed, grey-haired man was moving around, asking strangers questions. He approached a woman sitting alone and then a girl standing near me, who had long blond hair. He asked her, ""Are you traveling to Philadelphia?"" She replied she was heading north but to New York, not Philadelphia. He thanked her and moved on.

I became curious about him. He asked an old lady if she was going to Philadelphia, but she said Wilmington, so he moved on. I was going to Philadelphia, but he didn't ask me, probably because I didn't look reliable to him. He seemed stressed and asked a woman reading a book if she was going to Philadelphia. She said yes, and he asked her for a favor. I pretended to check my watch, even though I didn't have one, and listened.

The man explained that his daughter was flying abroad for a study year and had forgotten her passport. She called from the Philadelphia station, unsure of what to do. He told her to stay there, and he would find someone to bring her passport. The woman asked why he didn't go himself, and he said he couldn't leave his wife alone because she was in a wheelchair. This seemed like a weak excuse to me, and I was suspicious. The man held a padded envelope, not a plain one, which seemed odd. I silently warned the woman to be careful."
FCE_30,"**Gary and Me**

John Moore, a restaurant owner, shares his story about his son Gary, a well-known TV chef. John believes everyone gets a chance in life. Gary's chance was cooking, and John's was running a restaurant. When John found the restaurant, it was in poor condition, but he saw potential in it. This venture reminded him of his childhood when his mother worked in a factory, leaving him alone. He wanted to ensure family time, so his wife managed the children and the accounts while he ran the business. They lived above the restaurant and valued family meals, which helped their children, Gary and Joe, become confident. From a young age, they interacted with customers, giving them a strong start in life.

Gary was an energetic child. At seven, he once jumped into a corner bath like a pool and knocked himself out. As he grew, he worked for pocket money, starting with odd jobs and then helping in the kitchen by age ten. He was disciplined, often waking up before his father. Gary wasn't very academic but excelled in the kitchen. By 15, he was as skilled as the adults and sometimes managed the kitchen, preparing over a hundred meals. John knew Gary would pursue catering because of his talent. For school work experience, John sent Gary to a friend's restaurant.

Recently, Gary started playing drums and formed a band. John advises him to focus on one thing, saying, ""If you chase two hares, you catch neither."" He told Gary to achieve his goals by 30, or it might be too late. At 17, Gary went to catering college. On his first day, he quickly completed a morning's work in an hour and helped others. John's proud of Gary's success in TV cooking shows. He taught Gary that hard work is essential because nothing is given for free. Gary seized his opportunity and succeeded. John reflects that if children remember even a little of what parents teach, it's a success. Gary's actions show he listened to his father's advice."
FCE_7,"Finding an affordable flat in Dublin was as difficult as finding gold during a gold rush. The best way to find a place was through personal connections: if you knew someone who knew someone leaving a flat, that often helped. But for someone like Jo, who had just arrived in Dublin, there were no personal contacts to rely on. She had no one to inform her about a soon-to-be-vacant bedsit. So, she stayed in a hostel and searched for a place. For Jo, Dublin was a big unknown. She felt like she was stepping into the unknown when she took the train to work there. She never questioned why she was going. Everyone she knew from school assumed she would leave their small town, which they considered boring and isolated. They all wanted to escape, experience life, and have a real existence. Some of her classmates moved to nearby towns like Ennis or Limerick, where they had family to help them settle. But none of Jo's classmates were going to Dublin. She was going alone. Jo's mother thought it would be great if she stayed permanently in the hostel, as it was run by nuns and safe. Her father hoped the hostel was warm, as they were known to be cold. Jo's sisters, who worked as waitresses, thought she was crazy for staying in a hostel for a whole week. Jo didn't know her family was still thinking and talking about her as she answered an ad for a flat in Ringsend. The ad said, ""Own room, own television, share kitchen, bathroom."" It was close to the post office where she worked and seemed too good to be true. She hoped it would be nice, that the people would like her, and that it wouldn't be too expensive. There wasn't a line for this flat because it was more like ""Third Girl Wanted"" than ""Flat to Let."" The mention of ""own television"" made Jo wonder if it was too fancy for her, but the house looked ordinary. It was a red-brick terraced house with a basement, but the flat was upstairs. A cheerful girl with a college scarf, who seemed to have been rejected, was coming down the stairs. ""Desperate place,"" she said to Jo. ""They're both awful. Common as dirt."" ""Oh,"" said Jo and continued climbing. ""Hello,"" said a girl with ""Nessa"" on her T-shirt. ""Did you see that snobby girl leaving? I can't stand her type."" ""What did she do?"" asked Jo. ""Do? She didn't have to do anything. She just looked around, made a face, giggled, and said, 'Is this all there is? Oh dear, oh dear,' in a posh accent. We wouldn't have her here, would we, Pauline?"" Pauline wore a very colorful shirt, almost as bright as her hair. Jo realized Pauline was a punk, which surprised her. She had seen punks on O'Connell Street but never talked to one. ""I'm Jo, I work at the post office, and I called about the flat."" Nessa said they were about to have tea and offered Jo a mug. One mug had ""Nessa,"" another ""Pauline,"" and the third ""Other"" written on it. ""We'll put your name on it if you stay,"" Nessa said kindly."
FCE_43,"People love dolphins. We enjoy watching them in marinas, movies, and TV shows. However, the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society warns that dolphins are in serious trouble. Mark Simmonds explains how their numbers are decreasing. Dolphins are special to us because they are very intelligent, understand human emotions, and represent freedom in the wild seas. TV shows like ""Flipper"" and ""Seaquest"" have made us love them even more. But these shows don't show the real problems dolphins face in polluted and overfished seas today. For example, the number of North Sea harbour porpoises, a type of dolphin, has dropped by up to 89,000. You might think such popular animals are protected by laws and marine reserves, but they are not, and this could become a major wildlife crisis.

There are 40 different types of dolphins worldwide. In northern Europe, the most common are the striped, common, bottlenose dolphins, and the smaller harbour porpoise. The first two live far out at sea and are rarely seen, so we know little about them. The larger bottlenose dolphins and harbour porpoises used to be common near European coasts. Bottlenose dolphins are very social and were once found along the Channel coast and in British rivers like the Thames. Now, they are only found in places like the Moray Firth in Scotland and Cardigan Bay in Wales, and the few that remain show signs of stress.

It's hard to pinpoint exactly why dolphin numbers are falling because their habits are complex. Overfishing, which is reducing fish stocks and harming local fishing industries, also threatens dolphins. Porpoises need to find food quickly, and if fish are overfished in one area, they might not survive long enough to find food elsewhere. They also risk getting caught in fishing nets, which they can't see. Modern fishing methods use large nets that float or are dragged quickly through the sea. Many dead dolphins have been found on beaches in France and Cornwall, showing marks and cuts from these nets.

Pollution is another problem. Waste and chemicals in the sea can accumulate in dolphins' bodies. For example, pesticides dissolve in fat, so dolphins can absorb them, and they build up in their bodies. Female dolphins then produce milk with high levels of pesticides, passing the poison to their young. There is a case of a young dolphin dying from its mother's poisoned milk.

Perhaps the most debated threat to dolphins is human disturbance. Dolphins live in groups and rely on sound to understand their world. Noise pollution from ships and oil wells travels four times better in water than in air, which might disturb dolphins in ways we don't fully understand yet."
FCE_51,"Text: 'GETTING FIT Exercise is crucial for your mind, body, and spirit. It's one of the best ways to keep balance in your life, especially when everything around you feels chaotic and fast-paced. You might be tired of hearing about fitness, but there's a reason it's talked about so much: it's really good for you. There are many reasons to exercise and very few reasons not to, for most people. Exercise improves muscle tone and quickly changes your body shape. It boosts muscle strength and helps you maintain good posture, which is how you hold your body when sitting or standing. It prevents muscle imbalances that can lead to injuries. It quickly improves specific areas like thighs, stomach, and upper arms. It also benefits your heart, lungs, and blood circulation. You might have heard these reasons many times and feel bored by them. But here's something that might catch your attention: exercise helps reduce depression and tiredness, and it helps regulate sleep patterns. It also helps manage stress and can relieve certain medical conditions. By now, these points should convince you a bit. If not, common sense should tell you that exercise is beneficial. There are many types of exercise you can try, like aerobics, calisthenics, jogging, using free weights, or weight machines. Remember, training too hard or with too much weight can cause injury, so start slowly and carefully. If you're unsure, consult your doctor about what's best for you. Good posture is essential for improving your body shape. A stiff or sagging body not only looks unattractive but also lacks energy and is more prone to minor health issues. If you tend to slouch, imagine a helium balloon pulling the top of your head up. This will help lift your chest for better breathing and make your abdomen look slimmer. When your chest is balanced while standing, you should be able to see your ankles. Stretching your muscles improves flexibility and movement, helps maintain correct posture, and prevents muscle tears and injuries from overuse. Doing this four or five times a week will make your body more flexible and fit. Stretching should be a key part of your exercise routine, done slowly and precisely. The best exercise routine includes a good warm-up, stretching exercises, an energetic workout, and a cool-down period.'"
FCE_11,"IN THEIR NATURAL HABITAT

What motivates film-makers Amanda Barrett and Owen Newman to leave their home comforts for months? It's the quest for the perfect shot. Among the many creatures in East Africa's jungles and plains, two of the hardest to find are producer Amanda Barrett and cameraman Owen Newman. Currently, they are in the Ngorongoro Crater, which has faced six months of almost nonstop rain, leading to unexpected challenges. Newman mentioned they had to buy an expensive tool so Amanda can pull their vehicle out of the mud when it gets stuck. Their collaboration has produced some of TV's best wildlife films, like their acclaimed film on leopards. Even while this film about Africa's elusive cats was airing, they were back in the wild, this time following the equally elusive jackal. This is common in TV partnerships. Traveling film-makers have been exploring the globe to capture exotic wildlife since TV began. I talked to Newman about their partnership during one of his rare visits to a safari lodge. 'We sometimes argue, but we usually resolve it quickly,' he says about his colleague. Neither sees themselves as the leader, and they get along well because they view animals similarly. 'When we're on the move, we set up our tents each night. But now, we're in a more fixed camp, and since we start at 5 a.m. each day, we make tea the night before and keep it warm in a flask.' Their daily meals are pre-packed and heated by whoever is available. 'We can be out for up to eight weeks, so food can be a concern,' says Newman. It's a tough life, but being alone in remote areas lets them get close to the animals and become part of their world. Newman recalls filming a lion family where a lioness would greet their car as part of her routine. Newman first worked with Barrett in 1988 on 'The Great Rift,' and two years later, they teamed up to film Arctic foxes. Since then, they spend four months on location to gather enough material for each half-hour film. Before starting, they must submit a script for approval. 'Amanda and I had a good working relationship from the beginning,' says Newman, 'because we shared the same ideas and vision. We aim to create films rich in atmosphere that capture the true spirit of the place and animals, touching people's hearts. I believe evoking an emotional response is better than appealing only to the intellect.'"
FCE_14,"In our series on women in sport, Suzie Ellis met with Kendra Slawinski, the captain of England's netball team. Kendra has a busy schedule leading up to the World Championships next month. She spends her days teaching at a local school and then trains in a supermarket car park. When I asked if she gets odd looks while training there, she said she's too focused on her movements to notice much, though she might see cars slowing down.

Kendra is dedicated to being in top shape for the Championships. This will be her fourth time competing, and it's set to be the largest event yet, with 27 countries participating. She feels the support from the home crowd will be special and hopes it will boost netball's reputation in England. However, playing at home also means more pressure to perform well from the start. Their first match is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. Although England has always beaten them, Kendra expects an exciting game because Barbados has talented players.

England is currently ranked fourth in the world, but Kendra knows the Championships will be challenging. Unlike a series where you can lose a game and still win overall, the Championships offer only one chance to succeed. Over her 15-year career, netball has become more intense and competitive. Kendra emphasizes the importance of training to win, but she also notes that players are friendlier once the game ends.

Netball is now more scientific in its approach to fitness. Kendra believes it's crucial for the team to think and train like world-class athletes. As captain, she aims to lead by example with a strong mental attitude, supporting and encouraging her teammates.

Kendra's netball career has been carefully planned from the start, and she decided that this competition would be her last as a player. She may coach young players in the future, but for now, her focus is on this final event. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she might feel emotional, knowing her loyal supporters are with her every step of the way."
FCE_63,"Rachel Mills is a scientist who loves exploring the depths of the Atlantic Ocean. She is a lecturer and researcher in marine geochemistry at the Oceanography Centre, Southampton University. Her work involves studying the chemical processes in the sea. When she's not teaching, she dives three kilometers into the ocean in a small steel vehicle to study underwater volcanoes. Inside the vehicle, space is so tight that she can touch the two pilots. They can't stand or move much and must stay inside until someone opens the door from outside. A dive lasts about 16 hours: three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours collecting rock and water samples, and three hours to return to the surface.

If there's an emergency, they can press a panic button to release a small escape vessel that quickly rises to the surface, like a ping-pong ball in water. However, no one has tested it yet, and Rachel thinks it wouldn't be a pleasant experience. The first time she entered the vehicle, she was on a ship's deck with an instructor who explained emergency procedures, including what to do if the pilot had a heart attack. This was to test her reaction to being in such a confined space.

Rachel has completed six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian crew to a site five days' sail west of the Canary Islands. There, on the ocean floor, is a vast area of underwater volcanoes with chimneys emitting black smoke. The Russian team was installing scientific equipment to study the effects of a project that would drill a 150-meter hole through a volcano.

When not at sea, Rachel works in her office at the Oceanography Centre. Two-thirds of her salary comes from teaching, which she enjoys, but it allows her to continue her research on ""black smokers,"" another name for underwater volcanoes. These volcanoes release water that looks like black smoke at a rate of one meter per second and a temperature of 350 degrees Celsius.

Rachel's only frightening experience was with an American team when an explosion occurred while towing equipment. The shock waves hit their vehicle, and she feared for her life. When nothing happened, the relief was immense.

Diving to the ocean's depths is an adventure for Rachel. Every time she sees the chimneys through the porthole, she feels a sense of wonder. She is often the first person to see these sights. After studying black smokers for her Ph.D. for three years, seeing them in person was an incredible experience."
FCE_56,"**Interview Tips**

First impressions are crucial. Research shows that people form opinions about us within the first few minutes of meeting. They notice our clothing, eye contact, body language, speaking speed, voice volume and tone, and the words we use.

Mary Pearce, who studied to be a teacher, shares her experience: ""I worked hard for my degree and felt confident when I graduated."" She applied for a job at a local primary school and got an interview with the Head Teacher. ""I noticed a small hole in my jacket that morning,"" she remembers. ""I could have changed, but I didn't want to be late, as punctuality is important to me."" Mary didn't get the job. Her friend, who works at the school, told her the Head Teacher commented, ""If someone doesn't present their best image at an interview, what kind of teacher will they be?""

Simon Grant, a hotel manager, says, ""Interviewees who care about their appearance are more likely to care about their jobs. People often think it's what's inside that counts, but in an interview, you should present yourself in the best way possible."" Many people overlook the importance of a professional image. For instance, Janet Goodwood worked for ten years as an administrative assistant in a large accounting firm. When the office manager retired, she applied for the position but didn't even get an interview. ""I thought it was a mistake, so I asked the Director of Personnel,"" she says. ""He told me I didn't fit the image of an office manager and suggested I improve my wardrobe before applying for a promotion again. I was shocked because I do a good job, and I thought my appearance shouldn't matter.""

Movement and gestures also affect an interviewer's first impression. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian found that 7% of our feelings and attitudes are communicated through words, 38% through voice, and 55% through facial expressions. If our facial expressions and words send different messages, the listener will trust the non-verbal message more. So, ensure your words match your body language. Mixed messages can confuse the interviewer.

It's also important not to seem too desperate for the job or too eager to please. Sheila Rice, a marketing specialist, applied for a promotion, and her interview went so well that she was offered the job immediately. ""I was thrilled,"" she recalls. ""But I showed too much enthusiasm. Once the boss saw how excited I was, he knew I wouldn't refuse the offer. As a result, he offered me a lower salary than I expected. I'm sure I could have negotiated a better salary if I had controlled my excitement.""

Finally, consider what you say and how you say it during an interview. David Artesio, a manager at an employment agency, suggests learning about the company before the interview. ""The annual report, for example, can tell you about the company's activities. Mentioning an area that interests you during the interview shows your interest in the company."" Business consultant Marian Woodall advises having a few questions ready and avoiding long, confusing sentences. As she says, ""Poor communicators talk in paragraphs. Successful communicators use short sentences and clear points."""

**The Farmer**  
Matt Froggatt used to work as an insurance agent in London but now runs a sheep farm. ""After 14 years in business, the City went from being exciting to a grind—no one was having fun anymore. I hadn't planned to leave for another five or ten years, but then I was made redundant unexpectedly. The payout wasn't great, but it was enough to start the farm. My big break came when I met the head chef of a top local hotel. By supplying them, my reputation grew, and now I also sell meat by mail order. I'm glad I'm not stuck in an office anymore, but it's surprising how little has changed: I still work 80- to 90-hour weeks and sell a product.""

**The Painter**  
Ron Ablewhite was a manager in advertising but now earns a living as an artist. ""Painting started as a hobby, but I found it more exciting than my job. Taking redundancy to become an artist seemed logical. The career counselor I spoke to was surprised because most people in their mid-forties need to get back to work for financial reasons. But we married young, and our children didn't need our support. Moving to the north of England was a leap into the unknown. We left all our friends, but our friendships have survived the distance—many visit us now.""

**The Hatmaker**  
After five years as a company lawyer, Katherine Goodison started her own business making hats in her London flat. ""Being a lawyer was fun and well-paid, but the hours were terrible. I didn't want to become a senior partner working even more hours, so I left. People said I'd get bored, but that hasn't happened. The key is having deadlines. In fashion, there's always something to do, so I keep a strict schedule. I'm happier and less stressed now. I miss socializing with colleagues, but I love being responsible for my product. If I do a bad job, it's on me. You care more when your name is on the line.""

**The Masseur**  
Paul Drinkwater worked in finance for 16 years before becoming a masseur at the Life Centre in London. ""I started in financial markets at 22, setting up deals. I liked the adrenaline but never found the work rewarding. I almost got made redundant in 1989, but I resigned and traveled for a year to figure out what I wanted. I was interested in health, so I visited top gymnasiums and talked to the owners. I knew I needed qualifications to change careers, so I took massage courses. Then I got part-time work at the Life Centre. I have no regrets. I used to feel out of control, but now I have peace of mind and control over my future. That's the best part."""
FCE_6,"Text: 'Dedicated to their sports Four young sports stars talk about their lives. A Darius (runner) I've always been into sports. I tried many different ones, but I was best at football and athletics. When I was 14, I had a chance to join a professional football club, but I chose athletics instead. My biggest achievement was competing for my country in the youth team and winning a medal. Unfortunately, it didn't get much media attention, which was disappointing. I hoped to get sponsorship because training is expensive. I train at home during winter and then go to Florida for three weeks before the season starts. It's fun because there are great facilities and nightlife there. However, I have to be disciplined. If friends invite me out before training, I have to decline. I wish I didn't have to, but dedication is important in this sport. My main goal is to compete in the next Olympics, which would be amazing. B Gabriel (surfer) The surfing community is small, so you often meet the same people at competitions. Professional surfers are serious, and the best waves are often at dawn, so you have to avoid late-night parties. I don't mind that much, but I do miss sleeping in. However, it's worth it because without dedication, I might not have won the National Championships last year. After a win, I make sure to have a big night out, and if there's prize money, I treat myself to a nice trip. The sacrifices are worth it because winning the championship led to me hosting a surfing series on TV. I guess I'm a bit of a celebrity now. C Dieter (yacht racer) With five guys on a boat, we have a lot of fun. We're traditional and always celebrate a win in style. Some say we act childishly when we're out, but we don't seek media attention. Sometimes reporters care more about our celebrations than our race results. I'm away for eight months a year, so it's nice to come back and hang out with friends from different backgrounds. You can't focus on the sport all the time; it's not healthy. I'm known in the sailing world, but I've only been recognized in public a few times. I wouldn't want to be a celebrity. I get nice letters from people asking for signed pictures, and I reply to each one, even if it takes time. D Tomas (tennis player) It's great to feel the crowd's support when I walk on court. At the last tournament, it got a bit overwhelming with people crowding around. Still, I enjoy being recognized by fans when I'm out shopping. It has downsides, though. My last girlfriend didn't like it when I got too much attention from female fans. Tennis players travel a lot, and that's why we broke up, I think. It was tough, but you have to make sacrifices in any sport; you have to be serious and professional. It doesn't bother me much. I'm happy to focus on my game now and enjoy other things in life after I retire, which happens early in this sport.'"
FCE_33,"Shopping with children can be very challenging for parents. One mother describes it as ""absolute murder"" because her kids want everything they see, like sugary cereals, Disney videos, or comics. She can't afford all these things and feels guilty when she gives in to their demands, as she believes she's buying unhealthy items. However, she also feels bad for constantly saying no and worries about not giving her children the chance to make their own choices. 

Research shows that children ask for something every two minutes during a supermarket trip. Over £150 million is spent each year on advertising aimed directly at children, mostly on TV. This amount is expected to grow, and supermarkets are where this advertising is most effective. Children often don't understand why their parents can't buy everything they want, and arguments about health don't stand up against appealing ads.

Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, though these ideas aren't always correct. It's good for parents and children to talk about food because if kids only learn from TV ads, they get a biased view. Parents feel frustrated competing with advertisers and having to let their children down repeatedly.

The Independent Television Commission, which oversees TV ads, doesn't allow advertisers to tell kids to ask their parents to buy things. But as Dibb notes, the goal of advertising is to persuade people to buy, so the effect is the same.

Deciding which of their children's requests to agree to or refuse is a major stress for parents. One mother says she discusses food with her children and has taught her son to be skeptical of ads. As a result, they have fewer conflicts in the supermarket because her children don't ask for things she won't buy.

Parents admit they are sometimes inconsistent in their responses. Mike, a father of two, says they refuse to buy sweets for their son because they're unhealthy, yet they buy treats like cream and chocolate for themselves. He acknowledges that it's natural for children to want nice things, but he still gets annoyed by their demands. His willingness to say yes often depends on his mood and life circumstances, making it hard to be consistent.

Supermarkets could help reduce parent-child conflicts by removing sweets from checkout areas or offering supervised play areas. Although parents might spend less without their children, the idea of shopping without a child's demands could attract more customers, balancing any loss."
FCE_20,"Text: 'Five-star luxury meets modern technology The five-star Merrion Hotel, which has just opened, is the result of careful research into what customers want and nearly two years of work converting four large eighteenth-century houses in Dublin. This approach allowed the hotel to install the latest technology for both staff and guests. At the Merrion, General Manager Peter MacCann expects his staff to know guests by name. For details of guests' preferences, he uses the hotel's computer system. This system helps treat returning guests in the special way expected at a five-star hotel. Although it cost £250,000 to install, MacCann believes it will pay for itself over time. He praises its efficiency and is enthusiastic about its features. For example, if a guest requests certain music CDs during their first stay, those CDs will be ready for them on their next visit. This is possible because of the guest-history feature, which allows staff to record any number of preferences. Hotel guests often complain about room temperature. Another high-tech system controls this important comfort area. Guests can change the temperature themselves within three degrees of the normal 18°C, and each room can be adjusted between 14°C and 25°C at the front desk. However, it is the other technology in the rooms that guests are likely to appreciate most. This is especially true for business users, and MacCann estimates that up to sixty-five percent of his business will come from this market. To meet these needs, the hotel has moved the traditional business center into individual bedrooms. Each room has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that also works as a photocopier and printer, and a video-conferencing facility. Technology changes quickly, so the hotel has tried to anticipate future improvements. Extra cables have been installed to handle future scientific advances. The televisions are rented, not bought, so they can be replaced with newer models at any time. DVD recorders can also be upgraded when needed. Despite all this modern equipment, MacCann says they have tried hard not to overwhelm guests with technology. The 145 bedrooms are large, well-furnished, comfortable, and welcoming. There are also a swimming pool and gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a beautiful garden at the center of it all. As in all luxury hotels, the food must be excellent. Chef Patrick Guilbaud's Dublin restaurant already had two Michelin stars when he decided to move his restaurant to the Merrion. Being part of the hotel has many benefits for both him and the hotel. He has been able to design a new kitchen and bring it into the modern age. There are also better parking facilities than at his previous location. For the hotel, they can offer a popular and successful dining option without financial risks. With the help of technology and a skilled staff, the Merrion is likely to succeed.'"
FCE_40,"**Where I Get My Energy**

Emma Marsden asked six women who live life to the fullest to share their secrets.

**A. Jeanette Kupfermann, Journalist and Author:**  
""I get my energy from excitement and challenges. Learning new things gives me a lot of energy. Activities with rhythm, like flamenco dancing, are also energizing. Dance is expressive and revitalizing. Feeling bored or that life is pointless can drain you. Being effective, even in small ways, boosts your energy.""

**B. Linda Kelsey, Magazine Editor:**  
""I have a lot of work, but I enjoy it, so it doesn't feel like a chore. Enjoying your work keeps you from feeling low, even if you're tired. I need a good amount of sleep to feel great. When I only get six hours, I feel sluggish. Exercise gives me energy, but finding the energy to start is hard! I do yoga once a week and try workout tapes at home. Exercise lifts my spirits. I feel low in the office between 3 and 5 PM, so I think it's good to eat something then.""

**C. Annie Nightingale, Disc Jockey:**  
""I don't rely on healthy eating for energy; it's my natural enthusiasm and positivity. I dislike negative attitudes. I believe in enjoying life and seizing the moment. Enjoyment is key. Achieving goals is important. My job is exciting, surrounded by lively young people. I love being busy and sociable. I enjoy taking photos and writing imaginary song lyrics for fun, which is a good mental release when traveling.""

**D. Floella Benjamin, Author and Children's TV Presenter:**  
""My energy comes from doing things I love. I believe in my work and family life, and being positive helps. Working with kids is great because they are resilient and give a lot. Energy is like a natural chemical, activated by interacting with others. Smiling at people and getting a smile back is thrilling. It's better than feeling sorry for yourself. I try to eat healthily and don't smoke or drink, but I don't have an exercise routine. My most energetic moments are playing with kids.""

**E. Deborah Moggach, Author and Playwright:**  
""I love transforming a wasteland into a garden. I once turned a concrete area into a garden by breaking up the concrete and adding soil. It was more rewarding than workouts or tennis. Knowing someone wants to read my writing gives me energy. I find it hard to write without an audience. I also enjoy exploring private lands like a child, and if caught, I pretend I didn't know it was private.""

**F. Katherine Monblot, Therapist:**  
""You need to have interest and respect for what you do. I like taking risks and get bored easily, which keeps me motivated. Doing things you dislike drains you. I used to be on committees and resented the time they took. You have limited energy, so focus it on what's most important to you."""
FCE_45,"**ICE SKATING**

Ice skating has been around for thousands of years. Archaeologists have found skates made from animal bones. These bone skates were used until iron was introduced in Scandinavia around 200 AD. In Scandinavia, the upper classes considered skating an important skill. In the early 1900s, skating was elegant and reserved. However, at the 1924 Winter Olympics, 11-year-old Sonja Henie brought a more athletic style, making skating more popular. Today, skating combines art and athletics, making it both graceful and physically challenging.

For beginners, balance and control are crucial, and speed comes with practice. Your body position is important for balance. Keep your legs slightly bent and knees flexed to center your weight, leaning slightly forward. Relaxation is key in skating, more so than in other sports. To start, your heels should almost touch, and your feet should point outwards. Push forward with your back foot and make a small movement with the other foot. It's fairly simple, right? As you practice, you can gradually make longer movements.

Learning how to fall is one of the first skills a skater should master. Even top professionals fall. To avoid injury, try to stay relaxed when you fall, which reduces the impact. To get up, use your hands to kneel, then stand. Once you can move confidently on the ice, you can try different styles like figure skating, freestyle, distance, speed, and pair skating. The best way to start is by learning figure skating and then basic freestyle. Most ice rinks offer guidance to help you learn basic figures, and soon you can try turns, jumps, and spins.

If you watch good or professional skaters, you'll notice how relaxed and smooth they are. To achieve this, you should regularly practice exercises. Skating with a stiff body can be dangerous, so warm-up exercises should include those for the legs, back, and shoulders, focusing on the ankles and knees. After skating, do the same exercises to prevent stiffness.

Skating improves balance, coordination, relaxation, and movement. It boosts heart and lung health and strengthens the body. Combined with swimming or jogging, it offers a great program for overall health and fitness."

Seeing a talented child win a medal can be very emotional. Julia Gregson spoke with three young stars and their mothers about the joys and challenges they face.

**A. Annika Reeder, 15,** won a gold medal in gymnastics at the Commonwealth Games. She dreams of becoming a physiotherapist and competing in the next Olympics. ""The work is tough right now. There's no time for TV, hanging out with friends, or doing much besides gymnastics and school. I take training one day at a time. When I'm extremely tired, my coach might give me a day off, but usually, I keep going. You can't take too many days off, or you'll get stiff.""

**B. Annika's mother** says, ""Annika showed great potential from a young age. I've seen parents push their kids, but it doesn't work. To perform at Annika's level, you have to want it yourself. People often say we've sacrificed a lot, but they don't see what the sport has given us. We love it and what it's done for Annika. Before gymnastics, she was a shy girl who hid behind me, but now she's met people worldwide and gained confidence.""

**C. Sarah Stokes** started show-jumping at ten and has since won the British National Championship. ""It's good my parents like show-jumping because they train me and take me everywhere. Shows last from one to five days. I never get tired of it—I love the excitement and fun. Even without my parents, I'd do it because I'm determined. I'm glad they're happy when I win, but I do it for myself. This year, I aim to qualify for the British young riders (under-18) team. My big dream is to win an Olympic gold medal.""

**D. Sarah's mother** shares, ""Sarah's passion for horses started at age 1. By 5, she was up early to exercise her pony. To qualify for major shows, we travel all over England. To save money, we sleep in our horse box. Sarah is well-organized and happiest on a horse. Watching your child succeed in something they love is unbeatable.""

**E. Jane McShane, 10,** is Britain's Under-14 Chess Champion. ""Tournaments are friendly. I know everyone, and it's fun. When playing, I don't concentrate much. I should, but I just look around and don't think too hard. I'm not worried about getting arrogant; I don't talk about my success at school. I don't like feeling embarrassed.""

**F. Jane's mother** recalls, ""Jane played her first game at 5. My father suggested it. He tried to teach me chess when I was young, but I was bored. Jane loved it immediately. By the end of that day, she knew all the moves, and by 6, she was beating adults. I'm happy when she wins, but if she wanted to quit, I wouldn't stop her. I don't want to discourage her just because she's exceptional. If she has a gift, she should reach her potential."""
FCE_29,"It's true - we're all getting taller. Chris Greener was only fourteen when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy. The teacher joked, ""What do you want to be, the flagpole on a ship?"" because Chris was already almost two meters tall. Today, at 228 cm, he is Britain's tallest man. On average, people in Europe grow about a centimeter taller every decade. More and more very tall people are being born each year. Interestingly, this doesn't mean we're evolving into a new super race. Instead, we're returning to our original size from the time of the cavemen. We're finally overcoming the effects of generations of poor diets, which is having a big impact. Professor Chris Stringer, a palaeontologist, says, ""We are becoming like the Cro-Magnons again, the people who lived 40,000 years ago.""

For most of history, our ancestors ate a wide variety of foods. Women gathered herbs, fruits, and berries, while men hunted animals. Some hunter-gatherer tribes still live this way. One study found they ate 85 different wild plants. But about 9,000 years ago, agriculture began, which had serious consequences. Farmers took over most green areas, and now just three plants—wheat, rice, and maize—provide over half of the calories we eat. This limited diet has harmed our health and growth. Over the centuries, we've eaten soups, porridges, and breads that left us undernourished. In Ohio, scientists found that when people started farming corn, healthy hunter-gatherers became sickly and underweight. Tooth decay and diseases increased. Corn, once thought a blessing, was actually a health disaster, according to some anthropologists. Despite this, agriculture spread because farmed land could support ten times more people than hunter-gathering.

Only recently have wealthier nations started to address poor nutrition. In Europe, the US, and Japan, diets are now more like those of our ancestors. As a result, the average man in the US is now 179 cm tall, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm. This is a positive trend, but it brings challenges. While people are getting taller, things like bed lengths and legroom in planes and trains haven't changed much. Clothes manufacturers also have to adjust their products. The question is: how tall will we get? We can't grow forever. There must be a limit. Robert Fogel from the University suggests it could be around 193 cm, and we might reach it this century.

However, scientists note that while individuals are growing taller due to better nutrition, as a species, we are actually getting smaller. During the last ice age, 10,000 years ago, humans were slightly rounder and taller to keep warm. As the climate warmed, we became thinner and smaller, even with good nutrition. If the planet continues to heat up, we might shrink even more. So, global warming could counteract the growth in human height."
FCE_57,"Text: 'Studio Audiences What is it like to be in the audience when a television show is being filmed? Cosmo Landesman found out. Like technical difficulties, studio audiences are a common part of television, yet they remain a mystery to many of us. Watching them get excited on game shows, we wonder - who are these people? Among all live entertainment audiences, studio audiences are often seen as the least prestigious. I've heard that even people in the TV industry look down on them - one cameraman even compared them to cattle. I used to think studio audiences were just people eager for a brief moment of fame. But there's no typical studio audience. They come from all walks of life, professions, and income levels. TV shows try to attract different types of people for different programs. Those of us who prefer watching TV at home can't understand why anyone would go to a studio. Why apply for tickets, travel far, and endure hours of boredom in an uncomfortable studio just to watch something you can see at home? One idea is that people hope to appear on TV for a moment. I didn't believe this until I spoke to Angela, who said she came for the chance to be on TV. Another idea is that people are curious to see behind the scenes. But the most common reason I heard was simply that 'a friend gave me a ticket'. Few of us have been in a studio audience, yet we think we know what it's like. You sit there, packed among strangers, while someone holds up signs saying APPLAUD or LAUGH - and you clap or laugh as instructed. This might be true for some shows, but not all. As one studio manager says, 'We always hope a show will be good enough not to need these signs.' But is there any real difference between being in a studio and watching TV at home? For Claire, being in a studio is 'more exciting', while Charlotte enjoyed feeling involved with live TV. 'Last year I saw my favorite comedian. When you watch him on TV at home, you miss a lot.' What I missed was seeing live actors - from where I sat, I could only see the back of someone's head. The opening scenes were filmed so far away that I ended up watching the show on a studio monitor. Going to a studio might be a terrible way to watch TV, but that's not the point. For most of the audience, it was simply fun and a free night of entertainment.'"

I prefer places where nature and human presence mix. When I travel, I like charming villages with old temples more than empty deserts. At eight, I went to school in England and would cycle to Lastingham village on Saturdays. Cycling was my escape from school. I enjoyed exploring the stark hilltops, cozy valleys, and old villages. Being from Scotland, the landscape felt both familiar and different, and I still visit today. I used to write about my adventures in a diary, which was my first step into travel writing, a field where I later became well-known.

There's a small railway from Hythe to Dungeness, run by enthusiasts. I always choose first class because it's only a bit more expensive. The scenery isn't dramatic. The train crosses Romney Marsh with its sheep and runs beside a canal. But my favorite part is when the train passes through back gardens. For a moment, we see people in their daily lives, making tea, washing dishes, or setting up a deckchair. I see myself through their eyes, a woman in a tiny train, peeking into their homes. It's the ordinary landscape that draws me in. Just fields, sheep, and a distant grey sea. It makes me look closer, searching for something that opens my eyes.

The Hartland Peninsula is a beautiful, remote coast. The beaches are hard to reach and rocky, so there are few people. Some brave surfers come, but most visitors enjoy the sea's majesty. The coast faces the Atlantic and is known for shipwrecks. There are coastal walks you can combine with trips inland through lush valleys filled with oak trees, ferns, and wildflowers. We stay in simple self-catering places with a family who owns property in Southole village.

**Annette**  
My favorite place in England is the Trough of Bowland, a wide-open moorland perfect for hiking. Few people live or visit there. It's a hidden, empty, and remote area, and I love the sense of space. I found it by accident as a student and have visited every year since, sometimes alone, with my boyfriend, and now with my son. It hasn't changed much since my first visit. Having a child makes these trips more special. It saddens me that he's growing up in a city.

**James**  
I bought Glenthorne, my favorite house in Britain, to find peace and reconnect with my English roots. I grew up in Sri Lanka but went to school in Devon at twelve. I used to cycle around the moors and village lanes. We had a story about a place we never cycled past: if you went down the driveway, you'd never return. That place was Glenthorne. It's my dream place, a magical, secluded, romantic house. You can't hear anything except the sea, wind, and birds."
FCE_42,"HAPPY HUNTING GROUND

We're a family that loves animals and enjoys being around all kinds of creatures. One afternoon, a series of events led to complete chaos. My daughter called me at work, excited because she had found a wonderful pine snake. ""Can we keep him?"" she asked. I agreed, but only for one night. We had a special tank ready for temporary guests like this, just enough time to admire them and look them up in our well-used natural history book.

I got home late and quickly started boiling a pot of water when I heard screams from my sons' bedroom: ""Oh, Mother! Help! Do something!"" I rushed in to find a crisis involving Domino, our cat, and Bianca, a white mouse I received as a Mother's Day gift. (Some mothers get perfume, I've heard.) Domino, with the mouse's feet sticking out of his mouth, was running around the room, avoiding the children who were trying to stop him. I jumped into the chaos and tripped over something, landing on the floor. As I considered how to stop Domino, I noticed the snake was escaping from its tank, slithering onto the floor.

The room was a frenzy of cat, mouse, kids, and snake, with the dog barking wildly. The pot boiled over in the kitchen, so I quickly turned off the gas and returned to the chaos. I managed to grab Domino by the tail and rescued the mouse, which was surprisingly unharmed. This mouse was caught by Domino three more times in its life but eventually died of old age.

Feeling encouraged, I turned my attention to the snake. It didn't have any obvious weak points. I sat on the floor like a snake-charmer, rocking back and forth without a flute. Slowly, the snake relaxed and rested its head on its coiled body, though it still watched me suspiciously. I carefully slid my hands under the snake and stood up, carrying it to the end of the garden. I pointed it towards a tree, hoping it would choose to live there. When I finally let go of its head, expecting it to attack, it instead slid over my shoulders like a colorful shawl, seeming to settle in for the winter.

We stood there in the dusk—four children, me, and the snake. My eldest, DJ, broke the silence with a scientific observation: ""You know what it is, Mum? You're nice and fat and warm, and the shed isn't."" I had the children gently encourage the snake to move on. Slowly, it did, climbing up the wall and disappearing over the roof. As the last bit of its tail vanished, my three-year-old, Clay, summed it up for all of us: ""Boy, that was one big snake!"""
FCE_59,"In today's fast-paced world with phones, faxes, and computers, the traditional art of letter writing is at risk of disappearing. However, I believe receiving a letter offers a unique joy that other forms of communication can't match. There's the thrill of its arrival, the pleasure of seeing who it's from, and the enjoyment of reading it. I've been writing letters for as long as I can remember, starting with little notes to my mother. She always made sure I wrote my own thank-you letters for Christmas and birthday gifts, no matter how short or messy they were.

When I left home at 18 to study medicine in London, my mother and I would write to each other weekly. Occasionally, my father would write too, and his long, funny letters were always a delight. These letters mostly talked about everyday events involving my parents and their friends. Although we also made phone calls, it's the letters I remember most. I also received letters from boyfriends. Many of them had to work or study far away, so we stayed in touch through letters. Surprisingly, this strengthened our relationships, as I found it easier to express myself in writing.

I love receiving letters with birthday or Christmas cards. While notes are nice, a letter full of news is even better, especially if it comes in an airmail envelope with beautiful stamps. I get letters from Mangala in Sri Lanka, someone I trained with over 20 years ago, and I have penfriends in Australia and Vancouver. There's also a lady from France I write to regularly. We met by chance in a restaurant, and if we hadn't exchanged addresses, we wouldn't have this wonderful correspondence. I get to practice my French, and we've visited each other's homes.

My greatest letter-writing success was visiting my American penfriend in Texas this summer. We had been writing to each other for 29 years without meeting. Everyone was surprised that our correspondence lasted so long, and the local newspaper even featured our story on the front page. I'm happy that my children are continuing this tradition. Like my mother, I insist they write their own thank-you letters. My daughter writes me little notes, just as I did to my mother, and both my children have penfriends in Texas, arranged by my penfriend. I strongly encourage everyone not to let letter writing become a 'lost art.'"
FCE_54,"Text: 'Careless tourists damage ancient alpine rock art Tens of thousands of ancient pictures carved into the rocks at one of France's most important tourist sites are being gradually destroyed. Scientists and researchers are worried that the 36,000 drawings on rocks in Mont Bego in the French Alps are being damaged so quickly that they might not last for future generations. The mountain, once a place for prayer and worship, has 4,000-year-old drawings carved into the rock. These include pictures of cows with horns, cultivated fields, and various gods and goddesses. However, as more people visit the site, the pictures are being ruined by careless graffiti. Jean Clottes, chairman of the International Committee on Rock Art, says, 'People think that because the pictures have been there so long, they will always be there. But if the damage continues at this rate, there will be nothing left in 50 years.' He has seen tourists stepping on the drawings, wearing away the rock and the details of the artwork. Some visitors even break off parts to take home as souvenirs. 'When people can't take a good enough photograph, they rub the drawings to get a clearer picture,' he said. 'The drawings are polished by the weather, and if the sun is shining and visitors can't see them properly, they simply rub and scrape them to make them look fresher.' Other researchers describe how people arrive with long sticks with sharp ends to scratch their own drawings or even their names into the rocks. But experts disagree on the best way to preserve the drawings. Henry de Lumley, director of the Museum of Natural History in Paris, believes that the only way to save the site is to make the whole mountain a 'no-go' area, allowing the public to visit only on guided tours. Otherwise, he says, the site will be completely destroyed, and important research work will be reduced. Clottes disagrees. 'The measure proposed by Henry de Lumley is the most severe, and while it is the most effective, it is also certain to bring about protests from people who live there,' he said. 'The site was classified as a historic monument years ago by the Ministry of Culture, and we must do as much as possible to save what is there.' David Lavergne, the regional architect, also wants to avoid closing the site. 'Henry de Lumley's idea isn't ideal,' he said. 'Our department feels that the best solution is to let people look at the site, but because the area is very big, it is difficult to prevent visitors from damaging it. I would prefer that everyone was able to look at it, but the main problem is financial. We do not have the funds to employ the necessary number of guards. We may have to consider charging a fee. There seems to be no prospect of government funding.' In Nice, Annie Echassoux, who also worked on researching the site, is worried that as the mountain becomes easier to reach - tourists can now avoid the three-and-a-half-hour walk by hiring vehicles - the damage will increase rapidly. She thinks that the only solution is to rope off the area and provide guides. 'You can't say the plan can't go ahead because there is no money,' she said. 'That is not good enough. Money must be provided because the Ministry of Culture has classified this area as a historic site. If we don't take steps, we will be responsible for losing the drawings for the next generation.''"
FCE_32,"Shopping with children can be very challenging for parents. One mother describes it as ""absolute murder"" because her kids want everything they see, like sugary cereals, Disney videos, or comics. She can't afford all these things and feels guilty when she gives in to their demands, as she believes she's buying unhealthy items. However, she also feels bad for constantly saying no and worries about not giving her children the chance to make their own choices. 

Research shows that children ask for something every two minutes during a supermarket trip. Over £150 million is spent each year on advertising aimed directly at children, mostly on TV. This amount is expected to grow, and supermarkets are where this advertising is most effective. Children often don't understand why their parents can't buy everything they want, and arguments about health don't stand up against appealing ads.

Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, though these ideas aren't always correct. It's good for parents and children to talk about food because if children only learn from TV ads, they get a biased view. Parents feel frustrated competing with advertisers and having to let their children down repeatedly.

The Independent Television Commission, which oversees TV ads, doesn't allow advertisers to tell children to ask their parents to buy things. But as Dibb notes, the goal of advertising is to persuade people to buy, so the effect is the same.

Deciding which of their children's requests to agree to or refuse is a major stress for parents. One mother says she discusses food with her children and has taught her son to be skeptical of ads. As a result, they have fewer conflicts in the supermarket because her children don't ask for things she won't buy.

Parents admit they are sometimes inconsistent in their responses. Mike, a father of two, says they refuse to buy sweets for their son because they're unhealthy, yet they buy treats for themselves. He acknowledges that it's natural for children to want nice things too, but he still gets annoyed by their demands. His willingness to say yes depends on his mood and life circumstances, making it hard to be consistent.

Supermarkets could help reduce parent-child conflicts by removing sweets from checkout areas or offering supervised play areas. Although parents might spend less without their children, the idea of shopping without their demands could attract more customers, balancing out any loss."
FCE_65,"Text: 'Going up the wall In the past, climbers went to mountains. Now, challenging climbs can happen anywhere, indoors or outdoors. The audience watches closely. High above them on the climbing wall, hanging upside down by just two fingers, is French climber Francois Lombard. He is competing in the World Cup Climbing Championships at Birmingham's National Indoor Arena. This arena is more known for hosting the TV show Gladiators, but both the show and the climbing championships have one thing in common - The Wall. The possibility of these events is due to new and fast-developing technology. Before the mid-1960s, climbers practiced on cliffs where there were good climbing spots. In winter, they either braved the cold, went walking, or climbed snow and ice in Scotland. As climbing evolved, it became important for top climbers to stay fit. With cliffs unusable for much of the year, they used brick edges or stone buildings to train. This kept their fingers strong and helped them avoid boredom. Soon, many sports centers started building walls specifically for climbing, using bricks with special edges to grip. Many of these early walls were inspired by Don Robinson, a physical education teacher who, in the mid-1960s, built a climbing wall in a corridor at Leeds University. Robinson had the idea of setting natural rock in concrete blocks, which could be part of a wall. Many climbing walls like this were built in sports halls across the country during the 1970s, but they had design issues. Walls could only be built vertically, while outdoor cliffs have features like overhangs and angled rock slabs. Another problem was that once built, the walls couldn't be changed, and climbers would get bored with the repetitive holds. In 1985, a Frenchman named Francois Savigny created a material that he shaped into forms similar to those found on cliffs. These could be attached to any wall and removed when climbers wanted a new challenge. French manufacturers also started experimenting with panels on a steel framework. Concrete was too heavy for overhanging walls without major construction, but steel frames could be set up anywhere as standalone structures. A system of interchangeable fixtures provided climbers with endless new holds.'"
FCE_61,"Text: If you tell someone you want to be an actor, they'll probably say it's 'risky' very quickly. Acting is indeed a risky career because there are more actors than there are roles. When you decide to become an actor, some friends might say you're crazy, while others might react differently. Everyone will give you different advice. But it's a personal decision, and only you can take responsibility for your ambition. There are no easy paths, no exams to pass, and no guarantee that training will lead to success. It's about luck and talent. However, there is a need for new talent, and acting can bring excitement, glamour, and sometimes big rewards. Talent is often seen as natural skill plus imagination, with imagination being hard to measure. It also involves courage and belief in what you're doing. The desire to act is hard to explain, but in theatre, it's about the connection between the actor and the audience. This connection drives actors. If you ask successful actors how they made it, they might shrug because they don't really know. They understand their skills and techniques but take nothing for granted, knowing their success can be temporary. Disappointment is a big challenge for actors. One month you might be out of work, and the next, you could be auditioning for a role. Even if you want the job badly, you might not get it. So, actors often find ways to handle the stress of auditions and rejection. Nobody likes being rejected, and this risk starts as soon as you begin auditioning professionally. You are showing that you are available, willing, and hopefully talented enough for the job. Ultimately, if you don't care enough, no one else will care for you."

FCE_28,"It's true - we're all getting taller. Chris Greener was only fourteen when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy. The teacher joked, ""What do you want to be, the flagpole on a ship?"" because Chris was already almost two meters tall. Today, at 228 cm, he is Britain's tallest man. On average, people in Europe grow about a centimeter taller every decade. More and more tall people are being born each year. Interestingly, this doesn't mean we're evolving into a new super race. Instead, we're returning to our original size from the time of the cavemen. We're finally overcoming the effects of generations of poor diets, which is having a big impact. Professor Chris Stringer, a palaeontologist, says, ""We are becoming like the Cro-Magnons again, the people who lived 40,000 years ago.""

For most of history, our ancestors ate a wide variety of foods: women gathered herbs, fruits, and berries, while men hunted animals. Some research shows they ate about 85 different wild plants. But about 9,000 years ago, agriculture was invented, which had serious consequences. Most green areas were taken over by farmers, and now just three carbohydrate-rich plants—wheat, rice, and maize—provide more than half of the calories we eat today. This limited diet has harmed our health and physical development. Over the centuries, we've eaten soups, porridges, and breads that left us underfed. In Ohio, scientists found that when people started growing corn, healthy hunter-gatherers became sickly farmers. Tooth decay and diseases increased. Corn, once thought to be a blessing, turned out to be a health disaster according to some anthropologists. Despite this, agriculture spread because farmed land could support ten times more people than hunter-gathering.

Only recently have wealthier nations started to address the poor nutrition of this system. In Europe, the US, and Japan, diets are now more like those of our ancestors. As a result, the average man in the US is now 179 cm, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm. This is a positive trend, but it comes with challenges. While people are getting taller, things like bed lengths and legroom in planes and trains haven't changed much. Clothes manufacturers also have to adjust their products. The question is: how tall will we get? We can't grow forever. There must be a limit. Robert Fogel from the University suggests it could be 193 cm, and we might reach it this century.

However, scientists note that while individuals are growing taller due to better nutrition, as a species, we are actually getting smaller. During the last ice age, 10,000 years ago, humans were slightly rounder and taller to keep warm. As the climate warmed, we became thinner and smaller, even with good nutrition. If the planet continues to heat up, we might shrink even more. So, global warming could counteract the growth in human height."

**The Farmer**  
Matt Froggatt used to work as an insurance agent in London but now runs a sheep farm. He spent 14 years in the business world, which he found exciting at first, but it eventually became tedious. He hadn't planned to leave for another five or ten years, but he was unexpectedly made redundant. Although the severance pay wasn't great, it was enough to start his farm. His big break came when he met the head chef of a local hotel with a top-rated restaurant. Supplying them helped spread his reputation, and now he also sells meat through mail order. He's happy to be out of the office, but he still works 80- to 90-hour weeks and is still selling a product.

**The Painter**  
Ron Ablewhite was a manager in advertising but now earns a living as an artist. Painting started as a hobby, but he found it more exciting than his job. Taking redundancy to become an artist seemed logical. A career counsellor was surprised when Ron said he didn't want to return to his old job, as most people in their mid-forties need to work for financial reasons. However, Ron and his wife married young, and their children were independent. They moved to the north of England, leaving friends behind, but their friendships have endured, with many visiting them now.

Katherine Goodison worked as a company lawyer for five years before starting her own hat-making business in her London flat. She enjoyed her job as a lawyer and earned well, but the long hours were exhausting. She didn't want to become a senior partner, so she left. Some people thought she'd get bored, but she never has. The key is having deadlines, as the fashion business is always busy with collections and seasons. She feels happier and less stressed now, though she misses socializing with colleagues. She loves being fully responsible for her work, as her name is on all the promotional material.

To change careers, he took various massage courses and was eventually offered part-time work at the Life Centre. He has no regrets and now feels in control of his life and destiny."
FCE_5,"Two brothers, Dave and Norm Lagasse, have turned a childhood game into a successful business. In their forties, they live in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA, and often play pichenotte, a game their grandfather, Lucien Rajotte, brought from Quebec, Canada. The family played it regularly, even after moving to New Mexico. The game was unknown in the southern USA, so visitors were intrigued by it.

Three years ago, Dave noticed their old pichenotte board was worn out and decided to make a new one. It was so well-made that relatives and friends wanted their own. Curious about the game's appeal, the brothers took a board to a sports bar in Santa Fe. Initially, people were skeptical, but once they tried it, they couldn't stop playing.

Dave researched the game's origins and found it likely started in India as 'carroms,' evolved into 'squails' in Britain, and was brought to Canada by British immigrants. The French-Canadian version, pichenotte, developed in Quebec. The game involves skill, with players flicking 12 pieces or 'pucks' across a board to score points by landing them in a hole or on concentric rings.

Seeing the game's popularity at the bar, the brothers made more boards and sold them at markets and craft fairs. The game became so popular that championships were organized, and a trophy called the 'Lord Pichenotte Cup' was created. As demand grew, the brothers decided to make pichenotte boards full-time. They set up a workshop in their garage and have produced over 450 boards, made of birchwood and mahogany, each weighing 12kg and 1cm thick. The boards sell for $595 on their website.

Although there are no professional pichenotte players or TV coverage yet, the brothers are optimistic about the future. They hope their business will eventually allow them to replace their garage workshop with a luxury car. Until then, they enjoy playing the game that might make them wealthy."
FCE_41,"**WELCOME TO THE MODEL VILLAGE**

When you enter the Model Village, it's hard to believe that just a few years ago, this area was a neglected piece of land, overgrown with brambles. It was considered useless for a long time. However, through the careful planning and hard work of one man, Colin Sims, and the constant support of his wife, this land was transformed into the beautiful village you see today.

During the construction, thousands of tons of soil and clay were moved to create the landscape. While machines like bulldozers helped, a lot of hard manual work was also needed. After shaping the land, about 1,000 tonnes of topsoil were added to create the lawns, flower beds, and rockeries. Hundreds of trees and shrubs were planted, carefully chosen to survive the salty air near the sea and the strong winter winds. Most plants came from local garden centers, but some were sourced from as far as Canada and New Zealand.

Colin Sims designed the entire village, and over 100 models were made by him over nine years since the village opened in 1972. The models are made from materials like stone, concrete, treated wood, and plastics to endure all weather conditions. Initially, Colin needed help from experts to understand how different materials would last over time, but he soon became an expert himself.

You'll notice that a consistent scale is used throughout the village, with great attention to detail. This was achieved through patience and unique construction techniques. The Model Village is a popular attraction, known for its high-quality craftsmanship and maintenance. The techniques used here have been adopted by other model villages in England and are even taught in some college courses.

The model buildings represent traditional British architecture but are not exact replicas of specific places. One of the most impressive is the Manor House, a typical 13th-century stone building with a brick tower, inspired by manor houses in the West Country. As you explore, you'll also see the Castle, St Mary's Church, a zoo, and a mini golf course, which is the newest addition.

Please stay on the paths during your visit and avoid touching the models, as any damage can require extensive repairs. Photography is allowed from the paths, and dogs are welcome if kept on a short lead. To enhance your experience, some models have buttons you can press to make them move.

At the end of your visit, we welcome your feedback. New models are always being planned, and your ideas can help us create a more diverse and interesting display. We also want to know if any models don't meet the village's standards, as we are constantly updating and replacing them. We hope you enjoy your visit and look forward to seeing you again. Don't forget to tell your friends about us!"
FCE_69,"Week after week, British tabloid newspapers publish photos that invade people's privacy and violate the editors' code of practice. While pop stars sometimes pose for paparazzi, this is not common. More often, people in the public eye are harmed when their private moments appear on the front page. Despite this, few people use the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), an organization meant to handle such issues. These photos rarely serve the public interest. Do intimate photos of pop stars help solve crimes? How did a photo of a famous actress on a hotel balcony protect public health and safety? The actress has previously complained about long-lens photos and had a valid reason to do so, as hotels are places where privacy is expected. However, she didn't take action, and the PCC didn't investigate, which is scandalous. The PCC should also look into a recent story about a pop star's love life. Like the actress, the pop star hasn't filed a formal complaint. Shouldn't the PCC take action on these and other inappropriate stories? Initially, this seems like a good idea. It would likely result in many rulings against newspapers, which would be reported by competitors and covered on TV and radio. The public wouldn't support the newspapers, forcing editors to stop publishing such content. Photographers would also be affected, as it would no longer be profitable to hide and take photos of celebrities. If the PCC acted as a 'police officer', it would face challenges. How would it decide to start an investigation? Should it encourage victims to complain? And if they refuse, should it proceed anyway? Celebrities and royalty might expect every story about them to be investigated and be upset if it isn't. The role is too large. How could the PCC monitor all British press: national, regional, and magazines? There's also the issue of embarrassment. Even if someone's privacy is invaded, would they want the added embarrassment of an investigation? Most likely want to move on with their lives. Some might have other reasons for staying quiet, like a worse story they want to keep hidden. In this case, even the PCC could be seen as an enemy. A British comedian was also targeted by the press when he and his wife were secretly photographed on their honeymoon. He didn't complain then or later when his family was photographed on holiday. He feared the newspaper, News of the World, would republish the photos with a new story about his 'anger', claiming it was just a joke and that, as a comedian, he should have a sense of humor. This fear is understandable. People worry they will be targeted again if they challenge the tabloids. Finding an easy solution to this serious problem is difficult."

We are not talking about those looking for another temporary job while searching for a permanent one, or those leaving a bad job after just a few weeks. Instead, we are discussing those who are taking a significant step in their career, choosing a job that matches their goals now that they have some experience, skills, and a clearer idea of their career path. 

What kind of job should you look for? It depends on your long-term goals. Consider if you want to specialize in a specific area, move up to higher responsibilities, or switch to a broader field. Whatever you decide, choose your second job carefully. Plan to stay in it for two to three years. This job will be important when you apply for your next one, as it should show that you are serious about your career. It should also challenge you, help you grow, and give you more responsibility.

If you feel like traveling, now is a good time to do it. You can work temporarily when you return and then find your second job. Future employers will be glad to see that you have satisfied your travel desires and are less likely to leave again.

FCE_17,"Confident people: What's their secret? Confident people might seem like they were always that way, but most will tell you it's a skill they've learned. Nina Hathway talks to five people about how they became confident.

A. Jenny: When I left school, I was very shy and thought I'd always be that way. At 25, I was asked to help at my daughter's school. I didn't think I could do it, but I surprised myself. Someone suggested I take a university course. I was nervous on my first day, but my confidence grew, and I became more outgoing. Working at the school was a turning point in my life.

B. Michaela: Four years ago, my father got sick, and I had to take over the family business. I was scared and became too aggressive, thinking that's what confidence was. But I learned that to be confident, you have to believe in yourself. If work gets too demanding, I don't feel guilty about postponing tasks. When faced with something difficult, I remind myself I have nothing to lose. Fear makes you lack confidence, so I talk to myself to overcome it.

C. Lisa: People think I'm confident, but the calmer I look, the more terrified I am. In TV, looking confident is crucial. Interviewing people taught me that everyone gets tense in important situations, and we feel calmer with friendly people. My mother once told me, 'Who's looking at you? Everyone's worried about themselves.' That's worth remembering. You gain confidence by facing fears. I was nervous for my driving test, but I passed and felt I'd never be that scared again.

D. Barbara: My confidence comes from enjoying my work, but it's something I've built over time. By learning from mistakes, you're more confident next time. I work hard and am popular at the restaurant, but not everyone likes me, and that's okay. You have to like yourself for who you are. My company offers training courses that boost self-esteem and encourages setting achievable goals. Seeing tangible achievements helps more than aiming too high and getting nothing.

E. Kim: After college, I worked as a secretary and was too scared to speak up in meetings. Eventually, I gained the confidence to share my opinions. When I started in politics, I was nervous about public speaking. I told myself, 'People do this every day, so you can too.' Writing notes helped, like a comfort blanket. Everyone feels a bit shaky speaking in public. The secret to confidence is telling yourself, 'Nothing is impossible.'"

'You should keep it,' he said, 'it's a tradition - if the line breaks, finders are keepers ... and I have plenty more.' He pointed to a pile of beautifully decorated kites at his feet. Each kite was exactly 120cm wide and long, made of tissue paper and split bamboo. We sat next to them under the shade of the coniferous trees behind the Beach of the Seven Lagoons in Kelantan, watching Malaysia's biggest kite festival. In the center of the beach were 10 platforms where helpers held up the kites, and a row of competitors held their kite lines, waiting for the countdown. When the whistle blew, the crowd cheered, and the kites soared into the sky like rockets. Over 500 men and boys had signed up for the competition, which lasts five days each year. Each participant entered four different kite designs, judged on decoration, stability, and flying efficiency. 'Flying kites isn't hard,' said Adnan, 'but making them requires real skill. Visit me at home, and I'll show you how it's done.' I accepted his invitation, one of five I received that day. At his house, I drank cold milky tea and ate fish crackers in a large polished room. As night fell, he invited me to return the next day to help rebuild his kite, but my plans didn't allow it. Instead, I explored the southern part of the state, driving towards Kuala Lumpur into mountains covered with lush rainforest. I took a wrong turn, and the smooth road ended at a river. A narrow boat was there to ferry people across. Nearby, a small sign caught my attention. It pointed up a path into the forest and read: 'Jelawang Jungle 3 km.' It would have been helpful to know that most of this distance was uphill, steep, and slippery. When I reached the track, I found a man waiting with a flask of tea. This was Baba, who managed a tented kitchen and several bamboo huts. I decided to stay, trying not to think about insects under my thin foam mattress. The night was completely dark, filled with various sounds. A waterfall roared nearby, and countless creatures moved and squeaked. In the morning, there was a stunning view over five ranges of green mountains. In the afternoon, it rained. First, the wind, then lightning hit the treetops. Moments later, I was soaked. Sliding downhill, I wondered how the giant butterflies avoided the huge raindrops. I also worried about my car being swept away (it sometimes happens) and the risk of drowning if I opened my mouth. Luckily, the car was still there, covered in mud, at the bottom of the track. In Kota Bahru, Kelantan's capital, everyone asked me questions: 'Where are you from?' 'How old are you?'

Suki, 26, art gallery assistant I'm a careful shopper - I like going, but I don't buy much. I usually know what I want and rarely go overboard. I sometimes shop to cheer myself up, but I often feel worse because I've spent too much! H. Ann-Marie, 29, nursery worker I love shopping, but only on certain days and never on a Saturday because it's too busy. I'd say I'm a careful shopper. I always have a good idea of what I want, and I never buy things immediately. I have to check other shops in case I find a better deal - it takes me a long time! I. Linda, 32, restaurant manager I'm an unwilling shopper - maybe because I work in the city center, the shops have lost their appeal for me. When I have to shop, I'll go, but I don't try things on because it's too much trouble. Clothes I buy don't always fit, but I don't mind too much. I'd rather make a few mistakes than spend a lot of effort shopping!'"

**Easter Quiz for Children**  
During the Easter holidays, young visitors can join a quiz about ""Surprises."" You can get the free quiz sheets at the Orange Street entrance. Children will explore 14 surprising paintings and answer questions about them. The quiz is available during normal gallery hours from 25 March to 9 April.

**New Picture**  
The Gallery has a new still life painting by Dutch 18th-century artist Jan van Os. This large painting (89.1 cm x 71 cm) shows flowers and fruit in bright colors on wood. It is one of the first of its kind in the Gallery. The painting is signed and dated 1777 and 1778 because the artist painted flowers as they bloomed in different seasons. Miss Violet Churchman donated it in memory of her sister Ida Nancy. It is now displayed in Room 25.

**Special Exhibition**  
The exhibition ""Painting in Spain during the late 18th century"" started in the Sunley Room on 15 March. The Gallery recently acquired works by three Spanish painters from this period: Paret, Melendez, and Francisco Bayeu. The exhibition also features Francisco's brother Ramon, Antonio Gonzalez, and two Italians who worked in Spain, Corrado Giaquinto and Giovanni Battista Tiepolo. The exhibition runs until 31 May.

**Lecture News**  
A series of lectures accompanies the special exhibition every Wednesday. On 5 April, Lizzie Barker will discuss Melendez's work. On 12 April, Sarah Symmons will lecture on Luis Paret. On 19 and 26 April, Juliet Wilson will talk about Francisco Bayeu. On Tuesdays in April, Erika Langmuir will explain how artists tell stories through their paintings.

**Gallery Restaurant Improvements**  
The Gallery restaurant now offers an improved and expanded service. With new kitchens, it provides a wide choice of hot and cold dishes at reasonable prices.

**Information for Visitors**  
Free guided tours of the Gallery are available every day at 11.00 am and 3.00 pm (except Sundays). These tours introduce some of the Gallery's greatest paintings and showcase the collection of important European paintings from the 13th to the early 20th centuries."

These weekly lessons, held in small classes, are so popular that there is a waiting list of 30 children eager to join. Parents pay £280 for the course, where their children can have fun and learn to cook well. Bill, a ten-year-old class member, says, 'I love my mum's cooking, and now I can do it better than her. The teachers make us laugh, especially when we sit down with them to enjoy the food we've made.' Flora, who is twelve, is having trouble with onions. 'I love cooking. I made a meal for ten friends, and they really liked it. Then my mum suggested I find a hobby instead of doing nothing on weekends. I was happy staying at home, so I wasn't too interested at first. But I'm really glad I decided to come.' Their teacher, Philippe, says, 'It's great fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, although the kitchen isn't always tidy when they're cooking! As adults, we're always learning more about food. If parents get their children interested in cooking while they're young, they'll have the skills to cook for themselves when they leave home.''"

PET_21,"Text: 'MONEY What is money? The pound, the dollar, or the franc are like units of measurement, such as a gram or a kilometre. The key difference is that you can use money to buy things. For example, a five-pound note can purchase a book, a large bag of sweets, or a couple of cinema tickets. However, the note itself is just a piece of printed paper that costs very little to produce. Thousands of years ago, people didn't have money as we do today. There were no banks or shops. Back then, a farmer like Mr. Green would trade the corn he grew for Mr. Hive's honey. This was a direct exchange between two people, each having something the other wanted. Over time, most societies created their own 'currencies' to make trading easier. These different currencies eventually started to connect, leading to the use of national currencies that we see today.'"

Hypatia's father was the director of Alexandria University, and he ensured his daughter received the best education possible. This was unusual because most women at that time had limited opportunities to study. After studying in Athens and Rome, Hypatia returned to Alexandria and began teaching mathematics. She quickly became well-known for her understanding of new ideas. Although we don't have any copies of her books, we know she wrote several important mathematical works. Hypatia was also interested in technology and invented several scientific tools to assist her work. During that period, many rulers were afraid of science, and anyone associated with it was at risk.

PET_27,"Grass is one of the most successful plants in the world. There are over 9,000 types of grasses, and they grow everywhere on Earth. Grasses are the only flowering plants that can survive in the cold environments of the Arctic and Antarctic. Grasslands are home to many animals, from small insects and birds to large animals like cows and lions. All these animals rely on grass in some way. Grass can quickly regrow after being cut or damaged. Unlike other plants, new grass leaves grow from below the soil, not from the top. This allows large groups of animals to live in one area. Once they eat all the grass, new grass starts to grow, providing a fresh meal."
PET_44,"Kal Kaur Rai, recently named Young Achiever of the Year at the Asian Business Awards, has always had a passion for fashion. Since childhood, she enjoyed drawing clothes and creating patterns. However, she never shared her dream of turning this hobby into a career with her parents, who owned a supermarket, because she believed they wanted her to pursue a more traditional career path. So, she studied management at university. 

After graduating, Kal moved to London and worked at an advertising agency. She needed to attend industry events but couldn't afford the designer clothes she admired, so she began making her own skirts and tops. Her friends loved her creations and asked her to make clothes for them too. This led her to find a small shop in London that agreed to sell her designs on a sale-or-return basis. Her clothes sold well, and nothing was returned, which gave her the confidence to leave her advertising job. She took out a £20,000 loan to start her own womenswear label.

Kal's parents were supportive of her career change, which made her happy. Now, her clothes are sold in over 70 stores, and her business earns more than £500,000. Her designs are featured in fashion magazines, she creates outfits for pop stars, and she has gained public recognition by winning the award. Kal acknowledges her success and feels fortunate, saying, ""What I do is my hobby - and I get paid for it! But remember, I've worked hard for this."""

PET_49,"Text: 'The Ghan Train Mark Ottaway traveled by train from Darwin, in the north of Australia, to Adelaide, in the south. The Ghan train crosses Australia from the warm northern coast through endless desert to the colder Southern Ocean. It's often called the 'famous Ghan', mainly because it's known for being late. The idea of a rail link between Darwin and Adelaide started in the 1920s with a line from Adelaide to Alice Springs, but flooding often made it hard for trains to pass. A new line was finished a few months before my trip. The railway was built for speeds up to 115 kph, but the Ghan is not a high-speed train. There are few stops, and most passengers are on holiday. The Ghan doesn't aim for luxury like the Orient Express, though the food on board is excellent. The railway was originally meant to carry goods, not passengers. It was thought that sending goods from Europe to Australia's south via Darwin and the train, instead of by ship around the continent, would save time and money. It's not every day a transcontinental railway is completed, and the Ghan claims to be the world's first north-south one. As I waited to board the Ghan, I saw everyone was excited about the journey. Most of my fellow travelers were Australian pensioners, eager to board. Our first stop, where the Ghan waited four hours, was at Katherine. Some passengers got off here for a boat trip up the gorge. I didn't leave the train until Alice Springs, where I went on a two-day trip to Uluru (Ayers Rock) with a small group and a guide. Climbing the rock isn't encouraged now, and few people do. Our group walked around the rock and stayed to watch the beautiful sunset. From Alice Springs, there are two trains a week heading south, so many passengers stop here. The view from the train after Alice Springs isn't very interesting. There's a lot of flat land, with only cattle to see. But at dawn on the third day, we reached the foothills near the Southern Ocean. My journey was over, and although the train might not have delivered on everything the ads promise, it took me to some of the most amazing sights Australia has to offer.'"
PET_31,"Each year, thousands of people climb Ben Nevis in Scotland. Because it's so far north, the weather can be very cold. Climber Keith Hewitt talks about his first time climbing Ben Nevis. It was February, and it was my first big winter climb. We took a route up the north face of the mountain to Tower Ridge. It's 600 meters up, probably the longest climb in Britain. We planned to camp for three days in the 'Carries', which are like big bowls in the mountain walls halfway up. We carried tents, sleeping bags, and metal spikes for our boots. You need these spikes because the snow can be so hard it's like walking on ice. Even though some of us were very experienced, we packed all kinds of safety gear, like lights to attract attention, hard hats, and extra clothes. The weather forecast was perfect, with no strong winds, but we still felt nervous when we started. Climbing Ben Nevis in winter is always a challenge. The path soon got steep, and my legs felt heavy. I was the weakest in the group, so I had to rest more often. The others sometimes stopped to let me catch up, but as soon as I reached them, they started again. I promised myself that I would always train properly before a climb in the future. After 200 meters, we reached the start of Tower Ridge, the path that would take us to the top of Ben Nevis. It's only a meter and a half wide, and the mountain drops hundreds of meters on each side. We knew we had to stay calm and focus on every step as we moved slowly along it. After seven hours of climbing, we reached the top. On a clear day, you can see the sea and all the way to the island of Skye, 48 kilometers away. But we weren't so lucky because a mist had come down. On Ben Nevis, getting back down to camp can be as challenging as going up. You need to read a map well because a wrong turn could lead to slopes too dangerous to go down in winter. I was glad we decided to take turns doing that job. That first time, it was only when I was safe in the tent that I could say I really enjoyed the experience. But at least I made it to the top."
PET_58,"Anna's new school

This week has been very exciting because we've just moved into our new school building! It's an incredible place. The builders used wood for the entire structure, just like our old school, but this one is designed to be very environmentally friendly, one of the first of its kind in our country. The construction took several months, so we watched it all happen. It was thrilling to see the builders clear the land, although it meant losing some beautiful open space. The noise from the machines was very loud, and the builders often had to stop because of heavy rain. We started to worry that the building might never be finished.

Now, we have five classrooms, which are huge—much bigger than those in our old, very old school next door. We share one room with the town's people for meetings and other events. There's also a nursery, a lovely dining room, and large changing rooms that we're eager to use once our new sports field is ready.

When you enter the school, you'll notice there are no heaters! Instead, the heat comes from us—the students, teachers, and the computers we use. The building is so well designed that it keeps all the heat inside—and the sound too. When we sing in our classrooms, it feels like we're in a concert hall!

Another interesting feature is the tree on the school roof! The builders placed it there after finishing the roof because it's a tradition in Austria, where the roof was made. The electricity for lights and computers comes from a wind turbine on a hill behind the school. We visited it with our teacher yesterday, and it spins very fast. It's so large that it can be seen from miles away! We took some pictures to put on our website.

Even though we're already using the new building, some parts are still being added. For example, we're currently putting on a play for parents, but we have to go back to our old school hall for it. The new hall will be ready by next year. We're thrilled with our new school, and our teachers say we'll learn much faster here!"

As I looked down at the river far below, I understood why people love rock climbing. My friend Matt and I arrived at the Activity Centre on Friday evening. The accommodation wasn't luxurious, but it had everything we needed: beds, blankets, and food. We were happy to be away from the city and breathing fresh air. On Saturday morning, we met the other ten members of our group. Cameron was there with his two friends, Kevin and Simon, while sisters Carole and Lynn came with Amanda. We all came from different places and none of us knew the area well. We knew we would spend the weekend outdoors, but we weren't sure exactly what we would be doing. Half of us spent the morning caving, while the others went rock climbing, and then we switched activities at lunchtime. Matt and I went to the caves first.

PET_60,"Sharks are some of the most intimidating animals in the ocean. They are excellent hunters because they have good eyesight and can sense movement through special lines on their bodies. This makes them very dangerous to smaller sea creatures, which they eat. While sharks share some similarities with other fish, their bodies are different. For instance, most sharks need to keep swimming constantly to breathe and survive, so they rarely sleep. Additionally, if sharks are flipped onto their backs, they can become completely still. This is helpful for researchers who need to study sharks, as it allows them to learn more about these interesting animals."

At my first ballet class, I felt nervous because I didn't know anyone. Everyone gathered around me, asking questions in Russian. I tried to respond in Russian, and then they switched to English, so we managed to communicate. Now, six months later, everyone is very kind to me, my Russian has improved a lot, and I understand my teachers. For the first two weeks after I arrived, my mum stayed with me, and when she left, I felt a bit sad. I even called home late at night once because I felt lonely. Compared to my ballet school in England, the classes in Russia are very challenging, and I eat a lot to keep my energy up. This makes me confident that I can meet the school's high standards. In the evenings, I watch my favorite films on my computer, but sometimes I fall asleep before the movie ends. Now that I've settled in, I feel really at home here. I enjoy walking around the city and visiting different shops, even in December when it was extremely cold. I decided to buy a fur hat because it was minus 10°C, but the Russians said it was mild for that time of year! At least my room was warm and cozy. Right now, we are preparing for a new production, and there's also a competition for young dancers that I'm going to enter. I feel so lucky to be here.'"
PET_55,"The ICEHOTEL

For many years, people visited the Arctic in the summer to see the midnight sun. In winter, however, only a few locals stayed in the snowy and icy landscape. By the late 1980s, people started to see the cold winter as an opportunity. In the winter of 1990, a French artist named Jannot Derit held an exhibition in a specially built igloo in Jukkasjarvi, a small town on the frozen Torne River. This igloo, called Arctic Hall, attracted many visitors. One night, some foreign guests decided to sleep there. They enjoyed the experience so much that the idea of an ice hotel was born. Today, the ICEHOTEL is famous worldwide.

Every winter, a team of snow builders, architects, and artists from around the world come to Jukkasjarvi to build the hotel for that year. As soon as one part is finished, it opens to visitors and overnight guests, while other parts are still under construction. The first section is ready in December, and new sections open each week until the entire hotel is completed by January 7th. Since the hotel is built outdoors using natural winter materials, the completion date can change depending on the weather. In spring, the hotel melts as temperatures rise.

Inside the hotel, the temperature stays between -5°C and -8°C, no matter how cold it is outside. Guests receive warm outer clothing like overalls, hats, and gloves as part of their stay. It's also wise to bring sweaters, a scarf, and plenty of wool socks. Choose footwear that is larger than usual to fit thick socks. If you're planning a visit, you can buy warm clothing and other items on the ICEHOTEL website. These can be delivered to your room when you check in.

The hotel is located in Jukkasjarvi, 200 km north of the Arctic Circle, but only 15 km from Kiruna airport and 17 km from Kiruna train station. Bus transport can be arranged from the airport or train station to the ICEHOTEL."

Around 6,000 people rushed to the store for special deals, like a leather sofa for £45 (available only until 3 am) and a bed for £30 (available only between 3 am and 8 am). Normally, the store will be open from 9 am to 9 pm every day, but Homestyle had planned to stay open for 24 hours straight on its first day. However, they had to close just 30 minutes after opening. A police officer at the scene said: 'We knew a big crowd was expected, but people were not patient. The store filled up quickly, and the managers wisely decided to close the doors. People outside got upset because they thought everything would be sold out before they could get in, and they refused to wait quietly. Another issue was the long line of cars trying to reach the parking lot. Many people left their cars in the middle of the road and walked to the store, which completely blocked the road.' One customer, Jenny Smith, who got inside, said: 'I waited for three hours and didn't have time to buy what I wanted. But the staff were calm and explained the situation. They had no choice because it wasn't safe. I'll come back when they reopen, but I won't wait in line again.'"

PET_34,"Tanya Streeter is a world-record holder in free-diving, a sport where divers go deep underwater on a single breath. In 2003, she made history by diving 120 meters without any assistance, holding her breath for over three and a half minutes. This achievement made her the first woman to break a man's world record in any sport. A team of fourteen safety divers monitored her dive at various depths. Despite concerns about the dangers of free-diving, Tanya believes that safety and training are crucial.

Most free-divers focus on specific events, but Tanya's training routine is consistent. She spends two-thirds of her time on land-based exercises at the gym, with the rest split between pool and ocean training. She uses an exercise bike to improve her heart fitness but avoids running to protect her knees, opting for fast walking instead. When practicing dives, she usually travels and aims to complete fourteen dives over four weeks, resting between each dive to avoid fatigue.

Outside of training, Tanya often appears in public to promote sports products and supports environmental causes through research and films. Growing up on Grand Cayman in the Caribbean, she loved swimming and exploring marine life, which she feels is reflected in her current life. Known in some countries, she uses her fame to raise awareness about environmental issues. In her thirties, Tanya plans to continue breaking her own records and has no intention of retiring soon, having started free-diving at twenty-five."

With new ideas and advanced computer programs, cartoons are becoming exciting again for people of all ages. By the late 1970s, the film industry thought cartoons were just for children. But soon after, a few directors came up with original ideas. They showed that it was possible to make films that both adults and children could enjoy. However, not every cartoon film was a hit. For example, The Black Cauldron didn't do well because it was too scary for kids and too childish for adults. Directors learned from this mistake, and film companies started making a lot of money again."
PET_26,"Title: Caroline Benson's Journey to Her First TV Role

Caroline Benson, a new TV star, shares her experience of landing her first TV role. She never imagined that during her first year at university, she would be filming ""The Finnegans."" Although she had only acted in school plays, she had loved the book since she was eleven. Her grandmother often said she was just like Polly Finnegan, and Caroline always dreamed of playing her.

Before starting university, Caroline took a year off to travel. While in Chile, her mother emailed her about plans to turn the book into a TV drama. Caroline felt she had to audition for the role. Her mother, initially surprised, sent Caroline's photo to the director and convinced him to meet her. Caroline flew back home and got the part.

The outdoor filming began a week after university started, so she got permission to be away for three weeks. Once back at university, she woke up at 6:00 am to catch up on missed essays. She didn't tell her university friends about her role, but they eventually found out and were very supportive. It was an incredible experience, and she feels very fortunate.

Caroline plans to pursue acting as a career after university, even though she doesn't come from an acting family—her grandfather was an opera singer. She has auditioned for other TV roles but hasn't received any offers yet. Despite her busy schedule, she managed to maintain a full social life. When filming ended, she felt a bit lost. Since then, she has acted in two college plays. Unfortunately, she hasn't been home much, and now that her first year at university is over, she's heading to Greece for the summer with friends."

Now, 'The Body Shop' has become an international company that is growing quickly worldwide. Over the years, I have learned a lot, and I have shared much of this knowledge in this book. I believe our company has valuable insights on how to run a successful business while staying true to our values. This book is not a typical business guide, nor is it just about my personal story. The key message is that to succeed in business, you need to be different. Business can be enjoyable, it can be run with love, and it can have a positive impact. In both business and life, I need to have fun, feel a sense of family, and be excited by surprises. I have always wanted the people who work for 'The Body Shop' to feel the same way. This book shares these ideas with the world and makes them public. I like to think there are no limits to our 'family' and no limits to what we can achieve. I find that thought exciting, and I hope you do too."

PET_30,"Honey is a sweet liquid made by bees, containing water and sugars. Bees can travel up to 75,000 kilometers and visit over two million flowers to make just half a kilo of honey. The color and taste of honey depend on the flowers the bees visit, with over 300 different types of honey available. Generally, lighter-colored honey has a milder taste than darker honey. In ancient times, honey was the main sweetener because sugar was very rare. It was highly valued by the ancient Egyptians, who even used it as a form of payment. Today, honey is produced and consumed worldwide. Studies suggest that honey can help prevent tiredness and boost athletic performance. Besides being a food, honey is also used for soothing sore throats and is an ingredient in many skin and hair-care products."
PET_7,"Norwich, the capital of East Anglia in Britain, has been inhabited for over two thousand years. It started as a small village by the River Wensum. By the time of the Norman invasion in 1066, it had grown into one of England's largest towns. Norwich is known for its religious diversity, with two cathedrals and a mosque. The first cathedral was built in 1095 and recently celebrated its 900th anniversary. In 1994, Norwich celebrated the 800th anniversary of receiving a Royal Charter, which allowed it to be called a city and govern itself independently.

Today, Norwich is relatively small compared to cities like London or Manchester, with a population of about 150,000. However, in the 16th century, it was England's second-largest city. It continued to grow and became wealthy, known for having as many churches as there are weeks in the year and as many pubs as there are days in the year. Although there are fewer churches and pubs now, the University of East Anglia was established in Norwich in 1964. The city has a growing student population and is a successful commercial center, being the largest insurance services hub outside London. Norwich offers a variety of entertainment options, including theatres, cinemas, nightclubs, cafes, restaurants, and arts and leisure centers. It also has a football team called 'The Canaries,' known for their green and yellow colors, though the origin of the name is unclear.

A modern shopping center, 'The Castle Mall,' is one of the city's attractions. For over two years, residents lived with a large hole in the city center as builders excavated the main car park. Nearly a million tons of earth were moved to create a city center park on the Mall's roof, featuring water pools and trees. The local people are happy that the old open market remains next to the new development. Both areas are thriving, showing that Norwich has successfully blended the old with the new."
PET_43,"The Albuquerque Balloon Festival

Every autumn, the sky above Albuquerque, a desert city in the southwestern United States, fills with bright colors. This is the Albuquerque Balloon Festival, a nine-day event held every year. The first festival took place in 1972 to celebrate the 50th birthday of a local radio station. It started with about a dozen hot-air balloons launching from a car park in the middle of Albuquerque. Since then, the festival has grown significantly. This year, at least a thousand balloons from over a third of the countries in the world are expected at its current location outside the city.

What to See

The pilots stay in radio contact and light up their balloons' burners at the same time. These are called 'balloon glows' and are great for taking photos. To see these 'glows,' you need to arrive just after nightfall or before 5:30 am as the balloons rise into the dark sky. During the day, you can walk among the balloons and talk to the pilots as they get ready for take-off. The balloons come in all sizes and colors, some shaped like animals, cartoon characters, or well-known products like soft drinks and fast food. Kids will love it.

In the afternoon, you can take a balloon flight over the desert with one of the many companies offering rides. Another option is to take the cable car from the desert floor to the top of the nearby mountains. This is the longest cable car ride anywhere and offers a bird's-eye view of the festival. There are many other attractions for visitors of all ages, including balloon races and fireworks on the opening night and the last three nights of the festival.

The Albuquerque Box

This is a local wind pattern that creates perfect conditions for balloonists. The Sandia Mountains protect the balloons from strong winds and create gentler wind currents at different heights. This allows skilled pilots to control the direction of their balloons by rising or descending.

Practical Advice

Buy your tickets in advance online to avoid long waits at the festival site. Wear several layers of thin clothing. It can be quite cool at night and in the early morning, but during the day, sunglasses and sunscreen are essential. Bring a flashlight for night-time events and, of course, your camera. If you're not using a digital camera, you'll need high-speed film for evening and night-time pictures."

Margaret, who lives in London, prefers to start teaching children at ages three and four, but she often makes exceptions for enthusiastic five-year-olds. When she began teaching the violin in 1972, her first students were her children's five-year-old school friends. Margaret's students have group lessons, with about twelve students in each group, and each lesson lasts an hour every two weeks. Additionally, each student has one individual lesson with her every week. Parents must also attend the classes because it is important for them to be actively involved in the lessons. From the very beginning, students learn to play by ear. They do not start reading music until they have been playing for several years, and for a long time, there is a noticeable difference between their playing and their music reading skills. Margaret explains that her method is not intended to create great violinists, and she often advises students who excel to leave and study the violin using more traditional methods."

Tom Wilcott is now playing bass guitar, replacing Simon McVee who left the band last year, and Tom Simpson has joined as the drummer. From the first song, which is a dance track, it's clear that the band is moving away from focusing only on slow songs. The second track is also a dance tune and is even louder and heavier. Most of the later tracks return to the band's usual slow style. These two dance tracks will surprise many fans, but they are excellent and could easily become hit singles. Singer Rob Letchford impressively hits every note perfectly. Fans should be thankful he recorded the songs before he had throat problems, which have caused the band to cancel their next tour. (Anyone who bought tickets shouldn't worry, as all concerts will be rescheduled once Rob recovers.) On this CD, Moonshine shows they can create perfect music in different styles, from the slow ones we know to the upbeat ones that make you want to dance. However, I felt that the best songs were at the beginning, and the last few tracks weren't as strong. Despite this, 'Here Again' is sure to be a big hit and bring more success to the band."

They often complain about the low number of women in the sport but use this as an excuse not to provide separate changing rooms. I put up posters, and 40 women of different ages and fitness levels joined. Most of them were interested in losing weight, but I don't think they had seriously considered running before. When they thought about it, they imagined difficult training sessions. They didn't picture themselves chatting and smiling while running in beautiful places, like along a river. Initially, they could only run for a minute, but now they can run for thirty minutes. They've also learned from other runners about diet and general fitness. I wanted to contribute to women's running, and I've enjoyed watching their progress almost as much as they have."
PET_40,"Text: 'THE HISTORY OF THE IDITAROD - THE LAST GREAT RACE ON EARTH In the 1880s, gold was found in Alaska, the northernmost state of the USA. Many people moved there, hoping to become rich. New towns were quickly built and expanded. One of these towns was named Iditarod, meaning 'far, distant place'. In 1909, it grew so fast that it briefly became the largest city in Alaska. During the summer, supplies could be delivered by boat, but in winter, the rivers and ocean froze, making access impossible. So, in 1910, a winter trail was created for dog sled teams to deliver mail, food, and clothes to gold miners. This trail was called the Iditarod Trail. It took about three weeks for a dog team to travel across Alaska. They stopped at 'roadhouses' where the drivers and dogs could rest and eat. The trail was used every winter until the 1920s when airplanes replaced steam boats and dog teams as the main transport method. However, in 1925, the dogs were needed again when a disease called diphtheria struck the city of Nome. The disease could be treated, but the nearest medicine was in Anchorage, on the other side of Alaska. Airplanes were still new, and it was uncertain if they could fly in such cold weather. Also, Carl Eielson, the only pilot skilled enough for the flight, was away. So, it was decided to use dog teams to transport the medicine. The journey covered over 1,000 kilometers, mostly along the Iditarod Trail. It took twenty teams just six days to complete the trip. Leonhard Seppala, a Norwegian who came to Alaska for gold, traveled the first 400 kilometers. He relied on his dog Togo to navigate through the blinding snow, and Togo proved to be a dependable guide. The last part of the journey was completed by Gunnar Kaasen, who had been driving dog teams in Alaska for 21 years. His lead dog was Balto. At one point, Balto refused to move forward, saving the team from falling into icy water. The diphtheria outbreak was stopped, and Balto became a hero. Today, a dog sled race is held every year from Anchorage to Nome, following the route of the 1925 journey. It is called the Iditarod and is known as 'The Last Great Race on Earth'.'"

Musicians from each band even created new tunes right on stage. It was exciting to watch, but even better when my band played! We have a great jazz band at my school, but not everyone who wants to join gets in—only about half do. However, anyone eager to play attends jazz practice before school, and we often spend time together after school, listening to jazz and learning its style. There are also trips to jazz summer camps across the country. I've been to a couple and learned a lot. Adults are often surprised that young people are interested in jazz. My music teacher thinks it's because pop music isn't challenging enough for serious music students like me.

""People laugh when we tell them,"" says Kath. ""But it's true. Gareth has wanted to be a clown since we took him to the circus when he was three."" When Alan lost his job, he and Kath decided to try and find full-time jobs with a circus. They both got jobs with a well-known circus, and Gareth started training to be a clown. He calls himself Bippo. They travel with the circus in the summer and go back home in the winter. Gareth's brothers are old enough to take care of the house while they are away. ""I can't say it was easy,"" says Kath. ""There was a lot to think about and organize. We only had a car and a very small caravan to sleep in, and we were leaving behind our lovely house. The only thing Gareth missed was his long, hot baths."" ""People ask about my education,"" says Gareth, ""but from the beginning, wherever we go, someone has always come to teach me. I use the same books as everyone back at school and I have a computer. I've never fallen behind my classmates."" And what about the future? ""It was a difficult decision,"" says Kath, ""but there was no other way to teach Gareth about being a clown. I'm happy to say it's working, and we're enjoying it."" And Gareth? ""I'm going to be the main clown in a circus one day,"" he says, ""maybe Bippo's circus."""
PET_52,"Eight-eighteen News is a news agency for young people aged 8 to 18. Our members gather news and write reports, stories, and articles. We send these to major newspapers, magazines, TV, radio, and websites for publication. Accepted stories can be read or listened to on our website. We have three centers nationwide where young people can meet and work on projects, and we plan to open more. Since starting in 1994 as 'Young News,' over 2,500 young people have joined us. 

Sophie, a former member, shares her experience: ""I learned about Eight-eighteen when they interviewed me for an article on young people's views on hip hop. I was impressed by the young journalists' opportunities. Age didn't matter; they were trusted to handle stories independently. I joined the Eight-eighteen center in my city, received training, and stayed until I was 18. The skills I gained helped me get a job at 19, and now I'm the youngest employee at a major news website, reviewing articles before they go online.""

When you join Eight-eighteen, you'll receive training and attend monthly meetings to decide who will write each news story. We encourage members to share skills. 'Peer trainers' are experienced members aged 12 and up who teach new members basic journalism skills. As they gain experience, some present sessions to young people and adults outside Eight-eighteen, often at youth clubs and summer camps, with support from older staff.

We hold training sessions for new members three times a year. The next session is in February. If you're interested in joining, contact Director Den Ley at 01622 657874 for more information. The program is open to children with all levels of reading and writing skills. Membership is free, and there's no test to join."
PET_28,"**Antarctica Sightseeing Flights Website**

Welcome to our website. Here’s what you need to know before booking a flight.

**Flight Overview**

During the short Antarctic summer, we offer sightseeing flights from Sydney, Australia, over Antarctica and back in a Boeing 747. Flight dates for next year aren't set yet, but if you book now, your deposit can be transferred if we change the date.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**How long is the flight?**

The flight lasts about 12 hours. After four hours, we usually see the first sea ice and icebergs. We spend four hours flying over Antarctica, and the rest of the time returning. During the flight, experts who have lived on Antarctic research stations give talks about the environment and history and answer questions. A camera near the pilot shows you a pilot's view from take-off to landing.

**Will I get a window seat?**

All passengers receive two boarding passes. Halfway through the flight, you switch to the seat on your second pass. Business and first-class passengers have a window seat for half the flight and a seat next to the window for the other half. Economy passengers have a window or next-to-window seat for half the flight and an aisle seat for the other half. Over Antarctica, we encourage passengers to move around the plane to share the views. The pilot flies in long 'figure 8s' over points of interest so both sides of the plane can see the sights.

**What if the weather is bad?**

We have 17 approved flight plans. On the morning of the flight, the captain checks satellite images and chooses the route with the clearest views.

**Will I see penguins and other wildlife?**

Most Antarctic wildlife is at sea level, over 3,000 meters below the plane, so we can't see them clearly. We don't land in Antarctica for environmental reasons. To see wildlife, you would need a boat tour.

**Can I take photographs?**

Absolutely! All cameras are welcome. We also offer fun photo opportunities on board where you can try on Antarctic cold weather clothes."
PET_35,"Text: 'Little Chefs For a group of children aged ten to fifteen, Saturdays are spent learning serious cooking skills. These weekly lessons, held in small classes, are so popular that there is a waiting list of 30 children eager to join. Parents pay £280 for the course, where their children can have fun and learn to make good food. Bill, a ten-year-old class member, says, 'I love my mum's cooking, and now I can do it better than her. The teachers make us laugh, especially when we sit down with them to share the food we've made.' Flora, who is twelve, is having trouble with onions. 'I love cooking. I made a meal for ten friends, and they really enjoyed it. Then my mum suggested I take up a hobby instead of doing nothing at weekends. I was happy staying at home, so I wasn't too interested at first. But I'm really glad I decided to come.' Their teacher, Philippe, says, 'It's great fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, although the kitchen isn't always tidy when they're cooking! As adults, we're always learning more about food. If parents get their children interested in cooking while they're young, they'll have the skills to make food for themselves when they leave home.''"
PET_5,"Winter Driving

Winter driving is dangerous because it's hard to predict what will happen, and accidents can occur easily. Fog might appear suddenly as you go over a hill. Ice can be hidden under melting snow, ready to make you lose control. A car coming towards you might unexpectedly slide across the road. 

Rule Number One for driving on icy roads is to drive smoothly. Sudden movements can make your car hard to control. So, whenever you turn the wheel, use the brakes, or speed up, do it gently and slowly. Imagine you have a full cup of hot coffee on the seat next to you. Drive in a way that you wouldn't spill it.

Rule Number Two is to be aware of what might happen. The more ice there is, the further ahead you need to look. Test how long it takes to stop by gently pressing the brakes. Remember, you might be driving faster than you think. Generally, allow double your normal stopping distance when the road is wet, three times this distance on snow, and even more on ice. 

Try to keep control of your car at all times to avoid trouble."
PET_41,"Craigie Aitchison was a painter from Scotland. He moved to London planning to study law but ended up going to art school. He found traditional drawing classes hard but continued painting. In his late twenties, he received a grant from the Italian government to study art, which sparked his interest in early Italian artists. This influence is visible in some of his work. Aitchison was inspired by the greens and browns of the Italian countryside and the clear light there, which he wanted to capture in his paintings. To achieve this, he painted colors in thin layers from light to dark, though he admits he never knows exactly how the final painting will look. He says, 'It's a secret - because I don't know myself. I don't start by painting yellow, knowing I'm going to put anything on top.' Aitchison makes it sound simple, saying, 'Anyone can do the colors - you can buy them. I simply notice what you put the colors next to.' Unlike some artists, he doesn't make sketches before starting a painting because he thinks it might make him lose interest. Instead, he changes his paintings many times before they are finished. This is why he prefers models who don't ask to see their portraits while he's working. 'If I feel they're worried and want to look at the painting, I can't do it.' Since moving to London, he hasn't felt connected to the Scottish art scene. He says he doesn't follow any tradition and just paints in his own way. However, his work still influences young British painters."
PET_38,"Two years ago, our 14-year-old son, Ben, asked for a drum set for his birthday. At first, we were against it because of the noise. Ben argued, ""It's better than watching TV or playing computer games in my free time, and it'll keep me out of trouble."" Eventually, we agreed. ""Okay,"" we said, ""but you must be considerate of the family and neighbors when you play.""

That was just the start. Since drums are hard to move, Ben's bandmates began coming to our house with their guitars and other equipment. So, for several hours a week, our house is filled with the sound of their instruments and singing. At least Ben's hobby has been good for our health: whenever the band practices, my husband and I go for a long walk. I must admit, even though their music sounds a bit unusual, they are a friendly and polite group of young men. I can't judge their musical talent—after all, I didn't expect my parents to like the same music I did as a teenager—but they do play regularly in local clubs for young people.

Our main concern is that they might not spend enough time on their schoolwork because of their music, though this hasn't happened yet. I always remind Ben how important his studies are. But one thing is certain—Ben was right: it has kept him out of trouble, and he is never bored."
PET_17,"Atlantic College

Last week, I visited Atlantic College, a top private school in Wales. This school is special because it offers students valuable experiences outside the classroom, along with their regular studies. The students, aged 16 to 18, come from all over the world. They spend their mornings studying, and in the afternoons, they engage in meaningful activities like helping on a farm, assisting people with learning difficulties, or checking rivers for pollution.

One of the best things about Atlantic College is its diverse student body. Students come from various social backgrounds and countries. Since the fees are high, at £20,000 for two years, many students receive financial aid. A quarter of the students are British, and many of them attend thanks to government support.

Barbara Molenkamp, a student from the Netherlands, said, ""I really admire the college for promoting international understanding among young people. You learn to live with and respect others, even those you don't get along with. During the summer holidays, my mother noticed I argued much less with my sister.""

In conclusion, Atlantic College provides its students with an excellent education through effective methods."
PET_47,"Text: 'Being an older student At 32, I have just finished my first year at university. I attend lectures regularly, and I've had to learn to read books quickly and write long essays. I decided to go to university after being away from school for fourteen years. As a secretary, I was earning a decent salary, but I was bored because the job didn't challenge me mentally. I felt trapped in the job and became more and more unhappy. I envied the students at the local university because they seemed happy, carefree, and hopeful, and I wanted to be part of that. However, now that I'm a student, I find it hard to connect with younger classmates. They often mistake me for a lecturer and ask me questions I can't answer. I also feel distant from the lecturers because, even though we are the same age, they know much more than I do. But I am grateful for this chance to study because I know a qualification is necessary for a fulfilling job, which is very important to me. Unlike most eighteen-year-olds, I prefer spending weekends with my books rather than going out partying. There are also typical student perks like long holidays and discounts at theatres and cinemas. I often wonder what I'll do after university, but I hope that continuing my education at this stage in life has been a good decision.'"
PET_48,"Henry Ford was born on a farm in Michigan in 1863, but he didn't enjoy farming. At fifteen, he started working as a mechanic and built his first car in 1893. After driving it for 1,500 kilometers, he sold it and made two larger cars. In 1903, he founded the Ford Motor Company. He used strong but lightweight steel to make affordable cars for regular people. In 1908, he created the first Ford Model T, which cost $825. Soon, he was selling 100 cars every day. By 1927, the Ford Motor Company was valued at $700 million. Early Ford cars were simple and inexpensive, but this simplicity sometimes meant fewer options. Henry Ford famously said about the Model T, ""You can have any color you like, as long as it's black."""

KET_13,"CANADA GEESE

Canada Geese are large birds with blue and white feathers. When autumn comes, they need to fly south to warmer places because the winters in Canada are too cold for them to survive. Last spring, Bill Lishman discovered sixteen young Canada Geese on his farm. They had lost their parents, and Bill worried that they wouldn't know where to go in the autumn. Bill had a small plane, so he decided to teach the birds to follow him. Throughout the summer, he took short flights in his plane, and the young geese flew behind him. When autumn's cold weather came, Bill flew to Virginia in the United States, which is 600 miles south of his home in Canada. The geese followed him all the way there. Bill left the geese in Virginia and returned home. This spring, Bill expected the birds to come back, but they didn't show up. So, he flew to Virginia to find them. He searched for two weeks but couldn't locate them. When he got back home, he found the geese waiting for him. They had managed to find their way back without his help!"

She sold each jar for £1 to her friends and quickly doubled the £500. Initially, her parents were not happy with her making jam; they wanted her to study and become a teacher or a doctor. However, Esther ignored their wishes and continued her jam-making. After a few months, she began selling her jam at the local market. She then expanded her business by making orange juice, which she sold to a school where a friend worked. After two years, her business grew significantly, and her parents were proud of her achievements. She produced various foods and sold them to shops and supermarkets.

KET_46,"Corryvale Farm is located in the west of England. Stephen and Jenny Blackler run the farm, where they have cows and chickens, selling milk and eggs. However, most of their income comes from Jenny's sheep. She owns 50 sheep, and each sheep produces enough wool for six sweaters. Every six months, Stephen shears the sheep to prevent them from overheating. 

Five years ago, Jenny decided to make sweaters from the wool and sell them at country markets. Unfortunately, it was summer, and the hot weather meant people weren't interested in buying sweaters. So, she started making socks instead. The socks were a hit because they were affordable, durable, and easy to wash. This marked the beginning of Jenny's business. Initially, she made the socks at home, but as her customer base grew to thousands, she had to send the wool to a factory. Now, the socks are produced by machines.

Jenny's socks come in six colors, five sizes for all ages, and are designed for different activities like walking, sports, and skiing. The busiest time for Jenny is Christmas, as Corryvale socks are a popular gift. In Jenny's office, the walls are covered with letters from satisfied customers from around the world."

KET_10,"Text: 'BURGLARS LOVE THE AFTERNOON Most house burglaries occur between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m., according to the police. Inspector Ian Saunders informed our newspaper that house burglaries have increased by over 30% compared to last year. He mentioned that 67% of these burglaries happen when people leave and forget to close a door or window. He further explained that burglaries at night are rare because families are usually home. However, he noted that winter afternoons are ideal for burglars because it is dark, making it easier for them to go unnoticed. Additionally, many houses are empty during this time as people are often still at work. Inspector Saunders suggested leaving lights on in living rooms and bedrooms when you go on holiday to deter burglars. He also encouraged neighbors to keep an eye on each other's homes when people are away and to contact the police if they notice anything unusual. 'We can also advise you on how to secure your home,' Inspector Saunders added. 'This assistance is free of charge.''"

KET_44,"Text: 'The History of Farming Before farming, people gathered plants and fruit from forests to eat. This meant they had to move constantly to find food. However, around 12,000 years ago in the Middle East, people began to cultivate crops. These were the first farmers. Farming allowed people to settle in one place, and their villages gradually expanded. Some villagers could focus on other tasks, like making clothes, because farmers provided food for everyone. Unfortunately, farming was challenging during bad weather, leading to food shortages. Today, farmers can produce more food, and it is transported over long distances to reach our homes.'"

In the past, farmers spent a lot of time observing the sky, animals, and plants to understand the weather better. Nowadays, there are many computer programs that help us learn about the weather, and people can even access weather information on their mobile phones.

This isn't because of homework; they have created a new computer word game. The idea for the game came from Frazer's younger brother, Kevin, who struggles with reading. Kevin finds it easier to learn words by seeing pictures and hearing information rather than just reading. Frazer wanted to help him. So, Frazer and Peter spent over 200 hours developing a computer game, which is now ready to use. It's a game that uses both speech and pictures. For instance, when you see the word 'hat', there is a drawing of a hat next to it, and you can hear Peter saying 'Hat! Hat!' at the same time. The boys have won many prizes for their game, and it will soon be available for sale worldwide. Many schools are interested in purchasing it."

KET_58,"Bollywood, the film industry in Mumbai, India, produces nearly 1,000 films each year. Since its first film in 1913, Bollywood has created over 29,000 films, making it the largest film industry in the world, surpassing the USA. Watching films is the most popular leisure activity in India, with ten million people going to the cinema daily. Bollywood films often feature romantic love stories, with singing and dancing as key elements. These films are also popular outside India, earning Bollywood over $500 million last year from international sales. Indian actors make more films annually than their Hollywood counterparts, but they earn less money. As a result, most Bollywood films cost about $2 million to produce, whereas Hollywood films usually cost at least $5 million. Most Bollywood actors are young and work intensely for a few years.

A young Englishman named Howard Bonnier opened a restaurant called The Palace there about three and a half months ago. Not many people in Britain know Mr. Bonnier's name yet, but he is already quite famous in France. This is because he has written for French magazines about almost all the best restaurants in that country. He is only 29 years old. When Howard was a teenager, he often went to restaurants with his parents. He enjoyed this so much that he decided not to spend money on clothes and CDs; instead, he used his money to visit France and dine in good restaurants. He also bought many French and English cookbooks—he says he has more than two hundred and fifty! So why did he decide to open a restaurant? Simply because he loves cooking. Has it been easy? He says it's expensive to start your own restaurant and much more difficult to cook for fifty people than for your family, but he is sure he has made the right choice."
KET_34,"John Pickering works in a park in a small town in central England, where he cuts the grass and waters the flowers. However, last week he was in Tokyo, where millions of Japanese people watched him on television. This is because John, who is 35 years old, is currently the top singer in Japan. He first went to Japan a few months ago to perform in dance clubs in Osaka and Nagoya. A disc jockey heard his songs and played them on the radio, leading to hundreds of young people calling in to request the songs again. In Japan, John performs under the name Jon Otis. Despite his success, he plans to continue working in the park in England because he is unsure how much money he will make from his music. ""I need to keep my job in the park,"" he says. ""I still have bills to pay!"" The other gardeners are unaware of his fame in Japan and have never heard him sing. John's wife, Denise, who works in a hospital, says, ""This won't change our lives. I only know John Pickering, not Jon Otis!"""

KET_26,"Line dancing has become a popular hobby for thousands of people in Britain. In nearly every town, you can find clubs and classes dedicated to this activity. According to Fiona Lever, a line dancing teacher, ""Line dancing is easy to learn. If you can walk, you can do it!"" You don't need a partner because you dance in groups, making it a great way to meet new people. Her classes include both young and old participants. Boys particularly enjoy it because they can make a lot of noise with their feet while dancing. When did line dancing start? Most people believe it began about fifteen years ago when American country music gained popularity in Britain."
KET_8,"Text: 'The Rhino There are five types of rhinos in the world today. The Black and White Rhinos live in the open fields of Africa, while the others live in Asian forests. All rhinos have large, heavy bodies. Their skin is very tough and they have very little hair. A rhino's big body stands on four short legs, and each foot has three toes. They usually walk slowly, but they can run up to 50 kilometers per hour. Rhinos are generally quiet and calm animals, and they eat only grass and other plants. A baby rhino weighs 40 kilos at birth and has been inside its mother for about fifteen months. An adult rhino weighs over 200 kilos and can live up to 50 years.'"
KET_4,"Text: 'THE HISTORY OF THE LONDON POLICE Today, police officers are everywhere, but in 1700, London had none. A few elderly men used to guard the streets at night, and they were poorly paid. Around 300 years ago, London began to grow. The city was very dirty, and many people were poor. There were so many thieves stealing money in the streets that people preferred to stay at home. In 1750, Henry Fielding started paying a group to catch thieves. They were similar to policemen and were called 'Bow Street Runners' because they worked near Bow Street. Fifty years later, there were 120 Bow Street Runners, but London had grown much larger and needed more police. So, in 1829, the first Metropolitan (or London) Police Force was established with 3000 officers. Most of them patrolled on foot, but a few rode horses. Until 1920, all the police in London were men. Today, London police are well paid, and those who still ride horses earn even more than the others.'"

KET_7,"Visit the Edinburgh Festival! Every year, thousands of people visit Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland, to experience the Edinburgh Festival. For three weeks in August and September, the city is full of actors and artists from around the world. They come for the largest arts festival in Britain. During this time, the streets are lively with music and dance from morning until night. You can even watch artists painting on the streets. One of the highlights of the Festival is the 'Fringe', where students perform comedy shows in small venues like halls and cafes. Many tourists come to see new films, plays, and listen to music by famous musicians. This year, there are over five hundred performances with actors from more than forty countries. Tickets for these shows are quite affordable, and it's often easier to see your favorite star in Edinburgh than in London. So, plan to visit Edinburgh next summer, but remember that finding a room can be tough, so consider booking your hotel now!"
KET_43,"ICE-FISHING

If you drive three hours north from Toronto, you'll reach Lake Nipissing. In winter, the lake freezes, and thousands of Canadian fishermen visit every weekend. They build small wooden huts on the ice and paint them in bright colors. Inside these huts, they fish for the fish swimming beneath the ice.

Bob Marvisch has been coming here every year for twenty-five years. He says, ""You need clothes that are light but warm: two pairs of socks and gloves, several thin sweaters, and a snow suit on top. Catching the fish is easy. First, you break the ice and make a small round hole. Then, you take a fishing line, put some bread on it, and drop it through the hole into the water. You pull the line up when the fish eat the bread. The fish are between ten and twenty centimeters long. Some people like to eat them, but after catching three or four, I prefer to have some chocolate or another snack! Today, I've caught twenty-five! It's a great sport, and you can meet some nice people here!"""

KET_11,"Madame Tussaud's Museum is a very popular tourist attraction in London. At this museum, visitors can see wax figures of famous people. Madame Tussaud, whose real name was Marie, was born in France in 1761. Her uncle was a doctor who created wax figures of people and opened a museum for them in Paris. Marie worked with him on these figures. During the French Revolution in 1789, Marie was imprisoned and had to make wax copies of the heads of famous people who had died, including Queen Marie Antoinette. In 1795, Marie married Francois Tussaud. In 1802, she moved to London with her wax figures and opened a museum there. Her wax figures are still on display today."
KET_14,"BICYCLES

Bicycles are an affordable and environmentally friendly way to travel. The first bicycle was created about 150 years ago. Initially, bicycles were costly, so only wealthy people could afford them. These early bicycles looked very different from the ones we see today. As bicycles became more affordable, many people started buying them. People began using bicycles to commute to work and for leisure activities. Nowadays, cars are used more often than bicycles because they are faster and protect you from the rain. However, some people still prefer cycling to work. They argue that there are too many cars in city centers, making it hard to find parking."
KET_63,"Text: 'The Elephant Show by Daniel Allsop, age 14 Last summer, I went to Thailand for a beach holiday with my family. One day, we visited a park near our hotel. It had beautiful flower gardens, but we were mainly interested in the elephant show. We went to a large square with seats on three sides. Three elephants came in with their keepers and stood in front of large white cards. Each elephant was given a paintbrush and started painting on its card. The keepers occasionally gave them new brushes with fresh paint. Following their keepers' instructions, the elephants slowly drew pictures. I was amazed! One picture showed a river, another a tree, and the third a bunch of flowers. When the keepers held up the paintings, everyone wanted to buy one. We gave the elephants the bananas we had brought for our lunch. Twenty years ago, elephants worked in the forest. Now, they don't work there anymore, but the smartest ones live in special centers where visitors can watch them.'"
KET_56,"Text: 'Big Cats There are many different types of big cats, and they vary in size, appearance, and behavior. Tigers are the largest of the big cats, reaching up to 3.7 meters in length from head to tail. Unlike most cats, tigers enjoy water and will often cool off in pools when it's hot. Lions are unique among big cats because they live in large family groups called prides. In these groups, several lions work together to hunt and provide food. Lions typically inhabit flat, open areas where they have a clear view to track other animals. All big cats need excellent eyesight to hunt smaller animals for food. They also require speed and strength to catch their prey.'"

KET_20,"The ostrich is the largest bird in the world, with adults weighing over 90 kilos. Most wild ostriches are found in southern Africa, but their numbers are low. Although ostriches have wings like all birds, they cannot fly. Instead, they use their wings to help them change direction while running. Ostriches are very fast runners, reaching speeds of 65 to 90 kilometers per hour, making it hard for predators to catch them. Baby ostriches are about the size of chickens and take around 3 years to grow into adults. They eat plants and can survive for several days without water."
KET_40,"Victoria Jamieson from Britain began snowboarding at the age of 20. Now, at 23, she has won many competitions in the sport. We interviewed her last week at a snowboarding competition in Switzerland and asked why she took up snowboarding. She said, ""I've always enjoyed all kinds of sports, especially skiing, so snowboarding felt like a natural choice. It's quick to learn, and you can become really good in just a few months."" 

When asked about her practice routine, she explained, ""In winter, I snowboard in the mountains every day from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. I also run and bike. But I love doing all of it! I enjoy the competitions and being in the mountains because it's so beautiful. However, free-riding, which is snowboarding outside of competitions, is the best thing in the world for me.""

We also asked her what is important when learning to snowboard. She advised, ""You can learn quickly, but you need lessons. It's also crucial to have the right clothes so you don't get wet, as you'll spend a lot of time falling down at first!"""

KET_64,"Mount Kilimanjaro is the tallest mountain in Africa. People of all ages have climbed it, from a seven-year-old boy to an 87-year-old man. There are different routes to reach the summit. The Marangu route, which is five kilometers long, is considered the easiest. It usually takes about five days to complete and is very popular with tourists. However, only about half of the climbers manage to reach the top. This is often because the weather can change very quickly. At the start, it might be hot and wet, but at the summit, there is ice and snow, and temperatures can drop below 20 degrees Celsius. Climbers need to bring both sunglasses and warm clothing!"

Otters are excellent swimmers and can move through the water at speeds over 10 kilometers per hour. They have thick brown fur that keeps them warm in the water. An otter can close its ears and nose, allowing it to stay underwater for several minutes. Twenty years ago, there were not many otters in Great Britain because the rivers were polluted, causing many fish and insects to die, leaving otters with little to eat. However, today the rivers are clean again, providing plenty of food for them.'"

In the past, Gail was famous for finishing second in major competitions. However, she was always cheerful and smiling, which made her popular in her hometown. Everything changed in 2004 when she participated in her first half-marathon, a long road race. She won with an impressive time, the fastest that year for any British woman. Gail's manager and husband, Mike Rollins, used to race when he was younger but had to stop due to an injury to his right leg. He can still run a bit and sometimes trains with Gail, but it's tough for him when she speeds past and he can't keep up. Gail trains diligently, doing a long run in the morning and fast runs in the afternoon, but she takes Sundays off to rest. ""I'm with her all the time,"" says Mike. ""Sometimes I ask, 'Are you sure you should be eating that?' It's usually about cakes, but she can eat almost anything."""
