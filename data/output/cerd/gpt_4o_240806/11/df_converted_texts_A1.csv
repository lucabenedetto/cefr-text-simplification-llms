CPE_15,"Text: 'Paying for Trash Some people think families should pay for each bag of trash they make. This idea sounds good for the environment and money, but it might not be. In many places, trash is picked up for free. Families pay for this with local taxes. But a family with a lot of trash pays the same as a family with little trash. More trash means more workers and trucks are needed, and this costs more money. If trash pickup is free, people might make too much trash. One idea is to make families pay for each bag of trash. This might make them throw away less and recycle more. But two American economists, Don Fullerton and Thomas Kinnaman, found this idea has problems. They studied towns in America where people pay for trash. People buy stickers for their trash bags. Only bags with stickers are picked up. In Charlottesville, Virginia, people paid 80 cents for each bag. The number of bags went down by 37%. But people just put more trash in each bag. The weight of trash went down by only 14%. In other towns without this system, trash went down by 3.5% anyway. Some people also dumped trash illegally. This might be 30-40% of the trash reduction. One good thing was a 15% increase in recycling. But many people were already recycling. In another study, the economists found that higher prices for trash stickers only reduced trash a little. A 10% price increase cut trash by only 0.3%. People would need to buy less of everything to make a big change. Other things like income and education might also affect how much trash people make. Richer towns make more trash and have less time to recycle. Charging for trash is not a bad idea, but it is complicated. Simple ideas can have complex results.'"
CPE_19,"Text: 'Work Theodore Zeldin talks about how our work life can change. Do you feel respected at work? Success in a job is not enough anymore. Many people feel their jobs are not valued. Even famous people can feel unhappy. Loving your job used to be special. Now, you need to think about how your job affects you as a person. This is important. If your job makes you boring or too busy, no money or status can make up for it. I want to find out how work can make us happy and help us grow. Work should not just be about making money. It should help us live better and meet new people. Even jobs like doctors and accountants are not as good as they used to be. Many people are stressed and unhappy. Companies are getting smaller, and workers do not feel connected to their jobs. In Britain, only 8% of workers feel their values match their company's values. I am looking at different jobs to see how they affect people. I want to find better ways to work. Many people work hard but do not feel alive at work. They feel like they have no choice. For example, hotel workers often have low pay and long hours. Hotels could be more than just places to sleep. They could be places where people meet and learn from each other. But hotels focus only on making money. Work is a relationship. People want to be independent and choose their jobs and coworkers. They need to talk and understand each other. Good conversation can change the world a little bit each time.'"
CPE_24,"**Broadcasting: The Story of TV and Radio**

Broadcasting started as a word for planting seeds by hand. It means spreading things widely. This idea fits with how TV and radio work. They send out shows from one place to many homes.

In the 1930s, people tried different ways to use TV. Some wanted TV to be like a phone, where people could talk back and forth. In Britain, hobbyists built their own TV sets. But big companies set rules that made it hard for these hobbyists to continue.

TV was mostly watched in public places, like theaters, in the early days. This was true in the USA, Britain, and Germany. But soon, people wanted TVs in their homes. As more people could afford TVs, they became a part of everyday life.

Broadcasting helped governments share important news with everyone. It also helped people feel connected to their country. Broadcasting was important for democracy because it gave everyone access to information.

Today, broadcasting is changing. The way we use TV and radio might be different in the future. But the idea of spreading information widely will always be important."
CPE_13,"**Clutter**

Sometimes, it feels like no matter how many things you have, you never feel safe. It is normal to want a home that meets your needs, but sometimes wanting more things can get out of control. Modern ads are made to make us feel like we need more. They tell us, ""If you don't have this, you are not good enough."" Try not to look at any ads next time you walk down the street. Ads are everywhere—on TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, t-shirts, and the internet—all telling us to buy more.

**Caves**

People around the world study caves. They want to know where caves come from, how water moves in them, and what lives in them. Caves are a small but interesting part of nature. They make us curious and we want to learn more about them. Many people study caves, both professionals and people who visit caves for fun. Studying caves can be hard because you need to be able to move well to get inside them.

**Weather Watch**

A long time ago, people watched the weather with just their eyes. This helped start the study of weather, called meteorology. Today, we use satellites and computers to learn about the weather. Computers can do math very fast, faster than people can. Weather science uses big words, but simple weather knowledge is still important. Human experience helps turn computer data into weather forecasts. People can still see things that help weather experts understand the weather better."
CPE_16,"**Music and Theatre**

I used to think opera was mostly theatre. But now I know music is more important in opera. I come from the theatre world, where words and actors are very important. In theatre, the audience and actors usually speak the same language. 

In music performances, like concerts or opera, many people don't know much about music. They might feel embarrassed about this. But they admire the skill of the musicians. Watching a great musician is like watching athletes. We know they are doing something amazing.

Theatre audiences have different expectations. They don't always understand an actor's skill. They might not be impressed by a long speech. But they often ask, ""How do you learn all those lines?"" Theatre audiences and performers meet on more equal terms.

Can music learn from theatre? I think yes. Music is full of emotion and can be like theatre. But music often feels formal, with dress codes and respect for conductors. Sometimes, audiences clap at the wrong time, which can interrupt the music.

Many people are trying to make music more welcoming. I remember a special event, a community opera, where the audience moved with the action. It was a great musical experience and changed many people's lives.

I want music to take more risks, like theatre. Sometimes, using new places for music can surprise everyone. It might be uncomfortable, but theatre audiences are used to this. I believe music can change and become more exciting. I love both theatre and music and want more people to enjoy them."
CPE_21,"**Sand**

I do not like sand very much. Sand can become glass and concrete, which is useful. But on the beach, sand is a problem. It blows in your face and gets in your food. It hides things like car keys and coins. When you are wet, sand sticks to you and is hard to remove. But when you step on a towel or get in a car, sand falls off. For days, you find sand in your shoes and socks. Sand stays with you for a long time. I do not want sand.

**Lock and Key**

People want their homes to be safe and private. Long ago, people used a beam to lock the door. Now, we have electronic locks with many combinations. But people still like using a key. Some companies tried using smart cards for locks. But people prefer turning a key at home. So, one company made an electronic lock with a metal key.

**Modern Art**

I was nervous to visit the new Tate Modern gallery. I do not understand modern art. I like some things, like furry art and neon lights. I do not know much about art, so I do not have many opinions. Art should talk to you, but it does not work for me. The new gallery helps visitors understand art. The labels explain what the art is about. This helps me understand the pictures better."
CPE_46,"**Every Picture Tells a Story**

When books become movies, many parts are cut or changed. This can be hard for the writer, but it can also help them see new things. When I worked on a movie script, I saw that I could remove a lot of the book's dialogue and description, but still keep the main idea. This doesn't mean the book's words were not needed. It's about how each type of story, book or movie, needs different things. In books, we often see repeated details about characters or who is speaking. This helps us understand better. In plays, which are mostly talking, the extra words make it feel like real speech. Some modern plays use a lot of extra words, so we don't always know what is being said.

**Watching Movies**

When we watch movies, we can feel like we are in a different world. For a short time, we forget about real life. But when the movie ends, we come back to the real world. Some people used to think movies were just for fun, not art. They liked watching them but didn't think they were important.

**The Film Studios**

The Leiper Film Company studios had many different buildings. It was hard to find your way around. There were three main entrances, but only one took you where you wanted to go. It was confusing for new people, but the workers knew their way. These workers made movies that brought excitement and adventure to people.

**Film-makers**

Many people want to make movies. There are books and classes on how to do it. Some people, like Robert Rodriguez, made movies with little money and became famous. He made his first big movie when he was young. In the past, movie makers took more time to learn. They worked on small projects first. Now, without big studios to help, new film-makers have to be different and creative."
CPE_3,"Text: 'A long time ago, many houses were on the west side of the city. They were small and not very nice. In summer, a factory nearby made the air smell bad. In the morning, a paperboy would hold his nose because of the smell. I don't remember much from when I was young. But I do remember sitting by a window and looking at the houses. I also remember my mother. She was often angry, and I didn't know why. She liked things to be very clean and proper. She didn't like people going into other people's gardens or making noise. My mother had some friends. They talked about the weather and their children. Growing up in West Earlham was the same for everyone. Before you were five, you stayed at home. After that, you went to school. Some kids went on bikes with their mothers. I went with other kids. I remember summer holidays. We saw new things outside West Earlham. Once, we went to a charity event, but my mother didn't like it. She thought people wanted money. My mother didn't trust politicians. She thought they took people's money. But she cared about my education. Sometimes, we went to the museum. My mother liked looking at the paintings. Once, she made a joke about a painting of a soldier.'"
CPE_10,"**Philadelphia Avenue**

I walked down Philadelphia Avenue. It was getting dark, and the air was wet. I felt like I was hiding. I knew this street well. My neighbors were the Matzes and the Pritchards. Han Kieffer had a grocery store here. My friends lived in the Kring's and the Pottses' houses. I used to play with them. The houses were special to me. I remembered the little paths in the cement where rainwater flowed. I used to skate or ride my scooter over them.

As I walked, I noticed the houses changed. The porches were lower, and the yards were smaller. Over time, wooden porches became iron ones. Some houses became stores, and some stores became houses again. I wondered how people lived in these old store spaces.

**Bachelor Fads**

Rick Gilbert lives in a flat that used to be a curtain warehouse. It has big doors and brick walls. He didn't want an open space. He wanted separate areas for work and living. He used a big plastic sheet to make a hallway and hide his office. The kitchen is in the middle. He wanted it to be a place for both work and friends. He used light wood for the floors and mixed modern and old furniture.

**Bruce Chatwin**

Bruce Chatwin was a writer who loved to travel. His first book, ""In Patagonia,"" was very special. It was a travel book that felt like a story. He sometimes changed facts to make the story better. He believed travel could help us find exciting histories.

**Swimming**

One summer, it rained a lot. I swam in the pool behind my house. The rain made bubbles in the water. I thought about swimming across Britain. I wanted to follow the rain to the sea. Swimming felt free, like walking or cycling. It helped me see the world in a new way."
CPE_67,"Text: 'CRYING Charles Darwin thought that crying had no clear purpose. He was probably wrong. Scientists now say crying is important for social reasons. Psychiatrist John Bowlby said crying helps mothers and children bond. Many people think children cry because they feel helpless. But why do adults cry? It is not easy to explain. The sound of crying is less important than seeing someone cry. Crying might have helped early humans trust each other and feel connected. We can cry for other reasons too. We might cry when we feel sorry for someone. Sometimes, we cry without wanting to, like when we hear beautiful music or speeches. We might cry during a sad movie, especially with other people. Crying seems to have a social purpose, but scientists are still studying it.'"
CPE_27,"**The Heat is On**

Global warming is making the Earth warmer. We know it will change the weather everywhere, but we are not sure how. The weather changes will affect plants, animals, water, and soil. Humans use these natural resources to grow food and build cities. Changes in these resources are important.

In the last 100 years, humans have put more gases into the air. These gases make the Earth warmer. Scientists think this is not natural and is because of human pollution. They use computers to try to predict the future weather. These predictions are not perfect, but they help us understand what might happen.

Scientists think the Earth's temperature will go up by 1°C to 3.5°C by the year 2100. The sea level might rise by 15-95 cm. There might be more heatwaves, floods, and droughts. These changes can affect where plants and animals live and how much food we can grow.

Some changes might be good. For example, in Australia, warmer weather has helped grow more wheat. But many changes might be bad. Less water might be available, especially in dry areas. The Mediterranean region is already seeing less rain in some parts.

Ice in the Arctic might melt completely. This could make it easier to transport goods by sea, but it also increases the danger from icebergs. The biggest change might be the rise in sea levels. This could cause flooding in cities like London, New York, and Tokyo. Many people might lose their homes, and some small islands might disappear completely."
CPE_66,"Text: 'Mission to Mars Wanted: a middle-aged, married couple for a 501-day trip to Mars and back. Applicants must be strong and healthy. This is the plan of millionaire Dennis Tito. He wants to send a capsule to Mars on 5 January 2018. The capsule will go 160 km above Mars. It will use Mars's gravity to come back to Earth without using more fuel. This is important because the next chance to go to Mars is in 2031. New technology is needed for this mission. If everything is ready in time, the spacecraft might go. Even if it does not go, the work will help future missions.'"
CPE_44,"**Art and Experience**

Art is often seen as something separate from everyday life. People think of art as a painting, a building, or a statue. But art is more than just these objects. Art is about what these objects make us feel and think.

Sometimes, famous art pieces are so admired that they become hard to understand. They seem far away from the real world. When this happens, art feels like it is in a special place, not connected to normal life.

To understand art better, we need to connect it back to everyday life. Just like mountains are part of the earth, art is part of our daily experiences. To learn about art, we should look at the simple things around us that we enjoy, like movies, music, and comics. These are also forms of art.

Many people enjoy these everyday arts without realizing they are art. They think art only belongs in museums. But real art is everywhere, in the things we see and hear every day. When we see art as part of our daily life, we can enjoy and understand it more."
CPE_22,"**Observing Lions**

Lions are big cats that hunt together. People often think lions work well as a team. They imagine lions hiding and then jumping out to catch their food. Lions seem to be good at working together. But after watching lions for many years, we learned something different. We started studying lions in 1978. We wanted to know why lions hunt together and take care of their babies together. We thought we would find answers in two or three years. But lions are very good at doing nothing. It took us a long time to learn about them. Lions can live up to 18 years, so we are only now finding answers to our questions."
CPE_39,"**Advertising in the 1990s**

In the early 1990s, people working in advertising had a hard time. The economy was bad, and many people lost their jobs. In Britain, in 1991, the economy went down, interest rates were high, and many people stopped buying things. Over 500,000 people lost their jobs, and 75,000 homes were taken back by banks. Many businesses, like car and building companies, lost a lot of money.

Advertising workers felt a lot of pressure. They had to do more work with less money. Even though it was hard, marketing became more important. Companies started to focus on making products that people wanted. This helped marketing people, but also made their jobs harder.

In the 1980s, advertising was very successful. But in the 1990s, it was difficult. The bad economy made companies think more about how they spent money on advertising. They wanted to know if advertising was really helping them. Many companies wanted better advertising strategies and creativity.

Advertising people had to find ways to do more with less money. The recession made it hard to take risks, which are often needed for good advertising. Other challenges included changes in the population, the power of big stores, and new laws about advertising. Some companies also had to learn how to advertise in other countries.

Because of these challenges, advertising people had to work hard to make sure their ads were effective. There was not much help available for them. Companies and advertising agencies were busy dealing with these problems and did not share their successful strategies. Books and seminars on advertising did not always provide useful information."
CPE_18,"Text: 'The Kitchen Dream When I was at university, I wanted to be a chef. This was not a common choice. Cooking is hard work, with long hours and low pay. But I did not mind. I was not happy at university. The work was difficult, and I did not enjoy the social life. Being a chef seemed better. It felt serious and honest. I first wanted to cook after eating at a famous restaurant in London. The food was amazing. I wanted to learn how to cook like that. I started reading cookbooks and making special meals. Swimming Lessons The swimming teacher was a small, strong man with tattoos. He taught me how to dive. First, I sat on the pool's edge and rolled into the water. Then, I stood and dived from the edge. The teacher was strict. He told me to look up and keep my legs straight. Next, I tried diving from the high board. It was very high, and I was scared. I jumped and felt like I was flying. I did not dive well, but I was happy. I felt free like a bird. The Traveller Some people like to travel in dangerous places. They climb high mountains and sail in big seas. They eat strange food and live in the unknown. These people are different. They live outside our normal world. We like our safe homes and easy lives. Sailing Jonathan Raban is scared of the sea, but he spends a lot of time on it. He is a good sailor. He likes to write about sailing. His boat has a tool that shows his exact place on the sea. He likes this tool but thinks other tools make sailing less special. He believes sailors should watch the sea, not just follow a compass. This is why he has time to look at the waves.'"
CPE_62,"**Holiday Reading**

Summer gives us two big joys: going on holiday and reading books. These joys are connected. Books help us feel at home in the world. We see our own experiences in stories from faraway places or long ago. Authors write about feelings we thought were only ours. They use words we cannot find. We feel thankful to these writers for helping us understand ourselves. Reading and travel help us see new things. When we are in a new place, our eyes are open. A good book can also show us things we did not notice before. We start to see the sky, people's faces, or feelings we did not know we had.

**Author's Note**

These travel stories were in the Observer newspaper over seven years. I made small changes, but not many. I fixed some mistakes. In one story about China, I thought the Hong Kong dollar would stay strong. A year later, it fell. I did not change the story because it was written at that time. Like other travelers, I was there, not knowing what would happen next. This is the story of travel: seeing the world with just a ticket. I believe travelers can see things, even in a postcard.

**Ecotourism**

'Ecotourism' is a popular word in travel. It started in the 1980s when people cared more about the environment. Tourists wanted to travel without harming nature. Now, 'ecotourism' can mean many things, like living with tribes or a short boat trip. It includes culture, nature, and adventure. The idea was good, but without rules, travelers can get confused.

**Transylvanian Journey**

I lost my Transylvania travel notes for 50 years. I found them by luck. They helped me write about that time. In Transylvania, I stayed in nice houses for weeks. I stopped writing because I thought there was nothing to say. When I moved, I wrote notes, not full stories. I worried about the order of events, but then I decided to let the story tell itself."
CPE_49,"**Fashion**

Fashion is not just a new thing. It has been around for a long time. Many people think fashion started in the 1800s and 1900s, but it is older. Historians say fashion began in the 1500s and 1600s when trade and markets grew. As societies grew bigger and more complex, people made more types of clothes. This made the meaning of clothes more complex too. Today, it is hard to say what any piece of clothing really means. For example, a man's suit can mean different things to different people.

**Writer**

Many people think all writers are rich and famous, but this is not true for most. Some writers have other jobs and write in their free time. Others, like me, do different small jobs to make money. I teach, do workshops, and write articles. I have heard of fun jobs, like writing for a chocolate factory, but I have not had one. Still, with part-time jobs and help from friends, I can write my book.

**Sudden Fame**

Our small shows were selling out, and more security was needed because of the many fans. We had to use secret ways to enter places to avoid the crowds. On days off, it was hard to go out without being followed by fans. In just a few days, we became famous. Fans watched us, and our managers took care of us. Even though I was shy, I felt more confident, but it was still hard for me to handle."
CPE_31,"**Music and Technology**

Technology is changing our lives. Susan Hallam talks about how it changes music in Britain. In the late 20th century, people had more ways to listen to music. They used radio, TV, records, tapes, CDs, and videos. But, there were fewer live music shows and jobs for musicians. Music is important for people and events. It helps us in many ways. Music will be in the 21st century, but it might change. People might still want to learn instruments. The music industry makes a lot of money in Britain. Musical skills are important for jobs, especially in media.

Playing music can help people learn other skills. In the USA, research shows music can help with intelligence. In Europe, group music lessons help kids with social skills and focus. Playing an instrument might help with good study habits and being on time.

In the future, music might change in two ways. First, people will listen to many types of music. New music styles will mix different kinds. Second, technology will help people make and play music. This might mean fewer live shows. More people of all ages will want to make music. These activities will be in communities and show their music traditions.

To prepare for the future, music teaching needs to change. More people should learn to play instruments. Music lessons will need to change to stay important. Musicians will need new skills to teach and work with different groups. They will need to inspire and teach people of all ages. They will also need skills for community work. This is different from how things were before. Music education should show its high quality.

Finally, we need to make music more important. Music is a big part of our lives, but we often forget it. People in the music world need to work together to change this."
CPE_58,"**Actors and Their Work**

Sometimes, people make fun of actors. This happens when actors talk too much about their work in interviews. They should be like the dancer Pavlova. When someone asked her what her dance meant, she said, ""If I could tell you, I wouldn't dance it."" But actors often say things that sound silly or are just gossip. 

Paul Scofield, a famous actor, said something important. He wrote in a letter that acting is interesting only when you do it. Talking about it makes it seem empty. Acting has no rules, except maybe being loud enough to hear. With every new play, actors start fresh, learning and growing with the story. When the play ends, they feel empty until the next one.

**A Review of Hamlet**

Adrian Lester plays Hamlet. His acting is simple and strong. He is very good with the words and his body. He plays a young man who is sometimes angry but also funny. His acting is very good, even if it looks easy. 

**A Director's Way of Rehearsing**

This director has a special way to practice plays. The actors look at the script on a screen. They think about the words and what they mean. When it's their turn, they speak the words with feeling. They imagine scenes and find reasons to say their lines. The director says not to plan too much. Just be open and trust that something will happen.

**The Perfect Theatre**

A good theatre makes you feel important. Going to a play is special, and the staff should know that too. The theatre should make a connection between the actors and the audience. Everyone should see and hear well. The theatre should fit the human voice and body. Old theatres often feel right because they have history. You can't please everyone with a play. People want to see something new and surprising."
CPE_37,"Text: 'Paul Simon Rock and roll in the 1950s was music for young people. But it was also important for older people. It changed music forever. It helped new rock stars to start. Paul Simon, like other young people in the US, listened to this new music on the radio. Alan Freed's radio show, Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party, played this music. Many young people listened to it. John Lennon, in Liverpool, also listened to rock and roll on the radio. Paul Simon loved the music from Freed's show. He wanted to make his own music. Snow I could not see a path, but I thought I would be okay if I was careful. The wind was strong and pushed me. I slipped on the ice. Suddenly, the snow under me broke. I fell into a hole about four feet deep. The snow was like a roof over the hole. I climbed out, feeling scared. I thought about what I would do if the hole was deeper. I sat by a pine tree to think. In one hour, I walked about half a mile. I knew I had to change my plan. Qualitative Research There are many books about qualitative research. These books talk about collecting data. But they do not talk much about how to look at the data. Many people do not know how researchers study their data. We asked social scientists to talk about how they study data. We wanted to understand the process better. This is not easy. We let our contributors show their work in different ways, like stories or formal writing.'"
CPE_2,"**Screen Learning**

My six-year-old son was eating noodles in a funny way. He said, ""I'm a little dinosaur,"" because he saw it on TV. I asked him what he learned about dinosaurs, and he didn't remember much. Many people like learning on computers and the internet, but is it the best way? One father tried an interactive program with his son. The father read the words, but the son only looked at the pictures. The father thought his son might learn more from a book. TV can give ideas, but real learning happens when talking with teachers or parents. New technology is good, but schools are still important.

**Hollywood**

By 1918, most movies were made in Hollywood. People in Los Angeles didn't like the movie makers at first. But they accepted them because movies made a lot of money. Hollywood became famous like New York, Rome, or Paris. It changed a lot; it used to have orange trees. People in Hollywood talk about movies, money, and famous people. Many successful people want to work in Hollywood but live somewhere else. Still, many people in show-business go to Hollywood.

**Photography**

Photography started in the 1800s. Artists wanted to keep real images of what they saw. They used light, lenses, and chemicals to make pictures. These pictures were more real and detailed than paintings. Some people said photography was not art because it used machines. But photographers knew it was a new way to show the world. They used cameras like artists use brushes to show nature and people.

**Book Illustration**

In the past, all children's books had pictures. Even books for older kids had pictures, but this changed over time. Many children's books were made cheaply, so some pictures were not very good. But some artists always did their best work. Old black-and-white book pictures are interesting to look at. Some are not good, but some are treasures. People are starting to show these pictures again in books and exhibitions. Maybe publishers will make new books with these old pictures."
CPE_68,"Text: 'Blogging: Sharing with the World

A while ago, a website talked about the dangers of telling everyone where you are online. It said that when you say, ""Hey, I'm here,"" you are also telling everyone, even people you don't know. This made people think that sharing too much online can be bad. The internet lets us share everything about our lives with many people. This can be exciting because we might become famous or rich. So, we share our stories and photos online. But sometimes, we realize too late that it can be dangerous.

In the past, some people started sharing their lives online. They were the first bloggers. They lost jobs, made and lost friends, and became famous before social media existed. These bloggers learned many lessons that we can learn from today.

In 1994, a student named Justin Hall started sharing his life on the internet. He wrote about everything and shared photos. People loved reading about his life. But one day, he had to stop because it caused problems in his personal life. He learned that sharing too much can make people not trust you.

In 2002, Heather Armstrong wrote about her job on her blog. Someone at her work shared her blog with her bosses, and she lost her job. This shows that what we say online can affect our real lives. But Heather's story ended well. She got married, started blogging again about her family, and became successful.

The lesson is: we can say anything online, but we should be careful about what we share.'"
CPE_23,"Text: 'Enough Sleep? Many people today feel tired. In busy countries, people often do not sleep enough. In the USA, 40 million people have sleep problems. In Britain, some books talk about people who cannot sleep. People are interested in sleep and why it is important. A sleep expert says, 'People need more sleep. They wake up early to avoid traffic.' One researcher did an experiment. He let people sleep for 14 hours a night for a month. After three weeks, they slept about eight hours a night. This shows they needed more sleep. In Europe, a university in England studies sleep. They look at how tiredness affects sailors, noise affects sleep, and driving when tired. They ask students to help with the research. Students get paid and change their sleep for the study. Dr. Louise Reyner says some people worry because they put wires on their heads, but they only study physical things. In a dark room, there is a driving simulator. People come at 2pm after little sleep. They drive and answer questions. The road looks endless, and the room is warm. Some people try not to sleep, but they do. Dr. Reyner says coffee can help. Two cups can make you a safe driver for a short time. She also suggests energy drinks and gum. Scientists know some things about sleep. People sleep in cycles, like other animals. There are four stages of sleep. Dreams happen in light sleep. The brain stops the body from moving during dreams. Scientists think sleep helps the body and brain, but they are not sure. Women sleep a bit longer than men, and older people need less sleep. In the past, people slept differently. A professor found that from 1500 to 1850, people had 'first sleep' and 'morning sleep'. They woke up in the night for an hour. This was a quiet time. As light became common, people started sleeping like we do now. The industrial revolution made people work longer, so they slept less. In some places, people still sleep in short times. They wake up at night because of noise or danger. Many people around the world need more sleep.'"
CPE_60,"Text: 'I am talking about big boots. Really big boots. I stood in my expensive cowboy boots on the rocks in the Arizona desert. I wore a cowboy outfit, but I was not a cowboy. I looked at the Arizona mountains and knew I was not at home. I flew from Denver in the morning and thought I might look like a cowboy. But when I saw a real cowboy at the airport, I knew I was not. He wore a dirty shirt and carried a bag. He looked at my new boots and left without a word. 

I used to be a racing driver. I loved driving racing cars. But I don't do it anymore. I thought about what to do next. Maybe I could talk about races on TV? But many other drivers want to do that too. Maybe I could sell old cars? But nobody was buying them. Being an 'ex' racing driver is hard. People don't want to hear about 'almost' winning. Even if I was a champion, people would only listen for a short time. 

I miss driving fast cars. I miss the excitement and the people. I was a little famous. People wanted my autograph. Now, I don't drive anymore. My phone doesn't ring much. I have a lot of free time. 

I looked at the sky. There were no big birds, but small birds were singing. I realized I have a lot to learn.'"
CPE_1,"**Vancouver**

In the last ten years, many people from all over the world have moved to Vancouver, in western Canada. In the evening, people walk on the city streets. If you walk with them, you can hear many different languages. People come to Vancouver because it has a mild climate, beautiful views of the ocean and mountains, and it is clean and safe. There are also good schools and jobs. Some people complain about new buildings, but the new people and tourists have helped the city grow. Vancouver was once called 'Terminal City' because it was a gateway to other places. Now, it is more of a gateway than ever.

**Writing Letters**

Journalists like me are not good at writing letters. Some say it is because we do not get paid for letters, but I do not think that is true. In our work, we try to make a big impact, so writing a simple letter is hard for us. Real artists do not have this problem. They know how to make their words special. When Shakespeare wrote his famous lines, he did not think about why they were good. He just wrote them.

**Supermarket Opening**

In the past, opening a new supermarket in Britain was a big event. A famous person would come to cut the ribbon. Now, new supermarkets open every day, so famous people are not needed. Last week, at a new Superbuy store, people did not care who opened it. They just wanted to be first inside. The first five men got a bottle of aftershave, and the first five women got flowers. People at the front of the line felt happy, and those who came late felt jealous."
CPE_53,"**Citizen Kane**

The movie *Citizen Kane* came out in 1941. At first, it was not a big success in theaters. People were worried because the movie was about a man like William Randolph Hearst, a powerful newspaper owner. But later, television made the movie popular. Many people who make movies today say *Citizen Kane* inspired them. This is surprising because it was Orson Welles's first movie. Welles said he did not know what he could or could not do, so he just did what he wanted. He had a great team, including cameraman Gregg Toland and writer Herman J. Mankiewicz. Welles and Mankiewicz decided to make a movie about a newspaper owner like Hearst. Welles was excited to direct and act in the movie.

**Dermot and Carmel**

Dermot thought Carmel was acting strange that morning. He told her he might be late because he wanted to stop at the golf club. Carmel just nodded and seemed not to listen. Dermot asked her what she would do that day. Carmel said she had nothing to do, so she would walk around town and look at shops. Dermot said she should enjoy herself and not worry about making dinner if he was late. Carmel agreed.

**Title Race**

A study showed that job titles can make people jealous at work. Many workers and bosses say titles cause problems. Some workers even want a better job title more than a pay raise. People do not like being called a lower position. New job titles focus on skills but are often just nicer names."
CPE_55,"Text: 'I was in Vienna to take photos. Photos were very important to me. I loved how light looked on things. One photo could show a whole city or person. I always hoped to take the perfect photo. I used to work for newspapers, but now I work for myself. I was in Vienna because another photographer left the job. I took photos for a book about four cities: London, Paris, Rome, and Vienna. I was happy to go to Vienna. Things at home were not good. I stayed at a hotel in the city. I had been to Vienna before with my wife, but this time was different. I wanted to take great photos. The first day, I rode trams to see the city. I wanted to make Vienna my own. A photo is a moment, and I waited for the right moment. The next morning, I went out early. The snow made the city look beautiful. I wanted to take a photo of the big cathedral, but it was hard to fit it all in one picture. Photography is magical. You can watch a photo appear on paper. Even when you know how it works, it still feels like magic. That morning in Vienna, something special happened.'"
CPE_50,"**Kinetic Art Exhibition**

A new exhibition in London shows kinetic art. Kinetic art is art that moves or shows movement. The exhibition is at the Hayward Gallery. It is not a big, expensive show. It is a simple and interesting look at art from the last 60 years. The exhibition has paintings, drawings, documents, and films. Guy Brett, the curator, has studied kinetic art for a long time. There are no long texts to read. Visitors can enjoy and learn by looking at the art.

**David Hockney**

David Hockney is a popular artist. Many people like his art. His art is easy to understand. It shows fun and relaxing things. Some people like Hockney because he is funny and interesting. Some critics say he is not a great artist. Hockney knows he is not the best. He thinks only time will tell if he is a great artist.

**Window-shopping - an Art Exhibition**

A curator made an art show called ""Window-shopping."" It was in an empty warehouse. Seven artists showed their work. The art pieces were very different. For example, Sam Cole made knitted cats that moved on a toy train track. Matthew Crawley used a video camera to make art. The art did not have a common theme. The curator wanted to show that art can be different and still be interesting.

**Art History**

Some people like to look at paintings but do not want to study them. They think studying art can ruin the fun. Art historians study art and its history. They think knowing more about art can make it more enjoyable. Our likes and dislikes in art can change over time. They are influenced by the society we live in. Enjoying art is important, but learning about it can also be interesting."
CPE_25,"**Metals**

A long time ago, people found metals. They liked shiny things. Maybe they found gold in a river. Gold is soft and easy to shape. People wanted it. They also found copper. Copper is good for making tools. People learned how to get copper from rocks. This was important for them.

**St Ives**

We walked with our bags down a small street. It was very windy and cold. The sea waves were big and hit the road. No one was outside. The houses were closed. We came to St Ives by train. The sky was grey. Visiting Cornwall without a car was not a good idea. I told my friend we would walk by the sea and sit by the fire.

**Computer Modelling**

Studying the past is hard because it is gone. People from long ago are not here. We do not know why they lived in some places. Archaeology gives us some ideas, but we cannot test them. But now, we can use computers. Computers help us make old places and people. We can see how they lived. We can change things like rain or people and see what happens."
CPE_34,"**Vervet Monkeys**

One day, a group of vervet monkeys saw a new male monkey near their trees. The new monkey wanted to join their group. The leader monkey did not want this. He made a smart plan. When the new monkey tried to come closer, the leader monkey made a loud noise. This noise means ""leopard is near!"" The new monkey got scared and ran back to his trees. This happened many times. But then, the leader monkey made a mistake. He made the noise while he was walking calmly. 

**What Cats Catch**

In a village in England, people counted what their cats caught. In one year, 70 cats caught over 1,000 animals. A professor thought that all cats in Britain might catch 100 million birds and small animals each year. But this is not true. Most cats live in towns and catch fewer animals. The important question is: are there still enough birds? The answer is yes. People feed birds in winter, and birds have places to live in gardens. Cats catch many animals, but they do not harm the bird population too much.

**Buffalo's Day**

Buffaloes are very important to marsh people. Every morning, buffaloes leave their sleeping place slowly. They make tired noises and move to the water. They stand at the edge, making noises about the hard day ahead. Finally, the leader buffalo moves into the water. They stay in the water, looking tired. Slowly, they swim away, just their noses above water. They spend the day eating plants in the water.

**Picasso's Painting**

In 1940, Picasso painted fish while he was in a fishing town. The painting shows a fish table with a crab and some fish. The fish look alive. The painting is flat and calm, like underwater. But there is a feeling of a fight coming. The fish show their teeth, and the crab has open claws. The painting has a feeling of danger."
CPE_12,"Photography

For about 150 years, photography has helped us see and remember many parts of life. It lets us see things that are far away or very small. We can see pictures from far places on Earth and even from space. Photography shows us the world and helps us understand life.

Long ago, people made pictures on cave walls. We don't know why they made them, but pictures have always been important to people. When photography was invented in the 1800s, it changed how we see the world. People thought photos showed the truth because they looked like what we see with our eyes.

Photos are like a special language. Some people thought everyone could understand photos, no matter where they are from. But, photos can mean different things to different people, just like words.

Photography has changed a lot since it was invented in 1839. Photos used to help us remember things, but now they also tell us about history. Photos can show us what life was like in the past.

Photography is not just about taking pictures. It can help change the world by showing us new ideas and helping us see things differently."
CPE_26,"**How to Write Poetry**

Writing poetry is not easy. Everyone has their own way. Some people need to feel safe to write a poem. Others write when they are sad. Some people write every day. Others wait for a special idea. All ways are good if you listen to your own voice. 

**The Short Story**

A short story should not have too many characters or long parts. Flashbacks should be short and help the story. Dialogue, or talking between characters, is important. It can show different sides of a story quickly. Every word in a short story is important.

**Screenplays**

Writing a screenplay is like playing chess. At first, you might not know what will happen next. But with practice, you see the whole game. You learn about strategy and patterns. The more you write, the better you understand.

**Looking at Writing**

Speaking is natural for humans, but writing is not. All children learn to speak without lessons. Writing systems were created by a few old societies. Many children find writing hard. Speaking is natural, but writing needs to be learned. We need to understand how writing works and how children learn it."
CPE_8,"Text: 'I have never started a book with more worry. I call it a book because I don't know what else to call it. I have a small story to tell, and I do not end with a death or a marriage. I leave my reader unsure. This book is about my memories of a man I met only sometimes, and I do not know much about what happened to him in between. I could make up things to fill the gaps, but I do not want to do that. I only want to write what I know. To protect people still alive, I have given them new names, and I have made sure no one can recognize them. The man I am writing about is not famous. Maybe he never will be. When he dies, he might leave no trace, like a stone in a river. Then my book, if read, will be read for its own interest. But maybe his way of life and his character will influence others, and people will realize he was special. Then it will be clear who I write about, and those who want to know about his early life may find something useful. I think my book will help people who want to write about my friend. I do not say the conversations are exact. I never wrote down what was said, but I remember well. I have put these talks in my own words, but they show what was said. I have not made up anything, but I have added some talks to make the story lively. I want people to read my book, and I think it is okay to make it interesting. The smart reader will know where I have done this and can ignore it. Another reason I worry about this book is that the people I write about are from another culture. It is hard to know people, and I think you can only really know your own countrymen. People are not just themselves; they are also where they were born, the games they played, the food they ate, the schools they went to, and the poems they read. These things make them who they are, and you can only know them if you have lived them. You can only know if you are them. Because you cannot know people from another country well, it is hard to make them real in a book. I have only written about my own countrymen, and if I have written about others in short stories, it is because you can describe them briefly. You give the reader a general idea and let them imagine the rest. In this book, I do not say my characters are as they see themselves; they are seen through my eyes.'"
CPE_4,"**Poetry Recitals**

Today, there are many different types of poetry. Some poets write poems to be read in books, while others like to read their poems out loud to people. This is called a poetry recital. 

In the past 20 years, poetry recitals have become more popular. People can hear poetry in small towns, schools, and festivals. Some poets write simple poems that are easy to understand when you hear them. These poets like to perform their poems for an audience. 

Other poets write more complex poems. These poems have deep thoughts and feelings. They are best read quietly on a page. When these poets read their work out loud, it might be hard for people to understand everything right away. 

Listening to poetry can be fun and helpful. It is good to hear how poets read their own work. Sometimes, music is played with the poetry to make it more enjoyable. This helps people see that poetry can be fun and not just for experts."
CPE_30,"**Oral History**

Historians are using more oral evidence, but it has problems. When someone talks about the past, it is not always clear or true. The historian and the person talking can change each other's thoughts. The historian chooses who to talk to and what to talk about. Even if the historian just listens, their presence can change how the person remembers and talks about the past. The final story is shaped by both the historian and the person talking. Memories can also be mixed with things from TV or other people. Sometimes, people remember the past as better or worse than it was. Feelings can make a story seem true, but they might come from later events, not the past.

**Animal Science**

There are two main ways to study animals: looking at how their bodies work and looking at their behavior. Physiologists study how nerves and muscles work together. People who study the whole animal look at how animals act and what affects them. There are two types of whole animal scientists: psychologists and ethologists. Psychologists study how animals learn, often in labs with rats and pigeons. Ethologists study how animals act naturally, often in the wild. These two groups are now working together more. Physiologists think their work is very important, but we also need to study animal behavior. Trying to explain a bird building a nest by looking at nerve cells is like trying to read a book with a microscope.

**The Social Sciences**

When students start studying social sciences, they need to learn two things: the content and the methods. They need to know the facts and how to find and organize them. Social sciences are not just common sense. Each social science looks at a different part of social life and uses different methods and ideas. These ideas help social scientists understand more than everyday common sense and make each social science different.

**Classical Architecture**

In Ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was more than just building. The Roman architect Vitruvius said architecture is about order, arrangement, proportion, symmetry, propriety, and distribution. He used some Greek words for these ideas. Utility and function were not part of his definition, but he did talk about the best ways to build for different uses. The focus was on beauty and art. Classical architecture started from simple huts in Greece and Italy. These huts were not artistic but gave basic forms that later became part of classical architecture. A classical temple is like a simple, single-room hut."
CPE_7,"Text: 'Lily and her sister kept her driving a secret from Chen for a while. Lily drove around the area, going over a small bridge with a bump. Chen found out but was amused. 'You can really drive, Lily? Well done!' he said. Mui thought Chen should be upset, but he was happy and planned a trip with Lily. They chose a Monday next month, leaving early and coming back by midday. Lily practiced driving more. Mui bought a road map with a discount, which impressed Chen. Lily felt a bit hurt by Mui's lack of trust in her driving. They soon reached the English Channel. Lily drove well. Even Mui, who was ready to give directions, agreed. Lily passed some slow cars, and Chen clapped. They drove through a seaside town and parked. Lily was unsure about parking rules, so she paid a fee to be safe. She locked the van carefully. Chen joked, 'No one will want that old van.' Lily and Mui were annoyed. Chen took their son, Man Kee, to see the sea. Chen thought about Man Kee's future. He wanted him to have a good education and own many restaurants. The sea made Chen feel thoughtful. He saw a ship with a telescope. He showed it to Man Kee and said it would take them home one day. Lily and Mui joined them. Man Kee didn't want to let go of the telescope. When Lily looked, the ship was gone, and she saw seagulls instead.'"
CPE_43,"Text: 'THE WELL I read that if you look from a deep hole, you can see stars in the day. I asked you to help me try this. You watched as I got into the well bucket. I told you to let me down. The bucket was heavy, and you were not strong enough. You tried to hold the handle but then let go. I fell into the well and hit my head. I saw strange lights, like stars in cartoons. I was scared and then angry at you for letting me fall. You asked if I was okay. I stayed quiet and watched you leave to get help. I climbed out of the well and hid. I saw water drops on the ground from my wet clothes. Mother and Father came with you and Arthur. Mother was very upset. Father looked into the well with a flashlight. I was scared they would find me. I came out of hiding and pretended to be hurt. I told them I found a secret tunnel from the well to the moat. Father asked me to repeat my story. I said the tunnel fell in after me. Father did not believe me. He said, ""Don't be ridiculous, boy,"" and walked away. Arthur looked at me sadly. He knew I was lying and worried about me. I felt bad for lying and knew I was in trouble.'"
CPE_51,"**Moving Day**

Susan is a widow. Her children are grown up. She has to leave her family home. A van is outside. It says ""Removers of Distinction."" Fred is the removal man. He is packing things in boxes. His fingers are big but gentle. His helpers are not so gentle.

Susan's house is nice. It has four floors and looks at a small harbour. She remembers her children growing up there. Robert, her son, is helping. He does not want her to talk about the piano. Francesca, her daughter, is also helping. She is careful with the piano.

Fred says, ""She doesn't look like she's going to cry."" Susan asks, ""Do people cry?"" Fred says, ""Yes, they cry when the house is empty. But they are okay at the new place.""

Susan remembers when they moved in. The piano got stuck on the stairs. Her husband, Peter, fixed the problem. They used a crane to bring the piano in through a window. It cost a lot of money.

Now, Susan is older. The children are busy. She finds it hard to climb stairs. She thinks about the piano. The banister is not straight from before. She should have told the movers. But it is too late.

Fred says, ""It's just the piano to come now."" Susan is nervous. Robert and Francesca watch. The piano comes down the stairs. Fred and his team carry it out. They put it behind the van.

Robert laughs first. Then Susan and Francesca laugh too. They are happy it is over. They walk down the path together, laughing. Susan only cries tears of laughter."
CPE_11,"Text: 'Online Book Reviews for Everyone

The Internet lets everyone share their ideas. Before, only some people could write book reviews. But with Amazon.com, anyone can write a review. On Amazon, you can say what you think about a book and give it up to five stars. This helps other people know if they might like the book.

Amazon is a big online bookstore. Many people write reviews there. Sometimes, people try to trick others with fake reviews. For example, some writers write good reviews for their own books using fake names. One writer, Lev Grossman, did this because he got bad reviews. He wrote good ones to make his book look better. But when he told people about it, Amazon removed his fake reviews.

Authors can also write messages about their books on Amazon. They can say they hope people like their book. But sometimes, people pretend to be famous authors and write fake messages. Amazon checks these messages, especially if the author is famous.

Sometimes, people write bad reviews if they are upset with a book. For example, people in a book about cheerleaders wrote angry reviews because they didn't like how they were shown in the book. Amazon removed these reviews.

Most people write honest reviews. They help others decide if a book is good. Writing reviews is a way for everyone to share their thoughts about books.'"
CPE_14,"**Art in Modern Times**

In the last 200 years, people think artists must be different from others. We like art that is new and surprising. We admire artists whose work was not liked 100 years ago. But today, we sometimes say an artist has gone too far. The media often say this, and we agree. We think art should be new, so we do not see the old ideas in it. We want artists to be special and different from us. In the past, people asked artists to make art for them. Today, artists work alone, and we get upset if they try to be like everyone else.

**Picture This**

I will describe a situation and ask a question. An artist picks a text from an art book. The text talks about different pictures. The artist asks someone to make a canvas and take it to a sign painter. The sign painter writes the text on the canvas in simple black letters. My question is: Is this a painting?

**Underground Encounters**

At the Mercury Gallery, London until 26th June

Artists often stick to one style to be successful. People like to see the same kind of art from them. Some artists, like Picasso and Hockney, change styles and succeed. Eric Rimmington is trying something new. He is known for still life paintings but now paints the London Underground. He likes railways and has made 40 paintings and drawings of the Underground. These show the interesting world below the city.

**Extract from a Novel**

I have come to this island with a few books. The villagers say only a sick person would come here to rebuild. I am here to heal myself. A woman from the village comes to clean the house, but I am alone. I am not happy or sad. I think about memories. Art is not useless. It helps us see the important parts of life. Artists use imagination to find meaning in life. Otherwise, why do we hurt each other?"
CPE_63,"Text: 'Family Business'

""My Dad said, 'Look here, it's no good!' We were in the car going back to London. My father and my brother Maurice had just picked me up from my school. I had won two prizes: one for Latin and one for doing well in exams. My father talked with my headteacher, and now we were going home for the holidays.

'What isn't good?' I asked. I knew he was thinking about something important because he was quiet. He usually talked a lot. 'You will do what you want now,' he said. 'You have many certificates. They say you will get a scholarship to Oxford.'

'So?' I said. 'Isn't that good?'

'I hear you want to be a barrister,' he said. 'A barrister!'

'I just said that,' I replied. 'I didn't know what else to say!'

'They say you have the right personality. You can understand things quickly, you talk well, and you like performing.'

'I don't know about that,' I said. 'I only know what I see on TV.'

'Anyway,' he said, 'I think you won't want to join the family business now. You will go to Oxford, and then you won't want it.'

I felt trapped by family expectations. I wanted to try other things, but I didn't want to upset my father. I wasn't scared of him like Maurice was, but I respected him.

'It's too soon to know,' I said.

'You won't want to join us,' my father said. 'It's a pity because you have the brains and vision.'

'There's still Maurice,' I said.

My father snorted. We both knew Maurice didn't like the business.

'You can help us during holidays until you leave Oxford,' my father said. 'Then you can decide. It will give you pocket money and help me.'

'OK,' I said, happy to avoid making a decision now.

So, I helped during holidays, never more than twice a year. I became a smart student with a little house, a nice car, and designer clothes.

In my last term, my father visited me. He said he needed me for one last important job for the family business. It was the biggest job ever.

'But Dad,' I said, 'I have my final exams soon. I need to focus on them.'

I knew he wouldn't understand. He might think I was betraying him. But I saw how focused and smart he was. He was a genius in his work. I respected that.

'All right,' I said. 'I'll do it.'"""
CPE_56,"Simon Costello knew buying the house in Pembroke Square was a mistake after a year. They couldn't really afford it. At first, it seemed like a good idea. Simon had many successful cases, and Lois got a raise at her job, making thirty-five thousand. Lois wanted to move because their flat was too small for a family. They needed more space, a garden, and a place for an au pair. They could have found this in a cheaper area, but Lois wanted a better address. She thought Mornington Mansions wasn't good enough for them. Lois decided one of them should use public transport to save money. Her job was far, so Simon had to take the crowded tube. He often thought about his grandfather's house in Hampstead, where he felt relaxed and cared for. But times had changed. Lois made it clear her career was as important as his. They needed both salaries for their lifestyle.

Now, their life could be ruined by Venetia. She came to their office angry. Someone upset her. She accused Simon of knowing a client, Brian Cartwright, bribed a jury four years ago. Simon denied it, but he felt guilty. Venetia didn't believe him. He wished he had said Cartwright lied to him after the trial. But he didn't, and now he was in trouble. If people heard about this, even as a rumor, his career could be over."
CPE_36,"Text: I chose this place to live because I thought people here wouldn't care about broken houses and messy gardens. But I was wrong. People in the shops soon start to know you. The roses next door remind me that the gardens were loved once. Usually, I stay inside, but tonight, I am watching birds fly. I cut some plants to make space for a chair, and my arms are scratched. It is a small London garden. My neighbor, Jaz, leans out of the window. She writes books that are not published. I have her latest book. 'How's the work going, Jaz?' I ask. 'In no other job do people ask about your work so much,' she says. 'I'll bring a drink down,' she adds. I don't want Jaz in the garden, but she comes. She sits on a chair and says, 'Cheers. I should've been a teacher. Writers don't have holidays. They say, those who can, do, those who can't, teach.' 'So, what plans for the holidays?' she asks. I feel worried about the school year ending. Empty days. Hot streets. The park with its fountain, and feeling lonely. 'I'm going to Stonebridge tomorrow. Can you feed the cats?' I ask. 'Of course,' Jaz says. 'Where will you stay?' 'With my friend Ruby at the Rising Sun,' I say. It's not true, but I deal with stories all the time. 'What do you think of my book?' Jaz asks. Her book, The Cruelty of Red Vans, is on my desk. I like the title and tell her. I say, 'Try writing about nice people.' 'Teachers!' Jaz says. 'I keep a journal and write something good about each day,' I say. 'Get a life, Ann,' Jaz replies. I have a life. I work, and I go out sometimes. When we go inside, I remember my school teacher, Miss Tarrantine, who said, 'I've had my moments.' We laughed."
CPE_6,"**Heritage**

Heritage is important because it connects people with the past. We often know about our grandparents and their stories. But, we also need to learn about our past to understand our future. Heritage helps us feel part of history. Just like we get our genes from our family, we also get culture from them. Sometimes, there are parts of our heritage we may not like, but it is still ours. Heritage teaches us many things and is important for our well-being. It affects our customs and traditions. In the past, we learned about our heritage through stories from our ancestors. Now, we learn from places and buildings. It is important to keep these places safe to remember our ancestors.

**The Fens**

I wrote a book called ""Waterland"" about a place in England called the Fens. I chose the Fens because they seemed simple and empty, but I found out they are not. The Fens are a special part of England, different from other places. They are both empty and full, wild and cultivated, open and mysterious. I did not visit many places in the Fens while writing my book. I like to imagine places instead of just seeing them. The Fens are not just a place; they are a feeling.

**Museums**

Museums should make their collections easy to see and understand. In the past, museums just put things in cases with long labels. Now, museums should make displays fun and interesting. Museums should also share their collections with many people. For example, they can lend objects to schools or help elderly people with memory problems. Museums show real things from the past, not copies. This makes them different from theme parks or books. Museums that make their displays exciting will help people want to learn more about history.

**Architecture and Environment**

People have always wanted to keep things from the past. But now, towns change quickly, and this affects us. Some people want to keep everything the same, while others think about how towns should look in the future. People who lived through big events like wars want to keep things stable. If people need to keep things the same, planners should think about this. Change is not bad if we know how to manage it. Changes in our towns show changes in our society, like how many people live there and what they need."
CPE_33,"Text: 'Einstein If you ask someone to name a scientist, they will probably say Albert Einstein. His face is used to sell smart things like computers and books. Many people don't know much about what Einstein did, except that he made some theories called 'relativity'. These theories are famous for being hard to understand and having strange ideas. Einstein helped change how we think about science in the 20th century. Scientists were trying to understand the universe better by studying matter and forces. Einstein looked at time, space, matter, and energy in a new way. Before, people thought like Isaac Newton, who said stars and planets moved in a fixed space and time. Einstein said time and space are not fixed but change depending on other things. Young Readers When we were kids, Lydia and I did not like prize-winning books because we thought they were boring. Our mom did not like this, but our dad would give us money to read good books. He also gave us some books as gifts, saying they were not just stories. We thought most of these books were for boys, but we did read some short stories and poems. Language In 1851, Jacob Grimm said the start of human language is a big mystery. Many people have strange ideas about it. In 1928, Charles Caller said early humans made sounds like ""meuh"" when they were scared. Some people thought these sounds became words like ""malaria"" for ""fever"" or ""mors"" for ""death"". Because of these strange ideas, many people did not talk about language origins. But now, it is an important research area. Language probably started in East Africa about 100,000 years ago. It was used mainly for being friendly and in power struggles, not just for sharing information.'"
CPE_20,"Text: 'Writing Reviews Frank Kermode talks about how to write reviews. Reviews are short articles about books, movies, or other things. They are usually in newspapers or magazines. Reviews do not last long. They are only important for a short time, like a day or a week. People often think writing reviews is not a serious job. Some writers do it because they need money or because they cannot work on big projects all the time. But writing reviews is a skill. It is not easy to write a good review. A reviewer must think about who will read the review. Some people read quickly, and others want more details. A reviewer must know a lot about many things and write clearly. Many reviewers also write other things, like books. For example, the American writer John Updike writes reviews when he is not writing novels. He collects his reviews in books. Some people think reviews are not important, but others like to keep them. Frank Kermode is a professor. He writes books and reviews. In English-speaking countries, it is normal for professors to write reviews. This is good for readers because they know the reviewer understands the topic. It is also good for professors because it helps them communicate with people who are not professors. Writing reviews is not the main job for most people. It is something they do along with other work.'"
CPE_40,"Ralph opened the door to his apartment. It was dark and quiet inside. Even after three years, he sometimes felt strange when he came home alone. When he first bought the apartment, he was excited to come home. He wondered what the apartment was like when he was not there. It felt like a safe place for him. He thought he should worry about things like burglars or broken pipes, but the apartment was always there, waiting for him. Sometimes it was tidy, sometimes not.

Ralph started to see the apartment as part of himself. He wanted it to change, but it stayed the same. Sometimes there were letters by the door or messages on the answering machine. He was glad nothing was broken or stolen. From his boring office, Ralph looked forward to being home alone. But when he got home, he felt empty and lonely. He thought his job was changing him, making him forget who he was.

At night, he read or listened to music, but he wondered why he did these things. He felt lost and confused. He remembered a time when he felt stronger and thought he could have done something different with his life. After university, he wanted to make a plan for himself, but he just wanted to survive. He applied for jobs his friends talked about and followed their paths. He went to one job interview for a local newspaper. He was happy to have a nice talk with Neil, his boss. Neil gave him the job because he was the only graduate who applied. Ralph thought this was a compliment."
CPE_45,"**Goat Racing**

I was going to see goat racing. It was Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. There were many people, ice-cream vans, food stalls, and loud music. Everyone was moving to the racecourse. I pushed through the crowd to find a good spot. A place was marked for the race. It was not like big racecourses, but people stood on both sides to watch. Some people tried to keep the goats in order. It was hard because goats like to eat everything.

**Canoe Trip**

As it got dark, I was scared about the night. The canoe was too wet to sleep in. We did not see any villages or huts all day. In the moonlight, we used a torch to see the cliffs. The torch batteries were low, so we put in new ones, but they did not work. We could not find a place to camp. Later, Lesley saw a light, and we were happy. But it was just moonlight on the water. We heard loud water, but we could not see it. We kept moving.

**How to be Good at Presentations**

I am not good at making presentations. But as a managing director, I have to present to my colleagues and shareholders. How can I get better and more confident? You are not alone. Presenting is different from running a company. To convince others, you must believe in what you say. Show your passion and enthusiasm. Do your homework. Test your ideas before. Ask colleagues about hard questions the audience might ask. Start with something everyone agrees on and build to your conclusion."
CPE_64,"Text: 'Some things take time. You can hurry to a meeting, but you cannot hurry everything. If you add oil too fast to mayonnaise, it will not work. If you pull hard on a tangled fishing line, the knot gets tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some things we can do fast, like solving puzzles. But some things need time, like making mayonnaise. If we rush, they do not work well. We think and learn in different ways. Sometimes we need to think fast, like when we are in danger. Other times, we need to think slowly, like when we are solving a big problem. Fast thinking is like our 'wits'. Slow thinking is like being creative or wise. We need both fast and slow thinking. Slow thinking helps with difficult problems. Scientists are learning more about slow thinking. It helps us understand complex things. It is important to give our mind time to think slowly.'"
CPE_29,"**Living in a New Place**

I am living in a new place. People are very nice to me. It is a small camp with many things we need. The camp is far away from other places. There are about forty people here. They are scientists, students, and other workers. Everyone helps each other. I can speak a little French, but not very well. I cannot make jokes or talk a lot. I miss some words, and my book of phrases does not help at breakfast. This is not a big problem, but at first, I felt shy. I was scared to eat with others. I did not know where to sit. I was nervous when people were quiet after I talked. I felt like I was back in school. I still smile a lot or get nervous when people talk to me. I think I feel sad sometimes because I cannot talk as much as I want. I like to talk a lot, but here I cannot.

**Meeting Elliot**

When I first met Elliot, I was a new writer. He did not notice me. But he always remembered people. When we met again, he was friendly but did not want to be friends. If I saw him at a show, he was with important people and did not see me. But then I became a successful writer. Elliot started to like me more. One day, he asked me to have lunch with him. I thought he wanted to know me better. After that, I saw him more often because I had many new friends.

**Alfred Hitchcock**

Alfred Hitchcock was a movie director. He said he did not care about the story or acting in his movies. He cared about the pictures and sounds. He thought movies should make people feel something, no matter where they are from. If a movie is made well, people from Japan and India will feel scared at the same time. Hitchcock was very smart and knew what he wanted. He liked to make people feel scared. He did not like to guess or think too much about his movie characters. He wanted to make movies that were just movies, with the best pictures and sounds to make people feel something."
CPE_57,"**Amateur Astronomy**

Astronomy has changed a lot in the last 50 years. 30 years ago, there were not many charts or books about astronomy. Telescopes were not very good. Now, you can buy many different telescopes and equipment. Computers help make charts and study stars. This is a great time for amateur astronomers. But, some things are not as good. You might need to travel far to see a clear sky. Airplanes make trails in the sky that can turn into clouds. This makes it hard to see the sun and stars.

**Too Much Choice**

Today, there are too many choices. There are many new products and services. Technology makes things change fast. This can be stressful and confusing. People want simple things in a complex world. But, it is hard to live simply when there are so many options. There are many types of soap and cereal, and many phone plans. It is hard to keep track of everything.

**McAndrews Hotel**

Every summer, we stay for two weeks at McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. It is a family tradition started by my grandmother. The hotel is special to us. The people who stay there are old-fashioned. We like good manners and privacy. We know each other's names but only say hello. It is hard to find this respect in hotels today."
CPE_9,"**Othello**

A special show of Shakespeare's play ""Othello"" moved from Stratford to London. I want to say sorry for a bad review I wrote when the show started last spring. I said Ray Fearon was too young to play Othello and I was wrong about his acting. I still think Othello should be older than Desdemona, but Mr. Fearon's acting is great. The whole cast is great. Some scenes are very memorable. One scene shows Cassio playing games with other young officers, and it gets out of control. Another scene shows Iago losing control and trying to calm down. The scene where Emilia helps Desdemona get ready for bed is very sad. The show is exciting and full of tension. Don't miss it!

**Lake Vostok**

In the middle of Antarctica, there is a big lake called Lake Vostok. It is under almost 4 kilometers of ice. The water in the lake has not seen air or sunlight for up to 25 million years. Scientists are very excited to study the lake and find out what lives there. They have been planning for two years to explore the lake. In the next few years, we will learn a lot about Lake Vostok.

**Scientists**

There was something interesting on the radio last week. Some scientists are talking about why they want to be scientists. They want to know why we want to learn about things like atoms and black holes. They think it is more important to know if what scientists do is right. Science is a tool, and we should decide how to use it."
CPE_42,"**Food**

Food is important and makes us happy. Many people like cooking. You don't need a special day or a fancy dish to cook. You can make a tasty soup with carrots, a leek, celery, and herbs in water. This is better than buying soup in a packet or can. You can also make a nice chocolate dessert in five minutes. Cooking shows care and love. We eat together at parties like birthdays and weddings. We don't eat takeaway food at weddings!

**In the Elevator**

Alistair tried to clean his office, but it was still messy. Papers were everywhere. He had many books and journals. He was going to meet Mallory. She was always on time and liked things neat. Alistair wondered what she would think of the mess. Mrs. Wilson, the cleaning lady, came to clean his apartment, but not his office. She thought Alistair was from a different place.

**Karen**

Karen wanted to be different from her mother. When she was twelve, her brother hit her eye with a golf club. She thought she was blind, but she was okay. The doctor said she was lucky. Karen felt she was saved for a reason.

**Miss Fogerty**

Miss Fogerty was walking on the grass. She was happy and sad. She learned something new in her small village. Dr. Bailey, her doctor, was not well. He was kind and listened to his patients. Miss Fogerty liked him very much. The village loved Dr. Bailey because he cared for everyone."
CPE_59,"**Joanna's Lessons**

Joanna MacGregor is a busy concert pianist. She also writes books for children learning the piano. Joanna is very good at playing the piano. She plays many types of music like classical, jazz, and blues. At a concert for kids, a boy asked her to play ""Match of the Day."" Joanna played it and made the boy happy.

Joanna cares about how children learn the piano. She wrote a book called ""Joanna MacGregor's Piano World"" for young learners. She is very busy with concerts and other projects, but she still wrote the book. Joanna thinks the first piano lessons are very important. She wants music to be fun and for everyone to enjoy.

When Joanna was young, her mother taught piano to many children. Joanna learned that music is for everyone, not just for very talented people. She believes everyone should try to learn the piano, just like learning to swim or speak a little French.

Some children learn piano quickly, but others take more time. Joanna is interested in helping all children enjoy music. She thinks some children stop learning because they feel too much pressure to be perfect.

Joanna's book is colorful and fun. It has a story and CDs with music. She wants learning to be fun. She says children should play all over the keyboard and use the pedals. As children learn more, they need to practice reading music. Joanna thinks practice is very important. She practices a lot every day. She says practice is more important than performing.

Joanna has tips for practice: know what you want to do, play the whole piece even with mistakes, and mix hard and easy pieces."
CPE_54,"**Writing by Hand and on Screen**

Dr. Johnson said, ""Easy writing is not fun to read."" Good writing is hard. When I look at my old school essays, I see few mistakes. Today, I would rewrite them many times. Writing by hand was hard, so I wrote carefully. Computers make writing easy, but also sloppy. Writers spend a lot of time fixing computer drafts. Emails are not like handwritten letters. They are less personal. Many people write love emails now. This is good, but emails can be too strong and lose meaning. Handwriting has more care and character.

**The CD**

I looked at the CD. It was shiny. Mr. Warriston said, ""They are amazing, right?"" I agreed. He put the CD in the machine. ""Some say they sound bad, but I like them,"" he said. I asked, ""Do you turn them over like records?"" He said, ""No, you play one side."" He thought and said, ""Good question. You could have two sides."" He smiled and said, ""Let's find the best place to listen.""

**Books versus Electronic Text**

Malcolm Bradbury said if matches came after lighters, we would think they are better. People say electronic text is like the invention of printing. But changes take time. In 1979, a book said books would disappear in the 1980s. This was wrong. Reading on a screen is hard, so people don't do it much. Computers make people read in small parts. But many books, like religious texts and dictionaries, are not read from start to finish. Computers don't help with reading everything.

**The Office**

Charles walked into a tidy office. The carpet was clean, and the desk was nice. Kathleen was organizing files. She said, ""You need computers, Charles. This is too much."" Charles liked the room but did not want computers. They talked about this many times. Kathleen was good with computers and helped Charles write a paper about them. She could make software do anything."
CPE_32,"Text: ""You don't take sugar, do you?"" shouted his secretary. She was not really asking because she had been making Lancelot coffee for many months. She sometimes forgot because he was not supposed to be there. But now he was there all the time. He found that staying away caused problems. Lancelot thought about how he went from being an important advisor to someone always trying to fix problems. He had no place to park when he arrived at work. ""This came,"" she yelled, waving a folder. ""From that man in Los Angeles. You said you wanted to see it."" The label said: ""A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert."" It also said ""An Expanded Synopsis."" Lancelot did not want to see the word ""synopsis."" He wanted to see ""A First Draft."" Lancelot had already seen a synopsis of this book and did not want to see another one. Ian Cuthbert got a lot of money in advance for this book when Lancelot bought the company. Ian was an old friend, but he was not easy to work with. Lancelot read the synopsis. It was not new. He closed the folder. Ian's manuscript was not coming soon. The synopsis was not brilliant. Lancelot remembered a famous author who was paid for each chapter. But Ian got a big advance. Lancelot studied modern languages at Oxford. He remembered when Ian was a big talent at Cambridge. Ian's friends took over British theatre quickly. Ian was very talented but did not use his talent. He was hard to work with. He was supposed to edit a big arts magazine, but it never came out. He had a contract with a fashion magazine but did not produce much. At meetings, Ian was clever but critical. Ten years later, he was unreliable. Lancelot thought ""A World History of the Short"" was a mistake from the start."
CPE_65,"Text: 'Breakfast in England

Breakfast is important for health, say experts. But in history, breakfast is new in England. In medieval times, people did not often talk about breakfast. Some travelers ate early before long trips, and sick people ate breakfast for health. But most people did not eat breakfast unless they were kings or nobles. 

In the 1500s, breakfast became normal for everyone. Some say this is because there was more food. But there were also big social changes. People started working set hours, often very early. So, eating in the morning became necessary, not just for rich people.'"
CPE_61,"**Photography**

When a photographer takes a picture, they choose what to show. This choice depends on their skills, ideas, and culture. In this book, we will see how these things change the style and meaning of a photo. We will also see how people look at and feel about photos. For example, when someone reads a newspaper, they see photos. But we can ask if the photo shows the real scene or the photographer's view. Is the moment in the photo important, or is the photo a symbol of something in the world?

**More than a Game**

For me, sport is more than just playing. The best people in sport believe in themselves. You need to focus if you want to be the best. Sport is hard, and you have to do it yourself. Sport teaches discipline and working with a team. My sport lets you be good alone, but it is also a team game. Like in life, you can do well alone, but remember others are there too. Sport has given me a lot, not just money. It has shown me new things and places. But you also have to give up a lot for these good things.

**Tuning In**

Some memories stay clear in our minds. For me, one special time was in California many years ago. I was awake, listening to a bird singing in a tree. I don't have trouble sleeping, but the bird's song was beautiful. The bird's music reminded me of jazz and Indian music. It felt like the bird was making up the song as it went. I listened and enjoyed the music until I fell asleep."
CPE_52,"Text: People have always talked about birds. What does this say about us? Paul Evans writes about a wren, a small bird, hitting the glass of a greenhouse. Is it a message or just a bird stuck? It could be both. Wrens have been part of British culture for a long time. In the past, people watched wrens to see if they would have good or bad luck. Today, we still see wrens in pictures and decorations in homes. Even if old beliefs are forgotten, we still like wrens. A forest without wrens feels empty. This is because birds are important in stories and culture. Our view of birds can change over time. For example, red kites were once common in London and seen as helpful. Later, they were seen as pests and almost disappeared, except in Wales. Now, they are protected and are a symbol of nature conservation. Our connection with birds is very old. Early humans watched birds to know about danger, weather, and food. Birds also connect us to dreams. We like birds because they can fly and sing. They show us freedom. Some people think these feelings are old and not needed now, but they are still part of us. Birds show us how the environment is changing. In Britain, 30 bird species are in danger. This is sad because we lose not only birds but also culture. Birds like the skylark and turtle dove are in poems and stories. Losing them is losing part of our culture. Stories and legends about birds are important. They help us feel connected to birds. Watching birds is exciting and not just about science. Birds are special, and the stories we tell help us understand them. The wren in the greenhouse makes us think about the past and the future."
CPE_28,"**Maps**

A map shows where things are on Earth. It uses distance and direction. Long ago, people used time to say how far things were, like ""a day's walk"" or ""a day's boat trip."" This told more about how easy it was to travel than the real distance. 

Direction was not very important for travelers. They wanted to know, ""Where do I go?"" and ""How far is it?"" So, written directions were used instead of maps for a long time. Even today, some maps, like train maps, do not show true directions.

Early maps used signs to show important places. These signs were different in size to show how important they were. The way maps were made changed depending on their purpose and where they were made. To understand old maps, we need to know the signs they used.

Making maps better has been about showing distance and direction more accurately. Science helped map-making. For example, the magnetic compass helped find direction. New tools helped measure angles better. Learning about the world and the shape of the Earth also helped make better maps.

Maps became important for more people, like soldiers and scientists. Soldiers needed maps to show land features for battles. Scientists needed maps for studying history, geography, and more. Today, maps show many things, like weather and land use.

Map-making has changed a lot over time. Sometimes it moved forward, sometimes it did not. Old ideas stayed with new ones. Map-makers needed better tools to use new ideas. Old maps were often copied, so new ideas took time to be used. 

Maps are important for learning about the past. They show how people thought and worked. This makes studying old maps interesting and helpful."
CPE_35,"Text: 'TIM RICE I went into a young man's nice room. The rest of the house was messy. The room had many records and a stereo player. The young man was Andrew Lloyd Webber. He was going to study history at Oxford, but he had nine months free. He wanted to be a famous composer like Richard Rodgers. I wanted to be a pop star for women, money, and fame. Andrew wanted me to write lyrics like Oscar Hammerstein. He played me some of his music, and I liked it. We decided to work together. I was still interested in pop music, but I thought Andrew was very talented. I was training to be a lawyer, but I wanted to try writing with Andrew. Andrew had an idea for a musical about Dr. Thomas Barnardo, who helped orphans. I wasn't sure about the idea, but Andrew's music was good. I started writing lyrics for the musical. I missed a day at the office to write. I didn't know it then, but I had changed my career.'"
CPE_5,"**Language**

People can talk to each other. Language is very important for humans. It is hard to think about life without language. If you see two or more people, they will probably talk. When people are alone, they talk to themselves, their pets, or even plants. Language is like an 'instinct'. This means people know how to talk like spiders know how to make webs. Spiders did not learn to make webs from school or special training.

**Climate and Weather**

Climate and weather are made by the air around us. They affect where animals and plants live. Climate can change how places look. For example, warm and wet places have many plants and animals, like in tropical jungles. Cold and windy places have fewer living things. Weather changes every day and makes the climate. Air moves because the earth spins and because of the sun.

**Coffee**

I worked in a restaurant and had to make coffee. In Melbourne, a restaurant's coffee is very important. I learned a lot about making coffee and using the espresso machine. Making a good cup of coffee is not easy. I thought I would have to do other jobs, like cleaning ash-trays. But my boss was patient. He said, ""Making coffee is both an art and a science,"" and it takes time to learn."
CPE_41,"**Art on TV**

Why does TV often fail with art shows? Painting and sculpture are good for the camera. The camera can show a whole artwork and then zoom in on details. But few TV shows make art interesting and fun to watch. One example is Robert Hughes's show, ""American Visions."" Hughes is a good critic. He has a strong personality and talks about American art. I thought the show would focus on great art. Instead, it talks about American history and culture in art and buildings.

**Dealing in Metals**

I worked as a metals dealer for 20 years. I took risks and made money. Metals are not controlled like other markets. With luck and knowledge, you can earn a lot. Risk is normal in this business. But now, more minerals are taken, and raw material costs are going down. Prices of most metals are half of what they were 20 years ago. I was asked to check claims against a big company using cheap materials.

**Extract from a Holiday Brochure**

Abaco and its small islands are part of the Bahamas. There are 700 islands from Florida to Cuba. Each island is different and special. To travel in Abaco, you need a boat. If your room does not include a boat, don't worry. There are many ferries and water-taxis. You can also rent a boat. Sailing is very popular here. Abaco is called ""The Sailing Capital of the World."" The waters are great for fishing, diving, snorkeling, and swimming. The islands have beaches that stretch for 200 miles. At night, the lights of restaurants and cafes in Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay shine brightly."
CPE_69,"Text: 'Make Your Own Bamboo Bike in the UK

At the Bamboo Bike Club, you can build your own bike. Engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan run this club. You get a custom bike frame and a fun weekend of building. 

It's Saturday morning in Hackney Wick, east London. The Bamboo Bike Club is busy. You can hear machines working. This is the only place in the UK where you can build a bamboo bike. 

Bamboo bikes are becoming popular. Companies like Calfee Design in California and Bamboo Bikes in Yorkshire make them. But they are expensive. A ready-made bamboo frame costs a lot of money. 

James and Ian wanted to make bamboo bikes cheaper. They worked in a shed in Wales for years. They wanted to sell frames, but then they had a new idea. They wanted to share the fun of making a bike. 

The Bamboo Bike Club is more like a community. James and Ian have other jobs too. James makes wind turbines, and Ian is a civil engineer. They run monthly courses. You get a custom bike frame and a fun weekend for a good price. 

On the first day, you learn how to choose strong bamboo and make strong joints. You glue the tubes together. You use alloy tubes for parts that need to be very strong, like the handlebars. 

James and Ian help you with every step. They make sure everything is right. If you make a mistake, you can try again. Bamboo is good for this because you can use another piece. 

On Sunday, you wrap the joints with hemp and glue them. This makes the bike strong. You add a coating to make it waterproof. Then, you can add wheels, brakes, and other parts. 

The bike is strong and good for long rides. Ian rides his bike to work every day. James tested his bike off-road for three months. 

Bamboo bikes look different from metal bikes. They have a unique style. James and Ian say this is the point. 

Bamboo bikes are light and smooth to ride. They are fun and easy to ride. The price is less than £500.'"
CPE_38,"**Self-help Books**

Dione Reverend was an editor at Random House in New York. She found a book by Dr. John Gray, a pop psychologist. She thought it would be a bestseller, and she was right. Dr. Gray is now very rich, and Dione Reverend has her own company. Dr. Gray's book helps people talk better with each other. Many people in America like self-help books. These books are very popular and help the publishing business in New York. In Britain, many self-help books are also sold. But not all books are good. Many are not published because they are too similar to others. Editors look for books that can sell well. Dione Reverend says a good title is very important.

**Autobiographies**

An autobiography is a book about a person's life, written by that person. The writer should tell the truth, but sometimes they do not. They might leave out things that are too personal or not important. Some writers think they can show the truth better by making up stories. They might call their book an autobiography to make readers believe it is true, even if it is not. This is not always done to trick people.

**Dashiell Hammett's Detective Stories**

Detective stories became popular in the late 1800s and early 1900s. These stories show the problems in society. A crime in the story shows human desires like greed. Solving the crime helps society work well again. In Hammett's stories, society is not perfect. The detective and the criminal are similar. The detective understands the criminal. He is both a good guy and a bit of a bad guy. This makes his job complicated.

**Science Writing**

Stephen Jay Gould is a famous science writer. He says that to write well about science, you need to understand the culture of science. Only scientists can explain science well. Gould believes you should not make things too simple for readers. You can use simple words, but the ideas should stay the same. If readers feel you are talking down to them, they will not like your writing."
CPE_17,"**Air-conditioning**

At Cannons Gym in London, it is very cold inside. The gym uses a lot of air-conditioning because it is very hot outside this summer. Sometimes, the gym feels as cold as the Arctic. Many places use too much air-conditioning. Instead, they could use other ways to stay cool. For example, they could use natural light and air, and have thicker walls to keep the heat out. These ideas can help reduce the need for air-conditioning.

**Sundials**

Sundials are tools that tell time by the sun. A long time ago, people used sundials to keep their clocks on time. But then, clocks and watches got better, and sundials became just garden decorations. Now, people are interested in sundials again. David Harber, who makes sundials, says they are special because they connect us to the planets. When a sundial starts working, it feels magical. Sundials are calm and remind us of our place in the universe.

**Paint Your Own China**

I once saw older women painting china cups with flowers. They were very good at it, and their hands were steady. I thought only very talented people could do this. But when I went to a china-painting class, it was different. The people there just wanted to have fun. Even the teacher did not want to paint quickly like a machine. Everyone was there to enjoy painting."
CPE_47,"Text: Uncle chose a holiday for Keith and Dawne. It was a flight from Gatwick Airport and twelve nights in Venice at the Pensione Concordia. When they booked the trip, the travel agent said they would be with a school group learning Italian. But something went wrong. Keith and Dawne ended up in a hotel called the Edelweiss in Switzerland. At Gatwick, they gave their tickets to a girl in a yellow-and-red uniform. She checked their tickets and said everything was fine. On the plane, they heard people speaking with North of England accents. Keith thought maybe the Italian class was on another plane. When they arrived, a woman said, ""The coach will take us on."" But the coach stopped at a hotel. Keith thought it was just an overnight stop. They were tired and didn't ask questions. The next morning, they realized they were staying there for the whole holiday. Keith told the receptionist there was a mistake. They were supposed to be in Venice. The receptionist said they were booked for twelve nights in Switzerland. Dawne described the travel agent who booked their trip. A woman named Mrs. Franks, who they saw at Gatwick, said there are many holidays with similar tickets. She laughed and said they couldn't end up in a wildlife park. Keith insisted they were not meant to be in Switzerland. Mrs. Franks left them standing there. An old man named Nottage talked to them. He and his wife had a good night's sleep. Keith and Dawne walked outside. They didn't say it, but they knew it was ironic. They wanted a holiday away from elderly people, but ended up on a tour with them."
CPE_48,"Text: 'HE WAS A PEOPLE PERSON American business leaders are learning from the explorer Ernest Shackleton. Most people in Britain know who Shackleton was. In America, he is becoming popular now. Books and movies about his life are being made. The American Museum of Natural History is having a big exhibition about him. Some American managers see Shackleton as a role model. They admire his leadership and communication skills. Jim MacGregor, a manager in New York, thinks Shackleton is a good example for handling business problems. Shackleton was a strong leader. He made tough decisions, like turning back from the South Pole to save his team. His ship, the Endurance, got stuck in ice and sank, but he kept his team safe. Shackleton planned well, listened to his team, and was flexible. He believed in being optimistic and patient. He showed care for his team, like giving his gloves to a team member. People today admire Shackleton for his bravery and leadership.'"
CAE_15,"Text: 'Finding Food in Madagascar In the forests of Madagascar, there is a special animal called the aye-aye. It lives like a woodpecker. Both the woodpecker and the aye-aye look for insects in wood. The woodpecker uses its beak and long tongue. The aye-aye uses its teeth and a long, thin finger. Scientists have studied how the aye-aye finds insects. Dr. Carl Erickson from Duke University studied some aye-ayes named Nosferatu, Poe, Samantha, and Annabelle. He gave them logs with holes. Some holes had food, and some did not. The aye-ayes found the food without seeing or smelling it. Dr. Erickson thinks the aye-aye taps the wood with its finger and listens with its big ears. It can hear if there is a space inside the wood. The aye-aye is like a woodpecker and also like a bat because it uses sound to find food. It is also like a squirrel because its teeth grow all the time. The aye-aye can open nuts with its teeth and finger to eat the inside.'"
CAE_19,"Text: 'Ordinary people, ordinary lives Many of us have photos of our grandparents, but do we know what their lives were like? We often want to write things down about our lives, but we don't do it. Hannah Renier has an idea: she writes books about other people's lives. These books are not about famous people, but about ordinary people. Hannah started this because she talked to her family and saw that many stories were disappearing. People like to tell their stories. They do it for their children and for the future. One man, 62 years old, shared his life story. He talked about his divorce and other things that were hard for him. He wants his family to learn from his life, but he hasn't let his children read it yet. He thinks they can read it after he is gone. Hannah sees that many people repeat patterns from their childhood. They marry people their parents like or do the opposite. People still have problems from their youth even when they are older. Hannah listens to people and writes their stories. She doesn't judge them. People can choose what to keep in the book. It's not about showing off. It's about remembering the past. Each book takes about 30 hours of interviews. The book is special and costs about £3,000. Hannah gets about 10 inquiries a week, but the cost is high for many people. She thought more people would want this, but mostly people with money are interested.'"

CAE_46,"**Title: Flying Without Gravity**

Tom Mumford, a journalist, joined students on a special flight to test ideas in weightlessness. The plane looked normal from the outside. It was a Boeing KC-135, made in 1964. Inside, it was different. It was like a long white tunnel with lights on the walls. Most seats were gone, except a few at the back. Thirteen students from Europe and America sat there. They had worked hard for a year to be on this flight. The European Space Agency asked students to think of fun experiments to do without gravity. The best ideas got a spot on this flight.

The plane flew like a big bird going up and down. At the top of each curve, the plane and everything inside became weightless for a few seconds. The students felt like they were closer to the moon than Earth. The plane took off smoothly, but soon it climbed steeply. The engines were loud, and we felt strange. Then, the engines stopped, and we floated. It was like dancing in silence. We couldn't tell which way was up or down.

After a few seconds, gravity came back, and we landed on the floor. Some students felt sick, but they had 30 curves to do their experiments. Dutch students studied a robotic cat to see how cats land on their feet. A German team looked at how metal joins work without gravity. Students from Utah State University tried to make solar sails from thin films. They hope these sails can use the sun's light like a yacht uses the wind.

After two hours, we felt dizzy, but mostly excited. One student said, ""It was unforgettable. I want to be an astronaut even more now."""
CAE_3,"Text: 'With the trees, I planted my stake in New Zealand JONATHON PORRITT TALKS TO DANNY DANZIGER Jonathon Porritt is the author of Seeing Green - The Politics of Ecology'. I had a time in my life when I didn't have any summers. I went to New Zealand every summer here, which is winter in New Zealand, so I had nine winters in a row. I like winter. My parents had an idea to buy a small piece of land for my brother, sister, and me to take care of. My mother said, 'If you plant trees, you can have it.' This way, we would always have a connection to New Zealand. My father grew up there. They found land 20 miles north of Auckland in a place called Rangitoupuni. The land was not very good, but it was okay for planting trees. I like land and was excited about planting trees. I worked in Australia on farms before, so I liked the idea. I started planting in 1968, and by 1972, we planted all 70 acres. In 1968, it rained a lot in New Zealand. It was a happy time, even though it rained almost every day. I was very wet and cold. Every morning, I got ready to plant more trees. I had a helper who knew how to plant trees, which was good because I was new to it. You carry a bag with trees around your neck. When the bag is full, it is heavy, but it gets easier as it gets lighter. The hardest part was making straight lines. You decide how far apart to plant the trees, then use poles to make straight lines. Once in line, you plant all the way down, turn around, and come back. I like hard work, and it made me fit. After a while, you get used to planting and find a rhythm. You dig a hole, put the tree in, stamp it down, and move on. While working, I thought a lot about life and nature. I have been back to New Zealand four times to see the trees grow. It makes me happy to see them. I worry when I read about bad weather in New Zealand. But the trees are now 20 years old and doing well. In 1984, I took time off from teaching and went back alone for three months. I wrote my first book, Seeing Green, there. There is a small cabin on the land with just a bed, table, and chair. I wrote in the mornings, pruned trees in the afternoons, and did research in the evenings. I feel a strong connection to that place. It is where I feel most connected to the earth."
CAE_10,"Text: 'CARING FOR BADGERS' ""What now?"" I thought when a helper gave me a cardboard box. My husband Derek and I have an open farm in Somerset. We help orphaned animals. The noise from the box was strange. I looked inside and saw three small grey badger cubs. They were about eight inches long. Their fur was soft, and they had black-and-white striped heads. Most badger cubs are born between January and March. They live underground and can die if orphaned. These cubs were found by builders. They accidentally broke into the badger home. The mother was dead, and the cubs were cold and hungry. I cleaned them and put them by the stove for warmth. There were two females, Primrose and Bluebell, and a male, Willow. I fed them with a syringe and wiped them with a warm cloth to help them go to the toilet. For the first days, they ate every four hours. Soon, they drank from a bottle and moved around. They seemed happy. But after three weeks, Willow was sick. He died from a lung infection. I was sad but continued to care for the others. Then, a farmer brought another male cub. We named him Willow II. He was hard to feed but eventually learned. By April, the females ate creamed rice and other foods. Willow II was messy with his food. He liked sausages and then tried other foods. At five months, they ate cereals, meat, vegetables, fruit, nuts, cheese, eggs, and seeds. Badgers usually eat earthworms, beetles, bugs, and small animals. By August, the cubs were active at night. We walked with them in the orchard. They played and chased each other. Sometimes they nipped us playfully. Other badgers came to our field looking for food. We protected our cubs with metal sheets. The local press took pictures of us with the badgers. We started a project to build a home for them. We made a sett with tunnels and a gate. It had three rooms, one with a glass side to see inside. The badgers explored it and moved in. A bus company helped with costs, and local firms gave materials. Everyone wanted the badgers to have a home. One evening, they moved in. Now, I don't walk with them as much. They wake up late. Primrose joined another group, but Bluebell and Willow II still visit. This is their home now."
CAE_67,"Text: 'Looking for True North - and the Man Behind Halley's Comet Dr. Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, wants to follow Sir Edmund Halley's journey to study compass changes. Anjana Ahuja writes. Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) is famous for the comet named after him. But he also did important work on compass changes, called 'declination'. Declination is the angle between magnetic north and true north. Without knowing this, sailors could not use their compasses correctly to find their way at sea. Halley was one of the few people paid to do scientific research at that time. He sailed to the Cape Verde Islands to study declination in the Atlantic Ocean. The first trip stopped early because of problems with the crew, but Halley tried again. This time, he traveled to Rio de Janeiro, South Georgia, Newfoundland, and back to England. In 1701, Halley published a map showing compass changes in the oceans. This map helped sailors for over 100 years until changes in Earth's magnetic field made it less accurate. Dr. Clark, who likes sailing, wants to celebrate Halley's work by following his route. He needs to raise £70,000 for the trip. Sir Vivian Fuchs, who led a big expedition in Antarctica, is helping him. Dr. Clark became interested in Halley while working in Antarctica, where he read about him. 'Halley had an amazing life,' says Dr. Clark. 'He was a scientist and explorer. He helped Sir Isaac Newton with his famous book, Principia Mathematica.' Dr. Clark's trip, called 'In the Wake of the Paramore', will also have scientific value. He will take new measurements with better tools because Earth's magnetic field is always changing. This data will help improve the model of Earth's magnetic field. Dr. Clark says, 'We need to know true north to measure the magnetic field direction. We can use satellites for this.' The British Geological Survey and the United States Navy will provide instruments. A Danish satellite will also take similar measurements. Dr. Clark hopes his work will fill any gaps in the satellite's data. Halley's journey was the first scientific sea expedition, and he was the first civilian naval captain for this purpose. Dr. Clark has the experience for this trip. He spent two years in Antarctica and has sailed from Rio de Janeiro to England. He plans to complete the trip in four parts with different crews. Is Dr. Clark as dedicated as Halley? 'I am ready to spend eight months on this, so some might say I'm obsessed. But I need a good reason to sail across the Atlantic again. Halley and his life give me that reason.'"
CAE_27,"Text: 'PEACOCKS AND THEIR TAILS

Every summer, peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire show their big, colorful tails to the female peacocks, called hens. This is a mystery that Charles Darwin, a famous scientist, thought about a lot. He wondered why peacocks have such big tails when it seems like they would make life harder.

Darwin said animals change over time through evolution. The best animals survive and have babies. But he thought peacocks' tails were different. He called it 'sexual selection' because he thought hens liked the tails just because they were pretty.

Another scientist, Alfred Russel Wallace, had a different idea. He thought the tails showed that the peacocks were strong or healthy, even if people couldn't see it.

Today, scientists like Marion Petrie study the peacocks at Whipsnade. They want to know if hens really choose the peacocks with the biggest tails and if those peacocks are better in other ways.

They found that hens like peacocks with more eye-spots on their tails. But they are still checking if these peacocks are healthier or have better babies.

Another idea is from R A Fisher, who said that if a hen likes a peacock with a long tail, their children will also like long tails. This could make tails longer over time, just because they are pretty.

Scientists are still learning about why peacocks have such big tails.'"

It looks like it is 100 years old, but it was made last year. I like old boat designs, but I also use new technology. New technology helps make boats, but sometimes it makes sailing too easy. I think sailing should have some challenges. For example, I like to have a coal stove for warmth and a nice place to sleep. But I also think sailors should sometimes work with the sails. I do not like boats that feel like a house. My old boat, Hirta, had no electricity, no fridge, and no electronics, but it was a good boat. When I hurt my back, I had to sell Hirta. I could not find a new boat I liked, so I built 'The Westerman'. The designer, Nigel Irens, first drew the boat on a napkin. Then he used a computer to make the design better. The boat is made of wood and is very strong. It has crossed the North Atlantic and won races. It looks old but is very good at sea. It shows that old ideas can still work well.

CAE_22,"**Natural Talents**

Humans and chimpanzees are very similar. We are more than 98% the same in our genes. This means that the things that make us different from animals are new. Our ability to make art and do other human things comes from a small part of our genes. 

Animals and humans are not so different. For example, chimpanzees use sticks as tools, and sea otters use rocks to open clams. Monkeys have simple language with sounds for 'leopard', 'eagle', and 'snake'. 

The first human art we know about is from 35,000 years ago. This includes cave paintings and statues. People say human art is special because it is not useful, it is made for beauty, and it is learned, not instinctive.

1. **Not Useful**: Human art does not help us survive or have babies. For example, birds sing to find a mate, but human art is different.

2. **For Beauty**: Humans make art for pleasure. We do not know if birds enjoy their songs, but they sing mostly in the breeding season, so it might not be for pleasure.

3. **Learned**: Human art is learned. People in different places have different art styles. For example, songs in Tokyo and Paris are different, but people can learn each other's songs. Birds, however, are born knowing their songs.

Human art changes quickly. For example, paintings from the 20th century look different from the Mona Lisa. But some chimpanzees, like Congo and Betsy, also made paintings. Congo made many paintings in one day and got upset when his pencil was taken away. Their paintings were shown in an art show in London in 1957, and many were sold.

These chimpanzee paintings show that the line between human art and animal activities is not clear. Like human art, the ape paintings were not made for a specific purpose but for the painter's satisfaction. Some human art was also made for personal satisfaction, not to communicate with others."
CAE_39,"Text: 'A Big Adventure The Taklamakan Desert in western China is one of the last unexplored places on earth. It is also very dangerous. Charles Blackmore crossed it and survived. There are not many big adventures left and not many heroes. In the past, children's stories had brave explorers. These explorers had sunburnt skin and eyes looking far into the distance. Today, you do not find such people in stories or real life. But then I met Charles Blackmore. Blackmore's big adventure was leading a team across the Taklamakan Desert in western China. Its name means 'once entered you never come out', but local people call it the Desert of Death. He talked about the dangers and excitement of the journey at his home. The team had four Britons (one was a doctor), an American photographer, four Chinese experts, 30 camels, and six camel handlers. The camel handlers had never worked with camels before; they were truck drivers. This mistake could have been very dangerous. The team wanted to cross 1,200 kilometers of desert. Charles Blackmore wrote about their journey. At that time, he was leaving the Army after 14 years. He started the expedition for fun and to learn more about himself. 'I always thought I would stay in the Army. I got a promotion, but I wanted to know who I was outside the Army. It was a big risk. My wife, Tina, was worried because nobody had done that route before. We went into it without knowing what to expect. It took 59 days to cross from west to east, and the desert was kind to us.' When you read about the crossing, you might wonder why he said 'kind'. The team had many problems: sickness, very hot and cold temperatures, thirst, and losing some water. 'But', Blackmore said, 'when we were very tired and the camels had no water for seven days, we found some. We did not have the desert's big sandstorms. And we did not have the very cold weather that could stop us. But we had many problems. The sand got into everything, especially blisters and wounds. The high dunes were hard to climb for us and the camels. Sometimes the camels fell on us. 'What kept me going was the need to survive. We had no backup plan. No planes flew over us. Once we were in the sand, we were alone. 'I knew I was mentally strong, but I was scared about my physical strength. I remember the first day -- we sat at the edge of the desert, and it was so hot you couldn't breathe. I thought, ""We have to do it now!"" I was very scared.' If it was like that at the start, how did they feel at the end? 'When you have walked 1,000 kilometers, you do not give up. You have gone through so much. We were very thin but strong. My body was fit, and my legs were strong. I could walk over anything.' In the book, Blackmore talked about lying in the desert looking at the moon and thinking of his family. How did he feel about what his family went through? 'Inside me, there is someone trying to find peace. When I doubt myself, I think of the desert and how we did it. I am proud of that expedition. But for a lifetime achievement, I think of my family and our happiness. The desert does not compare to that.' Has Charles Blackmore found peace? 'I want the challenge and open spaces. We had a purpose. Now, I find it hard to be part of modern life.''"

Many of us have small, unusual habits. It could be entering contests, collecting things, or writing letters to newspapers. Eccentricity means being unique. Inside us, there are two forces: one wants to be different, and the other wants to fit in. Most people want to fit in because they want to be liked and accepted. People with unusual hobbies or ideas often find others like them. They make clubs and have meetings to share their interests. They feel better in a group, even a small one. We all feel a pull between being different and fitting in. Sometimes, we want to show we are unique. For example, someone might say, ""I say what I think,"" or ""You must take me as I am."" We can choose to be more unique. Some people become famous by being different, like Bob Dylan, a singer. He said, ""When you know what you want and go for it, people might not understand."" But being unique is not the same as being eccentric. If a singer wears strange clothes for attention, that is not eccentricity. But if they always act this way and cannot change, they might be eccentric. Eccentrics do not try to be different; they just are. They do not care what others think. They are not like people who play jokes, want attention, or hide from others. These people care about what others think. Eccentrics just live their lives in their own way.'"
CAE_58,"Text: 'Natural Books We asked four nature experts to tell us about the wildlife book that influenced them the most. A Geoffrey Lean Choosing the author was easy. As an environmental journalist, I have met many important people in the field. None was more important than Barbara Ward. She was very involved in environmental issues in Europe after World War II. Her book, The Home of Man, is about the fast growth of cities and the need for sustainable development. It is the best book I have read on this topic. B Linda Bennett When I read Signals for Survival by Niko Tinbergen, I can imagine the sounds and smells of a gull colony. This book explains how animals communicate. After reading it, watching a gull colony becomes more interesting. You can see which birds are partners and where their boundaries are. Niko Tinbergen wanted to share his findings with everyone. He worked with artist Eric Ennion, who painted birds beautifully. This book is great for anyone who loves wildlife. C Lee Durrell My Family and Other Animals by Gerald Durrell is the book that influenced me the most. It led me to a great husband and a career in conservation. I read it while doing research in Madagascar. The book made me feel happy and inspired. It shows animals and people living together in harmony. This is a world worth saving. Gerald Durrell looked at all living things as a family. This is an important idea for everyone. D Bruce Pearson I found The Shell Bird Book by James Fisher in my school library in 1966. I loved the 48 color plates of birds by Eric Ennion. I already liked bird books and learned to identify birds. This book had more to offer, like chapters on bird migration and birds in art. It helped me appreciate birds and nature more. The book showed me that my emotional response to nature is as important as a scientific one. I realized I could combine my love for art with my interest in nature.'"
CAE_37,"Text: 'DO REVIEWS HELP SELL BOOKS? We asked five big British publishers if book reviews help sell books. Here is what they said. Publisher A Reviews are very important for publishers. Many people buy books because of reviews. Authors and publishers feel sad if there are no reviews. Bad reviews are not so bad for publishers because they can still make people curious to read the book. Publisher B Publishers and newspapers both like book reviews, but they want different things. Newspapers want to entertain readers, and publishers want good reviews for their books. Reviews are better now than 40 years ago. Reviews help people know about books and authors. A good review can help sell books. Publisher C Reviews are very important for us. We publish books by authors who are not very famous, so we need reviews. Good reviews are better than advertisements. They help sell books. But reviews alone are not enough. We also need people to talk about the book and good marketing. Publisher D In the US, one review can make a book popular. In Britain, it is different. Sometimes, books with bad reviews sell well. It is hard to predict. Non-fiction reviews often talk more about the subject than the book. Publisher E Publishers and writers want good reviews. But do they sell books? I published a book with great reviews, but it did not sell well. People thought they knew the book from the reviews. The reviewer's name used to matter more. Now, a surprising reviewer or a fun review can make people want to buy the book.'"

He is one of the few people in the country who do this. Graham makes special designs for each customer. 'This way, I can make a unique gift,' he says. 'Many of my customers are women buying gifts for their husbands. They want a special gift that shows the man's job or hobbies.' The most common weathervane design is a cockerel. But the first weathervane Graham made was a witch on a broomstick. His friends liked it and asked him to make weathervanes for them. 'I saw that I could make many different designs,' he says. Graham decided to start a weathervane business. He used to work as a precision engineer for 15 years. Then, he and his wife, Liz, changed roles. She went to work, and he stayed home to look after the children and build the business. That was five years ago, and he is happy with his choice. 'My old job was not artistic, but this is fun and creative,' he says. 'I love designing.' Graham has made over 100 original designs. He works with fine detail and always asks the customer to approve the design before cutting it. Graham also keeps many traditional designs because they are popular. 'People like hand-made things,' Graham says. 'They want something different.' Graham does not want to expand his business. He wants to keep it as a small craft. 'I have found my place in the market. People love the unique designs, and I enjoy making them,' he says. 'For a long time, weathervanes have helped people know the weather by showing wind direction,' he explains. 'Now, more people are moving to the countryside, and they want special things for their homes. This helps my business.' Graham is very busy now. He sends flat-packed weathervanes to customers all over the world. American and Danish buyers are very interested. 'The price,' he says, 'depends on how detailed the design is.' His latest request was for a curly-coated dog. Whatever the occasion, Graham can make a special gift.'"

Before it was published, The Horse Whisperer was a very popular book. It is the first novel by British writer Nicholas Evans. He talks about his inspiration and success.

At the start of the year, Nicholas Evans was not happy. A film project he worked on for months failed. He was worried because he had not earned money for two years. He could have gone back to his old job, but he decided to write a book instead. He went to America for three months to learn about horses for his book.

The idea for the story came from a man he met in Dartmoor. The man told him about a horse that became wild. A gypsy talked to the horse and made it calm. These men are called 'horse whisperers'. Evans wanted to write a film script, but he decided to write a book instead.

In spring, he traveled across the US, learning about horses. He felt alone and worried about money. By August, he wrote half of the book. He showed it to a friend who was a literary agent. The agent said it was ""fine"" and thought Evans might get $30,000 for it.

In October, they sent the first part of the book to publishers. Soon, his agent said they got an offer of $75,000. Evans was surprised. The book was sold for $550,000 in the UK and $3.15 million in the US. It was a record for a first novel. Hollywood studios also wanted it.

Evans did not want to write the film script. He wanted to stay away from the film business. He thought about writing another novel instead."

Bobby won the first game, but he is not as strong as he was in 1972. He is 49 years old and not in good shape. Boris Spassky is even older. Chess has changed a lot in 20 years. Now, chess is more about winning than about art or science. Players need to be strong and smart. They use a chess clock to make sure they play fast. If they don't, they lose the game. Games are longer now, and players don't take breaks. Young players have an advantage. Most top players are under 30 years old. Computers are important in chess now. They help players prepare for games. A computer can show many games and help find mistakes. Players work hard before a game to be ready. Chess games can last up to eight hours. Players must focus all the time. If they lose focus, they can lose the game. The chess clock makes the game tense. At the end, players must move fast. Winning feels great, but losing is very hard. Chess tournaments last many days. Players play every day. World championship matches are even harder. In 1984, a match between Anatoli Karpov and Gary Kasparov stopped because they were too tired. Bobby Fischer once said, ""All I want to do is play chess."" He left chess in 1972, which was surprising. Now, he is back. If he wins, he will get a lot of money.

This means you can set two wake-up times, one for weekdays and one for weekends. It also has a cassette player, which is nice for listening to tapes. The radio quality is good, but it is big. Paul Bridges said he needs space on his table for his keys, wallet, glasses, and phone. He also books a wake-up call just in case. This model was the best-looking and the winner. Paul Bridges loved it, but the clock sometimes stopped at 16.00. I liked the digital display. The snooze button is easy to find. It has a power back-up, so you don't have to reset it if the power goes out. But it is hard to set up. Tom Granger said another model with a lamp was 'tacky'. The lamp is hard to use, and the clock was difficult to set. The radio was hard to tune, and the buzzer was very loud. This model is popular with young people because of its bright colors. Tom Granger liked it because it was easy to set up. But the alarm can be 10 minutes early or late. Paul Bridges did not like this. The simplest and cheapest model was small and easy to use.

They put expensive or fast-selling items there. Shelves at eye level are popular. Special offers are in 'dump bins'. They put things like salad dressing near salad items. C. Staples Spread Out Supermarkets put things like bread and sugar far from the entrance. You have to pass other things to get them. Stores put popular items far away so you see other things on the way. D. Less is More Some stores show fewer items to look special. Next stores do this. They look like boutiques. Their clothes are not more special, but the store looks nice. E. Price Tricks Shoppers care about the total bill, not each item. Supermarkets mix cheap and expensive items. They might sell some things cheap to get you in the store. They buy in big amounts to get discounts. F. Price Tags In chainstores, people notice prices more. Pricing something at $14.99 instead of $15 is important. It also helps stop theft because staff must give change. G. Lighting Stores use special lights. Chainstores want natural light so clothes look the same outside. Supermarkets use lights to make food look good. H. Walking Paths Stores use different carpets to guide you. Some shoppers stay on the path. Marks and Spencer use wood or marble for paths and carpet for sales areas. I. In-store Ads When you enter a supermarket, you see big pictures of food. In the US, some trolleys have screens with ads.

CAE_8,"Text: 'A history of the apple

Apples have been with us for a very long time. They come in many colors, shapes, and sizes. But today, we might lose some of this variety.

Prehistoric times 8,000 BC
People have eaten apples since very old times. In Britain, they ate apples and left the seeds. In Switzerland and near the Caucasus mountains, people kept apple halves for winter. These were small wild apples, not like the ones we eat today.

Norman times 1000 AD
The French learned to grow fruit from the Romans. They brought this knowledge to Britain. British monks worked on making new apples. Many apples today come from these old types.

Medieval times 1200
In the 1200s, some apples became popular in Britain. The Old English Pearmain was a dessert apple. The Costard was a cooking apple. But then, fewer apples were grown because of problems like droughts and wars. In the 1500s, King Henry VIII sent someone to France to learn about apples. This helped grow more apples in Britain.

Settler times 1750
By the 1600s, apples were very popular in Britain. People moving to Canada, Australia, the US, South Africa, and New Zealand took apples with them. In America, a man named Johnny Appleseed planted many apple trees.

Modern times 1850
In Iowa, a farmer found a new apple and called it 'Delicious'. It became very popular. In Australia, Maria Anne Smith found a new green apple. It was called 'Granny Smith' and became famous.

Today 1950
Apples are grown all over the world. Most apples come from just a few types. Many people want more different kinds of apples. We need to keep many types of apples for the future.'"

CAE_7,"Text: 'Advertising Problems Today

Advertising is not doing well. This is not just because of the bad economy. Advertising started to go down in 1989, before the economy got worse. The problem is bigger and is happening everywhere. Advertising has not changed with the economy. Advertisers think about big markets and big media, but now there are many brands and media. This means markets are smaller. Big brands should focus on small groups, but they often do not. This is where advertising is wrong.

Think about your shopping. When you go to a supermarket, you buy many things. Most are not advertised brands. You might buy a few advertised brands from the 15,000 items in the store. In a year, you might buy a few hundred brands. Big items like cars? Maybe one every three years. Clothes? Not many are advertised brands. Even with candy, medicine, and services, you probably buy less than 400 brands a year.

There are 32,500 advertised brands. Let's look at the 9,500 brands that spend a lot on advertising. Most people buy 400 of these, not all because of ads. That is about 4%. So, 96% of advertising might be wasted. When you watch TV, count how many ads are for brands you buy. For most, it is about 1 in 16 (6%). The other 15 (94%) are wasted.

You might think ads do not affect you. Most people think this. But it is not true. People do not buy most brands they see in ads. Waste is part of advertising. Not everyone will buy the brands they see. People notice only a few ads and ignore the rest. But advertising can still work. It talks to many people to find the few who will buy. It is a cheap way to reach many people.

Smart targeting can help reduce waste. But advertisers cannot know who will respond. Even the best direct mail does not get 100% response. This is different from face-to-face selling. A salesman might sell to everyone he talks to, but media cannot do this. If advertisers knew who would buy, they would not need media. They could talk to people directly.

Any advertiser who gets one million new customers (2% of adults) is doing well. For soap powder, the top brands would be happy with a million new customers. Any ad campaign that gets 2% of people is very successful. This is a small part of the population. To reach them, mass media is the best way. But advertising needs to focus more on small groups to succeed.'"

The house looks traditional with a clay roof and is near the Minster. It blends with the town's old buildings and was approved by planners. The house is very quiet because it is super-insulated. Inside, it is peaceful. On a sunny day, the conservatory warms the air. Robert opens windows for air because the house is draught-proof. Even their cats have a special door.

They use rainwater and have special toilets. Water from washing goes into the garden. They don't use a dishwasher to avoid strong detergents. The house is not medieval, but it has a tall hall. The Vales pay no water bills and use little electricity. They will soon have solar panels to make more electricity. The only heating is a small wood stove. In winter, the house stays warm without it.

I went to a stop-smoking session with group therapy and hypnotherapy two months and three weeks ago. I didn't plan to stop smoking, and I didn't really want to. I didn't feel sick, and I thought I was healthier than my friends who didn't smoke. I went to the session in Birmingham to write an article about people trying to stop smoking. I said, 'I won't try to stop because I'm here to write, not to quit.' I liked smoking; it made me happy. The counsellor seemed to know something I didn't. We could smoke as much as we wanted, and the room was full of smoke. But when they told us to smoke, I didn't want to, and neither did the others. The idea of stopping smoking started to feel good. It was a secret feeling just for me. Could I do anything? Stopping was easier than I thought. The need for nicotine went away after a few days. I thought working without cigarettes would be hard, but it wasn't. The hardest part was being at home on weekend mornings. Smoking was something to do when I was bored. I do miss smoking, but not too much. Doing things without smoking, like eating out or waiting for a plane, is new for me.'"

CAE_56,"Margaret and her special skill

Margaret Wilkins has a special skill. She can find water underground using a forked hazel stick. Many farmers ask for her help when their wells dry up. Margaret and her husband have a business to drill wells. They use machines, but to find water, Margaret only needs her hazel stick. They are successful more than 90% of the time.

Finding water this way is called dowsing. Some people think it is like a 'sixth sense'. There are different ideas about how it works. Some say it is because everything vibrates, and water vibrates more. Dowsers, like Margaret, might feel these vibrations.

Margaret is very busy, especially when there is little rain. She helps farmers, people with holiday homes, and golf-course developers. She looks for water 50 to 70 meters deep. It is important to find clean water, away from farm waste. The water is in rocks, and it is clean if brought up straight. They also need electricity for the pump, so the well should be near power supplies.

Margaret starts by looking at a map with a pendulum. The pendulum swings over places with water. Then, she walks with her hazel stick to find the exact spot. When she is over water, she feels something special. The stick moves up when water is below. It is important to drill exactly where the stick shows. If Margaret and her husband do not agree on the spot, they keep looking.

Margaret's skill is not common, but it works well for her business. She calls it an 'intuitive perception of the environment'. This skill helps her find water and keep their business successful."

Amanda (23), a young mother with two daughters, swapped lives with her friend Cindy (30), who works as a waitress in a busy London restaurant. A. Amanda's story I had never been in a place like the restaurant before. It was dark and noisy, with many people. I was nervous! Being a mother is busy, but this was different! I had 15 minutes to learn how to carry a tray of drinks. The other waitresses made it look easy, but I dropped the drinks. I was embarrassed, but they laughed and said everyone does it at first. By 11.30 am, people were waiting outside, and I was nervous. I worried about remembering orders, but everything was on a computer. After a few hours, my feet hurt, and the music was loud. I had to say 'Pardon?' a lot, which was embarrassing. By 5 pm, I was very tired and wanted to rest my feet. I couldn't believe it was a 'quiet' day! I thought waitressing was easy, but you need to be friendly and calm. I'm shy, and I don't think I could work on a busy Saturday night. The pay wasn't great, and I didn't get any tips. I was happy to go back to my children. It seems easy after waitressing! B. Cindy's story I was nervous about being a 'mum' for the day, but excited too. I thought I could handle the girls, but I was wrong! After Amanda left, I had to dress and feed the girls. I took Sophie to school and Katie to nursery. I thought I would have three hours of peace, but I had to clean the house and do the washing. At 1 pm, I picked up Katie, went to the supermarket, and then home for lunch. When Sophie came home, the real trouble started. They jumped on the sofa and screamed loudly! I thought they would get tired, but they didn't. I got them to bed by 8 pm, but they kept asking for water to come downstairs. It was tiring to keep talking to them. I didn't know how tiring it was to look after two small children. You don't have time for yourself, and the responsibility is big. But I enjoyed the day. Rosemary (42) runs a dairy farm. She swapped with Hilary (30), a teacher at a primary school. C. Rosemary's story On the farm, I wake up at 5.30 am, so waking up at 7 was nice! I didn't know what to wear. I couldn't wear farm clothes! At assembly, I saw about 400 pupils. I hoped I didn't stand out. Then it was time for a maths class. The children worked in groups, which was different from my school days. I helped with a nature project about snails. By lunchtime, I was tired and wanted a break, but teachers only have five minutes to eat. I went to a meeting and helped with sports trials. After lunch, there was a reading lesson and a French lesson. The children wanted to practice French with me, which showed my French was not good. Then we went to the hall for Physical Education. I was tired, but the children had lots of energy. The hardest part was speaking in front of the class. Teachers have more holidays, but I think I'll stay with farming! D. Hilary's story I arrived at the farm at 8.30 am, but Rosemary had been up for three hours! The farm has 100 cows, 15 calves, and about 800 sheep. Rosemary also makes ice-cream, yoghurt, and cream. I spent the morning in the ice-cream shop, putting milk in bottles and ice-cream in cartons. It was hard not to taste the ice-cream! At lunchtime, I checked the sheep. I picked up a sheep that had fallen over. If they stay down for more than 12 hours, they could die. After feeding the calves, I started milking. It took two-and-a-half hours. Rosemary does this twice a day, every day! I found it lonely. I missed the children. The worst part is not being able to leave work. The cows need milking every day, so it's hard to take time off. Rosemary only gets about three days' holiday a year. Farming seems nice, but it's different in reality. The income is not regular, and the weather is a problem.'"

CAE_45,"Text: 'Career Power: Be a Leader at Work

A. What makes a good leader? A leader is someone who inspires and helps others. Leadership is not about being tall or very smart. Pat Dixon, who wrote a book about men and women at work, says leadership is about 'making things happen with people who are as excited as you are'. A good leader should speak clearly and with confidence. Dixon says, 'It's about saying ""I believe"" instead of ""I think"".'

B. John van Maurik, a teacher of leadership, says, 'Many people can be leaders, but they don't know it. Becoming a leader is about finding and using your hidden talents.' We are all born with the ability to lead, but we need the right chance to show it. We can see leaders like Mahatma Gandhi or Richard Branson, but it can be hard to see leadership in our own jobs. Still, being a leader is very important for good management.

C. Think about the best and worst boss you have had. They might both be good at planning and meeting goals. But how did they do it? The best leader made you feel motivated and supported. The worst leader made you feel unimportant and blamed you when things went wrong. The first one led well; the second one just managed badly.

D. Leaders and managers are different. Managers like to work within rules. Leaders make new paths. 'A good manager can keep a company running,' says Michael Shea, who wrote about leadership. 'But a good leader can change a company or team for the better.'

E. Whether you are the boss or not, you can learn to be a better leader. Here are some tips:

* Leadership is best when you choose to do it. Find what you care about. When you feel ready to lead, use that energy and take action.
* Think of yourself as a leader. Your ability to lead is strong. Know it.
* Working with others is good, but sometimes you need to lead firmly. Try different styles. If you usually ask others for their views, try leading. See how things change.

F. * Leadership takes practice. You learn by leading, taking risks, and learning from mistakes. Learn to share tasks and motivate others.
* Your way of leading might not work for everyone. Keep improving your communication skills. You don't have to be liked, but your ideas should be.
* Be visible and easy to reach for those who matter. Remember, you don't have to lead all the time. Know where your help is needed and how you can help others become leaders too.'"

CAE_32,"**Taking Photos of People**

People are very interesting to photograph. A photo with a person is usually more interesting than one without. But, taking good photos of people can be hard. You need to think about how they move and their expressions. Sometimes, the camera can make people act differently.

**A. Group Photos**

When taking group photos, don't make people stand in straight lines. Ask them to stand at different angles or levels. Some can sit or kneel in front so you can see all faces.

**B. Posing for Photos**

People often feel stiff in front of the camera. Help them relax by finding a comfortable position. They can fold their hands or put them in their pockets.

**C. Taking the Photo**

Don't pretend you are not taking a photo. This can make people feel tense. Most people will agree to have their photo taken. They might feel shy at first, but they usually like it. Help them by giving directions.

**D. Eye Contact**

A photo is strong if the person looks at the camera. Ask them to look into the lens. They don't have to smile. Remind them to look just before you take the photo. You can also say something funny to get a real reaction.

**E. Looking at Something**

Instead of looking at the camera, the person can look at something else in the photo. This can make the photo interesting. It looks like you are watching them without them knowing.

**F. Expressions and Gestures**

Expressions and gestures show a lot about a person. A laughing child makes us smile. A sad face makes us feel sad too. Look for familiar expressions like winks, anger, or thumbs-up.

**G. Backgrounds**

A background can make a photo more interesting. Make sure the background is not too busy. Focus on the person. Use a wide-angle lens to make the person look bigger compared to the background.

**H. Interaction**

When people talk, argue, or work together, you can take good photos. Look for eye contact or physical contact, like a handshake. Show how one person reacts to another.

**I. People and Places**

Many photos are taken on holiday. To show people with a nice background, use a wide-angle lens. Move back to get the whole scene. Ask people to stand close to the camera. A good photo shows both the people and the place.

**J. To Pose or Not to Pose?**

Decide why you want the photo. If you want to remember someone, ask them to pose. But, family photos can be more fun if they are not posed. Candid photos show real moments and are more lively. They help you remember better in the future."

These skills can show who will do well and who will not. They are important for future jobs too. These skills are not what we learned in school. Doing well in exams is not important here.

B Today, job security is not guaranteed, so personal qualities are important at work. These have been called 'character', 'personality', or 'soft skills'. Now, they are called 'emotional intelligence'. This means knowing and controlling our own and others' feelings, and using them to think and act. At work, it includes self-awareness, self-control, motivation, empathy, and good social skills. Some think it means 'being nice', but sometimes it means telling the truth even if it is hard. It is not about showing all feelings, but managing them well to work together towards a goal. C More businesses see that emotional intelligence is important for management. The harder the job, the more it matters. Lack of these skills can make it hard to use technical skills. Some people succeed without emotional intelligence, but as work gets more complex, companies where people work well together do better. In today's workplace, teamwork and customer focus make emotional skills important for success everywhere. D IQ changes little, but emotional intelligence grows as we learn from life. We can get better at handling emotions, motivating ourselves, and understanding others. This growth is called maturity. We can learn emotional intelligence and add these skills to help us. This is important when job stability is uncertain. Emotional intelligence is not a magic solution for companies, but if ignored, other things do not work as well.'"
CAE_52,"Text: 'Should the media make money from content they don't own? Digital cameras and phones make it easy to take pictures of news events. Social media has changed how people share these pictures. Some journalists use social media to find pictures of news events. But sometimes, they use these pictures without asking. There is a rule that says they can use pictures without asking if it is very important. But people still talk about if this is right or wrong. Research shows that about one in ten people would take pictures of a news event. This means these pictures are important for the media. To keep a good relationship with people, the media should make sure to ask for permission and give rewards for these pictures.'"
CAE_28,"**Ancient Chinese Medicine in the West**

**Acupuncture is very old.**  
Acupuncture is 2,000 years old. It comes from China. It is part of Chinese medicine. This includes herbs, massage, diet, and exercise. Acupuncture is used for many health problems. In the West, it is mostly used for pain. Some doctors, nurses, and therapists use it for pain relief.

**What is acupuncture?**  
Chinese medicine says health is when the mind, body, and spirit are in balance. Energy, called Qi (pronounced ""chee""), moves in the body along lines called meridians. There are 12 main meridians. Each is linked to an organ. If Qi is blocked, the body is not in balance. This can cause illness. An acupuncturist checks your wrist pulse, tongue, and appearance. They ask about your health, mood, and habits. They use thin needles in the skin. They may also use heat or pressure to help Qi flow.

**Acupuncture points**  
Acupuncture points are on meridians. They may not be near the pain. People feel a dull ache or tingling when the needle is used. This shows the needle has reached the Qi. There are over 300 main points.

**How does it work?**  
Doctors in the West think acupuncture can help with pain. They have scientific ideas about how it works. It may block pain signals to the brain. It may also release natural painkillers in the body.

**What pain can be treated?**  
People with long-term pain often try acupuncture. It is used for back pain, sports injuries, arthritis, headaches, and pain after surgery. It may also help with menstrual pain, facial nerve pain, and pain in very sick people.

**Modern use of acupuncture**  
Acupuncture has been used in China for over 2,000 years. In the 1950s, it started being used instead of anesthesia in surgery. This showed some doctors outside China that acupuncture works. In China, it is used in many surgeries. Needles may be used alone or with electricity or drugs. It is said to reduce pain, but it is different for each person. Acupuncture does not have the side effects of regular anesthesia.

**Is it always effective?**  
It is hard to test acupuncture in studies. But some studies show 50 to 80 percent of people find it helps with long-term pain. Acupuncturists say it works for many people. It may take six or seven visits to feel better, but some improvement should be felt after two or three visits.

**A different view of pain**  
Western and Chinese medicine see pain differently. Acupuncturists look at the whole person, not just symptoms. They spend time finding out what causes the pain. They ask if the pain is worse in cold, heat, damp, or wind. They also ask if the pain is sharp, dull, or burning. This helps decide how to treat the pain. Western doctors may not ask these questions.

**Traditional or not?**  
Some doctors have traditional acupuncture training. Others use scientific ideas. Traditional acupuncturists believe Chinese medicine can make deep changes for a longer cure. It is important to choose a good acupuncturist. They should send you to a doctor if needed."

CAE_5,"Text: 'Handwriting Can Show Who You Are Some people think handwriting can show a person's character. In some countries, when you apply for a job, you might need to give a sample of your handwriting. Companies use handwriting analysis, called graphology, to see if you are right for the job. Graphology is seen as a real science in many places. It can help find illnesses like heart disease and cancer. It can also show how a person feels or if they have emotional problems. Big companies use graphologists to look at handwriting for important jobs. But many doctors do not believe in graphology. Patricia Marne, a graphologist for over 20 years, thinks doctors should take it seriously. She says handwriting can show social class, intelligence, and if a person is honest or not. It can also show if someone might be a criminal. Criminals often have messy handwriting. Ms. Marne says handwriting can show if a person is under stress or has health problems. Changes in handwriting can mean something serious has happened. She also says handwriting can show if a person is creative or a loner. It takes six years to learn how to read handwriting well. Ms. Marne believes more research will make graphology a real science. But some doctors say handwriting only shows how a person was taught to write and nothing more.'"

We visited four different offices to see how healthy and happy they are. Our expert team included a building health consultant, an ergonomist (who studies people's working conditions), and an occupational psychologist. Here are their opinions.

Office A: Advertising Agency
Building Health Consultant: This office is very simple. There is no central heating or mechanical ventilation, and windows open to the street. The team of seven people seems happy and adapts to the seasons by opening doors or using electric heaters. They have created a homely work environment without much outside control.
Ergonomist: The furniture is mixed and often creates bad working positions. Chairs are old and many are broken. However, the team has a varied work schedule, which helps reduce tiredness and boredom.
Occupational Psychologist: Staff enjoy the variety of work and the flexible office space. The office is the right size for knowing what others are doing but also having personal space. It is attractive and fun, showing efficiency and creativity.

Office B: News Service
Building Health Consultant: The office is comfortable and the air quality is good, helped by a No Smoking policy.
Ergonomist: Chairs, lighting, and computer equipment are good, but the office is impersonal with grey walls.
Occupational Psychologist: Walls are bare except for planners and a poster. Staff relationships are okay, but the office could be better if desks were arranged for easier information sharing.

Office C: Bank
Building Health Consultant: The office feels like a glass case. Despite smokers, the air is not stale.
Ergonomist: The office is standard and uninspiring. Desks are just adequate, and some chairs do not meet requirements.
Occupational Psychologist: Staff support each other and use technology well. The office is busy, but the wood panels and brown carpet make it look dull.

Office D: Newspaper
Building Health Consultant: The air-conditioning is poor, and the office is dusty and cluttered.
Ergonomist: The furniture is not suitable for a high-tech office. Chairs are old and not adjustable.
Occupational Psychologist: The office is dirty and needs cleaning. There is little conversation, and everyone seems stressed. The company should encourage teamwork.'"
CAE_38,"Chewing Gum Culture

Chewing gum is popular, and Americans chew 12 million pieces every day. It has less than ten calories per piece. Chewing gum is a type of food, so it must follow the rules of the American Food and Drug Administration. 

Today, most gum is made from synthetic materials, with added pine resins and softeners to keep the flavor and make it chewy. But in the past, it was different. The ancient Greeks chewed a resin from the mastic tree, found in Greece and Turkey. Greek women used it to clean their teeth and freshen their breath. 

In America, colonists learned from the Amero-Indians in New England to chew resin from spruce trees. In the early 1800s, people in the eastern United States sold spruce gum, making it the first commercial chewing gum in the country.

Modern chewing gum started in the late 1860s with chicle, a milky substance from the sapodilla tree in Central America. This gum was smoother and more elastic, leading to a new industry. However, growing sapodilla trees for chicle has not been successful. As the gum market grew, synthetic alternatives were created.

Today, a few chicle gatherers, called chicleros, still work in difficult conditions. They travel long distances in hot, humid forests to collect chicle. They face dangers like poisonous snakes and insects. The chicleros climb trees to collect the sap, which they carry to a camp to boil and make into bricks. Life at the camp is hard, with simple food and local alcohol.

The chicleros worry about their jobs. The United States used to import 7,000 tonnes of chicle a year from Central America, but now only 200 tonnes are collected in Mexico's Yucatan peninsula. As gum sales increase, manufacturers use synthetic materials to save money and meet demand.

Gum producers are finding new ways to sell their products. They say gum helps you relax, gives you energy, and reduces tooth decay. Chewing gum for 20 minutes can increase saliva, which helps protect teeth. Research continues on new textures and flavors. Glycerine and vegetable oils are used in gum, and most new flavors are artificial. However, some flavors still need natural ingredients. In America, 137 square kilometers are used to grow mint for the two most popular chewing gums in the world."

CAE_47,"**The Hotel Inspector**

Sue Brown works as a hotel inspector. She checks hotels to see if they are good. Christopher Middleton watched her work. 

Sue visits the Globe Hotel for an inspection. Right away, there are problems. The receptionist is talking on the phone and does not notice Sue. Sue says, ""Very poor."" This is a common mistake she sees in hotels.

The Globe Hotel has three red stars, which means it is one of the top hotels. But Sue is not happy. The entrance from the car park is not welcoming. There is a long, empty corridor to the hotel door. Sue says, ""Not what I expected.""

Things get worse. The receptionist cannot find Sue's booking. Most rooms are empty, but the room Sue gets is not nice. It is stuffy, and there is a big hole in the wall.

Sue is known for being tough. People called her ""The Woman in Black,"" but she says she is not too tough. The next morning, she tells the hotel manager, Robin Greaves, who she is. He looks worried. He apologizes for a bad smell in the lounge. Sue suggests fixing the plumbing and not taking guests to that room.

Sue also says good things. She likes Emma, the assistant manager, and Trudy, the waitress. Dinner is good, and the hotel keeps its two-rosette food rating. Greaves asks how to get three rosettes. Sue says, ""Not serve a pudding that collapses.""

Sue's job is to tell hotels what is wrong. Sometimes people get upset. Once, a woman said Sue got her son fired because he served apple pie with his fingers. Sue writes a report for the hotel. They pay for her advice.

The good news for the Globe Hotel is they keep their red stars. But another inspector will come in two months to check again. Greaves says, ""Good,"" but he does not look happy."

She says, ""It was really his garden."" At first, Danny did not like some of Susan's ideas, but he understood when she said she wanted to paint them.

Susan likes to paint one flower at a time. She sometimes paints a group of flowers, but usually, she picks one flower and takes it to her studio. She paints it for a few days, then picks another flower. It can take years to finish one painting. Spring and early summer are her busiest times because many flowers bloom then. She likes to watch how flowers change. For example, tulips change shape in water. They look boring at first, but then they twist and turn.

Susan has always liked plants. She studied them in school and collected wild flowers. She did not like garden flowers before. She thought they looked fake. She liked wild flowers because they grew in hard places. Now, her garden has plants from faraway places like China and the Himalayas. She lets the garden grow freely, like a kind aunt with children. Susan is busy with two art shows, so she hired another gardener. But she still likes to work in the garden because it helps her with her paintings."

Before that, I wrote reviews for other newspapers, magazines, and radio. That's how I met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page. He also wrote for radio and TV. He hired me, but Tom was not mainly a journalist. At first, he wanted a team of critics to write about books, TV, theatre, film, and radio. We would have a weekly lunch to choose what to write about, and there would be guests to make it fun. It felt like a dream: a new newspaper, and I was part of it. It seemed unlikely that a new paper could succeed. I even thought a millionaire was pretending to hire me. I had little confidence. The first time I saw someone reading the newspaper on the London Underground and saw my review, I didn't know what to do. Tom's idea for a team of critics didn't work out. It was a good idea, but we didn't meet as planned, so we talked by phone. People preferred a reviewer to focus on one subject, so I chose film. Thanks to Tom, I now write a long piece each week, usually about one film. This way of working is good for me. I wouldn't like the usual film critic's job, which means reviewing every film. That would make me bored quickly. I would soon be saying, 'What boring film must I watch now?' I like having space to write more or to be creative when there isn't much to say. But what is my job for the public? I think people choose films because of the stars, the ads, or the director. People usually stick to the types of films they like. It's rare for someone who hates westerns to watch one because of a review, or for a romance fan to skip a love story because of a review. So, if a film review isn't a guide, what is it?

After breakfast, Sarah cleans the rooms or makes afternoon tea. She finishes by 11 a.m. and goes skiing. She skis until 4.30 p.m. Sarah goes back to the chalet to make dinner. Dinner is at 8 p.m. and has three courses. Coffee is ready by 10 p.m. Sarah cleans the kitchen after dinner. Sometimes she talks with the guests. Other times, they want to be alone. Sarah meets her friends at 11 p.m. They go out to places like Bananas and Dick's T-Bar. But she does not stay out late on Saturday. Sunday is her busiest day. She starts work early. Breakfast is ready by 7 a.m. for guests who leave. After they go, Sarah cleans everything. She also shops for the week. New guests arrive at 4.30 p.m. Sarah makes tea for them. She helps them with boots or skis. Then she makes dinner again. Sometimes she is too tired and goes to bed early."
FCE_27,"Miss Rita Cohen was a small girl with pale skin. She looked much younger than Seymour's daughter, Marie, but said she was six years older. One day, she came to Seymour's factory. She wore overalls and big shoes, and her curly hair framed her pretty face. She was so small and young that Seymour found it hard to believe she was at the University of Pennsylvania. She was doing research on the leather industry in New Jersey for her Master's degree.

A few times a year, someone would call or write to Seymour to ask if they could see his factory. Sometimes, he would help a student by answering questions or giving a short tour if they seemed serious. Rita was almost as small as the children from Marie's class. Years ago, Marie's class came to see how Seymour made gloves. Marie loved the laying-off table, where men shaped and pressed gloves on hot brass hands. Marie called them 'pancake hands' because they looked flat.

Rita asked, 'How many pieces come in a shipment?' Seymour replied, 'Between twenty and twenty-five thousand.' She took notes and asked more questions. Seymour liked that she was interested in every detail. He explained that the tannery is a contractor. They buy the material and make it ready for work. Seymour's grandfather and father worked in the tannery, and so did he for six months. He asked Rita if she had ever been inside a tannery. She said, 'Not yet.' Seymour offered to arrange a visit for her.

Seymour told Rita that tanning is an old industry, with remains found in Turkey from six thousand years ago. He said his father is the leather expert and could talk about gloves for days. Seymour asked Rita if she had ever seen anything being made. She said she saw her mother make a cake when she was a child. Seymour laughed. Rita reminded him of Marie, who was always eager to learn and remembered everything from school.

Seymour decided to show Rita the whole process of making gloves. He asked her, 'What size do you wear?'"

There was a place by the lake where they cut trees into wood for building. There was an old building with two floors. Around it, there were big piles of soft sawdust. The sawdust looked like golden mountains. One afternoon, Michael and his friends climbed to the roof of the building. They sat with their legs over the edge and looked at the lake. Michael said, ""I dare you to jump down,"" and he jumped onto the sawdust. He laughed and said, ""I dare you all!"" His friends were scared, but one by one, they jumped and laughed too.

Later, they went back to the roof to jump again. Everyone jumped except Michael. He was scared and stayed on the roof. His friends called him a coward and left. Michael stayed alone on the roof for a long time. The sun was setting, and he was sweating because he was nervous. Finally, he closed his eyes and jumped. He fell on the sawdust and lay there for a while. The workers had gone home, and it was quiet.

Michael felt ashamed and walked home. He was late for dinner. His stepmother was not happy and said, ""You should come home on time for dinner."" She was a kind woman, but Michael was sad. He kept thinking about his friends laughing at him."
FCE_44,"**Careers Advice**

Are you unhappy with your job? Do you want to change but don't know how? Kitty Doherty has some advice. Many people go to a careers adviser for help. You write about yourself and take some tests called 'psychometrics'. The adviser gives you a report with career suggestions and training you might need.

I tried Career Analysts, a big company for career advice. The test felt like a school exam. I was with ten people, answering questions quickly. The test had tasks like finding mistakes in lists and matching shapes. After the test, I talked to an adviser. He gave me a report with his thoughts and advice. I agreed with most of it. I was not good at science and technical tests, so I am glad I did not become a nurse. But I was happy to hear I made the right choice with journalism.

Changing your career doesn't mean a big change. Last March, Donna Laney, 25, lost her job as a marketing manager. Her friends told her to try Career Analysts. She wanted to look at her skills and interests. She found out she was good at design but decided to use her skills in a new job. Now, she works in Public Relations. Career Analysts helped her see what she wanted to do.

Some people need help to make big changes. Juliet Greene, 26, worked at a bank for six years. She was bored and wanted a new challenge. She went to Career Counselling Services. The tests showed she liked sciences. After four meetings, she decided to study geology. She is happier now.

But careers advice doesn't work for everyone. Amanda Margetts, 24, was a sales representative. She wanted new ideas but didn't like the suggestions. They needed a big pay cut or a lot of retraining. She felt a friend could give similar advice."

Patients sit on this couch while he checks their teeth. Jerome says, 'Half of the people only go to the dentist when they have pain. They are scared.' To help with this, he tries to make a place where people are not scared. He does not wear a white coat because people think it means pain. Jerome thinks going to the dentist should be relaxing and fun. This is surprising because many people think going to the dentist means pain. Jerome says, 'If people are relaxed and happy, they will forget bad experiences.' He uses virtual-reality headsets to help people relax. 'We were the first in Britain to use them, and people like them. Patients watch a film about underwater animals while I check their teeth. Then they see a video of their mouth.' Many patients like this part of the visit. The office smells nice, like oranges, not like a dentist's office. Jerome says, 'I want people to know it is different here. Smell is important. The usual dentist smell can make people scared.' The nice smell is very pleasant. Jerome is known as a fashionable dentist, but he is serious about his work. Relaxing is important, but good treatment is the most important. He uses a tool that sprays warm water to clean teeth, not scraping them. It feels strange at first, but it is not painful if you are relaxed. Five years ago, Jerome went to the United States to learn about dental techniques. 'I learned that if you make it easy for the patient, it is easy for you too,' he says. He thinks this is the start of a change in British dentistry. A patient comes in. Jerome offers him tea and asks what video he wants to watch. The patient seems to enjoy this special treatment. The office feels more like a beauty salon than a regular dentist office.'"
FCE_39,"**Chocolate: A Sweet Story**

Chocolate comes from South America. Now, it is a big business around the world. At Easter, people in Britain spend over £230 million on chocolate. They buy a lot of chocolate at this time. Only at Christmas do people eat more chocolate.

The cacao plant is very old. The Aztec, Toltec, and Mayan people in Central America grew it over 3,000 years ago. The cacao tree is a tropical plant. It grows in Africa, South and Central America, the West Indies, and South-East Asia. The fruit of this tree is big like a melon and has 20-40 seeds. When dried, these seeds become cacao beans. We use them to make chocolate. In English, they are often called cocoa beans. This is a mistake from the 17th century.

The Aztecs used cocoa beans as money. They also made a drink called xocoatl, which means 'bitter water' in their language. The drink had spices and was used for special events. The Spanish liked it with cinnamon and sugar. It took 100 years for the recipe to spread in Europe.

In the late 17th century, people in Europe started to drink chocolate in special chocolate houses. Until the last century, chocolate was a drink made from solid blocks. In 1826, CJ van Houten from the Netherlands made chocolate powder. This was by taking out most of the cocoa butter from the beans.

In 1847, Fry and Sons, a company in Bristol, made the first chocolate bar. They mixed cocoa butter, chocolate liquor, and sugar. Later, a Swiss company added milk to make milk chocolate.

In 1905, the English company Cadbury made the Dairy Milk bar. They used good advertising to make it popular. Now, people in Britain eat about four chocolate bars each week. To sell more, companies make chocolate bars into ice cream, drinks, or desserts.

Cacao farmers had problems when cocoa bean prices went down in the 1980s. Many small farmers had to stop working. Remember them when you eat your next chocolate bar."

After ten years of digging, they believe they are close to finding gold worth five million dollars. Terence, who is 68 years old and from Liverpool, says, 'We are finding some gold; we just need to dig a little more.' They started looking for gold after reading about gold in the 'Dolgellau gold belt' in Wales. They read old mining books and newspapers to find the best place to dig. They spent ten years getting permission to dig, taking earth samples, and cleaning the area. They dug a tunnel and a 10-meter hole. Now, they need more money to keep digging. They hope someone will give them PS50,000 to help. Chris says, 'It is hard to find someone to help, but we have some people to ask.' People in the area are interested in the gold search. Dolgellau is a town that needs tourists. Peter Woolven, who works at a hotel, says, 'If they find gold, more people might come here, but I hope not too many.'

Rachel Mills is a scientist. She works at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. Rachel studies the sea's chemicals. She teaches at Southampton University. When not teaching, she goes in a small underwater vehicle. It is like a small car. She dives 3 kilometers down to study underwater volcanoes.

Inside the vehicle, space is very small. Rachel can touch the two pilots. They cannot stand or move much. They stay inside until someone opens the door. A dive lasts 16 hours. It takes 3 hours to go down, 10 hours to collect rock and water, and 3 hours to come back up. If there is a problem, they can press a panic button. A small escape vessel goes quickly to the surface. No one has tested it yet.

Rachel was nervous the first time she went in the vehicle. She was with an instructor. He showed her what to do in an emergency. Now, Rachel has made six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian team. They went to a place near the Canary Islands. There are many underwater volcanoes there. The Russian team was putting equipment there to study a volcano.

When not at sea, Rachel is at her office. She loves teaching, but she also loves her research. She studies ""black smokers."" These are underwater volcanoes. Water comes out and looks like black smoke. It is very hot, 350 degrees.

Rachel was scared once. She was with an American team. There was a big explosion. She thought she would die. But nothing happened, and they were safe.

Rachel loves diving. She feels wonder when she sees the volcanoes. She studied them for three years. Seeing them for real was amazing."

'Never again,' I said, as I came home. I said the same thing the next year. And the next. I just needed to buy one train ticket, and because I was under twenty-five, I could travel anywhere in Europe for a month. Sleeping in a train corridor is different from sleeping in a bed. The train rocks you to sleep. Carrying everything in a backpack makes you travel simply. You might even burn socks that smell bad or throw away books when you finish them. This is the Inter-Rail spirit. You can forget about common sense. All you need is a ticket. This ticket lets young people travel to many countries quickly. On my first trip, my friends and I thought the ticket was just a cheap way to get to our camp in France. But we wanted to travel more because there was always another country to see. And it cost us nothing extra. We were not very interested in culture. This was our first holiday without parents. We made our own plans and only saw the easy sights. We wanted to escape the guided tour and do something different. I liked that sometimes I only saw the view from the station. We were there to have fun. We were like other Inter-Railers. We shared train floors, food, water, money, and music. The excitement of travel is seeing a place that was just a name before. It feels like the city is real when the train arrives, and you see it with your own eyes. You can only understand Europe by seeing it yourself. Everyone knows what is there, but it means nothing until you see it. This is why other people's holiday photos are boring. The train trip won't show you new things in the world, but it is a good personal experience. Europe is big, and Inter-Rail helps you see this, even if it takes time."""
FCE_37,"Text: 'It is very disappointing to arrive at an airport in another country and find out that your bags are not there. You might have to wear the same clothes for a long time until the airline finds your bags. Sometimes, you might be in a place with a different climate and have the wrong clothes. Airlines do not often say how many bags they lose, but it happens. Even the best airlines make mistakes, and they cannot promise that your bags will always be on the same flight as you, especially if you have to change planes. 

Airlines ask you to check in early so there is enough time for your bags to go through the airport and onto the plane. The time needed to change planes is also longer to help with bag transfers. Usually, this system works well. But extra security checks and air traffic problems can delay flights and cause the baggage system to fail. Sometimes, human error or a torn label can also cause problems. These issues are worse at big airports, called 'hubs', because they handle many bags. For example, last year, London's Heathrow airport had over 41 million passengers, and nine million of them changed planes. Even good airports like Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Singapore, and Zurich have bad days. 

The chance of losing bags is higher at some airports. In the United States, Miami airport is known for losing bags when passengers connect to flights to Latin America. To avoid losing your bags, choose direct flights if you can and check in early. If you must change planes, try to use the same airline and allow more time between flights. Label your bags inside and out with your home and holiday addresses and include flight numbers. If your bags still go missing, talk to the airline staff in the baggage area and fill out a property irregularity report (PIR) before leaving the airport.'"

Charlie James is a wildlife photographer. He knows a lot about the kingfisher. This bird is blue and green. It lives near streams and rivers and eats fish. 

Old trees hang over the stream. The water is shallow. The colours are soft greens, browns, and yellows. The kingfisher flies fast and straight. It is like a flash of light. You see it for a second, but you remember it.

Charlie loved kingfishers when he was young. He does not know why he loves them so much. There are many stories about kingfishers. One story says a kingfisher flew high and got the blue of the sky on its back. Its belly got burnt by the sun. 

Kingfishers have no blue colour in their feathers. The feathers reflect light and look blue. Sometimes they look green when the light changes.

Charlie likes to watch kingfishers. They are shy, but you can see them from a hideout. His first hideout was an old blanket. He waited near a kingfisher's spot. The bird came back and sat close to him. It took him four years to take a good picture.

Charlie spent a lot of time by the stream. He missed school to watch the birds. He did not do well in school. But people noticed his interest in kingfishers. At 16, he worked for a nature magazine. Later, he became a wildlife film cameraman.

Charlie wants to make a film about kingfishers. He wants to show beautiful images without words. He loves the colours of the kingfisher's wings. His photos show his feelings, but there is more to his love for kingfishers than his work can show.'"

The park is good for young children, so our three-year-old had fun. The kids loved the Crocodile Ride and the Giant Wheel. There is a special dodgems ride for very young kids, which was great. For older children, there are scarier rides, like Splash Out, where you jump in a pool! After five hours, Steve and I were tired, but the children wanted to stay. The park is clean and safe, but the scenery is not very nice. The staff are very helpful. Wonderland - The McMillan family We never went to a theme park before, so we didn't know what to expect. We thought Oscar might be too young, but he loved it. He liked the Mountain Train and Little Land, with small famous buildings. The older children liked the ferris wheel and driving toy cars. We stayed for six hours and liked the places to rest. The park is beautiful and the staff are friendly. There is something for everyone, even adults. Adventure World - The Jeffree family After seven hours, we still had more to see. The children loved the Big Top Circus with a trapeze act. We went on the Terror Line, and the girls were scared but liked it. Their favorite ride was Running River, where you think you will get wet, but you don't. Toy Land is fun for younger children. The children saw the new ride, Fear Factor, but they were too small for it. The park is clean, and the staff are great. On one ride, a staff member helped us by sitting with one of the girls. The Great Park - The Langridge family We arrived at one o'clock and were sad the park closed at 5 p.m. This park is good for younger children because the rides are not too scary. I am scared easily, but I had fun. We loved Exotic Travels, a boat ride that starts slow and then is very fun. We waited for Lightning River for half an hour, and it was over fast! I didn't go on the Big Leap, but it looked fun. If the children were older, they might find it boring, but they loved it. Fantasy World - The Break-all family The park says there is 'No Limit to the Fun', and we agree. Europe's tallest roller-coaster, the Rocket, is very scary. Ben thought it was the scariest ride, but Jennie thought the Hanger, where you hang upside-down, was worse! There are many rides, and the older children went on them many times.

Gill Page visits the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales and talks to Gareth Roberts, who works for the Trust. Gareth is a warden. He says a warden needs common sense and must be good with people. Gareth talks to farmers, visitors, and builders. Gareth grew up on the Lleyn Peninsula and worked on his family's farm. Many people wanted the warden job, but Gareth got it because he knows the area well and has farming experience. He still helps on his parents' farm, so he understands farmers' problems. Gareth's farm work helps him do his job, like building fences and planting trees. Gareth has learned more about nature. He remembers collecting flowers and bird nests as a child. He now sees how farming has changed the countryside. Farmers were just following government rules. At first, farmers and nature lovers did not agree. Now, they talk and understand each other better. Gareth's job is to make sure work is done well and cheaply. He likes finishing projects, but he also spends time on paperwork. Gareth loves his job, even though he is always working. He likes talking to people, but some visitors are rude. They act like they own the place. Gareth says common sense is important. If you like being outside and have common sense, you might want to be a warden like Gareth. But there might not be a job on the Lleyn Peninsula for a long time!'"

The game is faster now. 'We train to win,' she said. 'But after the game, we are friendly.' Netball uses science for fitness. 'We must think and train like top players,' Kendra said. 'As captain, I must be strong and help my team.' Kendra planned her netball career carefully. She decided this will be her last competition. She might coach young players later. But now, she is focused on her last big event. At the opening ceremony, she might have a tear in her eye.'"
FCE_50,"**Specialist Music Schools**

What can you do if your child is very good at music? It can be hard to know how to help them. Some parents do not see their child's talent until the child becomes upset or difficult. Regular schools are good for children who are smart in subjects like math or English. But children who are very good at music need special help. Regular schools may not have this help, especially if music is not important there.

Specialist music schools can help these children. In Britain, there are five music schools. These schools are for children aged seven to eighteen. They help children become better at music with the help of professional musicians. Children at these schools spend a lot of time on music. They have lessons, play in groups, and learn about music theory. They also practice a lot. The rest of the time, they study important subjects like English and math.

These schools are private, and classes are small. Most children live at the school. This means they spend a lot of time with other children who love music too.

There are some problems. The schools are expensive, but they try to help parents with scholarships. Also, not all parents want their children to live away from home at a young age. Some school directors think it might not be good for very young children to be in such a strict environment. They want to make sure children grow up happy and balanced.

Being in a music school can be stressful. Some children lose interest in music as they grow older. The pressure to be the best can make them feel like they failed. But the schools watch the children closely and help them if needed.

Some children are also very smart in other subjects. They might feel unhappy if they cannot study these subjects enough. For these children, it might be better to wait until they are older to decide about a music school. They can also go to a regular school with a good music program or take music lessons on weekends at a music college. But this is hard for families who do not live near big cities."

The garden looks nice because the people who lived there before liked gardening. They left plants that Susan likes. Susan also has a gardener named Danny. She says, ""It was really his garden."" They work well together. At first, Danny did not like some of Susan's ideas, but he understood when she said she wanted to paint them.

Susan likes to paint one flower at a time. She picks a flower and takes it to her studio. She paints it for a few days. Then she picks another flower and paints it. Sometimes, it takes her a long time to finish a painting. Spring and early summer are busy times for her because many flowers bloom then. She likes to watch how flowers change. For example, tulips change shape when they are in water.

Susan has always liked plants. She studied plants in school. She used to collect wild flowers. She did not like garden flowers before. She thought they looked fake. Now, her garden has plants from other countries. They grow well in her garden. Susan lets the garden grow freely. She is busy with two art shows, so she does not have much time for the garden. She has another gardener to help. But she knows she must work in the garden to stay connected to her flowers."

There is a train from Cannes that goes along the coast to Italy. You can see beautiful sea views. It is always nice, no matter the weather or time of year. You can also see lovely gardens and houses. The people on the train are fun because there are tourists and locals. They all enjoy the beautiful trip. Raj Patel - Explorer I have taken many train trips, but my favorite is the Nile Valley Express in Sudan. When I was young in South Africa, I missed a family train trip to the Kruger National Park. I was too young and stayed with my aunt. When I moved to England, I had not been on a train. London Waterloo was the first big station I saw, and it amazed me. Betty Cooper - Novelist I love one train: the Blue Train. My husband and I took it on our honeymoon across France to a boat to Egypt. On the train, my husband gave me a pink dress. I loved it. Someone said pink is good for the brain, and I wear it a lot now. The trip was lovely, going through France and then by boat on the Nile. It was perfect after the wedding. Martin Brown - Journalist We were writing articles on a world trip and had to cross a desert in Africa. There was no road, so we took the Desert Express train. The schedule was not fixed. The driver waited for people to arrive. When the train came, many people got on, even on the roof for free. At night, the train went through beautiful places. It was like a dream. Arisu Mezuki - Actress Most people like trains from when they are kids, but not me. I grew up in Singapore and Cyprus and saw few trains. As a teenager, I made a film with a railway in Yorkshire.

FCE_8,"Text: 'Do you want to get your story published? Our expert, Margaret Stubbs, can help you. Many people ask, 'I have written a story or book. Who should I send it to?' First, you need to learn about publishers and practice writing. To sell your writing, you need to know about the 'writing world'. No matter what you write, you should know the market you want to reach. The best way to learn is by reading a lot. Visit your local library, bookshops, and newsagents. Reading will show you what publishers want. Remember, things change. New magazines come out, and editors change jobs. Publishers always want new writers, so give them what they want. If you want to write short love stories, find out which magazines publish them. Get recent copies and see what kind of stories they like. Know who the readers are because the editor wants to please them. Writers often ask me, 'My story was rejected three times. Am I wasting my time?' I never discourage anyone, but the work might not be ready to publish. Many new writers send their work too soon. If you have only written one story, it is not likely to be published. Success usually comes after years in publishing or journalism. When you send your work, keep writing more stories. Each story will be better, and you will feel more like a writer. Don't throw any stories away; improve them. I suggest not showing your work to others at first. Remember, every successful writer has faced rejection. Do everything you can to become a writer. Look for a creative writing course or join a local writers' group. Think of yourself as a writer and practice writing every day if you can.'"

A man with grey hair was talking to strangers. He looked rich: tanned skin, nice sweater, and a soft coat. He asked a woman sitting alone a question. Then he talked to a girl near me. She had long blond hair. I thought I might like to talk to her too. The man asked, 'Are you going to Philadelphia?' 'Well, I am going north,' she said. 'But to Philadelphia?' 'No, New York, but I'll be ...' 'Thanks, anyway,' he said, and moved on. Now I was interested. 'Ma'am,' he asked an old lady, 'are you going to Philadelphia?' She said, 'Wilmington,' and he walked away to another couple. I stood up and moved closer, looking at the train platform. I was going to Philadelphia. He could have asked me. But I knew why he didn't. I looked unreliable. He glanced at me and walked away. He looked worried. 'Please!' he said to a woman reading a book. 'Are you going to Philadelphia?' She put down her book. She was about thirty-five, older than me. She looked like a teacher. 'Philadelphia?' she said. 'Yes, I am.' 'Can I ask you a favor?' I stopped and looked at my wrist. (I don't have a watch.) I could tell she was careful. The man noticed too and said, 'It's not hard, I promise!' They announced my train. People moved to Gate E, pulling their bags. I heard the man talking. 'My daughter is flying today for a study year abroad, from Philadelphia. I put her on a train this morning. Then I went home and found my wife upset. My daughter forgot her passport. She called from the station in Philadelphia; she didn't know what to do.' The woman made a sympathetic sound. I would have stayed quiet. 'I told her to stay there. I would find someone to take her passport.' Why didn't he go himself if it was so important? 'Why don't you go yourself?' the woman asked. 'I can't leave my wife alone. She's in a wheelchair.'

My son, Gary, got his chance with cooking, and my chance was to run a restaurant. When I found the restaurant, it was in bad shape, but it was perfect for me. This business made me remember my childhood. My mother worked in a factory, and I was sad because I was alone. So, I wanted time for family. My wife took care of the children and did my accounts, while I ran the restaurant. We lived above the restaurant, and we always ate meals together. This was good for our children, Gary and Joe. They are both very confident. From a young age, they talked to our customers. This helped them a lot. Gary was a lively child. When he was seven, he jumped into a bath like a swimming pool and hurt himself. When he was older, he worked for pocket money. He did small jobs and by ten, he was in the kitchen every weekend.

But if you are new, like Jo, you don't know anyone. Jo had just arrived in Dublin, so she stayed in a hostel and looked for a flat. Dublin was a big unknown place for Jo. She felt like she was going somewhere new when she took the train to work there. Everyone at her school thought she would leave her small town. Some of her classmates went to towns like Ennis or Limerick. But Jo was the only one going to Dublin. Jo's mother thought it was good for her to stay in the hostel because it was safe. Her father hoped the hostel was warm. Jo's sisters, who worked as waitresses, thought she was crazy to stay in a hostel for a week. Jo didn't know they were talking about her as she answered an ad for a flat in Ringsend. The ad said, 'Own room, own TV, share kitchen, bathroom.' It was close to the post office where she worked. Jo hoped it was nice and not too expensive. There was no line for this flat because it was more like 'Third Girl Wanted.' The 'own TV' part made Jo think it might be too fancy, but the house looked normal. It was a red-brick house with a basement, but the flat was upstairs. A girl with a college scarf was leaving and said, 'Desperate place. They're both awful.' Jo kept going up. 'Hello,' said a girl with 'Nessa' on her T-shirt. 'Did you see that girl leaving?

Mark Simmonds talks about how dolphins are in danger. Dolphins are special to us. They are very smart and can feel human emotions. They make us think of freedom in the sea. TV shows like Flipper and Seaquest make us love them more. But these shows do not show the real problems dolphins face. The seas are dirty and have too many fishers. One type of dolphin, the North Sea harbour porpoise, has lost many of its kind. You might think dolphins are safe and protected, but they are not. There are 40 kinds of dolphins in the world. In northern Europe, we see striped, common, bottlenose dolphins, and harbour porpoises. Striped and common dolphins live far in the sea. We do not know much about them. Bottlenose dolphins and harbour porpoises used to be near European coasts. Now, they are only in a few places in Scotland and Wales. They have skin injuries, which show they are stressed. It is hard to know why there are fewer dolphins. Overfishing is a big problem. Fish are disappearing, and dolphins cannot find food. Dolphins can also get caught in fishing nets. Many dead dolphins have been found on beaches in France and Cornwall. They had marks from nets. Pollution is another problem. Waste in the sea can make dolphins sick. Pesticides can build up in their bodies. A young dolphin died from its mother's milk because of this. Noise is also a problem for dolphins. They live in groups and use sound to understand their world. Noise from ships and oil wells can disturb them. We do not know how much this affects them.'"

Exercise makes your muscles strong and changes your body shape. It helps you stand or sit correctly. It also helps your heart and lungs work better. Exercise can make you feel less sad and tired. It helps you sleep well and feel less stressed. Exercise can also help with some health problems. There are many types of exercise like jogging, aerobics, and lifting weights. But be careful not to train too hard, as it can cause injury. Start slowly and ask your doctor if you are unsure. Good posture is important too. Stand tall and imagine a balloon pulling your head up. This helps you breathe better and look slimmer. Stretching your muscles makes you more flexible and helps prevent injuries. Stretching should be part of your exercise routine. Do it four or five times a week. A good exercise routine includes a warm-up, stretching, a workout, and a cool down.'"

First impressions are important. People decide what they think about us in the first few minutes. They look at how we dress, our eye contact, our body movement, and how we talk. Mary Pearce wanted to be a teacher. She says, ""I worked hard for my degree. When I graduated, I was confident."" She applied for a job at a primary school and got an interview. ""I saw a small hole in my jacket that morning,"" she remembers. ""I wanted to change, but I didn't want to be late. Being on time is important."" Mary did not get the job. Her friend at the school said the Head Teacher thought, ""If she doesn't care about her image at an interview, what kind of teacher will she be?""

Simon Grant, a hotel manager, says, ""People who look like they care about themselves are more likely to care about their jobs. In an interview, you should look your best."" Many people forget to look professional. Janet Goodwood worked for ten years as an assistant. She wanted a promotion but did not get an interview. She asked why and was told she did not look like a manager. She was surprised. ""I do a good job. How I dress should not matter.""

How we move and our gestures also matter. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian found that 7% of our message is words, 38% is voice, and 55% is facial expressions. If our face and words say different things, people believe the face. Make sure your words and body language match. Do not look too desperate for the job. Sheila Rice, a marketing specialist, got a job offer right away. ""I was happy,"" she says. ""But I showed too much excitement. The boss knew I would not say no, so he offered me less money.""

What we say and how we say it is important. David Artesio, a manager, says to learn about the company before the interview. ""Talk about something that interests you. This shows you care about the company."" Marian Woodall, a business consultant, says to have questions ready and speak clearly. ""Good communicators use short sentences,"" she says."

I can't buy all these things. I feel bad if I say yes, and I feel bad if I say no. I try not to take them shopping, but then I worry they won't learn how to choose things.' Research shows that children ask to buy something every two minutes in a supermarket. A lot of money is spent on ads for children, mostly on TV. These ads make children want to buy things. Parents find it hard to explain why they can't buy everything. Ads make things look very nice, and children don't understand why they can't have them. Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says, 'Parents care about what their children eat, but ads give children a one-sided view.' TV ads can't tell children to ask their parents to buy things, but they still make children want to buy them. Shopping with children can be stressful for parents. They have to decide what to buy and what not to buy. One mother says she talks to her children about food and ads. Her son listens to ads but is critical of them. They talk about products and look at labels. Now, her children don't ask for things she doesn't want to buy. Parents also say they are not always fair. Mike, a father, says, 'We say no to sweets for our son because they are bad for him, but we buy chocolate for ourselves. It's nice to buy good things, and children want that too. But I still get annoyed when they ask for things. It depends on how I feel. If I'm happy, I might say yes. It's hard to always say the same thing.' Supermarkets can help by not putting sweets near the checkout or by having play areas for children. Parents might buy less, but they would enjoy shopping more without their children's demands.'"

The General Manager, Peter MacCann, wants his staff to know guests by name. For other details, he uses a computer system. This system helps give special service to guests who come back. It cost a lot of money, but MacCann says it will be worth it. For example, if a guest likes certain music, the hotel will have it ready for their next visit.

Guests often complain about room temperature. At the Merrion, guests can change the temperature a little in their rooms. The front desk can also change it more if needed.

Business guests will like the technology in the rooms. Each room has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine, and video-conferencing. The hotel is ready for future technology changes. TVs and DVD players can be updated easily.

Even with all this technology, the rooms are comfortable and welcoming. The hotel has 145 large rooms, a swimming pool, gym, conference rooms, bars, restaurants, and a garden.

The food at the hotel is excellent. Chef Patrick Guilbaud, who has two Michelin stars, moved his restaurant to the Merrion. This is good for both him and the hotel. He has a new kitchen and better parking. The hotel offers a great place to eat without financial risk.

With technology and a great staff, the Merrion Hotel is ready to succeed."

I like doing new and challenging things. Learning new things gives me energy. I am learning flamenco dancing now. Dance is fun and gives me energy. If you are bored, you can feel tired. Doing something useful gives you energy.' B. Linda Kelsey Magazine editor: 'I have a lot of work, but I enjoy it. I like being at work. If you like something, it doesn't make you feel bad, even if you are tired. I need a lot of sleep. When I sleep well, I feel good. I know exercise gives me energy, but it's hard to start. I do yoga once a week and try to exercise at home. After exercise, I feel happy. I feel tired in the office in the afternoon, so I eat something then.' C. Annie Nightingale Disc jockey: 'I don't eat healthy food for energy. I think being happy and positive gives me energy. I don't like negative people. I think we should enjoy life. I like my job. The last two years were exciting. I work with young people, and they give me energy. I like taking photos and writing songs for fun. It helps me relax when I travel.' D. Floella Benjamin Author and children's TV presenter: 'My energy comes from things I like. I believe in my work and my family. Being positive helps. I love working with kids. They have a lot of energy. Smiling at people gives you energy. I try to eat healthy and don't smoke or drink. I don't have an exercise plan. I play with kids for exercise.' E. Deborah Moggach Author and playwright: 'I love making a garden from nothing. I did it once. The garden was concrete, and I changed it to soil. It was better than exercise. I get energy when people read my writing. I like walking in nature. If someone sees me, I say I didn't know it was private. It's fun and feels like being a child.' F. Katherine Monblot Therapist: 'You must like and respect what you do. I like taking risks and get bored fast. Doing things you don't like makes you tired. I used to be on committees, but they took my time. You have limited energy, so use it for important things.'"
FCE_45,"**ICE SKATING**

Ice skating is very old. People have skated for thousands of years. Long ago, people used skates made from animal bones. Later, around 200 AD, people in Scandinavia started using iron skates. In Scandinavia, rich people thought skating was important. 

In the early 1900s, skating was calm and stylish. But in 1924, at the Winter Olympics, an 11-year-old girl named Sonja Henie made skating more athletic. This made skating more popular. Today, skating is both beautiful and hard work.

When you start skating, balance and control are important. You get faster as you get better. To balance, keep your legs slightly bent and lean a little forward. Relaxing is very important in skating. 

To start, your heels should almost touch, and your feet should point outwards. Push forward with one foot and make a small move with the other foot. It is not too hard. As you practice, you can make bigger movements.

Learning how to fall is important. Even the best skaters fall. To fall safely, stay relaxed. This helps you not get hurt. To get up, use your hands to kneel, then stand.

Once you can skate well, you can try different styles like figure skating, freestyle, or speed skating. It is best to learn figure skating first. Most ice rinks have teachers to help you learn. 

Good skaters look relaxed and move easily. To be like them, do exercises often. Warm up your legs, back, shoulders, ankles, and knees before skating. After skating, do the same exercises to avoid stiffness.

Skating helps with balance, coordination, and relaxation. It is good for your heart and lungs and makes your body strong. Skating with swimming or jogging is great for health and fitness."

The teacher joked, 'Do you want to be the flagpole on a ship?' because Chris was already almost two meters tall. Now, Chris is 228 cm tall and is the tallest man in Britain. 

Every ten years, people in Europe get one centimeter taller. More tall people are born each year. This does not mean we are becoming a super race. We are becoming like our ancestors from 40,000 years ago. Back then, people ate many different foods. Women collected herbs, fruits, and berries, and men hunted animals. They ate 85 different wild plants. 

About 9,000 years ago, farming started. This changed everything. Farmers grew wheat, rice, and maize. These three plants now give us more than half of our food. This diet was not good for us. People became less healthy. In Ohio, scientists found that when people started farming corn, they became sick and underweight. 

Farming spread because it could feed more people. But many people were not well-fed. Only recently have diets improved in Europe, the US, and Japan. Now, the average man in the US is 179 cm tall, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm. 

This is good, but there are problems. Beds are still 190 cm long, and there is less leg-room in planes and trains. Clothes makers have to change their sizes. We cannot grow forever. Scientists think we might reach 193 cm this century. 

But, as a species, we are actually getting smaller. During the last ice age, people were bigger to stay warm. Now, as the planet gets warmer, we might get smaller again. Global warming could make us shrink."""
FCE_57,"Text: 'Studio Audiences What is it like to be in the audience when a TV show is made? Cosmo Landesman found out. Studio audiences are a normal part of TV, but many people don't know much about them. We see them happy on game shows and wonder - who are these people? Some people think studio audiences are not very important. Even people who work in TV sometimes don't respect them. I thought studio audiences were just people who wanted to be on TV for a short time. But there is no typical studio audience. They come from all kinds of backgrounds. TV tries to get different people for different shows. Some people like to watch TV at home and don't understand why others go to a studio. Why do people get tickets, travel far, and sit for hours in a studio to watch something they can see at home? One idea is that people want to be on TV for a moment. I didn't believe this until I talked to Angela. She came because she wanted to be on TV. Another idea is that people are curious to see behind the scenes. But many people say they came because a friend gave them a ticket. Not many of us have been in a studio audience, but we think we know what it's like. You sit with strangers, and someone shows signs that say APPLAUD or LAUGH, and you clap or laugh. This is true for some shows, but not all. A studio manager says, 'We hope a show is good enough not to need these signs.' Is there a difference between being in a studio and watching TV at home? Claire thinks sitting in a studio is 'more exciting', and Charlotte likes being part of live TV. 'Last year I saw my favorite comedian. At home, you miss a lot.' I missed seeing live actors because I could only see the back of someone's head. The first scenes were so far away that I watched on a studio screen. Going to a studio might not be the best way to watch TV, but that's not the point. For most people, it was fun and a free night out.'"

Bruce
I like places with people. I don't like empty places. When I travel, I like villages with old buildings. When I was eight, I went to school in England. On Saturdays, I rode my bike to a village called Lastingham. I liked the hills and valleys. I am from Scotland, so the place felt familiar. I wrote about my adventures in a diary. This was my first travel writing.

Sophia
There is a small train from Hythe to Dungeness. I like to travel first class. The view is simple, with fields and sheep. The train goes through gardens. I like to see people doing everyday things, like making tea. The simple landscape makes me look closely.

Matthew
The Hartland Peninsula is a quiet and beautiful coast. The beaches have rocks and are hard to reach. Few people come here. Some people surf, but most enjoy the sea view. There are walks by the coast and in valleys with trees and flowers. We stay in a small house in a village called Southole.

Annette
My favourite place in England is the Trough of Bowland. It is good for hiking. Not many people live or visit there. I found it when I was a student. I visit every year with my family. It has not changed much. I like the space and quiet.

James
I bought my favourite house, Glenthorne, in England. I wanted peace and to feel at home. I grew up in Sri Lanka but went to school in Devon, England. I used to ride my bike around. We had a story about Glenthorne: if you went there, you would not come back. It is a quiet and special house. You can only hear the sea, wind, and birds.'"

We love animals and have many at home. One day, my daughter called me at work. She found a pine snake and asked, ""Can we keep him?"" I said, ""Yes, but only for one night."" We have a special tank for animals we find. 

I came home late and started cooking. Suddenly, I heard my children shouting, ""Oh, Mother! Help!"" I ran to their room. Our cat, Domino, had caught Bianca, a white mouse. Domino ran around the room with the mouse in his mouth. I tried to catch Domino but tripped and fell. 

Then, I saw the snake escaping from its tank. The room was full of noise: the cat, the mouse, the kids, and our dog barking. I turned off the stove and caught Domino. I saved the mouse, which was not hurt. This mouse was caught by Domino three more times but lived a long life.

Next, I had to catch the snake. I sat on the floor and waited. Slowly, the snake calmed down. I picked it up and took it to the garden. I wanted it to go to a tree, but the snake wrapped around my shoulders. My eldest child, DJ, said, ""Mum, you're warm, and the shed isn't."" 

The children helped move the snake to the tree. It climbed up and disappeared over the roof. As the last part of the snake vanished, my three-year-old, Clay, said, ""Boy, that was one big snake!"""

It is exciting to see a letter arrive, to see who sent it, and to read it. I have written letters all my life. I started with small notes to my mother. She always told me to write thank-you letters for Christmas and birthday gifts. It didn't matter if they were short or messy, as long as they were letters. When I left home at 18 to study in London, I wrote a letter every week to my mother, and she wrote back. Sometimes my father wrote too, and his letters were funny and long. The letters from home talked about everyday things. We also made phone calls, but I remember the letters more. I also got letters from boyfriends. Many of them were far away, so we wrote letters to stay in touch. Writing letters made our relationships better. I could say things in writing that were hard to say in person. I love letters that come with birthday or Christmas cards. Notes are nice, but a long letter with news is better! I get letters from Mangala in Sri Lanka, a friend I trained with 20 years ago. I have a penfriend in Australia and another in Vancouver. I also write to a lady in France. We met in a restaurant, and my husband took her photo. I asked for her address, and she wrote back. Now we write to each other often. I practice my French, and we have visited each other. My biggest letter-writing success was this summer. My family and I visited my American penfriend in Texas. We wrote letters for 29 years but never met. People were surprised our letters lasted so long. The local newspaper even wrote about it. I am happy my children write letters too. Like my mother, I tell them to write thank-you letters. My daughter writes me little letters, just like I did. She and my son have penfriends in Texas, thanks to my penfriend. I hope people keep writing letters and do not let it disappear.'"
FCE_54,"**Title: Tourists Damage Ancient Rock Art in France**

In the French Alps, there are very old pictures on rocks. These pictures are 4,000 years old and show cows, fields, and gods. The place is called Mont Bego. It was once a place for prayer. 

Many people visit Mont Bego. But some visitors are not careful. They write on the rocks and damage the pictures. Some people even take pieces of the rock home. Others rub the pictures to see them better. This is bad for the pictures.

Jean Clottes is an expert on rock art. He says if the damage continues, the pictures will be gone in 50 years. 

Experts have different ideas on how to protect the pictures. Henry de Lumley thinks the mountain should be closed to visitors. Only guided tours should be allowed. But Jean Clottes and David Lavergne do not agree. They want people to see the pictures. But they say it is hard to stop the damage because the area is big and there is not enough money for guards.

Annie Echassoux is worried because more tourists can now reach the mountain easily. She thinks the area should be closed off with ropes and guides should help visitors. She says money must be found to protect the pictures for future generations."
FCE_32,"Text: 'Shopping with Children Shopping with children can be very hard. One mother says, 'They want everything they see. They ask for sweet cereals, Disney videos, and comics. I can't buy all these things. I feel bad if I say yes, and I feel bad if I say no. I try not to take them shopping, but then I worry they won't learn how to choose things.' Research shows that children ask to buy something every two minutes in a supermarket. A lot of money is spent on ads for children, mostly on TV. These ads make children want to buy things. Parents find it hard to explain why they can't buy everything. Ads make things look very nice, and children don't understand why they can't have them. Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says, 'Parents care about what their children eat, but ads give children a one-sided view.' TV ads can't tell children to ask their parents to buy things, but they still make children want to buy them. Shopping with children can be stressful for parents. They have to decide what to buy and what not to buy. One mother says she talks to her children about food and ads. Her son listens to ads but is critical of them. They talk about products and look at labels. Now, her children don't ask for things she doesn't want to buy. Parents also say they are not always fair. Mike, a father, says, 'We say no to sweets for our son because they are bad for him, but we buy chocolate for ourselves. It's nice to buy good things, and children want that too. But I still get annoyed when they ask for things. It depends on how I feel. If I'm happy, I might say yes. It's hard to be fair all the time.' Supermarkets could help by not putting sweets near the checkout or by having play areas for children. Parents might buy less, but they would enjoy shopping more without their children's demands.'"

At the World Cup Climbing Championships in Birmingham, a French climber named Francois Lombard is climbing on a wall. He is hanging upside down by two fingers. The National Indoor Arena, where the event is happening, is also known for the TV show Gladiators. Both events have a wall. This is possible because of new technology. Before the 1960s, climbers practiced on cliffs. In winter, they climbed in cold places like Scotland. To stay fit, they used brick or stone buildings to practice. Later, sports centers started building special climbing walls. Don Robinson, a teacher, made a climbing wall at Leeds University in the 1960s. He used natural rock in concrete blocks. Many walls like this were built in the 1970s, but they had problems. They were only vertical, unlike real cliffs with different shapes. In 1985, Francois Savigny from France made a new material for climbing holds. These could be changed on the wall. French companies also made panels with steel frames. These were lighter and could be moved. Climbers could have new holds all the time.'"

Some friends might say you are crazy, but others might not. Everyone will give different advice. It is your choice, and you must be responsible for it. There are no easy ways to become an actor. There are no exams to pass, and no guarantee you will get a job after training. You need luck and talent. There is a need for new actors, and acting can be exciting and glamorous. Sometimes, it can also be rewarding. Talent is a natural skill and imagination. It is also about courage and belief in what you do. Why do people want to act? It is hard to say. In the theatre, the important thing is the connection between the actor and the audience. This connection is what makes actors want to act. If you ask actors how they succeed, they might not know. They know about their skills and others' skills, but they do not take success for granted. They know they are only as good as their current job. Disappointment is a big problem for actors. Last month, you might have been out of work. Then, you get an audition, but you might not get the job. Actors do not like to talk about their chances. They find ways to handle the stress of auditions and rejection. Nobody likes being rejected. From the start, you must be ready for rejection. You must show you are available, willing, and talented.

They moved to New Mexico but kept playing the game. Visitors were curious because the game was not known in southern USA. Three years ago, Dave made a new pichenotte board because the old one was broken. A relative and a friend wanted one too. The brothers took the game to a bar in Santa Fe. At first, people did not want to play, but then they enjoyed it. Dave found out that the game is like one from India called 'carroms'. It became 'squails' in Britain and then 'pichenotte' in Quebec. Pichenotte is a game for two to four people. Each player has 12 pieces or 'pucks'. They flick the pucks with their finger. Getting a puck in a small hole is 20 points. There are rings worth 15, 10, and 5 points. The game lasts two minutes. The brothers made more boards and sold them at markets. The game became popular, and they started a championship with a trophy called the 'Lord Pichenotte Cup'. The boards sold quickly, so the brothers started a business.

When you come to the Model Village, it is hard to believe that a few years ago, this place was just empty land with lots of bushes. People thought it was useless land. But one man, with help from his wife, worked hard to make it beautiful. They moved a lot of soil to change the flat land into the nice shapes you see now. Machines helped, but there was also a lot of hard work. They put new soil on top to make grass, flowers, and rocks.

Many trees and plants were put in the village. They had to choose plants that can live near the sea and in strong winter winds. Most plants came from nearby, but some came from far places like Canada and New Zealand.

Colin Sims thought of the Model Village. He made over 100 models in nine years, starting in 1972. The models are made from stone, concrete, wood, and plastic to last in all weather. Colin learned from experts about how to use these materials, and soon he became an expert too.

The models are all the same size compared to real life, and they have lots of details. The Model Village is very popular because it is well made and looked after. The way Colin made the models is now used in other model villages in England and taught in some schools.

The buildings in the village show traditional British styles. One of the best is the Manor House, which looks like a 13th-century building with stone walls and a brick tower. You will also see a Castle, St Mary's Church, a zoo, and a mini golf course.

Please stay on the paths and do not touch the models. Taking photos is okay from the paths. Dogs can come if they are on a short lead. Some models have buttons you can press to make them move.

At the end of your visit, we would like to hear your thoughts. We are always planning new models and want to know which ones you like or think need fixing. We hope you enjoy your visit and come back again. Please tell your friends about the Model Village."

Sometimes, pop stars pose for photographers, but this is not common. Usually, these pictures hurt famous people because they show private moments. Few people ask the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) for help. The PCC is an organization that helps with these problems. These pictures are rarely important for the public. Do pictures of pop stars help catch criminals? How did a picture of a famous actress on a hotel balcony help public safety? The actress was upset about these pictures before. She was in a hotel, a place where she should have privacy, so she could complain, but she did not. The PCC did not investigate, which is surprising. They should also look into a story about a pop star's love life. The pop star did not complain either. Shouldn't the PCC do something about these problems? At first, this seems like a good idea. It would stop newspapers from publishing such pictures. Photographers would also stop taking these pictures because it would not be worth it. If the PCC acted like a 'police officer', there would be problems. How would they decide to investigate? Should they ask the person to complain? If the person does not want to, should they still investigate? Also, famous people might expect every story about them to be investigated and be upset if it is not. The job is too big. How can the PCC watch all newspapers and magazines in Britain? There is also the problem of embarrassment. Even if someone's privacy is invaded, do they want more attention from an investigation? Most people just want to forget and move on. Some might have other reasons to stay quiet. They might have a worse story they want to keep secret. Even the PCC might become a problem.

You can travel, do temporary work, and then find your second job. Future employers will be happy to see you have traveled and are ready to work. Juliette Davidson worked for three lawyers after leaving college. It was a good first job. She learned office work and improved her skills. But there was no chance to move up. So, she left, traveled for a year, and now works as a Personal Assistant to Brenda Cleverdon, the Chief Executive of Business in the Community. Juliette says, 'In two and a half years, I have learned a lot and my job has grown.' Her job title is the same, but her duties have changed. She now does more important work like handling correspondence and budgets. She also deals with different questions from company leaders to people starting a business. Brenda gives her projects and events to organize.'"

A Jenny When I left school, I was very shy. I thought I would always be shy. At twenty-five, I helped at my daughter's school. I was scared, but I did well. Someone said I should go to university. I was nervous on my first day, but my confidence grew. Working at the school changed my life. B Michaela Four years ago, my father got sick, and I took over the family business. I was scared and acted too strong. I learned that to be confident, you must believe in yourself. If work is too hard, I save some tasks for the next day. When things are difficult, I tell myself I have nothing to lose. Fear makes you less confident, so I talk to myself to forget my fears. C Lisa People think I am confident, but when I look calm, I am scared. I learned to look confident because it is important for TV. Interviewing people showed me that everyone gets nervous. My mother told me, 'Who's looking at you? Everyone worries about themselves.' I remember this. You gain confidence by doing things that scare you. I was nervous for my driving test, but I passed. After that, I felt less scared. D Barbara My confidence comes from enjoying my work. I built it over the years. If you learn from mistakes, you are more confident next time. I work hard and am liked at the restaurant, but not everyone likes me. I don't let it bother me. You must like yourself. My company has training courses that help my confidence. They also help us set small goals. It helps to see you achieve something. E Kim After college, I worked as a secretary. I was scared to speak in meetings. I started to speak up. In politics, I was scared to speak in public. I told myself, 'People do this every day, so you can too.' I wrote notes to help me. Everyone is a little scared to speak in public. The secret is to tell yourself, 'Nothing is impossible.''"

'You can keep it,' he said, 'it's a tradition - if the line breaks, you keep the kite ... and I have many more.' He showed me a pile of beautiful kites at his feet. All were 120cm wide and long, made of paper and bamboo. We sat next to them under the trees behind the Beach of the Seven Lagoons in Kelantan, Malaysia. We watched the big kite festival. In the middle of the beach, there were 10 platforms. Helpers held the kites, and people waited to fly them. When the whistle blew, the kites went up like rockets. More than 500 men and boys joined the competition, which lasts five days every year. Each person had four kites. They were judged on decoration, how well they flew, and how stable they were. 'Flying kites is easy,' said Adnan, 'but making them is hard. Come to my house, and I'll show you.' I accepted his invitation. At his house, I drank cold tea and ate fish crackers. As it got dark, he asked me to come back the next day to fix his kite, but I couldn't. I explored the south of the state, driving towards Kuala Lumpur, into the mountains with rainforests. I took a wrong turn, and the road ended at a river. A boat was there to take people across. I saw a sign that said: 'Jelawang Jungle 3 km.' The path was steep and slippery. At the top, a man named Baba was waiting with tea. He had a kitchen and bamboo huts. I stayed there, trying not to think about insects. The night was very dark and noisy. In the morning, I saw a great view of green mountains. In the afternoon, it rained hard. I got very wet. I worried about my car being washed away, but it was still there, covered in mud. In Kota Bahru, Kelantan's capital, people asked me many questions: 'Where are you from?' 'How old are you?' They were very friendly. Kelantan is famous for kites, but I remember it for the kind people.'"

Get your facts right Do not write about a town or how a jet engine works if you are not sure. Only write what you know is true.

The train is not very fast and most people on it are on holiday. The Ghan is not a luxury train, but the food is very good. The railway was first built to carry goods, not people. It was thought that sending goods from Europe to Australia's south via Darwin and the train would save time and money. The Ghan says it is the world's first north-south railway. As I waited to get on the Ghan, I saw that everyone was excited. Most of the travelers were older Australians. Our first stop was at Katherine, where the train waited for four hours. Some people got off and took a boat trip. I left the train at Alice Springs and went on a two-day trip to Uluru (Ayers Rock) with a small group. We walked around the rock and watched the sunset.

Climber Keith Hewitt talks about his first time on Ben Nevis. It was February, my first big winter climb. We climbed the north side of the mountain to Tower Ridge. It is 600 meters up - maybe the longest climb in Britain. We planned to camp for three days in the 'Carries', which are like big bowls in the mountain walls halfway up. We carried tents, sleeping bags, and metal spikes for our boots. You need them because the snow is very hard, like ice. Even though some people in the group were very experienced, we took safety equipment like lights, hard hats, and extra clothes. The weather forecast was good, with no strong winds, but we were still a bit nervous. Ben Nevis in winter is always difficult. The path went up quickly, and my legs felt tired. I was the slowest in the group, so I had to rest more. The others sometimes stopped to wait for me, but when I got to them, they started again. I promised myself to train better next time. After 200 meters, we reached Tower Ridge, the path to the top of Ben Nevis. It is only one and a half meters wide, and the mountain drops down a lot on each side. We had to stay calm and focus on each step. After seven hours, we reached the top. On a clear day, you can see the sea and the island of Skye, 48 kilometers away. But we were not lucky because there was mist. Going back down to camp can be as hard as going up. You need to read a map well because a wrong turn can lead to dangerous slopes. I was happy we took turns reading the map. That first time, I only enjoyed it when I was safe in the tent. But I was happy I made it to the top.'"

This week has been very exciting because we moved to our new school! The school is made of wood, like our old school, but it is special because it is good for the environment. It took a long time to build, and we watched it happen. It was fun to see, but some nice land went away, and the machines were very loud. Sometimes, the builders stopped because of the rain. We thought it would never be finished.

Now, we have five big classrooms. They are much bigger than the ones in our old school. We also have a room for people in the town to use for meetings. There is a nursery, a nice dining room, and big changing rooms. We will use them when our new sports field is ready.

When you come into the school, you see there are no heaters! The heat comes from us, the teachers, and the computers. The building keeps the heat and sound inside, so when we sing, it sounds like a concert hall!

Another thing you see is a tree on the roof! The builders put it there because it is a custom in Austria, where the roof was made. The electricity comes from a wind turbine on a hill behind the school. We saw it yesterday, and it moves very fast. It is so big, you can see it from far away! We took pictures to put on the website.

We are using the new school, but some parts are not ready yet. We are doing a play for parents, but we have to go to our old school for it. The new hall will be ready next year. We are very happy with our new school, and our teachers say we will learn faster here!"

They can also feel movement with special lines on their bodies. This makes sharks dangerous for smaller sea animals that they eat.

Hello, I'm Nathalie. Last year, I joined the Kirov Ballet School in St Petersburg, Russia. I was one of the youngest foreign students. At my first ballet class, I was nervous because I didn't know anyone. Everyone asked me questions in Russian. I tried to speak Russian, and then they spoke English, so we could talk. Now, six months later, everyone is nice to me. My Russian is much better, and I understand my teachers. 

When I first arrived, my mum stayed with me for two weeks. When she left, I was a bit sad. I called her at night because I felt lonely. The classes in Russia are very hard, and I eat a lot to have energy. This helps me perform well. In the evenings, I watch my favorite films on my computer, but sometimes I fall asleep before the film ends. Now, I feel at home here. I like walking in the city and going to shops, even in December when it was very cold. I bought a fur hat because it was minus 10°C, but the Russians said it was not very cold for that time of year! My room is warm and cosy.

We are preparing for a new show, and there is a competition for young dancers. I will enter the competition. I feel very lucky to be here.'"

In the late 1980s, people thought winter could be special too. In 1990, a French artist named Jannot Derit had an art show in an igloo (a house made of snow) in Jukkasjarvi, a small town on the Torne River. This place was called Arctic Hall. Many people came to see it. One night, some visitors decided to sleep in the Arctic Hall. They liked it very much, and this gave the idea for an ice hotel. Now, the ICEHOTEL is famous around the world. Every winter, builders, architects, and artists come to Jukkasjarvi to make the hotel. When one part is ready, visitors can come and stay, even while other parts are still being built. The first part is ready in December, and new parts open each week until January 7th. The hotel is made outside with snow and ice, so the finish date can change. In spring, the hotel melts. Inside the hotel, it is always between -5°C and -8°C, even if it is colder outside. Warm clothes like overalls, hats, and gloves are included when you stay at the hotel. It is also good to bring sweaters, a scarf, and wool socks. Shoes should be bigger to fit thick socks. You can buy warm clothes on the ICEHOTEL website when you book your visit. These items will be in your room when you arrive. The hotel is in Jukkasjarvi, 200 km above the Arctic Circle, but only 15 km from Kiruna airport and 17 km from Kiruna train station. You can take a bus from the airport or train station to the ICEHOTEL.'"

About 6,000 people came to the shop. There were special offers, like a leather sofa for £45 until 3 am and a bed for £30 from 3 am to 8 am. The shop's normal hours will be 9 am to 9 pm every day. But Homestyle said it would stay open for 24 hours on the first day. However, it closed in half an hour. A police officer said: 'We knew many people would come, but they were not patient. The shop was full, so the managers closed the doors. People outside got angry because they thought everything would sell out. They did not want to wait quietly. Also, many cars were trying to get to the car park. Some people left their cars in the road and walked to the shop. This blocked the road.' One customer, Jenny Smith, got into the shop. She said: 'I waited for three hours and did not have time to buy what I wanted. The staff were calm and explained the situation. It was not safe. I will come back when they reopen, but I will not wait in line again.'"

In 2003, Tanya Streeter became the first person to dive 120 metres deep and come back up without help. She held her breath for over three and a half minutes. This made her the only woman to break a man's world record in any sport. Fourteen safety divers watched her dive. Some people say free-diving is too dangerous, but Tanya thinks safety and training are very important. Tanya trains a lot. She spends most of her time training in the gym. She also trains in the pool and the ocean. She uses an exercise bike to make her heart strong. She does not run because she wants to protect her knees. Instead, she walks fast to stay fit. When she practices diving, she travels away from home. She does fourteen dives in four weeks, with a rest day between each dive. It is important she does not get tired. When Tanya is not diving, she talks to people about sports products and helps environmental groups. She grew up on the Caribbean island of Grand Cayman and loved swimming and exploring rock pools. Tanya says her life now is like her childhood dreams. She is famous in some countries, so people listen to her about the environment.

In 1066, it was one of the biggest towns in England. Norwich has two cathedrals and a mosque, making it a place for different religions. The first cathedral was built in 1095. In 1994, Norwich celebrated 800 years of being a city. This means it could call itself a city and make its own rules. Today, Norwich is smaller than London or Manchester, with about 150,000 people. In the 16th century, it was the second biggest city in England. It grew for 300 years and became rich, known for having many churches and pubs. Now, there are fewer churches and pubs. In 1964, the University of East Anglia was built in Norwich. The city has many things to do, like theatres, cinemas, nightclubs, cafes, restaurants, and arts centres. Norwich also has a football team called 'The Canaries', with green and yellow colors. The city has a modern shopping centre called 'The Castle Mall'. Builders made a big hole in the city for over two years to build it. The roof of the Mall is now a park with water pools and trees. People in Norwich are happy that the old market is still there, next to the new shopping centre. Both places are busy, showing that Norwich has a good mix of old and new."
PET_43,"Text: 'The Albuquerque Balloon Festival Every autumn, the sky above Albuquerque, a city in the south-western United States, is full of bright colors. This is the Albuquerque Balloon Festival, a big event that lasts nine days every year. The first festival was in 1972 for the 50th birthday of a local radio station. There were about twelve hot-air balloons, and they took off from a car park in the middle of Albuquerque. Now, the festival is much bigger. This year, at least a thousand balloons from many countries will be at the festival, which is now outside the city. What to see The balloon pilots talk to each other on the radio and light up their balloons at the same time. This is called a 'balloon glow' and is great for photos. You need to come just after it gets dark or before 5.30 am to see the balloons glow in the dark sky. During the day, you can walk around the balloons and talk to the pilots as they get ready to fly. The balloons are different sizes and colors, and some look like animals, cartoon characters, or famous products like soft drinks and fast food. Kids will love it. In the afternoon, you can fly in a balloon over the desert with a company that offers balloon rides. You can also take a cable car from the desert to the top of the nearby mountains and see the festival from above. There are many other things to do for all ages, like balloon races and fireworks on the first night and the last three nights of the festival. The Albuquerque Box This is a special wind pattern that is perfect for balloons. The Sandia Mountains keep the balloons safe from strong winds and make gentle winds at different heights. This helps pilots control where their balloons go by going up or down. Practical advice Buy your tickets online before you go to the festival to avoid long lines. Wear layers of clothes because it can be cool at night and in the morning, but you need sunglasses and suncream during the day. Bring a flashlight for night events and a camera. If you use film, you need high-speed film for night pictures.'"

At first, students learn to play by listening. They do not read music until they have played for many years. There is a big difference between their playing and reading music for a long time.

New towns were built quickly. One town was called Iditarod, which means 'far, distant place'. In 1909, Iditarod became the biggest city in Alaska for a short time. In summer, boats could bring things to these towns, but in winter, the rivers and ocean froze. So, in 1910, a winter path was made for dogs pulling sleds. They took mail, food, and clothes to the gold miners. This path was called the Iditarod Trail. It took about three weeks for a team of dogs to travel across Alaska. They stopped at 'roadhouses' where the drivers and dogs could rest and eat. The trail was used every winter until the 1920s when planes started to be used instead. But in 1925, a disease called diphtheria was in the city of Nome. The medicine was far away in Anchorage. Planes were new, and it was too cold to fly. The only good pilot was not there. So, they used dog teams to bring the medicine. The trip was over 1,000 kilometers, mostly on the Iditarod Trail. It took twenty teams six days to finish. Leonhard Seppala, from Norway, traveled the first 400 kilometers. He trusted his dog Togo to find the way in the snow. The last part was done by Gunnar Kaasen, who had worked with dog teams for 21 years. His lead dog was Balto. Balto saved the team from falling into icy water. The diphtheria was stopped, and Balto became a hero. Now, a dog sled race happens every year from Anchorage to Nome, following the 1925 route. It is called the Iditarod and is known as 'The Last Great Race on Earth'.'"

PET_35,"Text: 'Little Chefs On Saturdays, a group of children aged ten to fifteen learn how to cook. The cooking classes are very popular, and 30 children are waiting to join. Parents pay £280 for the course. Children have fun and learn to make good food. Bill, who is ten, says, 'I love my mum's cooking, and now I can cook better than her. The teachers make us laugh, especially when we eat the food we made.' Flora, who is twelve, has trouble with onions. 'I love cooking. I cooked for ten friends, and they liked it. My mum said I should have a hobby instead of doing nothing on weekends. I was happy at home, so I didn't want to go at first. But now I'm glad I came.' Their teacher, Philippe, says, 'It's great fun. Children listen and remember better than adults, but the kitchen is not always tidy! Adults always learn more about food. If parents teach children to cook when they are young, they can cook for themselves when they grow up.''"
PET_5,"Text: 'Winter Driving Winter can be dangerous because it is hard to know what will happen, and accidents can happen easily. Fog can be at the top of a hill. Ice can be under the melting snow and can make you go off the road. The car coming towards you might slide across the road. Rule Number One for driving on icy roads is to drive smoothly. Quick movements can make a car hard to control. So when you turn the wheel, touch the brakes, or go faster, do it gently and slowly. Imagine you have a full cup of hot coffee next to you. Drive so you do not spill it. Rule Number Two is to watch what might happen. The more ice there is, the further you need to look down the road. Test how long it takes to stop by braking gently. Remember, you might be driving faster than you think. In general, allow double your normal stopping distance when the road is wet, three times this distance on snow, and even more on ice. Try to stay in control of your car at all times to avoid trouble.'"
PET_41,"Text: 'Craigie Aitchison Craigie Aitchison was a painter from Scotland. He went to London to study law, but he chose to go to art school instead. He found drawing classes hard, but he kept painting. In his late twenties, he got money from the Italian government to study art. He liked early Italian artists, and this shows in his work. He loved the green and brown colors of the Italian fields and the clear light there. He wanted to show this light in his paintings. He painted colors in thin layers, from light to dark. He says he never knows what the final painting will look like. He says, 'It's a secret - because I don't know myself.' Aitchison makes painting sound easy. 'Anyone can use colors - you can buy them. I just notice what colors go next to each other.' He does not draw before he paints because he might get bored and not finish the painting. He changes his paintings many times before they are done. He likes models who do not ask to see the painting while he works. 'If they want to look, I can't do it.' Since moving to London, he does not feel part of the Scottish painting scene. He says he just paints the way he can. But his work still influences young British painters.'"
PET_38,"Text: 'Rock Band Two years ago, our 14-year-old son, Ben, asked us for drums for his birthday. At first, we said no because of the noise. 'It's better than watching TV or playing computer games,' Ben said, 'and it will keep me out of trouble.' In the end, we said yes. 'Okay,' we said, 'but you must think about the family and the neighbours when you play.' That was just the start. Because drums are hard to move, Ben's band friends came to our house with their guitars and other equipment. So, for a few hours a week, the house is loud with their music and singing. At least Ben's hobby is good for our health: when the band plays, my husband and I go for a long walk. And I must say, even if their music sounds strange, they are nice and polite boys. I cannot say if they are good at music - my parents didn't like my music when I was young - but they play in local clubs for young people. Our main worry is that they won't study enough because of the band, but this hasn't happened yet. I always tell Ben how important school is. But one thing is sure - Ben was right: it keeps him out of trouble and he is never bored.'"
PET_17,"Text: 'Atlantic College Last week I visited Atlantic College, a private school in Wales. It is special because it gives young people experience outside the classroom and helps them study for exams. The students are 16 to 18 years old and come from all over the world. In the morning, they study. In the afternoon, they do useful activities like helping on a farm, caring for people with learning difficulties, or checking rivers for pollution. Students at Atlantic College come from different countries and backgrounds. Not many can pay the PS20,000 fees for two years, so there are grants. A quarter of the students are British, and many get help from the government. ""I admire the college for encouraging international understanding,"" said Barbara Molenkamp, a student from the Netherlands. ""You learn to live with and respect others, even those you don't like. During the summer, my mother saw I argued less with my sister."" In short, Atlantic College gives students a great education with methods that work.'"

I decided to go to university after 14 years away from school. I worked as a secretary and made good money, but I was bored. I wanted to think more and learn new things. I saw students at the local university. They looked happy and full of hope. I wanted to be like them. Now, I am a student, but it is hard to make friends with younger students. They think I am a teacher and ask me questions I cannot answer. I also feel different from the teachers because they know more than me. But I am happy to study because I need a qualification to get a good job. I like reading books on the weekend more than going to parties. I also enjoy student discounts for movies and theatre. Sometimes, I worry about what I will do after university, but I hope going back to school was a good choice.'"

After driving it 1,500 kilometers, he sold it and made two bigger cars. In 1903, he started the Ford Motor Company. He used strong but light steel to make cheap cars for people. In 1908, he made the first Ford Model 'T'. It cost $825. Soon, he was selling 100 cars a day. By 1927, the Ford Motor Company was worth $700 million. Early Ford cars were simple and cheap. But, there was not much choice. 'You can have any color you like,' said Henry Ford of the Model T, 'as long as it's black.' '"

Before she climbed the highest mountain in the world, she was a journalist and lived in a small apartment in south London. In 1993, Rebecca left her job and her family and went to Asia with some other climbers. She found that life on Everest is hard. 'You must carry everything on your back,' she said, 'so you can only take things that you need. You can't wash on the mountain, and in the end, I didn't even take a toothbrush. I like to be clean, but there is no water, only snow. Water is very heavy, so you only take enough to drink!' When Rebecca reached the top of Mount Everest on May 17, 1993, it was the best moment of her life. Suddenly, she became famous. Now she has written a book about the trip, and people often ask her to talk about it. She has a new job too, on a science show on TV. Rebecca is well known today and she has more money, but she still lives in the little apartment in south London with her pictures and books about mountains!'"

Last spring, Bill Lishman found sixteen young Canada Geese on his farm. They lost their parents. Bill thought, 'These young birds won't know what to do in autumn.' Bill had a small plane and decided to teach the birds to follow him. All summer, he took short trips in his plane, and the young geese flew after him. When it got cold in autumn, Bill flew to Virginia in the United States, 600 miles south of his home in Canada. The geese followed him all the way. Bill left the geese in Virginia and went back home. This spring, Bill waited for the birds to come back. They didn't come, so Bill flew to Virginia to find them. He looked for them for two weeks but couldn't find them. When he got back home, Bill found the geese waiting for him. They found their way home without him!'"

Five years ago, Jenny made some sweaters with the wool. She tried to sell them at markets, but it was summer and too hot. People did not want to buy sweaters. Then, she made socks. People loved the socks because they were cheap, strong, and easy to wash. This is how Jenny's business started. At first, she made the socks at home. But soon, she had many customers. She had to send the wool to a factory. Now, the socks are made by machines. There are six colours, five sizes for all ages, and different socks for walking, sports, and skiing.

KET_10,"Text: 'BURGLARS LIKE THE AFTERNOON Most house burglaries happen between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m., say the police. Inspector Ian Saunders told our newspaper that house burglaries have increased by more than 30% compared to last year. He also said that 67% of burglaries happen when people leave a door or a window open. Night-time burglaries are not common because families are usually at home. Winter afternoons are the best time for burglars because it is dark, and they can't be seen easily. Many houses are empty then because people are still at work. Inspector Saunders said it is a good idea to leave lights on in living rooms and bedrooms when you go on holiday. This will help keep burglars away. He also asked neighbours to watch other houses in the street when people are not at home. They should call the police if they see anything strange. 'We will also tell you how to make your house safe,' Inspector Saunders said. 'This help is free.''"

KET_44,"Text: 'The History of Farming Before people started farming, they went to the forest to find plants or fruit to eat. This meant people moved all the time to find food. But about 12,000 years ago, in the Middle East, people began to grow food. These people were the first farmers. Farming let people stay in one place, and their villages got bigger. Some people in the villages could do other work, like making clothes, because farmers grew food for everyone. But farming was hard when the weather was bad, and some people did not have enough food. Today, farmers can grow more food, and it travels very far to our homes.'"

This is more than the USA, so it is the biggest movie industry in the world. Most people in India like watching movies more than any other free-time activity. Ten million people go to the cinema every day. Bollywood movies are about love stories, and singing and dancing are important in every movie. People outside India also like Indian movies. Last year, Bollywood made over $500 million by selling movies to other countries. Indian actors make more movies each year than American actors in Hollywood, but they do not get paid as much. This is why most Bollywood movies only cost about $2 million to make. A Hollywood movie never costs less than $5 million. Most Bollywood actors are young. They work hard but only for a few years. Amitabh Bachchan is different. Some people say he is India's greatest actor. He has been in more than 140 movies in almost 40 years of acting."

About 300 years ago, London started to grow. The city was very dirty, and many people were poor. There were many thieves who took money in the streets, so people stayed at home. In 1750, Henry Fielding paid some people to stop thieves. They were like police and were called 'Bow Street Runners' because they worked near Bow Street. Fifty years later, there were 120 Bow Street Runners, but London was very big and needed more police. So, in 1829, the first London Police Force started with 3000 officers.

'You need clothes that are light but warm: two pairs of socks and gloves, several thin sweaters, and a snow suit on top. Catching the fish is easy,' he says. 'First, you break the ice and make a small round hole in it. Next, you take a fishing line and put some bread on it. Then you put the line through the hole and into the water. You pull the line up when the fish eat the bread. They are between ten and twenty centimeters long. Some people like to eat them, but when I have caught three or four fish, I prefer to have some chocolate or another snack! Today I have caught twenty-five! It's a great sport and you can meet some nice people here!''"

KET_11,"Text: 'Madame Tussaud's A very famous place for tourists in London is Madame Tussaud's museum. People can see figures of famous people made of wax there. Madame Tussaud was born in France in 1761. Her uncle was a doctor and made wax figures of people. He opened a museum of these figures in Paris. Marie helped him with his work. In 1789, during the French Revolution, Marie went to prison. She had to make wax heads of famous people who had died, like Queen Marie Antoinette. In 1795, Marie married Francois Tussaud. In 1802, she came to London with her wax figures. She opened a museum there, and her figures can still be seen today.'"
KET_14,"Text: 'BICYCLES A bicycle is a cheap and clean way to travel. The first bicycle was made about 150 years ago. At first, bicycles were expensive. Only rich people could buy one. These early bicycles looked very different from the ones we have today. Later, bicycles became cheaper, and many people bought one. People started riding bicycles to work and in their free time. Today, people use cars more than bicycles. Cars are much faster, and you don't get wet when it rains! But some people still like to cycle to work. They say there are too many cars in town centers, and you can't find anywhere to park!'"
KET_63,"Text: 'The Elephant Show by Daniel Allsop, age 14 Last summer, I went to Thailand for a beach holiday with my family. One day, we visited a park near our hotel. It had pretty flower gardens, but we wanted to see the elephant show. We went to a big square with seats on three sides. Three elephants came in with their keepers and stood in front of a big white card. Each elephant got a paintbrush and started to paint on its card. Sometimes, the keepers gave a new brush with paint to each elephant and took the old one away. Slowly, the elephants drew pictures on the cards. I couldn't believe it! One picture showed a river, one a tree, and the third a bunch of flowers. When the keepers showed the paintings, everyone wanted to buy one. We gave the elephants the bananas we brought for our lunch. Twenty years ago, elephants worked in the forest. Now, they do not work there, but the smartest elephants live in special places where visitors can watch them.'"
KET_56,"Text: 'Big cats There are many kinds of big cats. They are different in size and do not look or act the same. Tigers are the biggest cats. From head to tail, they can be 3.7 meters long. Most cats don't like water, but tigers like to lie in water when it is hot! Lions are the only cats that live in big family groups. Many lions work together to get food for the group. They live in flat, open places where they can see far and follow other animals. All cats need good eyes because they catch smaller animals for food. They also need to be fast and very strong.'"

KET_20,"Text: 'THE OSTRICH The ostrich is the biggest bird in the world. An adult ostrich can weigh more than 90 kilos. Most wild ostriches live in southern Africa, but there are not many left. Ostriches have wings, but they cannot fly. They use their wings to help them turn when they run. Ostriches can run very fast, from 65 to 90 kilometres an hour. This makes it hard for other animals to catch them. Baby ostriches are the same size as chickens. They take about 3 years to grow up. Ostriches eat plants and can live for many days without water.'"
KET_40,"Text: Victoria Jamieson is from Britain. She started snowboarding at 20 years old. Now, she is 23 and has won many competitions. We talked to her last week in Switzerland at a snowboarding competition. We asked her why she started snowboarding. She said, ""I like all sports, especially skiing. Snowboarding was natural for me. It is easy to learn, and you can be good in a few months."" We asked if she practices a lot. She said, ""In winter, I snowboard every day in the mountains from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. I also run and bike. I love it all! I like competitions and being in the mountains. It is very beautiful. But free-riding, which is snowboarding for fun, is the best for me."" We asked what is important when learning. She said, ""You can learn fast, but you need lessons. It is important to have the right clothes so you do not get wet because you fall a lot at first!"""

KET_64,"Text: 'Mount Kilimanjaro Mount Kilimanjaro is the tallest mountain in Africa. Many people have climbed Kilimanjaro, from a seven-year-old boy to an 87-year-old man. There are different paths to the top. People say the Marangu path is the easiest. It is five kilometers long. It takes about five days to climb and is very popular with tourists. Only half of the people who try to climb Kilimanjaro reach the top. This is because the weather can change quickly. At the start, it can be hot and wet, but at the top, there is ice and snow, and it can be very cold. Climbers need to bring sunglasses and warm clothes!'"
KET_29,"Text: 'Otters Not many people have seen an otter. Otters live near rivers and make their homes from small pieces of wood. They usually come out at night. Otters are very good swimmers and can swim more than 10 kilometres an hour. They have thick brown hair to keep them warm in the water. An otter can close its ears and nose, so it can stay under water for a few minutes. Twenty years ago, there were not many otters in Great Britain. The rivers were very dirty, and many fish and insects died. The otters had no food. But today, the rivers are clean again, and there is lots of food for otters.'"

KET_59,"Text: 'Buildings People always make buildings. We need houses to keep us warm and dry. We build stadiums to watch football games and concerts. We use other buildings, like museums, to keep beautiful things. Many people work on a building. The architect decides how the building will look and draws pictures. Engineers make sure the building is strong and safe. Then, the workers build it. The Sydney Opera House is a famous building with a nice roof. The building is beautiful from every side.

Before, Gail was famous for coming second in big races. But she always laughed and smiled, and people in her city love her for this. In 2004, everything changed when she ran her first half-marathon, a very long race. She won with the fastest time of the year for a British woman. Gail's manager and husband, Mike Rollins, also ran when he was younger, but he stopped because he hurt his right leg. He can still run a little and sometimes runs with Gail. But it's not fun for Mike when Gail runs faster than him. Gail trains hard. She runs long in the morning and fast in the afternoon. But she always rests on Sundays. 'I am with her all the time,' says Mike. 'Sometimes I say, ""Are you sure you should eat that?"" It's usually cakes, but she can eat almost everything.'"

KET_28,"Text: 'Bill Prince-Smith Bill Prince-Smith was a farmer, a teacher, and a dentist before he started writing children's books at 60 years old. Now, thirteen years later, he has written more than 80 books. Every day, he goes to his office to write. In the evening, he gives his work to his wife to read. 'She tells me when she doesn't like something,' says Bill. 'My ten grandchildren don't live close, but they also read my stories and say if they are good or bad.' This helps Bill know what young children like to read. Bill writes about life in his village and the farms nearby. His fifth book is his favorite: The Sheepdog is about a farmer and his dog. 'I have always liked animals,' says Bill, 'and dogs are very smart, they learn fast.' Last year, the book became a film with real animals and actors. The film-makers used new computer technology to make it look like the animals are talking. Bill was very happy with the film. 'Sometimes film-makers change books, but they didn't change mine and I love the film.''"

Many people send postcards when they are on holiday. Postcards are cheap, and the pictures are often better than people's own photos. The first postcard was sent at the end of the 1800s. It had a picture of a town by the sea. Later, postcards had pictures of news events, like an accident or an important person's visit. People liked these because newspapers did not have pictures then.'"

Birds are the closest living relatives to dinosaurs. Dinosaurs did not all look the same. There were more than 5000 kinds. Some were very small, but others were very big. The biggest were larger than any other animals on land. The Brontosaurus was 20 meters long and ate plants. The Tyrannosaurus Rex was not as big, but it was strong. It had sharp teeth for eating meat and could run fast with its long back legs.'"

In 1903, 120 years later, the Wright brothers made the first plane with an engine and flew it. This happened in the United States. In 1918, the US Post Office started the first airmail service. Aeroplanes changed a lot in the next thirty years. In the 1950s, aeroplanes became much faster because they had jet engines. In 1976, Concorde was made in the UK and France. It is the fastest passenger plane in the world and can fly at 2500 kilometres an hour. The trip from London to New York takes only four hours. Today, millions of people travel by aeroplane, and it is hard to think of a world without them.'"

People ate, talked, walked around during the show, and some even threw things at the actors! Today, you can still visit the Globe Theatre. A new theatre is in the same place near the river.
