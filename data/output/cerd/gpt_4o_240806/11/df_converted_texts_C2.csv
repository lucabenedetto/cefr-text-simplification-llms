CPE_15,"**Garbage in, garbage out**

Charging families for each bag of rubbish they produce seems like a good idea for the environment and economy. However, it might not be. In many developed countries, the process of collecting household waste is similar. Regularly, rubbish bags or bins are collected by special trucks and taken to a landfill. Economists find this process strange because, in most places, it appears free. Households pay for this service through local taxes, but a family that fills four bins pays the same as an elderly couple that fills one. Yet, the cost of disposing of rubbish is not zero. More rubbish means more collectors and trucks are needed, and local authorities pay more in landfill fees. This is a basic economic problem: if rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish. The obvious solution is to make households pay for the waste they dispose of. This would encourage them to throw out less and recycle more, assuming local governments provide recycling facilities.

However, American economists Don Fullerton and Thomas Kinnaman found that this logical approach can have unexpected and sometimes disappointing results. They studied several American towns and cities that started charging households for rubbish. The most common system is selling stickers or tags for rubbish bags or cans. Only bags with these labels are collected. In a study of Charlottesville, Virginia, a town of about 40,000 people, residents were charged 80 cents per tagged bag. While this seems like a sensible use of market forces, the authors concluded that the scheme's benefits did not cover the costs of printing materials, commissions to sellers, and wages for those running the scheme. Although the number of bags or cans fell by 37%, this was mainly due to the 'Seattle stomp,' where people crammed more garbage into each container by jumping on it. Machines at landfill sites compact waste better than individuals. The weight of rubbish collected, a better indicator of disposal costs than volume, fell by only 14% in Charlottesville. In 25 other Virginian cities without a pricing scheme, it fell by 3.5% anyway. Some people resorted to illegal dumping to avoid paying for rubbish removal. This is hard to measure, but the authors estimate that illegal dumping may account for 30-40% of the reduction in collected rubbish. A positive outcome was a 15% increase in recycled materials, suggesting people chose to recycle rather than pay for disposal. However, the fee might not have been the main reason for this increase, as many citizens were already participating in a voluntary recycling scheme.

In a more recent study, Fullerton and Kinnaman explored the economics of rubbish further. They concluded that pricing does reduce rubbish weight, but not by much. On average, a 10% increase in sticker prices cuts the quantity by only 0.3%. This figure is lower than in other studies, but is it surprising? To significantly reduce rubbish, people would need to buy less of almost everything. A small tax on weekly garbage is unlikely to make a big difference. Other factors, such as income and education, might be just as important as price. In wealthier towns, people throw out more rubbish and have less time for recycling. Should we conclude that charging households for rubbish is a bad idea? Not at all: free disposal is too cheap. But the effects of simple policies can be complex. Detailed economic models are often needed to understand them, and sometimes the results are not pleasant."
CPE_19,"Theodore Zeldin explores how our work life might change. Are you respected and appreciated as you should be? Success in a career is no longer enough. Many professions feel undervalued, and even famous individuals often feel bitterness behind their success. Loving your work used to be enough to make you part of an admired group. But now, you must consider what your job does to you as a person, affecting your mind, character, and relationships. This is important because, no matter how skilled you are, if your work makes you boring or unable to talk to people outside your field, or if you're too busy to gain wisdom or use your imagination and humor, then no amount of status or money will make up for your shortcomings as a person.

I am exploring how work could focus on fulfilling these personal aspirations, rather than just shaping us to fit industrial needs. Work should not only create wealth but also offer a meaningful lifestyle, help discover hidden talents, and provide diverse human interactions. However, this change doesn't mean ending unemployment. As people become more educated, they want jobs that are enriching, interesting, and useful. A lifetime of work should be like a work of art, with a fulfilled person at its center.

Even middle-class jobs are losing their appeal. Doctors are often more stressed than their patients and criticize clinical medicine. Accountants, despite their influence, worry about their profession's ethics. Most architects can't freely use their creativity. Administrators are stuck in bureaucracy. Middle managers, once proud of their status, are losing confidence. Meanwhile, the companies and institutions they work for are downsizing. Solutions like decentralized decision-making, skill development, and performance-based rewards haven't gained employee commitment. In Britain, only 8% of employees strongly feel their values align with their organization's.

I am investigating various jobs to see how they shape or harm those in them. I've studied how different cultures expand human potential and how courage can be developed. I've applied my method to key concerns of our timeâ€”happiness, love, friendship, and respect. Now, I'm focusing on finding more satisfying ways to earn a living. Many experts work on extending the life and income of companies, but we also need to evaluate ourselves as human beings and decide who we want to spend our lives with. How many of us feel truly alive at work? How many are part-time slaves, theoretically free to escape our drudgery, but actually trapped by our qualifications and careers, used by others, working not to become better people, but because we see no other choice?

Take hotel workers, for example, as 10% of the workforce is in the 'hospitality industry'. The amount of unused potential is incredible. Many intelligent and lively people endure low prestige, low pay, and long hours because hotels haven't been rethought since the days of the Ritz, with its old idea of luxury. A hotel is not just a place for travelers to sleep but a mini United Nations. People from all over the world meet at hotels, but usually pass each other silently. Many hotel staff are foreigners eager to learn a new language and culture, but they have only superficial interactions with guests. Hotels could be cultural centers, connecting guests with the city and each other. Hoteliers could use the knowledge of the many students they employ, instead of giving them only basic tasks. If they considered their staff's deeper ambitions, they would see many other services hotels could offer. But they are held back by accountants who say firms should focus on one main activity to maximize profits. It's time to rethink what this means from a human, not just financial, perspective, and move beyond traditional categories.

For me, work is a relationship. Now that many people are not satisfied with relationships based on obedience and see work as a way to express independence or personality, they should have the chance to design their own jobs and choose their colleagues and even customers, within practical and profitable limits. This means they need to know how to communicate beyond professional jargon, with minds that may seem different at first. Everyone knows communication is important, but it's different from conversation, and traditional conversation is different from the new kind of conversation people miss today. This is a more personal interaction, creating respect between participants, and is valued as a way to understand another person deeply, with the chance of being changed by the experience. It's more than relaxation because it's the most effective way to establish equality. Every time you have a conversation that achieves this, the world changes a little bit."
CPE_24,"**BROADCASTING: The Social Shaping of a Technology**

The term 'broadcasting' originally referred to the act of spreading seeds by hand over a wide area. This agricultural metaphor suggests planned growth and a rich harvest if conditions are right. It implies a central source of seeds, or resources, meant for wide distribution and reproduction. The question is why a new technology that could send words and pictures electronically was organized in a way that fit this metaphor. Television, like the telegraph and telephone, is a two-way communication technology. Yet, from the start, it was seen as a centralized 'mass' medium. This setup matched the socio-economic structures and lifestyles of modern societies. Other organizational forms were tried but remained just experiments.

Two lesser-known alternatives show what television could have been in a different social context. In the early 1930s, British radio amateurs experimented with two-way television as a possible telephone replacement. Popular science magazines published articles on building TV transmitters and receivers, and amateurs were active across the country. However, in 1938, the British Radio Manufacturers Association set standards that pushed these grassroots efforts aside. Thus, the chance for a grassroots, egalitarian form of television communication was lost, at least in Britain.

Broadcasting was linked to strong economic interests and the deep structures of modern societies. Despite TV amateurs' efforts, television in the early 1930s was mainly a medium for public viewing, especially in the USA, where it was seen as a potential competitor to the film industry. In Britain and Germany, public viewing was how most early audiences experienced TV. While grassroots, two-way television was marginal, public reception systems operated in several countries in the 1930s. These systems could have threatened the domestic use of TV, but they did not. Manufacturers saw the potential for mass sales of home TV sets once prices dropped. Given the division between public and private life in modernity, centralized broadcasting to homes was the most suitable organization.

As working-class people improved their living standards and joined 'consumer' society from the 1920s, the dream of a home as a center for entertainment and culture became possible for many in Western countries. This trend is now global. There is a link between social modernization and broadcasting structures. Social and economic modernization led to centralization of capital and power, while breaking up traditional communities created new lifestyles. People became more mobile, socially and geographically, leading to relative isolation compared to stable early communities. Centralized broadcasting helped governments efficiently reach citizens with important information and create a unified national community.

Broadcasting became the dominant form for radio and television due to these structured processes and interests. However, broadcasting also played a positive role in democracy. Between the World Wars, many countries saw broadcasting as a way to ensure equal access to resources for informed participation in political, social, and cultural life. Television is changing, and the term 'broadcasting' might become outdated. If so, this metaphor will refer to a specific organization of audio-visual technology during a centralized phase of social modernization."
CPE_13,"**Clutter**  
Sometimes it feels like no matter how many things you own, you never feel safe. It's normal to want a home that meets your needs, but sometimes the desire to get more things goes too far. Modern advertising is designed to make us feel insecure. The message is often: if you don't have this, you're not good enough. To see how much you're influenced, try not to read any ads next time you walk down the street. These expensive ads influence us in powerful ways without us noticing. We see them everywhereâ€”on TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, T-shirts, the internetâ€”all telling us to buy more.

**Caves**  
Research centers and universities worldwide have spent years studying caves, focusing on their origins, water systems, and life forms. Caves are a small but mysterious part of nature, sparking our curiosity and desire to learn. This has led to a lot of research. In places where caves affect our lives, studies have increased. However, exploring caves requires physical skill, so cave research is often done by both scientists and amateurs who enjoy cave exploration as a sport.

**Weather Watch**  
Many observant people, using only their senses, laid the foundations of meteorology, which has developed into a technical science since the 17th century. Satellites and electronic tools now provide us with constant weather information quickly, and computers solve complex calculations faster than humans can. Meteorological theory uses complex terms that can be confusing to non-experts. It might seem like there's no room for simple weather knowledge, but that's not true. Human experience is still crucial in turning data into weather forecasts. Observations from people can offer unique insights that help professionals understand the atmosphere better."
CPE_16,"**MUSIC AND THEATRE**

Until recently, I believed opera was mainly theatre. Now, I see it differently. After working at a national opera house, I learned that opera is primarily about music, with theatre coming second. This makes sense, but my background is in theatre, where the spoken word and the actor are most important. In theatre, there is no one directing the action once the play starts, and the audience usually understands the language spoken on stage.

In musical performances, whether in a concert hall or opera house, many people, like me, may not have a deep understanding of music. Some might feel embarrassed by their lack of knowledge, but most are amazed by the performers' skills. A brilliant singer or a perfect string section is easy to admire. Even a fairly good musician shows the results of years of hard work. Watching top-class music is like watching an athletics matchâ€”we know athletes are doing something similar to what we do when running for a bus, but we see how much better they are.

Theatre audiences have different expectations. They often don't understand an actor's skill and aren't particularly impressed by something that seems close to what they could do themselves. They don't usually applaud when an actor finishes a long speech, although they often ask, ""How do you learn all those lines?"" This doesn't mean theatre audiences are more generous or less demanding than music audiences; many are the same people. It suggests that in theatre, audiences and performers meet on more equal terms, no matter how challenging the material or spectacular the event.

The question is, should music learn from theatre about this relationship? I think yes, because a different approach can change the concert-goer's experience. Live music is naturally theatrical, full of emotion and drama, and it can reach the listener's imagination as part of a group. However, the traditional way music is presented, with strict dress codes and great respect for conductors and soloists, often highlights the difference between performers and listeners, creating a hierarchy. On the other hand, when audiences interrupt performances by applauding between movements or after a showy piece, it can disrupt the flow of the music, even if it's meant as appreciation.

Is there a solution? Yes, much is being done. There are efforts across the country to attract new audiences to concert halls and opera houses and to make 'serious' music more accessible. I recall a remarkable event, Jonathan Dove's community opera ""In Search of Angels,"" which moved from a cathedral to the town. It was a high-quality musical experience, with professional musicians playing a central role, and it was life-changing for many in the audience, who were not just watching but also participating.

What I hope for in music is more of the risk and boldness that theatre can show. Sometimes this comes from using unusual or challenging locations, which can surprise both performers and audiences. Comforts might be sacrificed, the acoustics might not be perfect, or it might be a bit cold, but theatre audiences have learned to be adventurous in following artists to unexpected places. I know most plays are performed in a conventional way, similar to concerts. However, I believe something can and should change in music conventions. My only authority is as an enthusiast: I love theatre and spend as much time and money as I can on music. I want both to succeed and for more people to enjoy them as much as I do."
CPE_21,"**Sand**

While I admire sand's amazing ability to be turned into useful things like glass and concrete, I am not a big fan of it in its natural form. To me, it is mainly an annoying barrier between a seaside car park and the water. It blows in your face, gets into your sandwiches, and hides important things like car keys and coins. When you are wet, it sticks to you like plaster and cannot be removed, even with a strong hose. But, strangely, as soon as you step onto a beach towel, get into a car, or walk across a clean carpet, it falls off you. For days after, you find piles of it on the floor every time you take off your shoes, and more flies around when you remove your socks. Sand stays with you longer than many illnesses. No, you can keep sand, as far as I am concerned.

**Lock and Key**

The search for a safe home, for privacy and security, has been around since humans first built permanent homes. The wooden beam behind the door may have been replaced by an electronic lock activated by a plastic card with countless combinations, but the desire to keep out the 'bad guys' remains. The appeal of a lock and key is partly psychological. Recently, some companies have tried computerized locking systems, where smart cards, swiped through a 'reader', control electronic locks with a digital command. But people don't like them. You might accept it at work, but at home, everyone wants the comfort of turning a physical key in a lock. As a result, when one locksmith company created a new electronic system, they made sure to include a real metal key in the device.

**Modern Art**

I was nervous about visiting the new Tate Modern gallery because, like many people, I can't understand modern art. I know I like some of it, especially furry things, neon light sculptures, and large photographs. Maybe if I knew more about it, I'd have an opinion on more things. Then again, you're not supposed to approach it like a school essay. The point is not to understand art, but to let it speak to you. This is a great idea, but it never worked for me. However, this new gallery has tried to give visitors a real understanding of the reasons behind the works. The first thing I noticed were the labels, proper labels that put a work in context and actually explained what it was trying to say. Instead of staring blankly at the pictures as I used to, these bits of information helped me understand."
CPE_46,"**Every Picture Tells a Story**

Adapting novels for film often means reducing, condensing, and deleting parts of the story. This can be frustrating for writers but also enlightening. While working on a script, I realized how much dialogue and description from a novel could be removed while still conveying the same message. This doesn't mean the original text was unnecessary. It's about the different ways each medium engages the audience and uses repetition. In novels, repetition helps readers remember character traits and understand who is speaking. In stage drama, speech often imitates real conversation, sometimes using language that seems redundant but serves to connect speakers. In some modern plays, this redundancy is extreme, making the dialogue seem like it only serves to establish contact, leaving the actual message unclear.

**Watching Movies**

Watching movies can transport you into another world, making you feel part of the film's reality. This experience can make you forget about the real world for a while. However, once the movie ends and the lights come on, you're back to reality. In the past, movies were often seen as mere entertainment, not art. Many people, including our parents' generation and teachers, enjoyed movies but didn't consider them an art form.

**The Film Studios**

The Leiper Film Company studios were a mix of different buildings, with a confusing layout. There were a few permanent landmarks, like the Script Department, but many small, similar rooms used for meetings. These rooms were hard to tell apart, and finding your way around was challenging. The studio lacked a clear main entrance, with three equal entrances that were hard to distinguish. Visitors were rare, as the studio didn't encourage them, but employees knew their way around. Together, they created films that offered audiences a temporary escape from everyday life.

**Film-makers**

Many people dream of making movies. Bookshops sell guides on scriptwriting and film production, and universities offer courses. Competitions offer cameras like the one Robert Rodriguez used to make El Mariachi, a low-budget film that launched his career. Rodriguez's success story is a dream come true. He recalls his 23rd birthday, comparing himself to famous directors like Orson Welles and Steven Spielberg, who made their breakthrough films in their mid-20s. In the past, filmmakers took time to mature, working in various roles before directing. John Huston was 35 when he made his first film, and Fred Zinnemann found success in his 40s. Today, without studio or TV support, aspiring filmmakers often have to be independent and resourceful."
CPE_3,"In those days, council houses covered the western side of the city: rows of crowded, dull homes in orange half-brick or pale white stucco. In summer, chemicals from the May and Baker factory, two miles away, filled the air with a strong smell of sulphur. The most common sight in that part of Norwich early in the morning was a paperboy wrinkling his nose in disgust as he walked along someoneâ€™s front path. Most of my early life is forgotten. But I remember sitting, or maybe balancing, near an upstairs window, watching the houses fade into the distance. Later, there are other vague memoriesâ€”faces I can't name, my mother ironing towels in a house that I don't think was ours, snow falling over the turrets of the great mansion at Earlham. My mother often appears in these early memories. I remember her as a small, precise, and often angry woman, whose anger I never understood and couldn't calm. Even as a child, when I went with her to the small shops in Bunnett Square or on longer trips into the city, I sensed her unusual personality. She was the most solitary person I have ever known, as alone in a room full of people as on a moor. She also had a strict sense of propriety uncommon on the West Earlham estate, which sometimes led to furious cleaning or handwashing and instructions to 'behave properly'. This moral code was beyond my understanding: even now, I'm not sure I understand it. Specifically, it meant not walking into neighbors' gardens or damaging their rose bushes; it meant sitting silently for long periods in the dining room, with your hands folded, listening to radio programs my mother liked; it meant many rules and restrictions. Over time, other figures appeared in these strict early scenes. Despite her solitude, my mother had friends. There was Mrs. Buddery, who was obsessed with the Royal Family, Mrs. Winall, who said nothing except to agree with others, and Mrs. Laband, who was livelier and somewhat disapproved of by the others. It was only later that I realized how poor their company was. They formed a sad and depressing group, talking about bad legs, cold weather, and ungrateful children, a category I often felt I belonged to. Looking back, it felt like a heavy weight, made up of the West Earlham houses, my mother and her friends, and the need to 'behave properly', was on my shoulders, and I needed to grow up and free myself from it. This was easier said than done. Growing up in West Earlham at this time followed a set pattern. Until you were five, you stayed at home and got in your parents' way (I remember aimless days when I was about four, playing on a rug while my mother sat coldly in an armchair). Then, the September after your fifth birthday, you went to Avenue Road infants school, half a mile away towards the city. The lucky few had a mother with a rickety bike and a child seatâ€”these were strange contraptions made of cast-iron with makeshift safety straps. As far as I remember, my mother left me in the care of other children in the street for this journey. If I remember anything about these early years, it's the summer holidays, when you caught glimpses of the world outside West Earlham: an old man next to Mrs. Buddery who told stories about his time in the Merchant Navy; a charity fete once at a house far away on Christchurch Road, where a kind woman gave out lemonade and tried to interest me in something called the League of Pityâ€”a kind of junior charity, I thinkâ€”only for my mother to dismiss it, saying its organizers were 'only after your money'. My mother often talked about mercenary motives, and she held politicians in deep contempt. If she thought of the House of Commons, it was as a place where rich people opened letters filled with money sent by a gullible public. No doubt I exaggerate. No doubt I overlook her virtues and highlight her flaws. But there was little kindness in my mother; it had all been drained from her. To be fair, my mother was aware of her role in my education. Occasionally on Sundays, she would take meâ€”in my 'good clothes'â€”on the 85 bus to the Norwich Castle Museum. Here, hand-in-hand, cautious but aware of the free admission, we would walk through rooms of paintings by the Norwich School of Artists. My mother wasn't entirely against this activity and eventually almost formed opinions on the subjects. I remember her stopping once in front of a painting of a Roman soldier in full battle gear and saying, 'Well, I wouldn't like to meet him on a dark night!' I recall this as the only time my mother tried to make a joke."
CPE_10,"**Philadelphia Avenue**

I walked down Philadelphia Avenue on the odd-numbered side. The evening was getting darker, and the air was thick with a light, prickly drizzle. This side of the street was familiar to me since childhood. Our neighbors were the Matzes and the Pritchards, and there was Han Kieffer's grocery store. My first playmates, all girls, lived in the Kring's and the Pottses' houses. Each house was distinct to me, just like the small channels in the cement that guided rain from the roofs to the street. As the street sloped downward, the houses seemed to become less grand, with lower porches and smaller front yards. Over the years, changes occurred: wooden porch railings were replaced with wrought iron in a Southern or Spanish style. In Shillington, some houses became stores, and some stores, like Pep Conrad's and Han Kieffer's, became homes again. I wondered how people lived in these spaces that used to be shops, with the lingering smells of merchandise.

**Bachelor Fads**

Furniture designer Rick Gilbert lives in a flat that used to be a curtain warehouse. It has typical loft features like exposed brickwork and large doors. However, Gilbert didn't want an open-plan space. In his previous home, the living and working areas were combined, making it hard to separate work from relaxation. So, he used a large sheet of corrugated plastic to divide the space, creating a hallway and leading the eye to the kitchen. He wanted the kitchen to be a neutral area for both social and work gatherings. To balance the modern look of the plastic and steel, he used light wood for the floors and filled the flat with sentimental furniture from his parents and markets.

**Bruce Chatwin**

Bruce Chatwin's life was full of secrets and mysteries, making his nomadic lifestyle a topic of literary debate. Despite this, he was a brilliant writer. His first book, ""In Patagonia,"" published in 1977, was a groundbreaking travel book. It combined elements of a thriller, romantic fiction, and extraordinary literature. Chatwin often mixed fact with fiction, altering reality for a better story or to capture the essence of his travels. His work suggested that through travel, one could discover histories that seemed to exist just to captivate future explorers.

**Swimming**

During a midsummer rainstorm, I hurried across my lawn and took shelter in the pool. As I swam, each raindrop created a small fountain on the water's surface. The best moments were when the storm grew stronger, silencing the birds, and a mist rose from the pool. It was during this summer of 1996 that I thought of a long swim through Britain. I wanted to follow the rain's path to the sea, breaking free from the monotony of swimming laps. In a world where everything is labeled and explained, activities like walking, cycling, and swimming allow us to reconnect with the wild and mysterious parts of our world. A swimming journey would let me explore areas that still hold mystery, like dark woods or high mountains."
CPE_67,"Text: 'CRYING Charles Darwin thought that humans cry for no clear evolutionary reason. He was likely wrong. More recent scientists have noted its social importance. Psychiatrist John Bowlby emphasized crying's role in forming bonds between mother and child. Many think tears, especially in children, show helplessness. But why adults cry is harder to understand. The sound of crying seems less important than the visual signal it sends. In early human groups, crying might have helped build trust and social connections. Tears can also have other reasons. We might cry to show sympathy for those facing injustice. Additionally, tears can come unexpectedly, sometimes to our embarrassment, when we hear inspiring music or speeches. We might cry during a sentimental movie, but interestingly, this happens more often with others than when alone. The social role of crying seems clear, but research continues.'"
CPE_27,"**The Heat is On**

We all know about global warming, but how much warmer will the Earth get, and how will it affect us? Many people understand the basics of global warming, but its consequences are uncertain. A warmer climate will likely change weather patterns worldwide. Since the atmosphere is connected to everything on our planet, climate changes will significantly impact plants, animals, water, and soil. Humans rely on these natural resources to produce food, build cities, and support billions of people. Any changes to these resources are serious.

The challenge is understanding how the world will change and what causes these changes. Over the last 100 years, human activities have increased the levels of certain gases in the atmosphere, which are linked to global temperatures. These increased levels are likely affecting the global climate, but our limited understanding of the Earth's heat balance makes the future uncertain. We do know that greenhouse gas levels have changed in line with global temperatures over the past 40,000 years, suggesting a strong connection. Evidence shows that the Earth's surface has warmed by about 0.6Â°C over the past century. Most scientists believe this warming is not natural and is partly due to human pollution.

Researchers use computer models called general circulation models (GCMs) to predict the effects of higher global temperatures. These models use physics and chemistry to analyze climate factors like temperature and solar radiation. However, they are simplifications and have limitations. Despite these challenges, most agree that the rate of climate change will be faster than anything we've seen before. GCMs suggest that by 2100, the average global temperature could rise by 1Â°C to 3.5Â°C, sea levels could rise by 15-95 cm, and precipitation patterns could change. Extreme weather events like heatwaves, floods, and droughts may become more common.

These changes could affect ecosystems, such as forests and grasslands, and the resources we depend on, like food and water. Some effects might be irreversible and harmful, but not all. In some cases, climate change could be beneficial. For example, in Australia, warmer temperatures have increased wheat yields by reducing frost damage.

However, many predicted effects of future warming are negative. Small climate changes can affect water availability, especially in dry regions or areas with existing shortages. The Mediterranean Basin has seen decreasing rainfall and changes in seasonality. Glacial processes may also change, affecting ice and impacting vegetation, wildlife, and human structures. The Arctic ice cover might melt completely, easing marine transport but increasing iceberg risks.

The most dramatic effect of global warming could be rising sea levels due to ocean expansion and melting ice. With about half of the world's population living in coastal areas, the consequences could be severe. Cities like London, New York, and Tokyo could face significant flooding, and many people might lose their homes, creating environmental refugees. Small island nations could be most affected, potentially disappearing if worst-case scenarios occur, leading to devastating consequences for their people and cultures."
CPE_66,"Text: 'Mission to Mars Wanted: a middle-aged, married couple for a 501-day round trip to Mars. Applicants must be physically and emotionally strong. This will be the profile of the first astronauts to go to Mars if multi-millionaire Dennis Tito's plans to launch a capsule on 5 January 2018 succeed. The capsule will take the crew to about 160 km above Mars. The spacecraft will use Mars's gravity to return to Earth without using more fuel, as saving fuel is important. The 2018 deadline is set because the next time Mars and Earth align is in 2031. It's a challenging task, but the race is on to create systems with new technologies. If these can be developed soon, the spacecraft might succeed. Even if it never launches, the efforts will still be valuable for future missions.'"
CPE_44,"**AESTHETICS**

Ironically, the very existence of art, which is essential for developing aesthetic theory, has become a barrier to understanding it. This is because art is often seen as physical objects like buildings, books, paintings, or statues, separate from human experience. However, the true essence of art lies in what it does to and within our experiences, and this misunderstanding hinders comprehension.

Moreover, the perfection and long-standing admiration of some art pieces create conventions that block fresh insights. Once an art piece becomes a classic, it is often isolated from the human conditions that created it and the effects it has on real-life experiences. This separation builds a barrier around art, making its broader significance, which aesthetic theory seeks to explore, difficult to grasp. Art is often placed in a separate realm, disconnected from other human efforts and achievements.

Therefore, a key task for anyone writing about the philosophy of fine arts is to reconnect art with everyday experiences. Just as mountains are part of the earth, art should be seen as part of human experience. Geographers and geologists show how mountains are connected to the earth, and similarly, those who study art philosophically must show how art connects to life.

If we accept this idea, even temporarily, we reach a surprising conclusion: to understand art, we must temporarily set it aside and focus on ordinary experiences that we don't usually consider aesthetic. We must approach art theory indirectly. While we can enjoy flowers without knowing plant biology, understanding them requires knowledge of soil, air, water, and sunlight interactions. Similarly, to understand art in its refined forms, we must start with raw experiences that capture our attention and provide enjoyment.

However, many people are put off by the idea that their everyday pleasures have an aesthetic quality. The arts that resonate most with people today, like movies, jazz, and comic strips, are often not considered ""art."" When art is confined to museums and galleries, people seek enjoyable experiences in their daily environment. Even those who oppose the museum view of art often share the misconception that art is separate from ordinary life. The best appreciation of distinguished art occurs when it is closely connected to everyday experiences."
CPE_22,"**Observing Lions**

In popular imagination, lions hunting for food are seen as a marvel of teamwork: in the fading light of sunset, a group of stealthy cats leaps from the shadows like trained hunters and surrounds their unsuspecting prey. Lions seem to be the perfect social animals, putting aside disagreements to work together for a common goal - their next meal. However, after many years of observing these creatures in the wild, we have a less idealized view. When we began our research in 1978, we wanted to find out why lions hunt together, raise cubs, and scare off rivals with loud roars. If an animal's success is measured by how many surviving offspring it produces, then cooperation might not always be beneficial: if an animal is too generous, its companions gain at its expense. So, why didn't the evolutionary rules of genetic self-interest apply to lions? We thought we could solve this in two to three years. But lions are experts at doing nothing. To the list of inactive noble gases, like krypton, argon, and neon, we would add lions. It has taken various research methods to uncover clues about their behavior. Since wild lions can live up to 18 years, the answers to our questions are only now becoming clear.

**Pop Music Review**

The release of Bedrock's third album was more than just a milestone for a talented but previously unstable band. ""New Life"" started a movement that changed the style of rock music in this country for the rest of the decade. Gone were the serious angst, plain clothes, and loud guitars of the past; in came a lighter mix of melodious local styles. A combination of social observation and strong anger mixed easily with the sound of fairground organs and northern brass bands. Humor and irony were prominent, as were voices that didn't hide their origins. The album showed Bedrock as skilled collectors and observers, and a clever team of songwriters. At their most obvious, they playfully explored traditional English themes like sunbathing and Sunday afternoons. But the album's real strength was in the gentle, sad depths it reached on tracks like ""So Low,"" a beautiful tune loosely based on weather, and ""To the Brink,"" a ballad that allowed no joking. The beauty of ""New Life"" is its consistently high quality - 16 tracks with no filler, an unmatched record in the era of long CDs.

**Extract from an Autobiography**

As a child, I was always fascinated by stories of ""The Sibyl,"" those mysteriously wise women who had great influence in the ancient world. At first, I only knew of one from a story my mother told me. An old woman from Cumae offered Tarquin, King of Rome, nine books for 300 gold pieces. He refused, and she burned three of them, offering him six for the same price. When he refused again, she burned three more books. He bought the remaining three for the full 300 gold pieces. I realized even then that there was a deep truth in the story - a lesson in salesmanship and life. I was sometimes a lonely only child. I would ask to play with other children and be refused. My mother told me to do something so interesting that all the other kids would beg to join me. It worked. It was another lesson I've never forgotten. When I was given the chance to write a travel book, I had to find something I could bear to learn about, something relevant to my life. I'm a reluctant traveler - I sent my editor a long list of places I wasn't willing to go. In the end, I'm only interested in ruins because the travel I like is the travel of the mind through time.

**What Becomes of Your Manuscript?**

When you submit your manuscript, it will likely join a pile waiting for someone to sort through before it topples over - the so-called slush pile. This person is usually either a junior in the editorial department (under 18) or an experienced person who comes in a few mornings a week and is paid by the hour. Neither has much influence, but they are on your side and looking to discover something original - the junior to make a name and acquire an author if lucky, the experienced person to justify continued freelance work. If they think your novel is promising, they will pass it to a more senior editor, and eventually, it will be discussed at an acquisition meeting. The editor supporting your novel will need to justify accepting it based on its quality and potential sales, and also consider if you, as an author, seem to be a long-term prospect (which you will have assured them of in your letter). Additionally, they will consider how promotable you are likely to be - an important factor - when a new novel needs all the help it can get. For this reason, publishers often like to meet a potential author before finalizing the offer."
CPE_39,"**Advertising on Trial**

If you worked in an advertising agency in the early 1990s, you might have faced the toughest years of your career. The recession was severe, lasting longer and hitting harder than expected, especially in industrialized countries. In Britain, 1991 saw a decline in GDP, high interest rates, reduced consumer spending, over half a million job losses, and 75,000 homes repossessed. Every business was affected, with some industries like vehicles and construction seeing a 30% drop. Many people and companies suffered globally.

Advertising professionals were not unique in losing jobs, but those who remained employed felt significant pressure. They were expected to support company profits while working with smaller budgets. Despite these challenges, the importance of marketing grew. Companies began focusing on producing what customers wanted, not just what was convenient for them. This shift increased the status of marketing professionals but also added to their responsibilities. Marketing was often seen as a cure-all solution.

With about half of marketing budgets spent on advertising, the responsibility fell heavily on advertising professionals. The 1980s were a prosperous time for advertising, but the 1990s brought a downturn. This was partly due to the economic climate, but also because clients began questioning the value of advertising. Without clear evidence of its benefits, many companies doubted the return on their investment. Advertising was under scrutiny, and clients demanded better strategies, creativity, and media placement.

Advertising professionals faced the same challenge as their clients: doing more with less. The recession led to debates over production costs and a reluctance to take risks, which are often essential for good advertising. Other challenges included demographic changes, the growing power of retailers, changing consumer needs, the rise of sponsorship, stricter legal restrictions, and the challenge of advertising abroad.

These factors forced advertisers to reconsider the effectiveness of their work. The pressure to increase successful advertising was high, but help was scarce. Companies and agencies were too busy managing these challenges to share their strategies, and those who succeeded kept their methods secret. Conferences and seminars offered some insights, but available books on advertising often failed to provide practical guidance. They tended to overestimate the quality and value of advertising work, which did not help those responsible for it."
CPE_18,"**The Lure of the Kitchen**

When I was at university, I decided I wanted to be a chef. Among my peers, this was an unusual choice. Cooking was not one of the desirable jobs that most of us aimed for. On the surface, it seems like an unattractive profession. Chefs are known to have tough lives: the work is long, stressful, and poorly paid. But these factors didn't discourage me. I was unhappy at university. The work was difficult, and the social scene felt closed-off and self-important. Being a chef seemed like the perfect escape from intellectual and social pretensions. It offered a seriousness and integrity that I found missing in my college life. However, my desire to cook wasn't just a reaction to being a student. It also represented an aesthetic ideal. My first glimpse of this ideal came when I ate a meal at a famous London restaurant. It was a revelation. I still clearly remember my starter. I finished that meal wanting to bow down, weeping, at the feet of the chef who had made it. I felt warm and uplifted for days afterwards. After this, I developed a strong desire to uncover the secrets of this fascinating art. I turned my student life into a long preparation for my entry into the culinary world. My history degree became a hollow pretense, distracting me from my true path. I gained my real education in a random and incomplete way by reading cookbooks, exploring markets and delicatessens, and preparing extravagant meals.

**Extract from a Novel**

The school's swimming instructor was a former drill sergeant, small and muscular, with tattooed arms. When I asked him to teach me how to dive, he told me to sit on the pool's edge, put my hands above my head, and roll forwards, pushing myself off with my feet. I practiced that move until the hour was up. The next visit, he had me standing upright and diving off the edge. The instructor was strict, and every time I surfaced, he looked at me with disapproval: 'Don't look down, look up!' 'Keep your legs straight.' 'Point your toes, I said!' The next week, I went up onto the high board. It was a fixed board, and its front edge bent slightly downward. It seemed incredibly high as I stood there, trying to gather my courage. Gradually, the echoing voices disappeared, and I felt as if I were wrapped in silence. I waved my arms vaguely as I'd been taught, tried to look up, not down, and launched myself into space. For a brief moment, I was flying. When I hit the water, I crumpled awkwardly, and my legs were all over the place. The instructor looked at me with contempt and shook his head. But even he could not diminish my euphoria. That's what they mean by 'free as a bird,' I thought.

**The Traveller**

For those of us who value a comfortable bed, running water, and the likelihood of living at least until tomorrow, the phenomenon of the traveller is as puzzling as it is intriguing. Here are people who have given in to the dangerous allure of the unknown, who actually choose to risk their lives by climbing the steep and icy face of a mountain prone to avalanches; who sail alone in fragile boats through towering seas; who will eat maggots and river insects if nothing more appetizing is available, and who can live, day and night for months on end, in the shadow and promise of the unknown. It is easy to dismiss such people as oddities - as indeed they are - to be placed among the truly eccentric: hermits, freefall divers, or indeed writers. That they exist cannot be denied, but the strange, uncomfortable world they occupy lies well outside our everyday experience and can be dismissed, we tell ourselves, as irrelevant. We can shrug our shoulders and return thankfully to our world of microwave ovens and answering machines, glad that the only risks to our own health are predictable ones, such as making a dangerous dash across a city street.

**SAILING**

Jonathan Raban is afraid of the sea, saying it is not his element, which is probably why he spends so much time on it. He does not claim to be a world-class sailor, though he is obviously a competent one. His main reason for sailing is that, being a writer, he likes to write about having sailed. Sailing is guaranteed to provide alarms and achievements for his pen to celebrate. Raban's little boat carries an electronic device that instantly gives sailors their position to within a few meters, anywhere on the earth's surface. Although he strongly approves of this instrument, there is more than a touch of primitivism in Raban's attitude to other sea-faring aids. He thinks the invention of the compass was a disaster, causing a 'fundamental rift in the relationship between man and sea.' Raban maintains that since it came into use, perhaps a thousand years ago, it has become the main object of the steersman's gaze, with the result that he no longer has to study the waves and feel the sea. And the ocean, once a place with all sorts of things going on in it, is now reduced to a mere space. Since his job is merely to keep steady on a course, the helmsman can be replaced for long stretches by an autopilot. This may be why Raban had time to look so carefully at the waves."
CPE_62,"**Holiday Reading**

Summer gives us two of life's great pleasures: leaving home and reading books. These joys are closely linked. Books help us feel more connected to the world. We can relate our experiences to those in books from long ago or faraway places because there are fewer human types than there are people. In books, we find our own thoughts and feelings. Authors can describe situations we thought were unique to us, or express our thoughts with clarity we can't achieve. What is unclear in us is clearly expressed in their words, especially if the book is from a distant place or time. We feel thankful to these authors for reminding us of who we are. Through reading and travel, we break free from routine. Our eyes are most open during our first days in a new place, or when reading a great book, which shows us things we previously ignored. Our mind becomes alert to new details. We notice the sky's colors, a friend's hypocrisy, or a hidden sadness we didn't know we felt.

**Author's Note**

These travel reflections were published as articles in the Observer newspaper over seven years. I have restored some small cuts made by the editor, but added little else. I corrected a few mistakes, but only if they were details I should have gotten right initially. Hindsight could allow more improvements, but that process would never end. For example, in the second article about China, it seemed likely at the time that the Hong Kong dollar would remain stable. A year later, it fell. If I rewrote the piece to predict this, it would seem like I had foreseen it, which I hadn't. Like any traveler, I was there at that moment, unaware of the future, focused on understanding the past. This is the story of mass travel: the world opening to people with no qualifications except the price of a ticket. But I believe my fellow travelers were not blind. Even a postcard can have a purpose.

**Ecotourism**

If there were awards for tourism phrases that have been overused, 'ecotourism' would win. The term appeared in the early 1980s, reflecting a rise in environmental awareness and a desire by travelers to have a positive impact. It quickly became a popular marketing term. Now, the ecotourism label includes anything from living with remote tribes for two weeks to a one-hour boat trip in Australia. Any tour involving culture, nature, wildlife, or mild adventure is often called ecotourism. The original motives were honorable, aiming to help people make informed choices. However, the lack of regulations and a clear definition left many travelers confused.

**Transylvanian Journey**

The notebook from my Transylvanian journey was lost for 50 years and only found recently by chance. It helped me reconstruct that time and write about it, but not as much as it should have. In Transylvania, I had an easier time than expected, moving from one welcoming house to another, often staying for weeks. When I stopped moving, I stopped writing, thinking there was nothing to record. I was slow to start writing again, and sometimes only made brief notes instead of a full narrative. Worried that details might be out of order, I added many disclaimers. But then I realized this wasn't a guidebook, so I let the story unfold naturally."
CPE_49,"**Fashion**

Fashion is often thought of as a modern trend, linked to the capitalism of the 19th and 20th centuries. However, many fashion historians emphasize that fashion, in terms of style and design, has a long history. They often start with the rise of markets and trade in the 16th and 17th centuries. As societies have become more complex, populations have grown, and new technologies for making different types of clothing and accessories have been developed, the meanings of clothing have also become more complex. Today, it is hard to say exactly what any piece of clothing or accessory means. For example, a man's suit, which seems to be a symbol of uniformity, can have very different meanings in different situations and to different people.

**Writer**

Reports of publishers fighting over promising manuscripts have given a false impression of what life is like for most novelists. For those of us not topping the best-seller lists, there are two ways to make a living. The smartest among us write in the evenings and have other full-time jobs that are secure even if the book doesn't become a hit or a movie. Others, like me, do various literary jobs, surviving on some teaching, occasional workshops, and writing articles like this one. I've heard of a writing job at a chocolate factory, but I've never gotten anything like that. Somehow, by juggling part-time jobs and credit cards, and often with the help of those mentioned in Acknowledgements, the novel gets written.

**Sudden Fame**

The small venues we were playing at across the country started selling out, and extra security was needed to manage the growing number of screaming fans. We had to use secret entrances to the places we performed to avoid being mobbed. On the few nights we weren't working, it was hard to leave the house without being chased by fans. In just a few days, we became celebrities. Our fans watched our every move, and our management and others took care of all our needs. Even though I was always shy, it was replaced by a strange over-confidence that only naturally shy people in similar situations can understand. In short, I was emotionally overwhelmed."
CPE_31,"**Music - The Challenge Ahead**

Technological advances are changing our lives at work, home, and during leisure. Susan Hallam talks about their impact on music in Britain. In the late 20th century, there were more ways to listen to music, like radio, TV, records, tapes, CDs, videos, and new multimedia. However, live music performances and full-time jobs for musicians have decreased. Access to music will likely keep growing because it meets many human needs. Music is essential for national events and personal activities, both formal and informal. A society without music is hard to imagine. The question is not if there will be music in the 21st century, but what kind it will be and if people will still want to learn instruments.

I believe people will continue to learn instruments. The music industry is a big income source in Britain, and musical skills are important for many jobs, especially in media. Besides job opportunities, playing an instrument can help develop skills early on. Research in the USA shows that listening to or making music can improve spatial reasoning, a part of intelligence. Although these findings need more support, European data shows that group music lessons can improve social relationships in school and help children focus, especially those with behavioral issues. Further research is looking into whether playing an instrument can help develop skills that can be used in other areas. For example, regular practice might help with good study habits and concentration, and playing in concerts might teach punctuality and organization. Because of these benefits, there will likely be a demand for music lessons in the short term.

What about the long term? Will there be a change in focus, and if so, what direction will it take? I think two things might happen. First, people will listen to more diverse kinds of music, with new genres mixing different styles. Second, technology will be used more in composing and performing music, making it easier for people to compose without needing technical skills. However, this might further reduce the need for live performances and musicians focused only on that. Alongside this trend, more people of all ages might want to participate in making music, likely in community settings that reflect local musical traditions.

To prepare for this future, the music profession needs to change. Instrumental teaching should adapt to help more people learn different instruments throughout their lives. This will affect the music curriculum and how progress is measured, requiring them to stay relevant for a wider audience and include more musical skills. Training musicians will be crucial. They need to motivate and teach learners of all ages, work with large and diverse groups, and develop communication, social, entrepreneurial, and management skills for community work. This is a big change from traditional methods and will require accountability. Positively, it offers a chance to show the high quality of music education available.

Finally, we need to raise the profile of music. Music is vital in our lives but often taken for granted. Everyone in the music profession should work together to change this."
CPE_58,"**The Actor's Craft**

Actors often face criticism and mockery. This is partly because they sometimes talk about their work in interviews, leading to clichÃ©s or gossip. They could learn from dancer Pavlova, who, when asked to explain her dance, said, ""If I could tell you, I wouldn't dance it."" Paul Scofield, a respected actor, once wrote that an actor's work is only alive during performance. Discussing it makes it seem empty and theoretical. Acting has no fixed rules, except perhaps being heard clearly. With each new play, actors start fresh, learning and growing with the characters and the writer's insights. Once a play ends, actors feel empty until the next project. This emptiness is evident in any discussion about theatre work.

**A Review of Hamlet**

Adrian Lester's portrayal of Hamlet is a balance between youth and adulthood, marked by simplicity and confidence. His command of the text and his self-control elevate him to a top-tier actor. Lester's Hamlet is a tense, watchful young man, driven by a controlled anger, with a sharp wit and humor that make him both intimidating and endearing. His performance is subtly virtuosic. Notice how his body seems ready to spring into action. Similarly, Handy's Horatio seems moved by an inner force. This raises questions: What is acting? What is behavior? Is acting an imitation or a creation of behavior? Who or what gives life to these characters, both morally and physically? This is a key question in theatre.

**One Director's Approach to Rehearsal**

This director's rehearsal process begins with ""dropping in."" The stage manager projects the script onto a screen. Actors sit quietly, absorbing the words. When it's their turn, they look at the screen, understand the first phrase, think about its meaning, wait for the impulse to speak, and then speak. For example, with the line, ""Queuing all night, the rain, do you remember?"" they breathe, let the thought sink in, and visualize a scene, like waiting in line for a concert. They find the impulse to speak, which the director calls ""The pathway to the line."" Impulses can come from outside or within. Actors should look into each other's eyes and consider their character's situation. The director encourages not pre-planning but trusting that something will happen.

**The Perfect Theatre**

The perfect theatre should make you feel your presence matters. Attending a live performance is an event, and the staff should recognize this. It's disheartening if the staff treats it as just another job. The theatre should create a connection between the performer and the audience. No one should feel they have a poor view of the actor. It's important that the audience is close enough to hear, see, and feel connected to the stage. The auditorium's design is crucial; it should complement the human voice and body. If it overwhelms the human form, it's flawed. Many late 19th-century theatres got it right by creating spaces that embrace the stage. I prefer theatres with a sense of history, like worn steps in a church, suggesting layers of human presence. Regarding plays, you can't cater to everyone. You can't predict what the audience will want. When visiting the theatre, you want to experience something unexpected; otherwise, you might as well stay home."
CPE_37,"**Paul Simon and Rock and Roll**

In the 1950s, rock and roll was mainly popular among young people, but its real significance was the big impact it had on middle-class and older people. It also set the stage for the next wave of rock stars, who listened to it with amazement, knowing that this new, exciting music would be a part of their future. For Paul Simon and other young people in the US, the main way to hear this fresh and exciting music was through Alan Freed's radio show, Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party. Freed's show was essential listening for many future rock stars. Like young John Lennon, who was far away in Liverpool listening to Radio Luxembourgâ€”the only place in Europe to hear rock and rollâ€”Paul Simon was captivated by the music from Freed's show. He was getting ready to move from just listening to music to creating his own.

**Snow Adventure**

There was no clear path, but I thought I would be safe if I walked carefully. The wind was strong, pushing me down as I slipped on the icy ground. Suddenly, the snow, which looked harmless, collapsed under me. I fell, surprised, into a hole about four feet deep. The snow had made a cover over a gap between two rocks, melting away to leave only a thin layer that I fell through. I pulled myself out, feeling shaken and worried, thinking about what I would have done if the hole had been thirty feet deep. I leaned against the top of a pine tree sticking out of the snow to assess the situation. In an hour, I had traveled about half a mile. It was clear that I needed to change my plan.

**Qualitative Research**

There are many books now that try to guide researchers on qualitative research. While a lot has been written about collecting data, these books often do not explain how to analyze the data. There is a lot of mystery about how researchers analyze their data. So, we asked different social scientists who have done qualitative projects to talk about the methods they used. The goal was to share insights and understanding of the process of qualitative data analysis, not to create a guidebook for new researchers. This task involves making hidden procedures more clear. While this might seem easy, we found it quite challenging. We allowed our contributors to present their work in various styles, including personal stories and more formal approaches."
CPE_2,"**Screen Learning**  
Recently, I saw my six-year-old eating noodles in a strange way. He was pulling them up with his teeth and trying to look fierce. ""I'm a little dinosaur,"" he said. He was acting out a scene from a TV show, so I asked him what he remembered about dinosaurs. The answer was, not much. Many people are eager to use the internet and computers for learning, but is learning from a screen effective? One writer shared his experience with an interactive program he tried with his son. The father read the words carefully, while the son played with the pictures. ""If he had spent ten minutes with a book, he might have learned something,"" said the father. Television, as shown by my son and his noodles, is a medium that suggests ideas rather than teaches them directly. Research shows that learning happens best in an environment where there is dialogue with teachers or parents. It needs to be guided. Using new technology to teach children is fine, but formal education still plays a big role.

**Hollywood**  
By 1918, most of the world's film-making had moved to Hollywood. Locals were not happy, seeing their area of Los Angeles changed by these newcomers. But eventually, they accepted it because of the success it brought. In Hollywood, success is measured by box-office earnings. Hollywood knows a good film when it sees one: it might make a star, but it must make money. In less than a century, Hollywood grew from a small village to a town as famous as New York, Rome, or Paris. Physically, it has changed a lot: a century ago, you would walk through orange groves to the village store. Yet, in some ways, it is still like a village - small-minded, with limited views - just a part of Los Angeles. For those who live and work there, the main topic is films: how much they have made, who is dating whom, who has been betrayed, and who is working on which project. Successful people often try to leave: to work there but live elsewhere. Still, it is the place where almost everyone in show-business eventually goes.

**Photography**  
Photography was created by nineteenth-century artists as a new art form. These artists wanted a lasting, accurate record of their surroundings, and they found it. The combination of light, lens, shutter, and a surface with light-sensitive chemicals created images more lasting and detailed than paintings. This worried other artists, and after their initial excitement, art critics claimed that photography was not art. They argued that photography was too tied to the real world and that pictures made by machines could not be acts of creative imagination. Despite the critics, photographers knew they had found a new art form. They used their tools like other artists use brushes and pencils - to interpret the world and present a vision of nature and its structure, as well as the people and things in it.

**Book Illustration**  
During the black-and-white era of book illustration, it was common for every children's book to have illustrations. This included novels for older children, which later had fewer illustrations as print runs became shorter. Children's publishing was active but often operated on a low budget, leading to some routine and mediocre work. However, the best artists always did their best work. The black-and-white archive is a mix of junk and treasure, a great place for research or browsing, where you can find immediate discoveries or start to re-evaluate a rich artistic period. The real treasures are likely to return to public view, either through reissues of individual titles, new publications about the artists, or exhibitions of original books and drawings. There are signs that this is starting to happen, and the familiar process of stylistic revival is underway. Eventually, a creative publisher will likely see the potential for a series of classic children's book illustrations from this period, either in facsimile reprint or in newly designed editions using the original artwork where it still exists."
CPE_68,"**Blogging: Sharing with the World**

Some time ago, a website warned about the dangers of public check-insâ€”telling everyone online where you are. The message was clear: you might think you're just saying, ""Hey, I'm here,"" but you're also letting everyone know you're not at home, including people you might not want to meet. This highlighted the growing concern about the risks of sharing too much online. The internet offers vast opportunities to share every detail of our lives with a global audience, promising wealth and fame. So, we dive into the online world, sharing confessions, personal photos, and stories. But soon, we realize the internet can be overwhelming and risky, and we might feel lost. 

Is this discouraging? Maybe, but don't lose hope. This future has a guide, created by a daring group of early internet users. In the early days of the web, they explored these challenges and faced the dangers. They lost jobs, made and lost friends, and dealt with the temptations of fameâ€”long before social media existed. These pioneers, the first bloggers, have already experienced what many of us are now facing. Before we forget their stories, it's worth learning from them. As the saying goes, those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.

In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started posting on the ""WWW,"" as it was known then, a place mostly for grad students, scientists, and a few curious teens like him. The web was invented at CERN, the international physics lab in Switzerland, to help researchers share their work. Hall saw it as a chance to share his life. He created a detailed online autobiography with words, photos, and art. In January 1996, he started a daily blog, and readers were drawn to his bold exploration of this new medium. Hall's approach was clear: if you crossed his path, you might appear on his site; no topic was off-limits. While it was the work of an exhibitionist, there was also a discipline and beauty to his project that some might even call art.

One day, visitors to Hall's site found his homepage gone, replaced by a single emotional video titled ""Dark Night."" His story unfolded; he had fallen deeply in love, but when he wrote about it online, he was given an ultimatum: ""either the blog goes, or I do."" Hall argued that sharing his life online made people not trust him. The blog ended, but the issue remains. Sharing online is exciting, but if you expect it to make people want to be with you, you'll be disappointed.

In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a young web worker in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. Sometimes, she wrote about her job at a software company. One day, an anonymous colleague sent her blog's address to every vice president at her company, including some she had mocked, and she lost her job. Experts who study online behavior call this the ""online distribution effect"": the feeling that we can say things online that we wouldn't say in person. But our digital lives are connected to our real lives. Ignoring this can lead to serious, life-changing mistakes.

Armstrong's story had a happy ending. Although she was upset and stopped blogging for a while, she eventually got married and restarted her blog, focusing on her new family. Today, she is a successful ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing supports her household. Once an example of the consequences of online mistakes, she has become skilled at sharing her life carefully. Armstrong learned an important lesson: the web allows us to say anything, but that doesn't mean we should."
CPE_23,"Text: 'Enough Sleep? Tiredness is often said to be a common issue today. As wealthier and busier countries have developed, sleeplessness and anxiety have also increased in people's minds. Research in the USA shows that 40 million Americans are chronically affected. Some recent popular novels in Britain have featured characters who can't sleep or are set in sleep-research labs. There is a growing interest in sleep: its patterns, its benefits, and sleep problems. A main concern is that 'People need more sleep,' according to a leading sleep researcher. 'People cut back on sleep when they're busy. They wake up too early to avoid traffic.' Recently, a sleep researcher conducted an experiment. He allowed participants to sleep up to 14 hours a night for a month. It took them three weeks to settle at an average of eight-and-a-quarter hours, showing they needed more sleep than they were getting. In Europe, these ideas are tested at a university sleep research lab in the English Midlands. The lab has studied the effects of fatigue on sailors, airport noise on sleepers, and the risks of tired drivers on motorways. They recruit participants through student newspapers, offering PS5 an hour. Dr. Louise Reyner reassures participants: 'Some people worry because we put electrodes on their heads, but we can't see their dreams or thoughts.' The lab focuses on physical aspects. In a dark room, there's a motorway simulator with a car facing a large screen. Participants arrive at 2pm, during the body's natural afternoon slump, after a short or no sleep. They drive while answering questions. The road seems endless, the sun is bright, and the air is warm. Young men deny they'll fall asleep. Dr. Reyner has a video of one trying not to. At first, he's alert, eyes fixed on the road. Then he blinks briefly, then longer, with his head dropping slightly. Each nod becomes heavier. Blinks turn into 10-second blackouts. He wakes up suddenly, but the car has veered off the road. Coffee might help. Two cups, even after no sleep, can make you a safe driver for over half an hour. Dr. Reyner suggests various alertness products: tablets, energy drinks, caffeinated gum. Shift workers could benefit from them. But what else do we know about sleep? Humans, like other mammals, sleep in a daily cycle. Once asleep, they go through four stages, from light to deep sleep. Dreams usually happen during the lightest sleep, and the brain paralyzes the body except for hands and eyelids to prevent injuries. Beyond this, facts become theories. It's suggested that sleep repairs body tissue, restores muscles, or rests the brain's frontal section that controls speech and creativity. But these might happen faster during relaxed wakefulness, so it's uncertain. Scientists are fairly sure women sleep half an hour longer than men, and older people need less sleep, though the reasons are unknown. When asked about sleep's purpose, some researchers say: 'Sleep is a way to travel through time without harm.' Sleep patterns may have been different in the past. A history professor found that between 1500 and 1850 in Britain, people had different sleep routines. They went to bed at nine or ten, woke after midnight from their 'first sleep', stayed awake for an hour, then had their 'morning sleep'. This time was used for reflection, remembering dreams, or even night-time activities. The poorest benefited most from this quiet time, free from daytime constraints. By the 17th century, with more artificial light, the rich switched to the continuous sleep pattern we follow today. The industrial revolution extended working hours in lit buildings, changing sleep habits for most people. Beyond Europe and America, the old pattern was common until recently. In some non-western cultures, there are no strict bedtimes. People sleep for a few hours, then get up. The idea of a full night's sleep doesn't apply. In some tribal societies, human and animal noises, and the need to watch fires and predators, make continuous sleep impossible. It seems people worldwide need more sleep.'"
CPE_60,"Text: 'We are talking about big boots here. Really big boots. I stood in my $800 designer cowboy boots on the rocks of an old formation in the Arizona desert sand. Money was no object. I wore the full cowboy outfit, and if you had the outfit, you might look like a cowboy. But I was not. It wasn't working. I squinted into the morning sun, looking out at the Arizona mountains, and I had to admit, I was not at home on the range. Flying in from Denver just after dawn, I felt like I might pass for an old cowboy coming in from the sky. That feeling didn't last past the first real cowboy I saw in the luggage hall of Phoenix airport. He was wearing a sweat-stained T-shirt, needed a shave, and was lifting a dirty canvas bag off the conveyor belt when he saw my brand-new cowboy boots. He slowly raised one eyebrow and walked out the door without looking back. There should be, somewhere, a suit of clothes an ex-racing driver can wear without feeling out of place. Something he could wear so that wherever he goes, he doesn't feel like everyone is speaking another language and moving in slow motion. I liked, no, I loved being a racing driver, driving racing cars. I am addicted to it, and it's all I know how to do. But I don't do it anymore. I couldn't if I wanted to. The question is, I thought, looking at the rust-colored mountains in the distance, what do I do now? A racing driver should have one or two backup plans for when he stops racing. I thought I did, but when I reached for them, they just disappeared. How about: an ex-racing driver adds color to the commentary directly from the trackside? 'We have fifteen guys, all former Indy and Formula One drivers, in front of you, Forrest, waiting to be commentators. We'll call you.' Well then, how about: an ex-racing driver starts a partnership to sell classic cars? That lasted nearly all winter with phone calls, lunches, lawyers, and meetings with bankers. But it was the year nobody was buying old Ferraris, and Honda was 'reviewing' its dealer list. So in the end, I gracefully withdrew before there was nothing to withdraw from. Being an 'ex' anything is depressing work. I mean, you tell me, how badly do you want to hear about how I was almost the World Champion? Nobody wants to hear a story that ends in 'almost'. And even if I had been world champion, you could probably listen to the story for five minutes before getting bored. Last year's champion was last year. Not that I want sympathy. Which is just as well, since I don't get any. Why should I? I had a good run, made money, and kept enough. But oh, man, I miss the thrill of getting into that sleek, powerful machine with seven hundred horsepower behind me. Zero to one hundred and fifty miles an hour in 4.9 seconds. And yes, I miss the danger of almost killing myself every race. I miss the exciting people and the reporters who acted like what I said mattered. Being famous, even a little, isn't all bad. Businessmen and politicians bragged that they knew me. Little boys sneaked under fences to get my autograph. And now that I don't drive a racing car... Only last week, the phone rang twice. I have time in the morning and time in the afternoon. And let me just check, but I think tomorrow is free, so much empty time. I looked up into the soft blue morning sky. No buzzards overhead. Maybe Arizona doesn't have buzzards. But a couple of little brown birds in a saguaro cactus in front of me were giving me advice, something like 'get away from our nest before we sing our hearts out'. It had never occurred to me that the desert had songbirds. It did occur to me that a fake cowboy in designer boots had a lot to learn.'"
CPE_1,"**Vancouver**

In the past ten years, hundreds of thousands of people from around the world have moved to Vancouver, in western Canada. In the evenings, residents like to walk through the city streets, and if you join them, you will probably hear many different languages. People are attracted to Vancouver for its mild weather, beautiful location between the ocean and mountains, clean and safe environment, and opportunities for education and work. Although some people complain about the rapid construction of new buildings, it's clear that the newcomers and the growing tourism industry have contributed to the city's revival. Locals used to call Vancouver 'Terminal City' because it was a gateway to other places. Even though this name is less popular now, Vancouver is more of a gateway than ever.

**Putting Pen to Paper**

Journalists, like me, are often not very good at writing letters. Some say this is because we don't like writing without getting paid, but I don't think we are that money-driven. It's more likely that because we always try to make a big impact in our work, we lose the natural flow needed for letter writing. Real creative artists, who don't focus on the impact of their words (even if they rewrite a passage many times), don't have this issue. I think the true test of a real artist is their natural understanding of the effect of their words. When Shakespeare wrote his famous lines, he probably didn't consciously think about how the mix of long words made them powerful, but it showed his greatness as a writer.

**Supermarket Opening**

In the past, opening a new supermarket in Britain was a special event. You could expect a soap opera star, a radio DJ, or a minor royal to cut the ribbon. Now, new supermarkets seem to open every day, so celebrities are no longer needed. Why pay a famous person when anyone can do it for free? Last week, waiting pensioners didn't care who opened the new Superbuy store, as long as they were first in line. One customer, who knew someone working there, said the first five men would get a bottle of aftershave, and the first five women, a bunch of flowers. This information quickly spread through the crowd, making those at the front feel pleased and the latecomers envious."
CPE_53,"**Citizen Kane**

When the film *Citizen Kane* was finally released in 1941, it faced a lot of controversy. The release was delayed because distributors were afraid of what William Randolph Hearst, who was thought to be the film's subject, might do to them. Despite receiving mostly enthusiastic reviews, the film was not a commercial hit. It was television that later brought it back to public attention. *Citizen Kane* is perhaps the most influential film, inspiring many to become filmmakers. This is especially surprising because it was Orson Welles's first film. Welles always said that its success came from not knowing what he was or wasn't allowed to do; he just did what he wanted. He had an amazing team, including cameraman Gregg Toland, screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, and special-effects expert Linwood Dunn. When Welles and Mankiewicz decided to create a story about a newspaper tycoon who was both like and unlike Hearst, Welles knew he had found the perfect project for himself as both director and actor. He took the opportunity with great enthusiasm.

**Dermot and Carmel**

Dermot noticed that Carmel seemed a bit strange that morning. He mentioned twice that he might be late and not to worry if he stopped by the golf club on his way home. He needed to chat with someone, and it was the best place to do so. Twice, Carmel nodded her head in a friendly but distant way, as if she hadn't really heard or understood. ""Will you be all right? What are you going to do today?"" he asked. She smiled and said, ""Funny you should ask that. I was just thinking that I had nothing to do all day, so I was going to walk downtown and look at the shops. I thought it was almost a sinful thing, just wasting the day."" Dermot smiled back. ""You're allowed to enjoy yourself. And as I said, if I'm late, I won't need anything to eat. So don't go to any trouble."" ""No, that's fine,"" she replied.

**Title Race**

Tea boy? No, I'm a mobile lukewarm beverage resource facilitator.

Human nature provides the most amusing of comedies. A recent study showed that job titles are a major cause of envy and unrest at work. A survey by a top recruitment firm found that 90% of employers and 70% of employees admit that titles create divisions among colleagues. Surprisingly, the survey found that 70% of office workers would be willing to give up a pay raise for a more 'motivational' or 'professional' job title. If our vanity is so strong that it even overcomes basic greed, we are indeed in trouble. The truth is that in these early days of the twenty-first century, nobody wants to be seen as subordinate. The titles being discussed focus on ability (like specialist or coordinator) but are really just euphemisms."
CPE_55,"The Vienna Assignment

I was in Vienna to take photographs. That was usually why I traveled anywhere. Photography was more than just my job; it was a big part of my life. The way light touched a surface always sparked my imagination. A single photo could capture the essence of a time, place, city, or person. I always hoped to take the perfect photograph, as long as I had film in my camera. Finish one roll, load another, and keep looking with open eyes. That was my approach for a long time.

I almost succeeded once when a photo I took of a smoke plume from a burning oil well became popular worldwide. It was a brief moment of fame, mostly due to luck. But they say you make your own luck, both good and bad. I went freelance after that, which seemed like a smart move, but life outside photography took some wrong turns. The mid-nineties weren't as successful as I had hoped after my photo made it to the cover of Time magazine. That's why I was in Vienna, not somewhere more newsworthy. But I was still taking photos and getting paid for it, which wasn't bad.

The assignment came by chance. I had taken photos in London for a picture book called ""Four Cities in Four Seasons"" featuring London, Paris, Rome, and Vienna. It was a European project that paid me well to capture my home city in different seasons. I added my own style to scenes like daffodils in Hyde Park and traffic in Piccadilly. I accepted that the best of my work might be overlooked since it was just a picture book, not meant to challenge anyone's views.

After finishing my London-in-winter photos, I learned that the Austrian photographer, Rudi Schussner, had left the Vienna job for unknown reasons. Instead of hiring someone new, they offered me the role. The Austrian publishers liked my work, and I was available, unlike the French and Italian photographers. I was happy to go because things at home weren't great. A week in snowy Vienna was appealing, and I didn't need it to be a compliment to my artistry.

They put me up at the Europa Hotel, in the heart of the old city. I had last visited Vienna with my wife for a busy summer weekend, but it wasn't memorable, and I didn't take many photos. This time, in a cold January, it would be different. I felt it as soon as I arrived and saw the pinky-grey light over the snow-covered roofs. I was going to enjoy myself and take great pictures.

The first day, I didn't even try to take photos. I rode the trams around the Ringstrasse, getting on and off to feel the city's atmosphere. The weather was set, frozen like the grand baroque buildings of the old empire. I hadn't seen Schussner's work from other seasons and didn't want to. This was going to be my Vienna. I just had to wait for the right moment. A photograph captures a moment, but you have to wait for it to come. So I waited and looked until I could see clearly.

The next morning, I was out at dawn. Snow had fallen overnight, making Stephansplatz white and almost empty. I hadn't figured out how to capture the cathedral in one shot. Its spire reached into the sky like a giraffe's neck, but at ground level, it was massive like an elephant. I might have to settle for a partial shot. In that weather, it could still be magical. Photography has always had a magical quality. In the 19th century, before the chemistry was understood, it seemed mysterious. Even when you know how it works, the mystery remains. Perhaps that's why what happened at Stephansplatz that morning didn't surprise me."
CPE_50,"**Kinetic Art Rejoice**

Something amazing has happened: London's serious Hayward Gallery has become a place of wonder. This change wasn't due to a big-budget, flashy show, but rather a unique exploration of a nearly forgotten art form from the last 60 years. A new exhibition looks at the history of kinetic art, which is art focused on movement, in the twentieth century. It shows that creating artworks that move by themselves or explore movement has been an ongoing, though often unnoticed, theme in fascinating creative work of this century. The exhibition, curated by Guy Brett, who has dedicated his life to studying kinetic art, includes a wide range of paintings, drawings, documents, and films. These are presented with minimal text, allowing visitors to enjoy making their own connections and discoveries.

**David Hockney**

David Hockney's art attracts many people who might not usually be interested in art. This could be because his work is figurative and easy to understand, or because it offers an escape from everyday life. Some people might be drawn to Hockney's charming personality and witty comments, which make him popular in the media. Some critics think Hockney is overrated, but others argue that his popularity doesn't mean his work lacks depth. Hockney himself knows his limits and believes it's not fair to dismiss his work because it doesn't fit an abstract idea of greatness. He doesn't claim to be a great artist and understands that only time will tell his true place in art history.

**Window-shopping - an art exhibition**

In recent years, I've seen many contemporary art exhibitions, some brilliant and some mediocre. What bothers me are shows that push a hidden agenda, suggesting a common attitude among artists. Sometimes this works, revealing new trends, but often it feels forced. As a curator, I wanted to create a show that was the opposite of this. With seven artists, I took over a space in an empty warehouse. ""Window-shopping"" was a collection of individual artworks connected only by their claim to be art. For example, Sam Cole's knitted cats chased each other on a toy train track, while Matthew Crawley's video camera experiment flickered on a monitor. These works didn't fit into a themed exhibition but complemented each other through contrast. I didn't make any grand statements about contemporary art, but perhaps there aren't any to make about an activity where artists set their own rules.

**Art History**

People who enjoy paintings sometimes hesitate to analyze them, fearing it will spoil their experience. Some say that art historians, who focus on theory, ignore the pleasure of looking and the creativity of art. This idea is like thinking that knowing a recipe's ingredients and cooking method takes away from enjoying the dish. Understanding something doesn't stop us from enjoying it; it might even enhance our pleasure. Pleasure is complex, and how we experience it can be examined. Our preferences are influenced by societal values, not just personal taste. While the sensory response to art is important, the idea that thinking undermines feeling is an outdated belief from a time when art was seen as separate from thought."
CPE_25,"**Metals**

Stone Age people might have become interested in metals because they wanted to decorate themselves. Imagine sitting by a river, waiting to catch a fish, when one of our early ancestors found a shiny yellow pebble. It didn't feel like a stone, but it was attractive. This is how gold might have become part of their lives. Gold is easy to shape, so it quickly became a valuable material. Copper might have been discovered by accident too. Once people realized how useful copper tools were, they eagerly searched for copper ores and ways to extract the metal. This is how metalworking became one of the skills that improved their lives.

**St Ives**

We walked silently, carrying our bags down the winding, cobbled lane into the town center. We were bent over against the strong wind and trying to avoid the icy waves crashing over the promenade. The streets were empty, and the shutters on every waterfront cottage were tightly closed against the storm. We had watched the weather get worse as we arrived in St Ives on the small single-track train. As the dark grey skies closed in, visiting Cornwall in the off-season without a car no longer seemed like a good idea. I had convinced my friend to join me with promises of walks along the beautiful Cornish coast and cozy evenings by open fires.

**Computer Modelling**

The challenge with studying the past is that it is gone. The people who lived through peaceful times and hard times are long dead. The reasons they settled in certain places or moved elsewhere, forming families, villages, and cities, are forgotten. Archaeology gives us hints, but we can't test our ideas with experiments on past cultures. We can't watch the past like a movie. Or can we? Computer modelling lets us recreate ancient landscapes and fill them with virtual communities. These digital creations have some of the needs and abilities of real humans. We can set rules for behavior and create social groups. Then we can change conditions, like reducing rainfall or increasing population, and see how this digital society reacts."
CPE_34,"**Vervet Monkeys**  
Cheney and Seyfarth describe an incident with vervet monkeys. One day, the dominant male in their group noticed a strange male in a nearby grove of trees. The stranger wanted to join the group, which could mean the dominant male might lose his position. To prevent this, the dominant male used a clever trick. Whenever the stranger tried to approach, he gave an alarm call that vervets use to warn of a leopard. This scared the stranger back into the trees. This tactic worked until the dominant male made a mistake: he gave the alarm call while casually walking across open ground himself.

**What Cats Catch**  
In a survey in the English village of Felmersham, residents collected prey caught by their cats. Over a year, seventy cats caught over 1,000 prey items. An American professor estimated that, based on these figures, cats in Britain might be killing 100 million birds and small mammals each year. However, this calculation is not accurate because most cats live in towns and catch less prey than rural cats. The important question is whether these numbers are sustainable. The answer seems to be yes. Many people feed birds in winter, and gardens provide nesting sites, keeping bird populations above natural levels. The survey showed that cats are significant predators but not devastating to Britain's bird population.

**Buffalo's Day**  
Buffaloes are very important to marshmen and are well cared for. Each morning, the buffaloes leave their sleeping area slowly and with groans, heading to distant reed beds. They stand on the platform's edge, complaining about the day's fatigue, until the leader finally moves into the water. Once in the water, they seem to forget their purpose and wallow for a while. Their movements are so slow that they are barely noticeable, but eventually, they swim away, appearing exhausted. They spend the day among reeds and bulrushes, grazing on green shoots at eye level.

**PICASSO, Pablo**  
In early 1940, Picasso painted several fish still lifes while staying in the fishing port of Royan. One painting shows a fishmonger's slab with a crab and a pair of scales holding two or three soles. Despite their situation, the sea creatures appear alive. The painting is complex because Picasso used overlapping and interlocking transparent planes. The thin, delicately brushed paint and cool colors create a calm, underwater world. However, this calm is disturbed by an impending battle between the fish and the crab. The sharp forms of the fish and crab, along with the scales, suggest a sense of menace and hidden violence, giving the painting a symbolic edge."
CPE_12,"Photography Over the past 150 years, photography has been used to capture all aspects of human life and activity. In this relatively short time, photography has grown in its ability to capture moments in time and space, allowing us to see fleeting moments and visualize both large and small details. It has shown us images from remote parts of the world, distant areas of the solar system, and the social complexities and crises of modern life. Photography has become one of the most important ways to express the human condition. However, using images to record events has a much longer history. The earliest pictorial recordings date back to the Upper Palaeolithic period, about 35,000 years ago. Although we cannot be sure of the exact purposes of early cave paintingsâ€”whether they recorded actual hunting events, served as magic to increase animals for hunting, acted as religious icons, or simply brightened domestic lifeâ€”pictorial images seem deeply connected to human culture. Throughout history, questions have been raised about the accuracy of visual images and their role in society. The idea that 'seeing is believing' has always given special importance to visual images. So when photography was invented, its social and cultural impact was huge. In the mid-19th century, photography promised to provide a truthful visual record automatically. The camera, working like the human eye, was seen as a machine that could capture a fixed image, very close to what we actually see. The chemical process of fixing the image allowed the capture of what might be considered a natural phenomenon: the camera image. At the same time, the photographic image was seen as a cultural achievement, producing images that artists had long struggled to create. Ironically, because of the camera's perceived realism, it was assumed that everyone would naturally understand photographs. This led to the question of whether photography was a 'universal language'. For example, in 1933, photographer August Sander expressed this view, saying even the most isolated person could understand a photograph of the sky. However, with the rapid increase in global communications in the late 20th century, we need to ask how well photographic images can cross cultural differences. Is photography as bound by cultural conventions as language? Is it possible that our familiarity with photographs has made us overlook the medium's ability to convey vivid impressions of 'reality'? Photography is often seen as providing convincing pictorial evidence, making the medium seem transparent and blurring the line between our perception of the environment and its photographic representations. It is common for someone to show a photograph and say, 'this is my grandson'. Since its invention in 1839, photography technology and attitudes towards it have changed significantly. This may be because photography has moved into 'mythic time'â€”its role as a 19th-century record-keeper has evolved, and photographic images, once immediate and close, have now become historical documents. These documents often reveal as much about the people and society that produced them as they do about their subjects. I aim to show that the camera is not just a passive recorder of events and that photography does not merely reflect culture but can inspire social and political change. For example, it is hard to imagine the cultural changes of the Italian Renaissance without recognizing the role of perspective in new visual representation. Similarly, photography has greatly contributed to the media culture of our era, while also bringing the harsh realities of the world to our coffee tables."
CPE_26,"**How to Write Poetry**

Teaching someone how to write poetry is like walking through a minefield: you need to be spontaneous, but one wrong move and your certainties can explode. Claiming to know everything is risky, so I suggest that for beginners, no advice can replace reading a lot, writing often, and freeing your imagination and spirit in any productive way, except total chaos. Some people need a stable life to write a poem; others write to escape misery. Some follow a schedule; others wait for inspiration or a sudden idea. All methods are valid, as long as they aren't just following a set formula. It's important to find your own voice, listen to it, nurture it, and let it grow until it can stand on its own.

**The Short Story**

In a short story, there isn't space for too many characters, long narratives, or extended flashbacks. Flashbacks should be brief and only used if necessary to clarify an issue. A good way to do this is through a quick memory in the main character's mind, recalling an event that affects the current conflict. This can move the story forward but should never slow down the action. Dialogue is more useful than many new writers realize. Two characters talking can show two sides of a question faster than explaining it from one viewpoint. It also keeps the reader interested. Overwriting can ruin a short story, but brevity shouldn't make it just a summary. Conflict and action must be as strong as in a novel, but in a short story, every word must count.

**Screenplays**

If you know how to play chess, you can understand how to write a screenplay. Most chess players move from start to finish without knowing much, but enough to play. We make moves without knowing what will happen later. Maybe we see one or two moves ahead, and if we do, we're pleased with our ability. Over time, we realize chess is more about long-term strategy than short-term tactics. We start to see the game as a whole, not just individual moves. Patterns, called gambits, emerge, like openings, middle games, and end games. In chess and screenplay writing, the more you practice, the more you understand its complexities.

**Looking at Writing**

""Humans naturally speak, as seen in children's babble, but no child naturally bakes, brews, or writes."" Charles Darwin was right: language is instinctive, but writing is not. Language exists in all societies, past and present. Languages change but don't improve: English is no more complex than Stone Age languages; modern English isn't better than Old English. All healthy children learn their language without lessons. When children lack a language, they create one. Writing, however, has been invented rarely in history, only in a few complex societies, and it developed slowly. Until recently, most children didn't learn to read or write; even today, many struggle. A group of children is as unlikely to invent an alphabet as they are to invent an engine. Children are naturally good with sounds, but reading and writing are skills that must be carefully taught. We need to understand how writing works, how children's minds work, and how to connect the two."
CPE_8,"I have never started a novel with more doubt. I call it a novel only because I don't know what else to call it. I have little story to tell, and I don't end with a death or a marriage. Instead, I leave my reader uncertain. This book is about my memories of a man I met only occasionally, and I know little about what happened to him in between. I could invent details to make the story more complete, but I don't want to do that. I only want to share what I know. To avoid embarrassing people who are still alive, I have given the characters made-up names and taken care to ensure no one recognizes them. The man I write about is not famous. He might never be. When his life ends, he might leave no more trace than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the water's surface. Then, if my book is read, it will be for its own interest. But perhaps his chosen way of life and his unique character might influence others, so that, long after his death, people might realize he was a remarkable person. Then it will be clear who I write about, and those interested in his early life might find something useful in my book. I think my book, despite its limits, will be a helpful source for my friend's biographers. I don't claim the conversations I recorded are exact. I never took notes, but I have a good memory for what matters to me, and though I put these conversations in my own words, I believe they represent what was said. I mentioned earlier that I invented nothing, but I have taken the liberty, like historians, to put words in the mouths of people in my story that I didn't hear myself. I did this to make scenes lively and realistic, which would have been dull if just recounted. I want to be read, and I think I'm justified in making my book readable. The intelligent reader will see where I used this technique and can choose to ignore it. Another reason I started this work with worry is that the people I write about are from another culture. It's hard to know people, and I don't think you can truly know anyone but your own countrymen. People are not just themselves; they are also shaped by where they were born, the homes they grew up in, the games they played, the food they ate, the schools they attended, the sports they followed, and the poets they read. These things make them who they are, and you can't know them by hearsay; you can only know them if you've lived them. You can only know if you are them. Because you can't fully know people from another nation except by observation, it's hard to make them believable in a book. I have never tried to write about anyone but my own countrymen, and if I have done otherwise in short stories, it's because you can treat characters more briefly. You give the reader broad hints and let them fill in the details. In this book, I don't claim my characters are as they see themselves; they are seen, like my main character, through my own eyes."
CPE_4,"**POETRY RECITALS**

Throughout history, the world of literature often seems confusing to those experiencing it. It is only later that we can see clear patterns and recognize important figures. Today, poetry is especially complex, with many different styles and opinions about how poetry should be presented, criticized, and taught. There is a general debate between two groups: 'literary' poets, who write poems to be read on the page, and 'popular' poets, who prefer performing their poems to an audience. This division is not strict, and public poetry readings have become more common over the past twenty years. These events happen in various places, like small towns, schools, colleges, and arts festivals.

For 'pop' poets, who write their work to be performed, public readings are beneficial. Their poems are often simple and easy to understand when heard. However, on the page, their lack of depth might be more noticeable. On the other hand, poets who focus on the craft of poetry, aiming to pack deep emotion, thought, and rhythm into their work, may not be fully appreciated by an audience hearing their poems for the first time. The risk is that these poets might choose to read only their simpler works to connect quickly with the audience, which might not represent their best work.

Listening to poetry readings cannot replace reading poetry on the page, but it can be a fun and educational experience. Hearing poets read their work can help listeners understand the emphasis and rhythm intended by the poet. It is helpful if the audience can follow along with the text or is already familiar with the poems. The main reason for popular poetry recitals, sometimes mixed with music, is to make poetry enjoyable and accessible, so people see it as something for everyone, not just a select few."
CPE_30,"**Oral History**

Historians are increasingly using oral evidence, but this method has challenges. It is unrealistic to think that someone's spoken account is a perfect reflection of past events. During an interview, both the historian and the informant influence each other. The historian chooses the person to interview and the topics to discuss. Even if the historian only listens, their presence can change how the informant remembers and talks about the past. The final account is shaped by the historian's social position and their way of understanding history, which can affect the informant. Historians must acknowledge their role in creating new evidence. However, challenges remain even when the historian is not present. The informant's memories might be influenced by other sources, like the media, or altered by nostalgia or later life experiences. Emotions and attitudes in the testimony can seem convincing but may not truly reflect the past.

**Animal Science**

Animal science has two main approaches: physiological and whole animal. Physiologists focus on how the body functions, such as how nerves and muscles work together to create behavior. The whole animal approach looks at the behavior of the entire animal and what influences it. Within this approach, psychologists and ethologists are distinguished. Psychologists usually study learning in a few species, like rats and pigeons, in labs. Ethologists study natural, unlearned behavior in animals, often in the wild. Although these fields are merging, physiologists claim their methods are more fundamental. However, understanding nerve cell functions doesn't eliminate the need to study behavior as a whole. Behavior has its own structure and must be studied at its own level. Describing a bird's nest-building by nerve cell actions is like trying to read a book with a microscope.

**The Social Sciences**

New social science students face a dual challenge: learning the content and the methods of their subject. They must understand both the knowledge in textbooks and the ways this knowledge is gathered and organized. These elements are closely linked. Since we all experience social life, social sciences might seem like common sense. However, each social science discipline goes beyond common sense, focusing on specific aspects of social life, using particular study methods, and employing its own concepts. These concepts form the 'logical basis' of the subject, allowing social scientists to surpass everyday understanding and distinguishing each discipline.

**Classical Architecture**

In Ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was more than just building structures. According to the Roman architect Vitruvius, architecture involves order, arrangement, proportion, symmetry, propriety, and distribution. These ideas likely come from an earlier Greek source. Utility and function are not part of this definition, though Vitruvius later discusses the best forms for different structures. Initially, the focus is on architecture as an art. Classical architecture has complex origins, with a long history of simple constructions in Greece and Italy that did not meet Vitruvius' artistic standards. Despite their simplicity, these early forms contributed to later architectural ideas. The classical temple, though elaborate outside, is essentially a simple, single-roomed structure."
CPE_7,"The two sisters kept Lily's driving a secret from Chen for a while. Lily would drive around the allotments, the railway line, and the gasworks, even jumping a small bridge with all four wheels off the ground, which was her only mistake. She finished her drives by the gasworks, surrounded by the smell of sulphur. Surprisingly, Chen was amused by his wife's secret driving. ""So you can really drive, Lily? Well done!"" he said. Mui thought men were strange; Chen should have been upset. Instead, he eagerly planned a trip with Lily, excited about her new skill. They chose a Monday at the start of next month, the quietest day of the week, planning to leave early and return by midday to avoid losing customers. Meanwhile, Lily practiced driving around the allotments. Despite her doubts, Mui bought a road map, getting a ten percent discount, which impressed Chen. Lily, however, felt a bit insulted by Mui's lack of trust in her navigation skills.

Within an hour of leaving home, they were looking at the English Channel. Lily drove perfectly. Even Mui, sitting in the back ready to give directions, had to admit this. On the road, Lily overtook a few slow vehicles with great skill, making Mui hold back her protests. Chen even applauded. After passing through the gasworks of a seaside town, past the lagoon with its small motorboats, they drove smoothly along the empty promenade. Lily parked in a street full of empty parking spaces. She wasn't sure about the road markings and preferred to pay a fee rather than risk being towed or fined. Maybe this caution would ease Mui's worries. On the way, Lily noticed her sister's tense face in the mirror, which she used often. It might be best not to mention worries that hadn't occurred to Mui.

Lily locked all the van doors and checked each one. ""Don't worry,"" Chen joked. ""No one will want that heap of tin."" The sisters were annoyed. Lily accused Chen of being ungrateful, and Mui scolded him for being too easily fooled by appearances. Surprised, Chen took Man Kee ahead to look at the grey sea. He sat his son on the railing and held him. Man Kee was a soft, warm, and increasingly responsive child. He put his small hand, similar to Chen's, on his father's sleeve. In that moment, Chen decided to raise Man Kee his way. He would ensure his son got a good education in numbers and grew up to own many restaurants, learning all aspects of the business. The somber sea made Chen feel pleasantly thoughtful as he planned Man Kee's future. He saw a trail of smoke near the horizon and then a ship appeared, shimmering in the sunlight. There was a telescope nearby. The sparkle of the water changed Chen's mood. He put a coin in the slot and looked through the telescope. At first, he couldn't find the ship, but then he saw it: a large, rusty tramp steamer. Chen lifted Man Kee to the eyepiece. ""Do you see the ship, Son?"" he asked gently. ""It's a special little ship for people like us. It's small and old, but we know better. It's the ship that will take us home when we're done here. It will take you to your homeland, which you've never seen."" Chen kissed Man Kee's head. Lily and Mui were behind him now. Lily put her arm around Chen's shoulders. ""The little old ship,"" Chen said. ""Let your mother see, Son."" Man Kee didn't want to let go of the telescope, and when he finally did, the view was gone. By the time Chen found another coin, the ship had disappeared over the horizon, and Lily only saw seagulls scavenging in the ship's wake."
CPE_43,"**THE WELL**

I had read somewhere that if you looked up from a deep hole, you could see the stars during the day. I convinced you to help me test this idea. You watched nervously as I pulled up the well bucket, steadied it on the wall, and climbed in. I asked you to lower me down. I didn't consider how much heavier the bucket would be with me in it, or that you might not be strong enough or willing to hold on. You tried to hold the handle as I pushed the bucket off the well's edge, but I fell immediately. You screamed and tried to stop the handle, but then let go. I fell into the well and hit my head. At that moment, I didn't realize I had, in a way, achieved my goal. I saw strange, blurry lights. Later, I connected these lights to the cartoon stars and planets that appear when a character gets hit on the head. At first, I was dazed, then scared, then relieved, and finally angry at you for letting me fall and worried about what Mother would say. You called down, asking if I was okay. I was about to shout back when you called again, sounding more panicked, which stopped me. I lay still, watching you through my eyelashes. You ran off, calling for help. I quickly climbed out of the well and hid in the shadows near the moat bridge. I heard alarmed voices from the castle. Mother and Father appeared with you and old Arthur. Mother was frantic, and Father told Arthur to use the winch. You looked pale and shocked. I felt a mix of excitement and fear. Then I noticed the trail of water drops I had left from the well to where I was hiding. I was horrified that no one had seen them. Father was shining a flashlight into the well. The drops glistened in the sunlight. I couldn't believe no one noticed. Mother was screaming, a sound I had never heard before. It shook me deeply. What should I do? I had gotten back at you, but now things were more serious than I expected. It had gone from a clever prank to something that would lead to serious punishment, likely for me. I regretted not thinking it through. From a plan to a disaster in minutes. Then an idea came to me. I gathered my courage and left my hiding place, pretending to be weak and disoriented. I cried out softly, then louder when no one heard me. I stumbled and collapsed on the cobbles. Sitting up, comforted by my weeping mother, I claimed I had found a secret tunnel from the well to the moat and crawled through it. I thought I was convincing until Father asked me to repeat my story. I hesitated, and his eyes narrowed. Trying to cover my lie, I said the tunnel had collapsed after me, so there was no point in checking. I looked into my father's eyes and saw disappointment. It was like seeing the world from an adult's perspective, realizing how my story sounded. My words stopped. ""Don't be ridiculous, boy,"" he said with contempt. He walked away. Arthur looked at me, regretful and troubled, shaking his head. He saw through my lie and worried about my character and future. His pity was as painful as my father's words, confirming their judgment of my actions. It affected me deeply."
CPE_51,"**REMOVAL DAY**

Susan, a widow, is leaving her family home now that her children are grown. The removal van had ""Removers of Distinction"" written on it, and indeed, everything special about the house was being packed away. Fred, the removal man, with his large fingers, carefully handled the fragile items, while his team was less gentle. Susan was leaving a beautiful four-storey house overlooking a small harbour. The memories of her children growing up there lingered like dust in the air. 

When they first bought the house, her son Robert, then five, had asked, ""Mum, when you buy a house, how do you get it home?"" Now, Robert was there helping, especially making sure Susan didn't mention the piano. Francesca, her daughter, was also helping, insisting that only she could handle the Steinway piano properly.

Fred, the removal man, noted that Susan didn't seem like she was going to cry. Susan asked if people often cried, and Fred explained that many do once everything is packed up, though they feel better at the new place. Susan could understand this feeling. She would have warned the movers about the piano, but Robert insisted it was their job to notice any issues. The piano was in the best room of the house and would be moved last.

Sitting on the bottom stair, as all the chairs were gone, Susan remembered when they first moved in. The piano had been brought in first and got stuck on the stairs. The removal men struggled for hours, and young Francesca had cried, ""We can't live in a house without a piano!"" Her husband Peter had solved the problem by hiring a builder to remove a window and using a crane to bring the piano in. It was an expensive process, and they couldn't afford to tune the piano for months. Peter had said, ""That's there forever,"" but forever is a long time.

The children were now too busy to visit often, and Susan found it hard to move around the house. She thought about the stairs and the slightly crooked banister rails, a reminder of the piano's difficult arrival. She should have warned the movers, but it was too late. Fred reassured her that only the piano was left to move. Susan felt anxious as Robert and Francesca watched from the hallway.

As the piano was carefully moved down the stairs and out the door, Susan felt on the verge of tears. But when the piano was safely outside, Robert started laughing, and soon all three of them were laughing uncontrollably, relieved it was over. They walked arm in arm down the path for the last time, with Susan shedding tears of laughter."
CPE_11,"**Online Literary Criticism for Everyone**

Is do-it-yourself literary criticism just harmless fun? From the beginning, the idea of open access to the Internet was a key principle. In theory, anyone could publish a manifesto or start a music channel online. In practice, though, some technical skills were needed, especially in the early days. However, one area that was truly opened to everyone was literary criticism. By visiting Amazon.com, the first popular online bookshop, anyone could try their hand at reviewing books. Amazon's approach to book reviews was simple: anyone could say what they liked about a book and give it up to five stars. This seemed like a brilliant idea. Each book had its own page on Amazon's site, and whenever a reader submitted a new review, it appeared automatically. This allowed Amazon to fill its pages with free reviews, and potential buyers could see what other readers thought of a book, rather than just reading the publisher's blurb or professional critics' opinions. Other online bookstores, which also had physical stores, offered similar features. But as the largest player, with over 80% of the online market, Amazon initially had the most customers, attracted the most reviews, and encountered the most issues. This open review system led to various kinds of misuse. Thousands of reviews were submitted each day, so it was impractical to check them all. Instead, a team of editors checked that reviews followed the company's guidelines. Single-word reviews, personal attacks on the author, obscenities, spoilers, or references to other reviews were not allowed. However, reviewers were anonymous and offending reviews were removed only if Amazon's editors noticed them. This allowed for some mischief. For example, writers could give their own books glowing reviews. One writer, Lev Grossman, was so upset by the bad reviews of his first novel ('infantile trash', 'puerile pap') that he submitted several positive ones himself ('hilarious', 'fabulous') to balance things out. His trick worked until he wrote an article about his deception, and the fake reviews were removed. Authors could also comment on their books by clicking a link marked 'I am the Author, and I wish to comment on my book.' Most authors used this feature to post friendly messages hoping readers would buy and enjoy their book. Some even shared their email addresses, inviting readers to contact them directly. However, Amazon did not verify that these comments really came from the authors, except for well-known writers. A little-known writer submitted a comment pretending to be from John Updike, calling himself a 'talented but ultimately over-hyped middlebrow author'. It was deemed fake and removed. The real drama came from readers, not writers. When James McElroy's ""We've Got Spirit,"" about a small-town cheerleading team, was published, it was well-received by the mainstream press. But many people mentioned in it felt betrayed and used Amazon's page to express their anger. Dozens of critical reviews were submitted, only to disappear a few days later. Despite this, Amazon saw the fact that so many people were willing to spend time reading and writing reviews as good for business. Since readers' reviews were meant to be a 'forum to talk about a book' rather than a chat room, Amazon closely monitored bestselling books to ensure reviews followed the rules. This meant that the best place to post a silly review was on a page for a less well-known book. ""The Story about Ping,"" a classic children's book about a duck named Ping, inspired much geek humor because 'ping' is also a term for a software tool used to measure Internet congestion. One long review made an elaborate analogy between the book's plot and Internet architecture, concluding that the book provided a 'good high-level overview' of basic networking concepts. Such silliness was rare. Most reader reviews on Amazon.com were taken seriously by their contributors. Overall, the reviews provided a remarkably accurate indication of whether or not a particular book was worth buying. The writer George Orwell once complained that reviewing too many books involved inventing reactions to books about which one has no spontaneous feelings. This makes the democratization of the process seem like a good thing."
CPE_14,"**Art in Modern Times**

In the last two hundred years, we often talk as if every artist must rebel against the art of their time. Art is admired for being unique, revolutionary, and even shocking. We like to praise artists whose work was not appreciated a hundred years ago. But when it comes to contemporary art, we hesitate and say an artist has gone too far, that what they do is no longer art. Or, more often, the media says it for us, and we agree because we expect art to be puzzling and new. We overlook the old themes, methods, and virtues present in today's art. We want artists to be different from us, with special talents and energy that break conventions. In the past, people went to artists with specific requests because art was part of everyday life. Today, we leave artists to their own ideas and get annoyed if they try to be more relatable.

**Picture This**

I will describe a situation and then ask an important question about it. I hope it doesn't seem too mysterious. But if it does, that's modern art for you. Here's the situation: An artist picks a piece of text from an art book. The text talks about the variety of pictures, asking, ""What are they all about?"" and then concludes, ""There is no end to the number of different kinds of pictures."" This sounds simple, but stay with me. The situation gets more complex. The artist asks someone to make a canvas, stretch it, and prepare it. Then, he asks a sign painter to write the chosen text on the canvas, instructing them not to make the lettering flashy or charming. The sign painter does this, writing the text in simple black letters on a white canvas. So, my important question is: Is the finished product a painting?

**Underground Encounters**

At the Mercury Gallery, London until 26th June

It is an unspoken rule for successful painters that once they find a profitable style, they stick to it. Collectors expect artists to continue in the same direction, and trying something new often leads to disappointment. I'm not sure why this is. Gallery owners prefer safe choices, and perhaps art buyers need the comfort of consistency. Some artists break the mold and succeed, like Picasso and Hockney. Eric Rimmington is another artist trying something new, and we will see if he succeeds. His new show moves away from the still lifes he is known for to paintings of the London Underground. Railways fascinate Rimmington. From drawings of Kings Cross Station in the 1980s, he logically moved to explore the underground world. These sketches inspired ""Underground Encounters,"" an exhibition of 40 paintings and drawings capturing the unique charm of this underground world for people on the move.

**Extract from a Novel**

I have come to this island with a few books. I don't know why I say ""escape."" The villagers joke that only a sick person would choose such a remote place to rebuild. So, I am here to heal myself, if you want to put it that way. Apart from the old peasant woman who comes from the village on her mule each day to clean the house, I am alone. I am neither happy nor unhappy; I feel like a hair or a feather in the cloudy mix of memory. I spoke of the uselessness of art but didn't mention its comforts. The comfort of my work with brain and heart is that only there, in the silence of the painter or writer, can reality be reordered and show its true meaning. Our everyday actions are like a rough cloth hiding the golden pattern underneath. For us artists, art offers a joyful compromise with everything that hurt or defeated us in life; it helps us fulfill our true potential through imagination. Otherwise, why should we hurt one another?"
CPE_63,"**Family Business**

""Look here, it's no good!"" said my Dad. We were driving back to London. My father, with my brother Maurice, had just picked me up from the fancy girls' school I attended. He had also just sat through Parent's Day, where I received the Latin prize and the prize for doing best in my exams. He had a long talk with my headteacher, and now we were heading home for the holidays.

""What isn't?"" I asked, though I had guessed what he was thinking from his unusual silence. He was usually a talkative man. ""You can't fool me. You'll do what you want now,"" he said. ""With all those certificates, I was told you will get a scholarship to Oxford.""

""So?"" I said, trying to be bold. ""Mightn't that be useful?""

""I also hear,"" he continued, and I knew a confrontation was coming, ""that you want to be a barrister. A barrister of all things!"" My father knew a lot about barristers and the law.

""I just said that,"" I replied. ""I couldn't think of anything else to say!""

""And apparently,"" he went on, ""you have the right personality - you can quickly understand a lot of information, you can talk well, and you enjoy performing.""

""I don't know about that,"" I said. ""All I know is what I see in TV dramas.""

""Be that as it may,"" he continued, ""I feel your heart's never going to be in the business now. Obviously, you'll go to Oxford University, and after that, I can't see you wanting it.""

The problem was that, like many children of family businesses, I felt trapped by family expectations. I saw other career options and wanted to explore them. At the same time, I didn't want to upset my father. I wasn't as scared of him as Maurice was - I was the favorite - but I found him intimidating.

""It's too soon to know,"" I said weakly.

""I tell you, you're not going to want to join us,"" said my father, who was often right about such things, ""and it's a pity because you've got the gifts - the brains, the nerves, the vision.""

""There's still Maurice,"" I said, sulking. My father snorted. We both knew Maurice hated the business.

""Anyway,"" I continued, ""you could always use me as a sort of consultant.""

My mother wasn't around to help - she had died early in my childhood, and my father had raised Maurice and me. Maurice was two years younger, and because he was motherless, I got into the habit of taking care of him. It wasn't a hardship. I loved Maurice. Because the business was successful, we lived in luxury - a big house in London, posh schools, nice clothes, parties, theatres, operas. My father knew all kinds of people - politicians, actors, businessmen - and our house was full of interesting conversations.

""I tell you what,"" my father continued. ""You can help us during holidays until you leave Oxford, and then if you decide to leave us, you can. It will give you some pocket money and be a real help to me.""

""OK,"" I said, relieved to avoid immediate decisions and especially the depression and sulks my father would fall into if I opposed him. This was how he controlled us.

So it happened. In my last term at school, and then during university vacations, I helped out, never more than twice a year, and always on the safer tasks. I became one of the smarter undergraduates, with a little house of my own, a small but powerful white car, designer clothes, and a black dress with a Paris label that I planned to wear for my final exams.

In my last term, my father visited me and took me to a village for a meal and a chat. There were only a few weeks left. My tutor predicted I would get a First Class degree (in Law), and I knew that if I stayed focused and used these last days wisely, he might be right. I felt poised, confident, concentrated.

This was not to be. My father told me that, in about a week, he needed me for one last assignment, the most important piece of business the family firm had ever attempted, and that it would be worth my while.

""But Dad,"" I protested, ""I've got my final exams coming up, and I need to concentrate on that. It's really important that I do well, and I don't want to think about anything else right now.""

I could tell that such pressures were beyond my father's imagination (or was he somehow jealous of my life away from him?) and that he would see a refusal as a betrayal in his hour of need. That was not all. As he described the procedures, I saw more clearly than ever before the single-mindedness of my father -- the clarity and resourcefulness with which he approached his work, the dynamic energy, the perfect self-control. In his way, he was a sort of genius, and I respected that in him. It made my own plans and hopes seem less important.

""All right,"" I said. ""I'll do it."""
CPE_56,"Simon Costello realized that buying the house in Pembroke Square was a mistake within a year of moving in with his wife, Lois. They could only afford it by being very careful with money, which made it a bad decision. At first, it seemed like a good idea because Simon had many successful cases, and Lois had returned to her job at the advertising agency shortly after their twins were born. She even got a raise, bringing her salary to thirty-five thousand. Lois was the one who pushed for the move, arguing that their flat wasn't suitable for a family, and they needed more space, a garden, and a place for an au pair. These needs could have been met in a less expensive area, but Lois wanted more than just space. She felt their old address wasn't suitable for a rising barrister and a successful businesswoman. 

To save money, Lois decided one of them should use public transport. Since her job was far away, Simon had to be the one to do it. The crowded tube ride made him resentful, and he often thought about his grandfather's house in Hampstead, where he had stayed as a boy. His grandmother believed in giving the breadwinner peace and comfort after a long day. But times had changed. Lois made it clear before they married that her career was as important as his. Their lifestyle depended on both their salaries.

Now, their situation was threatened by Venetia, who had come to their office in a bad mood. She accused Simon of knowing that a client, Brian Cartwright, had bribed jurors in a case four years ago and that Cartwright had given shares to Simon's fiancÃ©e before the trial. Simon denied it, but his denial was weak, and he felt guilty. He wished he had been prepared and could have given a better response. Venetia's anger and disgust puzzled him. He wondered why she felt the need to confront him and if her own actions were always perfect. He feared that if the accusation spread, even as a rumor, his career would be over."
CPE_36,"I chose this place to live, thinking I would be anonymous among people who didn't mind if the rented houses were falling apart or if the gardens were overgrown. But I was wrong. People in the shops soon start to recognize you. The roses next door remind me that the gardens were once loved. Usually, I stay inside trying to forget that it's summer, but tonight, I'm watching the swifts flying between the treetops and roofs. I've cleared some space in the garden for a chair, and my arms are scratched from the work. It's a small London garden where plants must grow tall to survive. 

My upstairs neighbor, Jaz, leans out of the window. She's written several unpublished manuscripts, and as an English teacher, I sometimes have to pretend to be interested. I have her latest one now. 'How's the work going, Jaz?' I ask. 'In no other job do you have to explain yourself so often,' she replies. Then she offers to bring a drink down. I don't want Jaz in the garden, and I realize it looks messy. The only way to the garden is through my flat, and Jaz is knocking on my door. 'You're on holiday now,' she says, sitting in the chair. 'I should've been a teacher - writers don't get holidays. They say, those who can, do, those who can't, teach.' And some can't do either. 'What plans for the holidays?' she asks. 

I feel anxious about the school year ending. Empty days. Hot pavements. The walk to the shops. The park with its fountain, and loneliness beside me on the bench. 'I'm going to Stonebridge tomorrow. Can you feed the cats?' I ask, my heart racing. 'Of course,' Jaz says, knowing she will be around. 'Where will you stay? A nice B and B?' 'No, with my oldest friend, Ruby, at the Rising Sun. We've known each other since we were eight.' It's not true, but I often deal with fiction. 'Going back to your roots. What do you think of my manuscript?' Jaz asks about her work, The Cruelty of Red Vans, which is half-read on my desk. I like the title and tell her so. I can see how red vans could be cruel, always bringing gifts to other houses and rejection letters to hers. I decide to be honest. 'Try writing about nice people for a change, people who try to be good,' I suggest. 'Teachers!' Jaz responds like a rebellious student. 'I keep a journal where I write something good about each day,' I say. 'Keep a journal! Nice people! Get a life, Ann.' 

Oh, I've got a life. I have my work, and I go out sometimes, reading on the tube. When we go inside, my calm kitchen reassures me. Then I remember my school geography teacher, Miss Tarrantine, who was about my age, winking as she said, 'I've had my moments.' We nearly died laughing."
CPE_6,"**Heritage**

Heritage is important because it connects people and communities to the past. We often feel connected to our personal heritage, knowing about our grandparents and their lives. Beyond personal stories, there is a broader need to learn about our past to understand our future, both individually and nationally. Heritage gives us a sense of continuity, helping us find our place in history. Just as we inherit genes, we inherit culture passed down through generations. Even if there are parts of our national heritage we don't like, it is still ours, and it is comforting to belong to something. Heritage teaches us a lot and is essential for our well-being, influencing everything from customs to material culture. Traditionally, we connected with the past through stories from our ancestors. However, Western industrial society disrupted communities, causing much of this oral tradition to be lost. Now, places and buildings provide clues to our past. It is crucial to preserve these links as a testament to our ancestors' identity.

**The Fens**

I started a novel, ""Waterland,"" where the landscape of the Fens in England became important. People often ask why I, a Londoner with no personal connection, chose to write about the Fens. The short answer is that I chose them for their apparent simplicityâ€”a flat and empty stage for my story. However, I learned that the Fens are neither flat nor empty. They are as richly English as any other part of England but also strangely unique. It's remarkable that in the middle of England, the Fens feel foreign to many English people, even when other distinct areas of Britain have become part of the nation's cultural heritage. The Fens are both empty and full, cultivated yet wild, open yet mysterious. My research for the novel wasn't extensive; I haven't visited places like Wisbech or Prickwillow. As a fiction writer, I prefer imagining worlds and making inspired guesses rather than seeking documentary proof. Imagining the Fens has its logic because, as Edward Storey's book shows, the Fens are not just a landscape but a state of mind.

**Museums**

Museums must make their collections accessible. In the past, this meant putting items in display cases with long labels that were hard to understand. Today, accessibility means more. Displays should be lively and interesting, using theatrical or architectural techniques to capture visitors' attention and evoke emotions. Museums should do more than just display items. They should make collections accessible to the widest community. For example, they can provide loan boxes of objects for teachers or use similar materials to help elderly people with memory loss. Museums focus on real artefacts and specimens, not replicas. They offer encounters with authentic items that existed and had meaning in history. This is their strength, setting them apart from heritage centres, theme parks, books, and digital media. Museums that embrace this challenge and offer exciting displays, catalogues, and outreach programs will find that virtual history can be an ally, creating a desire for the real experiences that only museums can provide.

**Architecture and Environment**

The desire to preserve things is not new, but changes in our towns happen so quickly and on such a large scale that most of us are affected. This turns some people into strong preservationists and makes others think more about the nature and future of towns. It can be argued that generations who lived through events like world wars are more inclined to preserve things than those before themâ€”anything that expresses stability becomes important. If there is a psychological need for preservation, planners should consider it. Change is not an enemy if we learn to manage it. Physical changes in our towns reflect social changes, such as changes in population, welfare, and demands."
CPE_33,"**Einstein**

If you ask someone to name a scientist, they will probably say Albert Einstein. His face is often used to sell products that are linked to intelligence, like computers and encyclopedias. Most people don't know much about what Einstein did, except that he created theories called 'relativity'. These theories are famous for being hard to understand and for making strange predictions that seem to go against everyday experiences. Einstein was part of a big change in scientific thinking, which started modern science in the 20th century. Scientists were trying to describe the universe in a new way by studying how matter and natural forces interact. Einstein made important contributions by rethinking the basics: time, space, matter, and energy. Before him, scientists followed Isaac Newton's idea that stars and planets moved in a fixed space and time. Einstein changed this idea, saying that time and space are not fixed but relative.

**Young Readers**

When we were children, Lydia and I didn't trust books that won prizes because we thought they would be 'worthy', which to us meant 'boring'. Our mother didn't like our attitude and would hint at her disapproval, but our father would happily give us small amounts of money to encourage us to read these books. He would also sneak in a few better-quality books among our Christmas and birthday gifts, marking them with 'This Book is NOT Literature'. Although we ignored most of his choices as 'boys' books', he did manage to introduce us to some good short stories and, once, a famous collection of poems.

**Language**

In 1851, Jacob Grimm wrote that 'The origin of human language is truly secret and marvellous'. This mysterious origin has led to many strange ideas. In 1928, Charles Caller claimed that early humans might have made sounds like ""meuh"" when they felt danger. ""Meuh"" sounds sad. Humans in dangerous lands with scary animals made desperate noises, and languages have kept some of these sounds, like 'malaria' meaning ""fever"" or the Latin 'mors' meaning ""death"". Because of such odd ideas, many people avoided the topic, thinking it was for eccentric thinkers. However, recently, the origin and evolution of language have become important research areas. Language likely developed in East Africa about 100,000 years ago. It was mainly used for friendly communication and was important in power struggles. Sharing information was probably not its original purpose, contrary to philosopher John Locke's idea of language as a 'great conduit' for sharing knowledge."
CPE_20,"Text: 'Writing Reviews Frank Kermode explores the art of writing reviews from a writer's perspective. Most reviews are created and shared under conditions that make them have a very short lifespan. There are deadlines and strict limits on their length. Once published, they last only as long as the newspaper or magazine they appear inâ€”maybe a day, a week, or at most a month. The temporary nature of reviews often defines their literary value. Many people, including the writers themselves, often think that reviewing is a task done out of necessity, like needing extra money, or because they can't spend all day working on a novel or a serious book. However, reviewing is a skilled and complex job. It's one thing to be concise and fair in a short newspaper review, and quite another to maintain a strong argument in a longer piece for international journals. The fifteen hundred words of a leading article in weekly magazines present challenges of both short and long reviews. Length isn't the only factor. Reviewers must consider their audience, from casual weekend readers to those deeply interested in the subject. A reviewer needs to know a lot about many topics and must write in a way that intelligent readers can understand and enjoy. This often means the reviewer also writes other things besides reviews. The American novelist John Updike, who views criticism as 'hugging the shore,' still enjoys writing reviews between his major novels. He collects all his reviews, even the short ones, into books with modest titles. While some might think lesser-known writers should accept the temporary nature of their work, it's understandable if they want some permanence, especially if they believe their best writing is in reviews. I feel this way about my own work. My main job has been academic, and most of my serious books are academic, the kind professors are expected to write. In the English-speaking world, unlike other cultures, there isn't a strict separation between reviewing and literary study, so it's common for the same people to do both. The days are gone when academics criticized professors for writing reviews, or for wasting time, or for not respecting their institutions. Complaints from non-professors that professors are taking their opportunities are also less common, partly because there is more reviewing work available now, and partly because the rewards are often small. I believe these arrangements benefit both readers, who can trust the reviewer knows the subject, and professors, as it helps them stay grounded. It also reminds them to communicate clearly with non-professors. When talking among themselves, they might use complex language, but when addressing intelligent non-professors, they need to be clear. Ultimately, reviewing is a secondary occupation. You can only do it well if you are also doing something else well.'"
CPE_40,"Ralph unlocked the door to his apartment and, as he entered the dark, still hallway, felt a brief unease about owning it. Even after three years, this feeling sometimes came over him when he returned alone at the end of the day. When he first bought the flat, he would come home eagerly, often as early as possible, wondering what the flat had been like while he was away. It felt like a welcoming place to him, where he was in control. He thought he should worry about intruders or leaks, but the flat always seemed to be waiting for him, either tidy or messy, depending on how he left it. Over time, he began to see it as just another part of himself, a space filled with his thoughts and feelings. He became frustrated with its inability to change. Sometimes, there would be a small pile of letters by the door or the answering machine would be blinking with messages. He was thankful that the windows hadn't been broken or the contents disturbed, though he wondered what it would look like if that happened. From his dull third-floor office on Holloway Road, Ralph often looked forward to his three or four quiet evenings at home each week. Once he left the artificial world of the office and felt himself returning on the bus ride home, he no longer needed to be alone, a fact he often forgot when planning his social life. At his desk, he would long for solitude, time alone with his belongings, but once home, he felt empty, waiting for a sense of self to return. Instead, he felt a deep emptiness, making him suspect that doing work he didn't enjoy had changed him, moving him away from who he thought he was. He would often read or listen to music as the night went on, but now he questioned why he did these things. His sense of direction was unclear, and ideas would come and go, unable to connect. There was a time, he thought, when he didn't feel this powerless, when he might have escaped if he had realized his own worth. But he had been eager to settle for something and followed the first path that seemed right. After university, he tried to make a plan for his future, but he wasn't surprised to find he only wanted to survive quietly. He applied for jobs he heard about from friends, following their paths without imagining he could find happiness in his work. He attended his only job interview gratefully and didn't think to question the positionâ€”a vague editorial role at a free local newspaper. He was relieved to have a pleasant conversation with Neil, his boss, and didn't consider the long meetings he now faced daily. Neil offered him the job immediately, saying Ralph was the only graduate who applied, which Ralph took as a compliment at the time."
CPE_45,"**Goat Racing**

I was about to see goat racing. It was Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. I pushed through ice-cream vans, crowds of people, food stalls, and loud music. Everyone was moving towards the racecourse, and I tried to find a good spot. A section was marked off for the race. It wasn't like big racecourses, but people stood on both sides of the track where the goats would run. They were trying to keep a few special goats in order, which is hard because goats are known to eat almost anything.

**Canoe Trip**

As the day ended, I started to worry about the night. The canoe was too wet to sleep in, and there was nowhere to stop. We hadn't seen any villages or huts since morning. In the dim moonlight, with our torch, we could barely see the cliffs. The torch batteries were dying, so we put in new ones, but they didn't work. We realized we wouldn't find a camping spot. A few miles later, Lesley shouted that she saw a flickering light, and we got hopeful. But it was just moonlight on the waves. Soon, we heard the loud noise of fast water, but we couldn't see what was happening. Time seemed to stop as we continued.

**How to be Presentation Perfect - we answer your questions**

I am not naturally good at making presentations, but as a managing director, I often have to present to my colleagues and major shareholders. How can I improve my presentation skills and confidence? 

You are not alone. Presenting requires different skills than running a company, but many senior executives need to be good at it. To convince your audience, you must believe in what you are saying. Show your belief with passion and enthusiasm. This means you need to prepare well. Test your ideas in advance. Ask colleagues to think of the tough questions your audience might ask. Also, create a positive atmosphere from the start. Begin with something everyone agrees on and slowly build to your main point."
CPE_64,"Some activities cannot be rushed; they need their own time. If you're late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you rush making mayonnaise by adding oil too quickly, it will curdle. If you pull too hard on a tangled fishing line, the knot will tighten. The mind also works at different speeds. Some tasks are done very quickly, while others take longerâ€”seconds, minutes, hours, days, or even years. Some mental tasks can be sped up, like solving puzzles or doing math in your head. But others cannot be rushed, or they will fail, like the mayonnaise, or become more complicated, like the fishing line. Saying 'Think fast; we need the results' can be as unwise as trying to sleep in half the time. We learn, think, and understand in different ways, and these mental processes work at different speeds, suitable for different tasks. 'He who hesitates is lost,' says one proverb. 'Look before you leap,' says another. Both are true. Generally, the mind has three processing speeds. The first is faster than thought. Some situations need an immediate, instinctive reaction. When my motorbike skidded on a wet road in London, my brain and body quickly reacted to keep me safe, and only afterward did my conscious mind catch up. A concert pianist or an Olympic fencer doesn't have time to think about their next move. This fast physical intelligence can be called our 'wits'. Then there is thought itself: the kind of intelligence that involves reasoning, weighing options, building arguments, and solving problems. A mechanic figuring out why an engine won't start, a scientist interpreting an experiment, or a student working on an assignment all use this type of intelligence, which relies on reason and logic. We often call this 'intellect'. Someone good at these tasks is called 'bright' or 'clever'. But there is another, slower mental process. It is often less focused, more playful, or dreamy. In this mode, we are thinking deeply or being contemplative. Sitting by the sea, lost in the sound of the waves, or just before sleep, we are in a different mental state than when planning a meal or writing a letter. This slow, seemingly aimless way of thinking is just as intelligent as the faster ones. Allowing the mind to wander is not a luxury to cut back on when life gets busy. On the contrary, slow thinking is an important part of our mental abilities. We need the slow mind as much as the fast one. Some problems are better solved with a slow mind. Some mysteries can only be understood with a relaxed, open mental attitude. Recent studies show that slower, less deliberate thinking is good for understanding complex or unclear situations. Deliberate thinking works well when the problem is clear. When deciding where to go on holiday, the options may be obvious. But when we don't know what to consider or which questions to ask, or when the issue is too subtle for conscious thought, we need the slow mind. If the problem is how to manage a difficult team at work, or whether to change careers, it might be better to sit and think than to search frantically for answers. This type of intelligence is linked to creativity or even 'wisdom'. Poets have long known the limits of conscious thinking and have tried to develop these slower ways of knowing. Philosophers have written about the parts of the mind beyond conscious thought. Only recently have scientists begun to study these slower ways of knowing. The field of 'cognitive science' is showing that the unconscious mind can do many interesting and important tasks if given time. It can learn patterns too subtle for normal consciousness, understand complex situations, and solve difficult problems better than the conscious mind."
CPE_29,"**Surviving in a Foreign Land**

I have been warmly welcomed. It's a friendly and well-equipped base camp in a very isolated place. At any time, there are about forty people - scientists, students, weathermen, satellite trackers - in a close community where everyone helps out. My basic French is just enough to communicate, but not to have casual conversations. I miss the subtle meanings, and my phrasebook is useless at breakfast. This isn't a practical problem for me, but at first, it affected my self-confidence. I found myself slightly dreading mealtimes. I would hesitate, worried about which table to choose, scared of the silence when I spoke, anxious like I hadn't been since my first weeks of school. I still smile awkwardly or panic when people talk to me. I think the reason for this occasional sadness isn't about losing company or communication; it's because I've lost the social advantage that my ability to talk has always given me.

**Elliot**

When I first met Elliot, I was just a young author like any other, and he didn't pay much attention to me. He never forgot a face though, and when I saw him here or there, he shook hands with me politely but didn't try to get to know me better. If I saw him at the opera, for example, and he was with someone important, he tended not to notice me. But then I had a surprising success as a playwright, and soon I noticed that Elliot was more interested in me. One day, I got a note from him inviting me to lunch, and I thought he was testing me. But after that, since my success brought me many new friends, I started to see him more often.

**Alfred Hitchcock**

The film director Alfred Hitchcock always said he didn't care about the subject of his films or the acting, but he did care about the photography, the soundtrack, and all the technical parts. For Hitchcock, it wasn't a message or a great performance that moved the audience; he believed people are excited by pure film, no matter their cultural background. So, if a film is made correctly, in terms of its emotional impact, the Japanese audience should scream at the same moment as the Indian audience. Hitchcock's view of himself was always clear, logical, and hard to argue with. He was a man of reason and a genius craftsman who liked to hear an audience scream. He didn't deal with speculation, abstract ideas, or intellectual hints, and his view of his own screen characters was not deep. He focused on film, pure film, and the most precise, calculated beauty of what a strip of film can do to an audience."
CPE_57,"**Amateur Astronomy**

Astronomy has changed a lot in the last 50 years. About 30 years ago, there were not many charts or catalogues. Telescopes were basic, and there were few books on how to do astronomy. Today, you can buy many types of telescopes and equipment. Electronic calculators and computers have changed how we make charts and analyze observations. This might be the best time for amateur astronomy. However, some things have been lost. Now, you might need to travel 80 km to find a sky as clear as it was in cities 50 years ago. During the day, airplane trails can last for hours and turn into clouds, making it hard to observe the sun and stars.

**Too Much Choice**

Society now has too many choices. There are too many things to do and too many options. In today's economy, people always want the newest product or service, and technology makes changes happen faster. New products come out quickly, making it hard to keep up. This can cause stress and make life feel disconnected. More choices mean more stress and less time. People are now looking for 'simplexity'â€”simple things that bring meaning in a complex world. But simplifying life is hard when there are so many products and services. There are more types of detergent and breakfast cereals than we need, and more software updates and phone plans than we can manage.

**McAndrews Hotel**

Every summer, we spend two weeks at McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. This is a family tradition started by my grandmother, and it has become very important to us. We do not let anything disturb this ritual. The guests at McAndrews are similar: old-fashioned and maybe a bit snobbish. I do not like the rude behavior of shop assistants today, which is seen as being equal. I dislike overly friendly waiters who seem like they might pat you on the back. I know most of the other guests' names because they have been coming here since they were children, like me. But I can be sure that when I see them in the hotel, we will only exchange polite greetings. Such respect for privacy is rare in hotels today."
CPE_9,"**Othello**

The move of an outstanding production of Shakespeare's play ""Othello"" from Stratford to London gives me a chance to correct a harsh review I wrote when the show first opened last spring. At that time, I said Ray Fearon was too young for the main role and criticized his acting. I still believe that changing the age difference between Othello and Desdemona alters the tragedy, but I take back my negative comments about Mr. Fearon's excellent performance. In fact, the entire cast is excellent. Memorable scenes include Cassio's competitive games with other young officers, which become dangerously intense, and the moment when Iago starts to lose control and struggles to regain it. I dare anyone not to be moved to tears during the scene where Emilia prepares Desdemona for bed. The pace and tension throughout the play are fantastic. Don't miss this production.

**Lake Vostok**

In the center of Antarctica, nothing moves. On the edges of the continent, there are many penguins, seals, and birds. But on the large white plateau inside, life cannot survive. Except, that is, in a huge hidden area of freshwater called Lake Vostok, which is under nearly 4 kilometers of ice, right below the coldest place on earth. The water has been cut off from air and sunlight for up to 25 million years. Biologists are eager to explore its mysterious depths and find out what strange organisms live there. Geologists and glaciologists are also very interested. For two years, researchers around the world have been planning how to uncover the lake's secrets, and if they succeed, the next few years will be known as the decade of Lake Vostok.

**Scientists**

There was an interesting discussion on the radio last week. It seems that a group of scientists are getting very excited about what motivates them to be scientists; the phrase ""because it's there"" comes to mind. We all know it's the age-old quest for knowledge, the desire to understand everything from atoms to black holes. But these scientists want to know why we want to know all of this in the first place and why science can't explain our curiosity. Surely, it's more important to know whether what we scientists are doing is right, rather than getting stuck in debates about the purpose of it all. I think the key issue is not why we pursue science, but to recognize that science is a tool, and we should decide how, where, when, and why to use it."
CPE_42,"**Food**

Our connection with food is basic and fulfilling. Many people who love cooking buy cookbooks like this one. Often, we think that cooking is only worth it for special occasions or complex dishes. This is not true. You can make a delicious soup by simply adding some chopped carrots, a leek, celery, and herbs to water. This is more satisfying than buying a packet or opening a can. Instead of buying a chocolate mousse with preservatives and additives, you can make a delicious dessert in five minutes that both adults and children will enjoy. Cooking is also a way to show care and love by bringing your own creation, no matter how simple, to the table. Sharing food is rich in symbolism and meets our deep human needs, which is why all our celebrations, like birthdays and anniversaries, happen around tables. No one would have a takeaway for a wedding or anniversary party! And few people would discuss a business deal over canned soup.

**In the Elevator**

This morning, Alistair tried to tidy his office, but papers were still everywhere. Tax forms were overflowing from drawers and boxes, waiting for a day when he felt like filing. Owning an apartment building added more paperwork. Books and journals were near the new bookshelves but not organized. As the elevator took him to his floor, he knew Mallory would be on time for their meeting. She would knock on his office door exactly on the hour. She was very punctual and neat. How would she react to the mess? She might think his office had been vandalized. He could pretend to be shocked when he walked in behind her. Mrs. Wilson, his cleaning lady, arrived while he was trying to clear some space on the carpet. He smiled at her hopefully as she unlocked his apartment door. Her eyes showed she had no intention of cleaning his office. She believed he was from somewhere far away, not from her familiar world in Brooklyn.

**KAREN**

Karen wanted to be different from her mother, which led her to create her own story of strength. A key moment in her life was when she was twelve, and her brother accidentally hit her in the eye with a golf club. She thought she was blind, but the bone protected her, as the doctor later told her. The club missed her eye, and she only needed a few stitches. When she opened her eyes in the doctor's office and saw her mother talking about miracles and small mercies, she felt she was saved for a purpose.

**Miss Fogerty**

Miss Fogerty was walking across the wet grass of the village green, feeling both excited and sad about what she had just seen. In a small community, it's thrilling to be the first to know something important, and her quiet life had little excitement. But she was deeply saddened by Dr. Bailey's condition. He had been her doctor for many years, helping her with her annual laryngitis. His best quality was making patients feel he had plenty of time and truly wanted to hear their concerns. This made him very dear to the village. He always gave his time, knowledge, and humor, and in return, he received loyalty and affection."
CPE_59,"Joanna's Lessons

Joanna MacGregor is a busy concert pianist. Despite her hectic schedule, she has started writing books for young children learning the piano. Her performances are so captivating that even someone with no musical sense would be moved. Watching her play is like seeing a pianist push human limits. However, at a recent concert for children, one boy was not impressed until she played ""Match of the Day."" For him, that was the real test of a pianist. Joanna found this amusing and easily played the tune, likely noting it for future children's concerts.

Joanna is unique among top pianists because she is interested in how young children learn the piano. She has published an elementary piano tutor for children called ""Joanna MacGregor's Piano World,"" despite her busy schedule. She is involved in many festivals, collaborates with young composers and artists, runs her own recording label, and often suggests joint projects with other artists. So why write a book? Joanna believes the first lessons are crucial. She thinks the music profession focuses too much on creating virtuosos, while most people have a more ordinary interest in music, which she finds more interesting.

Joanna's experience comes from teaching beginners between the ages of 18 and 25, before she became a concert pianist. Her childhood was filled with children learning piano from her mother, which influenced her belief that music should be accessible to everyone. She thinks everyone should have the chance to learn the piano, just like learning to swim or speak a little French. Some children progress quickly, but she is more interested in those who enjoy it for a while but often give up. This can happen at any stage, either because the beginning is frustrating or because of pressure to meet high expectations.

Joanna worries that some parents use music to make their children achieve, rather than just enjoy it. Children often quit because they feel they can't meet their parents' expectations. Her own training manual raises the question of whether she thinks existing tutor books or piano teaching are lacking. She is reluctant to criticize others but acknowledges that her books are not the only ones designed to make learning enjoyable. Her books include a storyline and CDs with accompaniments to make the first steps fun. She believes learning should be enjoyable and encourages improvisation and exploration of the keyboard.

As children progress, they need to be encouraged to read music rather than rely on their ear. Joanna, who relied on her ear as a child, understands this challenge. However, she believes practice is the most important factor. She admits she didn't practice rigorously until she attended the Royal Academy of Music, where she developed a contemporary repertoire that required practice. Now, she enjoys practicing for eight hours a day, which she considers the core of her musical life. She sympathizes with those who find practice difficult and believes it's important to plan what you aim to achieve. Her tips include treating yourself by playing through a piece, regardless of mistakes, and mixing hard with easy pieces."
CPE_54,"**Writing by Hand and on Screen**

Dr. Johnson once said, ""What is written without effort is in general read without pleasure."" This suggests that good writing is difficult. When I look back at my handwritten school essays, I notice there were few mistakes. Today, I would rewrite them many times. I think this is because writing by hand was hard work. Writing slowly made me think carefully. What was hard to change was written with care. On the other hand, using a computer can make us careless. Many writers find that the time spent fixing early drafts on a computer is similar to the time spent writing by hand. Also, emails, unlike handwritten letters, can be emotionally heavy. Some say emails have brought back the art of love letters. Many love emails are sent now, where before there was only small talk. That's a good thing. At least these emails are written in some form of English and grammar. But words on a screen can feel dull. Writers often don't realize the power of written words and may exaggerate. Words typed quickly lack the care and character of handwriting.

**The CD**

I put down my cup and looked at the CD. The case was not impressive, but the shiny disc inside was interesting. ""Wonderful little things, aren't they?"" Mr. Warriston said, coming back into the room. I agreed and carefully handed the disc to him. ""Amazing they can hold seventy minutes of music,"" he said, turning on the hi-fi device. He pressed a button, and a small drawer opened. He put the disc in, pressed the button again, and the tray closed. ""Some people say they sound sterile, but I think they..."" ""Do you have to turn them over, like records?"" I asked. ""What? No,"" Mr. Warriston said, standing up straight. ""No, you only play one side."" ""Why?"" I asked. He looked puzzled, then thoughtful. ""You know,"" he said, ""I have no idea. I don't see why you couldn't make both sides playable and double the capacity..."" He looked at the machine. ""You could have two lasers, or just turn it over by hand... hmm."" He smiled at me. ""Yes, good point."" He nodded at my wooden chair. ""Anyway. Come on, let's get you sitting in the best place for the stereo effect, eh?"" I smiled, happy to have asked a technical question Mr. Warriston couldn't answer.

**Books versus Electronic Text**

When comparing books and electronic text, author Malcolm Bradbury was right when he said that if matches had been invented after lighters, we'd be amazed at the improvement. Many people, excited by new technology, say electronic text is as important as the invention of printing and that it is almost complete. They forget that changes in how we think take a long time. This kind of thinking is called chronocentricity, the belief that our generation is at the center of history. For example, a book from 1979 predicted that books would start disappearing in the 1980s. So far, that prediction was wrong. Reading long texts on a screen is unpleasant, so most people don't do it. Also, the way information is organized on computers encourages people to read only parts of texts. Some say this leads to new ways of storytelling, but there's nothing new about reading non-linearly. Many books, like religious texts, dictionaries, and poetry collections, are not read from start to finish. What's new is that computers don't encourage reading a whole text.

**The Office**

Charles walked into the office and saw a perfect world of order. The carpet was clear of the papers that had covered it since it was laid down, and the desk was dark wood, just as he remembered from the auction five weeks ago. Neat file-holders were being put in their drawers. Twelve years of trade journals filled the shelves on one wall. Kathleen struggled to close the filing cabinet and then turned to him. ""You have to use computers, Charles. This is too much."" ""Hello, Kathleen. Oh, this is amazing."" He admired the room and its antique furniture. He wasn't thinking about a computer or any other machine in it, not even a pencil sharpener. ""Simply amazing,"" he said, avoiding the topic of computers. Over the two years he had known her, they had this conversation many times. She couldn't understand why he resisted technology when he was so good with computers and had even published an important paper on computer skills. She had inspired that paper. With a keyboard, she could change any software into something new and exciting."
CPE_32,"Text: ""You don't take sugar, do you?"" shouted his secretary, more stating a fact than asking a question. She had been making Lancelot coffee for many months, so she knew his preferences. Her excuse for forgetting was that he wasn't usually supposed to be there. However, he was there all the time now, realizing that staying away would lead to chaos. He often thought about how he had gone from being a valued advisor, meeting authors and playwrights over lunch, to a stressed worker with no parking space at work. ""This came,"" she yelled, waving a manila folder before placing it in front of him. ""From that guy in Los Angeles. You said you wanted to see it."" A typed label read: ""A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert."" Below it, ""An Expanded Synopsis."" Lancelot did not want to see another synopsis; he wanted a first draft. Ian Cuthbert had received a large advance for this book when Lancelot bought the company. Ian was one of several old friends Lancelot had mistakenly commissioned for books. Ian's unpredictable nature made him even less reliable. Lancelot skipped the introduction, which he had read many times, and glanced at the synopsis. He recognized almost every phrase. He closed the folder and set it aside, realizing Ian's manuscript might never come. The synopsis lacked the brilliance Ian was known for and felt uninspired. Lancelot recalled stories of a famous author whose last book was published incomplete after his death, coaxed from him chapter by chapter. But in that case, the payments were small parts of a hypothetical advance. Ian's advance had been huge, reversing the usual business practice of paying authors after they deliver a manuscript. Lancelot, who studied modern languages at Oxford, remembered when Ian was the most promising talent at Cambridge, a place so full of promise it made other places seem unimportant. Ian's peers had quickly taken over British theatre, but Ian's energy made theirs look lazy. He wore his coat like a cape and spoke of famous French writers as if he had met them. Yet, Ian's creative potential remained locked away. While others succeeded, Ian withdrew further. At the peak of his influence, he was already difficult to work with. Appointed to edit an arts magazine, he was overwhelmed by opportunities and never published an issue. His contract with a fashion magazine produced little but stories about his high salary, which increased in hopes of making him produce more, then anything at all. At editorial meetings, Ian was sharp-tongued and critical. Ten years later, he was unreliable even for his own funeral. Lancelot was close to admitting that ""A World History of the Short"" had been a mistake from the start."
CPE_65,"Text: 'England's breakfast revolution The importance of a good breakfast is clear according to health experts, but historically, breakfast is a relatively new concept in England. In medieval times, breakfast is rarely mentioned in literature. There are some references to travelers eating at dawn before long journeys, and to the sick having breakfast for health reasons, but most people did not eat breakfast unless they were royalty or nobles. However, in the sixteenth century, breakfast gradually became common. Some writers say this was because food was more available. However, they may not have considered other important social changes. For example, new work patterns might explain why breakfast became more important, as people started working set hours, often very early. So, having a meal in the morning became necessary and was no longer just for the wealthy.'"
CPE_61,"**Photography**

When a photographer takes a picture, they choose what to include based on their technical skills, artistic taste, personal views, and experiences, along with social and cultural norms. In this book, we will explore how these factors influence the style, content, and expression of a photograph, and how viewers perceive and react to these images. For instance, a newspaper reader might have an implicit understanding of the photos they see. However, instead of accepting the photo as it is, we might ask if it truly shows the scene as it was. Or, does it reflect the photographer's perspective? Is the exact moment captured important, or should the photo be seen as a symbol representing a situation in the world?

**More than a Game**

For me, sport has always been more than just a game. The most successful athletes have complete self-confidence. You need to focus entirely if you want to succeed in sports. There is only one way to be the best, and you must prioritize it above everything else. Sport is tough, and no one will do it for you. It's a matter of survival. Sport has taught me personal discipline and determination, but it also shows the value of teamwork. My sport allows and encourages individual excellence, yet it is a team game, and you must balance these two aspects. It's much like lifeâ€”you can succeed as an individual, but you must remember others around you. Sport has given me a lotâ€”not just money. It has opened doors for me and broadened my perspective, allowing me to see things worldwide that others may never see. But you also have to sacrifice a lot for those benefits.

**Tuning In**

Some experiences are so vivid that they become clear memories. For me, such a moment happened one night in California years ago. I lay awake, listening to a mockingbird singing beautifully from a hidden spot in a tall tree in the neighborhood. I don't usually have trouble sleeping, but the bird's amazing singing kept me awake. As I listened to its complex melodies, I felt drawn into a new artistic world. To follow the bird's patterns, I used my knowledge of jazz and Indian classical music. The bird convinced me I was hearing an incredible, spontaneous musical performance. I reacted with groans and cheers as each surprising musical variation came through the open window where I lay listening, until I finally fell asleep."
CPE_52,"Text: 'Love them, fear them, worship them, human culture has always had a lot to say about birds. But what does that say about us? Paul Evans reports there's a bump, bump, bump coming from the greenhouse as a little brown bird bounces against the glass. It's a wren: a bird with a lot of meaning, linked to predictions and messages. Is it trying to tell me something from a world beyond my imagination? Or is it just a bird stuck in a greenhouse? Both could be true, depending on your view. Wrens have been part of British culture for a long time. In medieval times, people believed the direction a wren flew could predict their luck. Today, the wren is still seen in pictures and ceramics in many British homes. Even if old beliefs have faded, the wren still holds a place in our minds and hearts. A forest without wrens feels empty. This is likely because there is a deep connection between us and many birds, going back to when people understood the world differently. When people relied more on nature for survival, they developed a way to communicate the importance of other creatures. This importance can change with culture, affecting how we see these creatures. A good example is the red kite. In the early 1500s, visitors to London were amazed to see red kites taking bread from children's hands. These birds were valued as city cleaners. But soon, they were seen as pests and almost disappeared, except in Wales. Over time, red kites became symbols of British conservation and were reintroduced to help them spread again. Our connection with animals goes back to human evolution. Early humans watched birds closely because they warned of predators, bad weather, and food availability, and also connected to the supernatural. But there's more to it. When we ask why birds matter to us, we also ask what it means to be human. Flight, song, freedom - our interest in birds reflects our identity compared to nature's wildness. Some might say these feelings are old and not needed now, but like the appendix and wisdom teeth, they're still part of us, and losing them is hard. That's why birds have become indicators of environmental change, showing ecological quality. Conservationists in Britain warn about 30 endangered species, which is sad not only because of the loss of unique birds but also because it's a cultural loss. Birds carry cultural meanings. For example, the skylark, turtle dove, and lapwing represent spiritual love, romantic love, and magic. Anyone who has read Shelley's poems, Shakespeare's sonnets, and Robert Graves's The White Goddess will feel sad about losing these once common birds. Yet, while we mourn these birds, the loss of others not in literature or folklore is often ignored. Folklore is important. The stories, legends, and rhymes that last over time, with their mysterious origins and changes, have a stronger connection to their subjects than scientific terms. This connection is strengthened by everyday language, giving them the power to evoke feelings and attitudes buried under modern life. Whether we watch wildlife films or birds in our backyard, the excitement we feel can't be fully explained by science. Birds are fascinating in ways we still struggle to understand, and the stories we tell about them help us interpret what birds might be telling us. The wren in the greenhouse creates a complex link, connecting the present with a deep past, holding the future in its song and escaping into it - a mystery that keeps me wondering.'"
CPE_28,"**Maps**

A map's main purpose is to show the relationships between points and features on the earth's surface using distance and direction. In the past, distance was often described in terms of time, like ""a day's journey by river,"" which told more about how easy it was to travel through the area than the actual distance. Direction was less important for travelers who mainly wanted to know ""Where do I go from here?"" and ""How far is it?"" Because of this, written travel guides were popular for a long time. Even today, some maps, like those of railway systems, might not show true directions. Early maps used signs to show landmarks, which varied in size to show their importance. The symbols used depended on the map's purpose and location, so understanding these symbols is key when studying old maps.

The history of map-making, or cartography, is about improving the accuracy of distance and direction and making maps more detailed. Cartography has used other sciences to help with this. For example, instead of using shadows or stars to find direction, people used the magnetic compass, which allowed for precise calculations. As knowledge of the world grew through exploration, attempts were made to map it. Astronomers found that the earth is slightly flattened at the poles, which led to more precise mapping of large areas.

Over time, the needs of map users changed. Travelers and merchants were no longer the only users. Soldiers, especially with the introduction of artillery, needed accurate maps to understand the terrain. This led to the invention of contour lines. Archaeologists, historians, and modern geographers also had specific needs. Today's cartographers map various distributions, like geological layers and land use. The recognition of maps' value in many sciences has led to a modern revival of cartography.

However, the development of cartography hasn't been smooth or continuous. There have been times of slow progress and rapid development, with old ideas coexisting with new ones. Cartographers often knew what was needed for progress but had to wait for better tools. Since copying old maps was easy and printing was expensive, map publishers were sometimes slow to adopt new ideas. Therefore, maps should not be taken as perfect evidence of the knowledge and techniques of their time.

The many maps we have today are the result of much human effort and thought. They are a valuable record for studying human history. This makes the study of historical cartography both fascinating and educational."
CPE_35,"**TIM RICE**

I was invited into a young man's drawing room, a calm and cultured space amidst a rather chaotic house where the less ambitious family members lived. Moving from the kitchen to his parlour felt like upgrading from economy to business class. This room held the largest collection of records I had ever seen, the first stereo record player and tuner I had encountered, and the surprising evidence of a teenager who had invested in Georgian wine glasses, pictures, and furniture. His name was Andrew Lloyd Webber. He had won a scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford, to study history, and had nine months before starting, during which he aimed to become England's answer to the composer Richard Rodgers.

My own dreams were just as wild; I wanted to be a pop star for the usual reasons: women, money, and fame. The difference between Andrew and me was that my dreams weren't a matter of life or death, though it's easy to say that now. They might have been if I had failed. So, when Andrew suggested a new crazy ambition for meâ€”to become as famous a lyricist as Oscar Hammersteinâ€”I was willing to try. This was partly because, within ten minutes of meeting, he played me three tunes he had composedâ€”I could tell he was very talented. As he confidently played selections from the many shows he had written and produced at school, I was reminded of the best show albums from my parents' LP collection. He needed a new lyricist for the outside world. I had little to impress him with, other than instant praise for his music and a genuine, released seven-inch single of a song I had written (both words and music) that an unknown pop group had recorded three months earlier.

We parted, promising to meet again and write something together. I was still more interested in the music charts than in West End theatre, but on the bus back to my flat, I told myself I had just met someone with rare talent and determination, and I would be foolish to miss the chance to work with someone who was clearly going to make a big impact on musical theatre, probably very soon. And even if we didn't succeed in challenging the top musical composers, we could try to compete with the Beatles and Rolling Stones later. The Everly Brothers had just made a comeback and would likely need new material.

The next day, back at my desk in the office where I was training to become a solicitor, the certainty I had felt about a life in show business with Andrew Lloyd Webber had faded a bit. I would, of course, continue to look at the small ads in Melody Maker for groups needing a vocalist and write a few more simple songs that wouldn't reveal the limitations of my voice, but it was still likely that I would eventually pass my exams and become a respectable lawyer by the time I was twenty-five. By then, I would surely have outgrown pop music, as my father confidently predicted I would by the time I was twenty-one. This was worryingâ€”if he was right, I only had a few more months to enjoy it. But in the meantime, I felt I had nothing to lose by seeing Andrew again. It would be fun to see a musical with him and to write lyrics that imitated musical lyricists rather than pop stars. Andrew was a fascinating person who talked about Good Food Guides and Victorian architecture, and he supported Leyton Orient football team.

I wasn't convinced by the idea for a musical he had been working on for the past year, but in 1965, I was rarely convinced about anything. His talent was undeniable, and he claimed to have all the contacts. I was soon back in his drawing room. The idea was the life of Dr. Thomas Barnardo, the nineteenth-century philanthropist who founded the orphanages that bear his name. His story was indeed worthy, but it didn't truly inspire me. The hero was too perfect, at least in Andrew's version, and the project was unoriginal in both concept and execution, owing too much to Lionel Bart's hit show, Oliver. On the other hand, Andrew's belief in his score's brilliance was infectious and not entirely unjustified. What did I know about musicals? As David Land, who later became my agent for over twenty-five years, memorably (and repeatedly) said, if there's a demand for one hamburger bar on the block, there's room for two. We could be the second hamburger joint.

I set to work with great enthusiasm, especially for the songs meant to be funny. Andrew outlined the plot, played me the tunes, and often gave me the title as well, most of which had likely been thought up by his former school friend who had already tried. I skipped a day at the solicitor's office, pretending to be ill, to write my first batch of theatrical lyrics. I didn't know it that day, but I had changed careers."
CPE_5,"**Language**

Humans have an amazing ability: we can communicate with each other using language. Language is so important to us that it's hard to imagine life without it. If you see two or more people together anywhere in the world, they will probably start talking. Even when alone, people often talk to themselves, their pets, or even their plants. I like to think of language as an 'instinct'. This means that people know how to speak naturally, just like spiders know how to spin webs. Spiders didn't learn web-spinning from a special spider teacher, and they don't need special skills to do it.

**Climate and Weather**

Climate and weather, created by the air around us, have a big impact on where animals and plants live. Climate can shape the look of landscapes. For example, warm and wet climates all year allow tropical jungles to grow, which are full of many different species. On the other hand, cold and windy areas have fewer living things. Weather patterns, which together form the climate, are caused by large masses of air moving and mixing. The atmosphere is always in motion. Some of this movement is because the air is on a spinning Earth, and it doesn't move as fast as the planet. The sun is another important cause of air movement.

**Coffee**

As a bar-person, I had to serve drinks and, more importantly, make coffee. In Lygon Street, Melbourne, a restaurant's success can depend on its coffee. I spent several days learning how to make coffee, especially how to clean and maintain the espresso machine. I also learned the key steps to make a perfect cappuccino. By the end of the first week, I realized making good coffee was harder than it seemed, and I thought I might be moved to simpler tasks like cleaning ashtrays. Fortunately, my boss was patient. ""Making coffee is both an art and a science,"" he said, ""and you need time to learn how to do it well."""
CPE_41,"**Art on TV**

Why does television often fail with programs about visual arts? Painting and sculpture should be perfect for TV, as the camera can show a whole artwork and then zoom in on details. However, few TV series successfully show both the joy and complexity of viewing art. A good example of this issue is Robert Hughes's series, ""American Visions."" Hughes is a reliable critic with a captivating personality, and he had almost eight hours to introduce British viewers to American art, which is often overlooked by British galleries. I expected the series to focus on great artworks, but it was more about how American history and culture are shown in its art and architecture.

**Dealing in Metals**

For 20 years, I worked as an international metals dealer and became known as a speculator. Metals markets are less regulated than others. With some luck, a willingness to take risks, and a good understanding of the market, one can make a lot of money. Risk-taking is essential in this industry. The adventurous culture fits well with a free-market global economy. However, free-trade economists who believed the market would keep metal prices stable have found the opposite. More minerals are being extracted, and raw material costs are decreasing. Considering inflation, most metal prices are about half of what they were 20 years ago. Recently, I was asked to investigate claims against a multinational company benefiting from these cheap raw materials.

**Extract from a Holiday Brochure**

Abaco and its offshore cays are part of the 700 islands of the Bahamas, stretching from Florida past the Tropic of Cancer to Cuba. Each island has its own character and offers something unique. To get around the islands and cays of Abaco, a boat is essential. If your room doesn't include one, don't worry. There are many ferries and water-taxis. You can also rent a boat if you prefer to travel independently. Sailing is the most popular way to get around here. Abaco is called 'The Sailing Capital of the World' for a good reason. The calm, naturally protected waters are perfect for fishing, diving, snorkeling, and swimming. The cays and their beaches stretch for 200 miles like a string of pearls. It's not just at sea where treasures are found. At night, the lights of the restaurants and cafes of Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay sparkle."
CPE_69,"**Build Your Own Bamboo Bike at the UK's First Workshop**

At the Bamboo Bike Club, run by engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan, you can join a course to build your own custom bike frame. It's a Saturday morning in Hackney Wick, east London. The only sign of life among the small factories is the sound of machinery from an upper window. Work has started at the Bamboo Bike Club, the only place in Britain where you can build a bamboo bike. I've come to see what's happening. There's a lot of energy and fun. This isn't like any woodwork class you've seen before.

Bamboo is becoming popular in bike construction. Companies like Calfee Design in California and Bamboo Bikes in Yorkshire are bringing back a method first used in 1894. The problem for most cyclists is the cost. A ready-made bamboo frame from these companies costs $2,995, or Â£1,868. This, along with the design challenge, inspired James and Ian to spend years working in a shed in Brecon, Wales. They wanted to create a bamboo bike business with affordable products for the average cyclist. After developing a marketable product, they realized they were on the wrong path. ""We realized we didn't just want to sell frames. We wanted to share the joy of making something unique and sustainable,"" James explains.

The result was more of a community than a company. The Bamboo Bike Club is still a side project for James, who makes wind turbines, and Ian, a civil engineer. They offer monthly courses where you can get a custom bike frame and enjoy a weekend of bike-building at a competitive price.

As someone who often fails at DIY projects, I was concerned about quality. On the first day, James and Ian explain how to choose bamboo for strength and form strong joints. Tubes are lightly glued in place: first, the front triangle with 40 mm diameter bamboo, then the thinner seat and chain assembly. Alloy tubes are used for parts needing more strength, like handlebars and wheel forks. Using jigs, power tools, and design blueprints is a challenge for someone used to assembling flatpack furniture. Accurate cutting for clean joints can be tricky. James and Ian supervise every step and help if needed. The self-build is a big draw for many participants, most of whom are engineers. Ian reassures that everyone makes mistakes. No problemâ€”just try again with another piece. Bamboo is forgiving. Each piece is pre-checked for quality, allowing you to focus on aesthetics: plain, black, or mottled bamboo.

Sunday is more relaxed, mainly spent building the lugs, or rather, wraps. Hemp bindings are wrapped around the joints and glued with epoxy resin to form a strong bond. A final polymer coating makes the bike waterproof. It's ready for wheels, brakes, gears, and personal touches. The bike is built to last, as strong as metal ones. Ian has ridden his for over a year on a 16-mile commute, while James has tested one off-road for three months without breaking it. ""Our bikes are over-engineered, but I prefer it that way,"" James says.

How does a bamboo bike look? A bit scruffy compared to professional frames, as the hemp weave can resemble parcel tape. But they are unique, which is the point, say James and Ian. Personally, I think a bamboo bike should be for relaxed rides, not racing. I choose a 'Classic English' frame for a gentle ride. They ride well too. I try James's bike, and it's light, stiff, and smooth, thanks to bamboo's ability to absorb vibration. Impressive, considering I hit every pothole. ""Some people love the build, but for me, these workshops come together when the bike is on the road,"" James says. ""They're so light, so effortless to ride. So much fun to ride too."" And the price? Less than Â£500."
CPE_38,"**Self-help Books**

Dione Reverend was just an editor at Random House in New York when she first saw a manuscript by an unknown pop psychologist, Dr. John Gray. ""I took one look at the title and knew it would be a number one bestseller,"" she says, laughing, and she was right. Dr. Gray, who is very understanding, is now a multimillionaire, and Dione Reverend has her own company. Dr. Gray's book on how to improve communication between men and women is a key part of a large and growing self-help industry. This industry claims to meet many of America's desires for self-improvement. It also benefits from these desires, creates many more, and supports the New York publishing world. As Britain is discovering, this genre can fill entire shelves with books as exaggerated as their covers, but there are worse. For every self-help book published, thousands are rejected for being too similar to others or too specialized. This is a small relief. As a new type of editor-agent looks for the next big hit, writing style is the last thing on anyone's mind. Marketability is everything. ""How promotable is the author? What's the 'hook'? Is it universal enough?"" Ms. Reverend lists the key questions, then admits: ""If someone comes to me with a really catchy title, that's two-thirds of the battle won. You know you can reach people.""

**Autobiographies**

There must be an unspoken agreement, a pact, between an autobiographer and the reader that the truth is being told. Such a pact is, I would guess, rarely fully kept. There are many reasons why the writer might not tell the whole truth. There may be actions or thoughts that he feels are too shameful to share. There may be things he decides not to write down because he thinks they are not important enough. There are also more complex reasons for secretly breaking the pact. The autobiographer might think that the ultimate goal of the work, the truth about himself, can be better served by inventing stories that capture the truth more clearly than sticking strictly to the facts. Or he might decide from the start never to stick to the truth. He might call his book an autobiography just to make the reader believe it is true, which will help him in his storytelling. Some readers might still believe they have read a true story, even when it is fiction. All of this can be done without any particular intention to deceive.

**Dashiell Hammett's Detective Stories**

Experts on detective stories have explained the popularity of this genre as a reflection of the conflicts in late nineteenth and early twentieth-century society. The detective story is essentially a symbolic story. The crime represents some basic human desire like lust or greed, and solving it, at least in traditional stories, symbolizes the return of the individual to society, with its lawless desires controlled so that society can function smoothly again. In Hammett's unique version, society is restored to its previous state, but that state is shown to be corrupt and false. The hunter and the hunted in Hammett's stories are two sides of the same personality. The private detective and his target understand each other and are, in a strange way, comfortable with each other. The private detective is part of both worlds. From the criminal's point of view, he is a bit too honest, and from the law's point of view, a bit too shady. He is both a criminal and a competitor. The private detective's mission is sometimes affected by his sense of being involved, and sometimes his desire to punish is increased by his worry about this ambiguity.

**Science Writing**

Today's greatest scientific essayist is Stephen Jay Gould. To talk about that art and hear his advice, I met him in an unusual setting: at the Grand Hotel (where he was staying while promoting his new book). Neither of us, it must be said, felt very comfortable there. As for writing a piece set in such a lifeless and self-important place, Gould said: ""I couldn't do it: Trollope might, but he knew the culture. And knowing the culture is central to being a successful writer. Science, for example, is a civilization of its own. As a result, only scientists can do a good job of presenting it. If you don't live in the community and don't understand its rules, you are at a disadvantage from the start."" One of Gould's principles is: never talk down to the reader. ""Make no concessions,"" he says. ""You can simplify the language but must never weaken it. Above all, you cannot simplify the argument. Once readers notice that they are being talked down to, your piece is dead."""
CPE_17,"**Air-conditioning**

At Cannons Gym, a popular spot for City of London workers during lunch, the air feels cold. To cope with this summer's unusually high temperatures, the gym has used too much air-conditioning. At quieter times, it feels as cold as the Arctic. This is an example of how modern society often misuses air-conditioning. It has become a key part of work and leisure, showing how humans can control or change the climate. However, many air-conditioned buildings could use other cooling methods. They could use daylight and natural ventilation and have thicker walls that absorb less heat during the day and release it at night. These ideas might seem simple, but they can be very effective and would greatly reduce the need for air-conditioning.

**Sundials**

It is likely not a coincidence that the start of a new millennium has brought renewed interest in sundials, which measure time based on the sun's position. A hundred years ago, they were essential for keeping clocks accurate. As clocks and watches improved, sundials became garden ornamentsâ€”romantic and intriguing, but outdated in a modern technological age. Now, interest in them is growing again. David Harber, a sundial maker, believes their charm comes from their connection to the planets. He says there is a magical moment when a sundial starts working. They are calm, romantic objects that remind us of our place in the universe.

**Paint Your Own China**

My idea of china-painting came from a visit long ago to an arts and crafts show where serious-looking older women showed how to paint delicate flowers on a teacup with precise brushstrokes. It was fascinating because each stroke created a perfect petal or leaf. Their hands were steady, the paint never smudged, and it seemed these women had either practiced for years or had a natural talent for precision. Remembering this, I wondered who would dare to take a china-painting course. Would beginners show natural artistry? In reality, the atmosphere was not intimidating. The students were there to have fun, and even the teacher did not want to paint petals on teacups as quickly as I remembered."
CPE_47,"Uncle chose a package holiday for them at a good price: a flight from Gatwick Airport, twelve nights in Venice, staying at the Pensione Concordia. When Keith and Dawne went to the travel agency to book, the clerk mentioned that the other people in their package were a school group learning Italian. But something went wrong. Either at the travel agency, the check-in desk, or in a computer, a mistake happened. Dawne and Keith ended up in a hotel called the Edelweiss, in Room 212, in Switzerland. At Gatwick, they gave their tickets to a girl in a yellow-and-red Your-Kind-of-Holiday uniform. She checked their details and said everything was fine. An hour later, they were surprised to hear people on the plane speaking with North of England accents. Keith thought there might have been a cancellation or the Italian class was on another plane. They ordered drinks. 'The coach will take us on,' a stout woman with glasses said when they landed. There was no mention of an overnight stop in the brochure, but when the coach arrived at its destination, Keith thought it was just a stopover. It was almost midnight when they got off the coach, tired and not questioning their right to the beds offered. But the next morning, when they realized they were staying there for the whole holiday, they were worried. 'We have the lake and the water birds,' the receptionist explained with a smile. 'And we can take the steamer to Interlaken.' 'There has been a mistake,' Keith told the man, trying to stay calm. He knew his wife was anxious beside him. 'We were supposed to be in Venice, at the Pensione Concordia.' 'I don't know that name, sir. This is Switzerland.' 'A coach is supposed to take us on. An official said so on the plane. She was here last night, that woman.' 'Your group is booked for twelve nights at the Edelweiss Hotel. To change now, sir, if you have changed your minds -' 'We haven't changed our minds. There's been a mistake.' The receptionist shook his head. He didn't know about a mistake. 'The man who made the booking,' Dawne said, 'was bald, with glasses and a moustache.' She gave the name of the travel agency in London. 'Is there a problem?' a woman asked, smiling at Keith. She was the stout woman he thought was an official. They had seen her talking to the girl at Gatwick. On the plane, she walked up and down the aisle, smiling at people. 'My name is Franks,' she said. 'I'm married to the man with the bad leg.' 'Are you in charge, Mrs. Franks?' Dawne asked. 'We're in the wrong hotel.' She gave the name of the travel agency again and described the bald clerk. Keith interrupted. 'It seems we joined the wrong group. We reported to the Your-Kind-of-Holiday girl and left it to her.' 'We should have known when they weren't from Dover,' Dawne added. 'We heard them talking about Darlington.' Keith made an impatient sound. He wished she'd let him talk. 'We noticed you at Gatwick,' Keith said. 'We knew you were in charge.' 'And I noticed you. I counted you, although you probably didn't see me. Now, let me explain. Your-Kind-of-Holiday sends clients to many places, with different holidays at different prices. There are villa holidays for the adventurous under-thirty-fives, treks to Turkey, and treks for singles to the Himalayas.' 'What I'm trying to say is that all tickets and labels are similar, yellow with two red bands.' Mrs. Franks laughed. 'So if you just followed others with the yellow-and-red label, you might end up in a wildlife park! But of course,' she added, 'that couldn't happen in a million years.' 'We're not supposed to be in Switzerland,' Keith insisted. 'Well, let's see, shall we?' Mrs. Franks unexpectedly walked away, leaving them standing. The receptionist was no longer at the desk. They heard typing. 'She seems kind,' Dawne whispered. Keith wasn't listening. He tried to remember everything: giving the girl the tickets, sitting down to wait, the girl leading them to the plane, the pilot's voice welcoming them, and the air hostess checking seat belts. 'Nice to have young people along,' an elderly man's voice interrupted Keith's thoughts. 'Nottage is the name.' The old man's wife was with him, both looking in their eighties. They'd slept well, she said, the best night's sleep in years, thanks to the lakeside air. 'That's nice,' Dawne said. Keith walked out of the reception area, and Dawne followed. Outside the hotel, they didn't mention the irony of the situation. On their first holiday since their honeymoon, they ended up on a tour with elderly people, when the whole point was to escape the needs of the elderly. Uncle had said so himself when they tried to persuade him to join them."
CPE_48,"Text: 'HE WAS A PEOPLE PERSON American executives are adopting the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton as a model of good management. Eluned Price reports. Most people in Britain know who Sir Ernest Shackleton was and have a rough idea of what he did. America, however, has only recently discovered him. The Wall Street Journal described Shackleton earlier this year as 'an Antarctic explorer whose feats went all but unnoticed for most of the 20th century,' which might be an exaggeration. But now Americans are showing great enthusiasm for him. Biographies and accounts of the voyage of the Endurance are being produced and are expected to sell quickly; the American Museum of Natural History is organizing a major exhibition, and Columbia Tristar is making a film about Shackleton's life. Some American managers have also adopted Shackleton as a role model. His admirers share stories of his achievements with admiration; they draw lessons in leadership and communication for modern business, and insiders refer to each other as 'speaking Shackleton'. The determined, resourceful Shackleton, with his reindeer sleeping bag (fur inside) and blubber-stove, has become a model for modern management consultants. Jim MacGregor, the managing partner of Abernathy MacGregor Frank in New York, chose Shackleton as a role model years ago. His firm specializes in 'communication aspects of mergers and acquisitions and corporate crises'. Such as? Such as 'this firm's plant blew up' or 'half the workforce has to go'. While not forgetting that Shackleton worked in public relations for a Glasgow steelworks, it may be a bit difficult to see the connection between surviving on the last bit of albatross in freezing temperatures and managing a crisis in a company. 'Even if a company handles its crises well, it can still cause problems by communicating poorly about what it's doing,' says MacGregor. 'Shackleton is a model for management because of his qualities as a leader and communicator. He had his values in order. He was at his best when he and those dependent on him had a great deal to lose -- such as their lives. In some ways, the most fascinating decision Shackleton made was to turn back when only 97 miles from the South Pole. That trip explained his credibility for the next one: the lives of his men were paramount.' This refers to Shackleton's expedition to reach the South Pole in 1908 when, 97 miles short of their goal, with unforeseen delays draining their supplies and limited time to get back to their ship, Shackleton made the courageous and difficult decision to turn back. In a crisis, says MacGregor, people want to know someone is in charge. Whereas now the tendency is for managers to avoid responsibility, Shackleton was prepared to stand up and accept it. His 1914 expedition became legendary. His ship, the Endurance, drifted for nine months in the pack ice and was finally crushed by ice floes. When it finally sank, Shackleton told his men, 'we should all eventually reach safety provided that you continue to do your utmost and to trust me'. From all the accounts and diaries they kept, it is clear that there was never a time that the Boss was not in charge. 'Shackleton thought everything through, planned for every possibility, kept his men continually informed, and sought their opinions,' says MacGregor. 'He was adaptable, willing to let go when something was lost and start afresh. We've built an effective set of principles here that Shackleton illustrates. Clients can relate to his story without feeling they're being criticized.' Shackleton believed that an explorer needs optimism, physical endurance, and patience. 'One of the hardest things to do in desperate situations is nothing, especially in America, a culture that is strongly against letting time sort things out,' says MacGregor. 'If you buy bonds and guess wrong on the interest rates, you hang in there and eventually you'll get your money back. To ""fix it"" and sell up would mean a huge loss. Equally, don't be afraid to change your plans if they're not working. If a new product's a failure, don't keep selling it.' Shackleton led by example. On the voyage back from the Endurance, he noticed Hurley, the expedition photographer, gloveless. He forced his own on Hurley, saying if he didn't put them on he would throw them overboard. Someone else remembered him doing the same thing with a biscuit when they were near starving on the 1905 expedition: 'He said he'd leave it in the snow. Millions of pounds couldn't have bought that biscuit.' As Caroline Alexander, author of Endurance, the human account of that expedition, says: 'The public appetite for heroic endeavor is increasing. Shackleton exposes the fact that there is nothing heroic going on now. Everything else falls away and he is left standing, the genuine embodiment of the ideals that we are so wistful for nowadays.'"
CAE_15,"**Tapping into a Food Supply**

In the forests of Madagascar, there is a primate called the aye-aye that has a lifestyle similar to a woodpecker. Both the woodpecker and the aye-aye search for insect larvae by boring into wood. The woodpecker uses its beak to chisel and its long tongue to catch insects. The aye-aye uses its sharp incisor teeth to gnaw into the wood and its long, thin third finger to scoop out the insects.

Although the aye-aye's unique feeding method was described over a hundred years ago, scientists have only recently discovered how it finds insects hidden inside the wood. Dr. Carl Erickson from Duke University's Primate Center studied the hunting skills of two male aye-ayes, Nosferatu and Poe, a female named Samantha, and her young daughter, Annabelle.

Dr. Erickson tested if the aye-ayes found insects by looking for visual signs, like holes on the wood surface where insects might have entered. He gave them logs with several drilled holes. Some holes led to cavities with mealworms, while others were empty. The aye-ayes went directly to the cavities with food, showing they didn't rely on visual clues.

Dr. Erickson then considered if the aye-ayes used smell or sound to find the insects. However, tests showed they didn't use these clues either. They could find mealworms even when the smell was blocked, and they located dead, silent mealworms too. 

So, how did the aye-ayes find the insects? Dr. Erickson discovered that they could sense the cavities themselves. When searching for food, an aye-aye taps the wood with its middle finger and focuses its large ears forward. Dr. Erickson suggests that the aye-aye uses echo-location, listening for echoes from the taps that indicate a hollow space below. It might also hear insects moving when disturbed by the tapping.

The idea that the aye-aye fills the role of woodpeckers in Madagascar's forests is interesting. However, there are birds like the Sickle-billed and Nuthatch Vangas that also search for insects in wood, so the woodpecker role might not be empty. The aye-aye can be seen as a mix of a woodpecker and an echo-locating bat. It also behaves like a squirrel, as its incisors grow continuously, and it has been seen in the wild gnawing through nut shells and using its long finger to extract the nut meat."
CAE_19,"**Ordinary People, Ordinary Lives**

Most of us have photos of our grandparents, but how many of us know what their lives were like when they were young? Diaries give us only small, incomplete glimpses, and family stories are often half-remembered. What will our grandchildren know about us? We often plan to write things down but never do. We might leave videos instead of photos, but they are still just images.

Hannah Renier has a solution: she writes autobiographies for other people, creating a hardback book of at least 20,000 words, with illustrations if needed. These are not stories of famous people, but of ordinary ones. The idea came to her when she talked to her family and realized how much of the past was disappearing. ""When I started, I didn't take it as seriously as I do now,"" she says. ""People say they do it for their children or for the future, but they also enjoy it themselves.""

The promise of confidentiality helps people be honest. A 62-year-old man, who made and lost a fortune before making another, said, ""I was surprised at what came out. There were painful things, like my divorce."" He did it for his family, hoping they might learn something, but hasn't let his children read it yet. ""If they insist, I'll let them. But I'd rather they read it after I'm gone.""

He also noticed patterns from his childhood that led to repeated mistakes. Ms. Renier has seen this in others too. ""It's amazing how many people are influenced by their parents,"" she says. ""The things parents say and do affect their children for life. People often marry someone their parents would approve of, or they rebel and do the opposite.""

Many people still feel disappointed about things that happened with their parents, even 60 years later. They try to impress a parent who wasn't impressed, and some seek permission to express their true feelings. Ms. Renier is more of a recorder than an inquisitor. ""It's not for the public, and I'm not there to pry. People sometimes tell me things and then hesitate, but I include it anywayâ€”they can remove it later if they want. Generally, people want to be honest.""

""It's not vanity publishing,"" she says. ""It's not about having an interesting life that the world needs to know about. Things are changing fast, and we're losing touch with the past. This gives us roots and a link to our ancestors. People want a little immortality.""

Each book involves up to 30 hours of recorded interviews, which Ms. Renier uses to write the life story, rearranging and interpreting the events. Modern technology allows her to produce everything except the binding with gold lettering. You can choose your own cover color and title. The books are fascinating to the private audience they are meant for and are not about revealing secrets at any cost. Ms. Renier organizes the material logically and writes well, so the final product is as good as its subject. The book looks high-quality and costs nearly Â£3,000, with extra copies at Â£25 each. She gets about 10 inquiries a week, but the cost, due to the time involved, deters many people. ""I thought it would be a more affordable product,"" she says. ""But the people I've worked with are often from well-off backgrounds, like readers of Harpers & Queen, where I advertise. They're the kind of people who would have had their portraits painted for their descendants."""

The Museum of Classical Archaeology has one of the few remaining collections of Greek and Roman sculpture casts in the world, with over six hundred pieces. Remember, none of the sculptures here are original. They are all precise replicas made from the originals, mostly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Museum is located in a specially designed gallery with excellent natural light. Plaster casts have many benefits: sculptures that were originally displayed together but are now in different museums across Europe can be seen together as they were meant to be. You can view nearly all the famous Greek and Roman sculptures in one afternoon.

The collection includes over 400,000 oblique and vertical air photographs taken by university staff over the past 45 years. The University has its own aircraft at Cambridge Airport and conducts photographic work throughout Great Britain. The photographs are of great interest as they provide a detailed, year-by-year record of the landscape, showing both the natural environment and human activity from prehistoric times to today. There is a small display in the entrance hall, and the knowledgeable library staff can help with inquiries. The photographs cannot be borrowed, but copies can usually be purchased. These are made to order and typically take about a month.

**E. Cambridge Medieval Brass Rubbing Centre**

The Cambridge Brass Rubbing Centre is the second oldest and longest-running center of its kind in the world, and it is one of the region's most unique tourist attractions. Visitors can enjoy creating wall hangings by rubbing one of over a hundred different brass plates from the tombs of medieval knights and ladies. By making resin copies, known as facsimiles, the center has preserved the originals while making brass rubbing accessible to everyone. Brass plates, an alternative to tomb statues, spread from Germany across medieval Europe and Scandinavia. Many beautiful brasses were destroyed during various revolutions, but most of the remaining ones are in Britain, and the widest range can be seen at the Cambridge Centre."
CAE_13,"**From Here to Paternity**

**A. The Theatre Director**

Due to my unusual personal life, which I can't really be proud of, I've had 35 years of small children, and I've loved every moment. I fed the baby this morning, and for me, that's what being a father is all about. I'm very lucky with my children. We all enjoy the same things: opera, theatre, books, music. This creates a strong bond, especially now that they are mostly grown up, and I've become more of a friend than a father. I don't believe in physical violence. I've slapped my children in anger, but I don't support it. I may not have been a very attentive father, but I've always tried to be available. I'm here if they need me, always on the condition that they call me. If you start chasing them to ask why they haven't been in touch, you create a terrible burden of guilt. My parents did it to me, and I would never do it to my children.

**B. The Advertising Executive**

I was young when they were born, only about 25, and I admit I found the responsibilities and limitations quite annoying. It made me age quickly, but it also kept me young, which I have always valued. As they became teenagers, they introduced me to things I might have drifted away from: music, youth culture, clothes. In a funny way, that has been invaluable for running the agency. I've never felt out of touch. Because I was trying to establish the business when they were young, I missed things like first concerts and sports days. I'm sad about that, but there are benefits now, like being able to take them on holidays to the south of France. They get along well with many of our friends and come to parties and advertising awards ceremonies with us without feeling intimidated. I think it's an advantage that I do something they see as glamorous and interesting.

**C. The Politician**

My first child was born just as I was about to be elected to the Greater London Council, and the others followed quickly. My wife and I promised to make time for them, but as I became more politically active, time became a real problem. I insist on only accepting weekend meetings and public appearances where there are facilities for one or more of the kids to come with me. If I didn't, they would just be left out. This way, they have a sense of what I do when I'm not with them, and there's no feeling of Daddy disappearing. I've noticed more MPs bringing their kids to the House. Maybe we're all becoming more aware of the need to involve our children in our lives.

**D. The Writer**

My first marriage ended when Kate and Bonnie were quite young, so I had to look closely at fatherhood. I made great efforts to stay in touch with the children. My ex-wife and I even tried living next door to each other for a while, so they could come and go as they wished, but I think Kate and Bonnie would say now that they found that quite confusing. Kate has said in interviews that I was always there for her, but I'm not sure I was a very good father. It's true I was around a lot, but like many parents in the Seventies, I think I treated the kids as adults too soon. Kate was complaining the other day that we were too liberal. I think I could have introduced more systems, more order. Instead, I took a very loose approach. I regret that now. I still worry about my older daughters as much as I do about my youngest. In that way, your kids never leave you.

**E. The TV Presenter**

I was ready for kids. I'd hit 30, met my wife, we had a lovely house, so we thought, ""Why keep spending our money on new sofas every Saturday when we could have a kid instead?"" Having my daughter Betty has forced me to come to terms with who I am. You feel you're doing something very special when you have a child, and you are. But you're also becoming just one more parent in a long line of parents. It's a great equalizer. I do resent it occasionally, but if there's ever a moment of irritation, it's dispelled by just one look at her. A baby's smile is the greatest self-preservation mechanism in the world. It can melt a grown man."

CAE_46,"**Science Defying Gravity**

Journalist Tom Mumford joins students testing their theories in weightlessness. From the outside, it looked like a regular aircraft. The pilot informed the young passengers that it was a Boeing KC-135 refueling tanker, built in 1964, based on the Boeing 707 passenger plane. However, appearances were misleading, and the 13 students from Europe and America who boarded were in for an extraordinary flight. Inside, it was a long white tunnel with almost no windows, lit by lights along the padded walls. Most seats were removed, except for a few at the back, where the nervous young scientists sat. For a year, they had competed with other students to join this flight. The European Space Agency challenged them to propose creative experiments to conduct in weightless conditions. Those with the best ideas won a spot on this unique flight, which can be described as an extraordinary roller-coaster ride. For the next two hours, the Boeing's flight would mimic a giant bird's erratic path, soaring upwards and then plunging towards Earth. The goal was to achieve a brief state of weightlessness at the top of each curve. As the pilot cut the engines at 3,000 meters, the aircraft continued to rise due to its momentum before gravity pulled it back down. In the few silent seconds between ascending and descending, the aircraft and everything inside became weightless, and the 13 students would, in theory, feel closer to the moon than the Earth.

The aircraft took off smoothly, but any illusions of a regular passenger flight vanished when the pilot put the Boeing into a steep 45-degree climb for about 20 seconds. The engines roared, blood drained from our heads, and bodies were scattered across the cabin floor. Then the engines cut out, and weightlessness was almost immediate. For 20 seconds, we floated in silence: the floor felt like a trampoline, and a single step launched us towards the ceiling. We drifted aimlessly; directions like left or right, up or down, lost their meaning. Only gravity, by anchoring us, allows us to understand the concept of moving elsewhere. After ten seconds of freefall, the pilot pulled the aircraft out of its dive. The return of gravity was less immediate than its loss but still sudden enough to make some students land with a bump. With the first curve completed, some turned green at the thought of the 29 more to come. Thirty curves equaled ten minutes of 'space time' for experiments. The Dutch students soon studied the movements of Leonardo, their robotic cat, to understand how cats always land on their feet. At the right moment, they released their device, and one student managed to turn it belly-down using radio controls. The next curve was nearly its last when another student accidentally landed on it during a rough return to gravity. Next to the slightly dazed robotic cat, a German team from the University of Aachen studied how the quality of metal joins is affected by the absence of gravity, with future space station construction in mind. Another team from Utah State University explored creating solar sails from thin liquid films hardened in ultraviolet sunlight. They spent the flight trying to produce these films in microgravity. They believe that once perfected, satellites could use solar sails to harness the sun's radiation like a yacht uses the wind. After two hours of swinging between heaven and Earth, breakfast felt unstable, but the main feeling was exhilaration, not nausea. This was a sensation that would last a long time. ""It was an unforgettable experience,"" said one student. ""I was already aiming to become an astronaut, but now I want to even more."""
CAE_3,"**With the Trees, I Planted My Stake in New Zealand**

**Jonathon Porritt Talks to Danny Danziger**

Jonathon Porritt is the author of *Seeing Green - The Politics of Ecology*.

I had a unique time in my life when I didn't experience any summers. I traveled to New Zealand every summer here, which is winter there, so I had nine winters in a row. I enjoyed it because I like winter. My parents had an idea to buy a small piece of land for my brother, sister, and me to take care of. My mother said, ""If you plant trees on it, you can have it."" This way, we would always have a connection to New Zealand, which was nice since my father grew up there. They found a plot about 20 miles north of Auckland in a place called Rangitoupuni. The land wasn't very fertile, but it was good for planting trees.

I've always been interested in land. I spent a year in Australia working on sheep farms and doing various farming jobs, so the idea of planting trees appealed to me. I was eager to start, and my family became enthusiastic as we progressed. We began planting in 1968, and by the end of 1972, we had planted the entire 70 acres.

In 1968, it was a very rainy winter in New Zealand. It rained almost every day we were planting, and I don't think I've ever been wetter or colder for such a long time. Every morning was a challenge: getting ready for another day of planting. Coming out of the Land Rover warm and dry, with rain pouring down, wearing a damp anorak from the day before, boots soaked, and hands struggling with wet laces. During this time, my mind wandered, and I had many thoughts and reflections about life.

In the first year, I worked with an experienced tree-planter, which was helpful since I had never planted trees seriously before. You carry a planting bag filled with as many trees as possible. When the bag is full, it's difficult, but it gets easier as it empties. The hardest part was getting the lines straight. You decide the spacing for the trees, line up three poles across a long distance, and those poles guide your lines. Once aligned, you plant along the line, turn around, and come back.

I enjoy hard physical work, and it made me fit. After a while, planting becomes automatic, and you develop a rhythm, using the fewest spade strokes needed to dig a hole. This rhythm is common in many farming jobs, where you train your body to perform standard moves, making the process easy: taking a tree from the bag, digging a hole, planting it, stamping it in, and moving on.

Mentally, it was fascinating. My mind wandered, and I had many thoughts about the natural world and our place in it. These ideas have influenced my life since then. I've returned to New Zealand four times to see the trees grow, which is satisfying because I planted them and feel connected to their success. I worry when I read about storms or droughts in New Zealand, but the trees are now 20 years old and doing well.

In 1984, I took a break from teaching and returned to New Zealand alone for three months. I wrote my first book, *Seeing Green*, there. There's a simple cabin on the tree farm with just a bed, table, and chair. I wrote in the mornings, pruned trees in the afternoons, and did research in the evenings. My connection to that area is still strong. It's the place where I feel most connected to the earth, a powerful bond."
CAE_10,"**BRINGING UP BADGERS**

""What now?"" I thought as a helper handed me a cardboard box. My husband Derek and I had turned our dairy farm in Somerset into an ""open farm"" six years ago, and we were known for caring for orphaned animals. The noise from the boxâ€”a mix of a cackle and a barkâ€”was unfamiliar. Inside, I found three small grey badger cubs, each about eight inches long. Their coats were like velvet, and their milky eyes looked up at me from their black-and-white striped heads. I had never seen badger cubs before. Most are born between mid-January and mid-March and spend their early life underground. If orphaned, they usually die of starvation and are never found. These three were brought in by builders who accidentally disturbed their sett while laying drain pipes. The mother was found dead with her babies still suckling her. The cubs were healthy but cold and whimpering. After removing their fleas, I took them into the farmhouse kitchen and placed them by the stove for warmth. There were two females, Primrose and Bluebell, and a male, Willow. I initially fed them with a syringe, wiping them with a warm cloth first to mimic their mother's licking, which helped them relieve themselves. For the first few days, they were fed every four hours. Within a week, they were drinking from a bottle and moving around, though shakily. They seemed content with each other for company and a heated pad as a substitute ""mum.""

Three weeks later, I noticed Willow was lethargic, though he was still eating. It was a warning sign I missed, and the next morning, I found him dead. A vet's post-mortem revealed he died from a lung infection. When bottle-feeding, it's important not to let an animal drink too fast, as liquid can enter the lungs. In Willow's case, this caused an infection that was hard to treat, even with antibiotics. Disheartened, I continued caring for the others. Six days later, a local farmer brought me another male cub, abandoned by its mother. He was cold and hungry, and the farmer knew she wouldn't return. Willow II joined us. At six weeks, he was about two weeks younger than the females. I soon discovered why his mother left him. He was difficult to feed, and I had to move the bottle's teat around and squeeze it to get him to drink. After 10 minutes, he would finally latch on. By the end of April, the females were eating creamed rice and then anything. Willow was different. He gave up the bottle but couldn't eat without walking through his food or sitting in it. Eventually, I offered him a sausage, which he slowly ate. After a week of sausages, he was ready for other foods.

At nearly five months old, they were eating cereals for breakfast, a meat and vegetable meal for lunch, and fruit, nuts, cheese, hard-boiled eggs, and sunflower seeds in the evening. Badgers usually eat 60% earthworms, plus beetles, bugs, baby rabbits, mice, voles, and plant shoots or roots. My badgers were better off than others that year; the summer was very hot, making it hard to dig for earthworms. By August, my badgers became nocturnal, going for walks at dusk or late at night. We often walked through the cider orchard, where they played and chased each other's tails. As ""human badgers,"" we joined in. I learned to avoid their playful nips, but Derek, who joined us less often, didn't and sometimes got bruised. During these walks, I saw other badgers in our field. They were likely extending their territories to find food, as badgers are territorial and can kill intruders. We were warned they might enter our badger pen and harm the cubs, so we covered the gate with sheet metal. The local press took pictures of me walking the badgers, and the response led us to start an appeal to build a sett on the farm. With advice, we designed a new home for the badgers. Our son Daniel drew up the plans, and we built a sett with tunnels, an enclosure, and a badger gate facing their usual walk direction. It had three chambers, one larger than the others, with a glass side for viewing from a darkened enclosure. As the sett took shape, the badgers explored it before their walks. Eventually, they forgot the walks, excited by the tunnels and bedding. The building cost more than expected, but a local bus company, Badgerline, sponsored part of the appeal, and local firms donated materials. Everyone wanted to see the badgers with a home. One evening, they finally moved in. After watching them for a while, we left them to settle. Half an hour later, I returned to find them asleep in their chambers. These days, I don't walk with them as often, especially since they're awake at midnight. We see Primrose occasionally, as she's joined a neighboring sett, but Bluebell and Willow II still greet us before heading off into the night. This is their territory now, a place they know well and a home they've accepted."
CAE_67,"**In search of true north - and the man behind Halley's comet**

Dr. Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, plans to follow Sir Edmund Halley's journey to map compass variations. Anjana Ahuja reports. Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) is famous for the comet named after him. However, one of his major achievements was mapping the 'variations of the compass' during his sea voyages on the warship Paramore. These variations, now called 'declination', refer to the angle between magnetic north and true north. Without understanding declination, sailors couldn't accurately correct their compasses, making it difficult to determine longitude and navigate the seas. 

Halley, one of the few people paid to do scientific research at the time, set out for the Cape Verde Islands to map declination in the North and South Atlantic. His first trip was cut short due to crew issues, but he tried again. This second voyage took him to Rio de Janeiro, South Georgia, Newfoundland, and back to England. From these travels, Halley published a 'New and Correct Chart showing the Variations of the Compass in the Western and Southern Oceans' in 1701. This chart and its successors were crucial for sailors for over a century until changes in Earth's magnetic field made them outdated.

Dr. Clark, an enthusiastic sailor, plans to celebrate the 300th anniversary of Halley's journey by retracing the Paramore's route. He needs to raise Â£70,000 for the trip, and Sir Vivian Fuchs, known for leading the first cross-Antarctica expedition, is supporting him. Dr. Clark became interested in Halley during a two-year stay at Halley Station in Antarctica, where he read about the scientist's life. 'Halley led a remarkable life,' says Dr. Clark. 'He was a respected scientist and explorer, not just an astronomer but also a geophysicist. While he was Astronomer Royal, he mapped stars and also developed a diving bell and advised Sir Isaac Newton on his Principia Mathematica.'

Dr. Clark believes recreating the voyage will give Halley the recognition he deserves. The expedition, called 'In the Wake of the Paramore', will also have scientific value. It will involve taking the same measurements Halley did, but with more accurate instruments. These measurements are important because Earth's magnetic field is always changing. The data collected will help improve the international geomagnetic reference field, a model of Earth's magnetic field. 'It's common to measure the size but not the direction of the magnetic field. You need to know true north to measure direction,' says Dr. Clark. 'We can use global positioning satellites for that on our expedition.' The British Geological Survey and the United States Navy will provide instruments, and a Danish satellite will be taking similar measurements globally. Dr. Clark hopes his measurements will fill any gaps in the satellite's coverage of the Atlantic Ocean and provide useful ground-based comparisons.

Halley's Atlantic journey was significant as it was the first dedicated scientific sea expedition, and Halley was the first civilian appointed as a naval captain for this purpose. Does Dr. Clark have the qualifications to succeed in his voyage? Besides his two years in Antarctica and work with the geomagnetic group at the British Geological Survey, he has already sailed 13,000 kilometers from Rio de Janeiro to England. He plans to complete the expedition in four stages with different crews. Does he share Halley's passion? 'I'm willing to dedicate eight months of my life to this, so some might say I'm obsessed. But I wouldn't cross the Atlantic again without a good reason. Halley and his fascinating life have given me a real sense of purpose.'"
CAE_27,"**POWER DRESSING**

Every summer, the peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire show off their beautiful tails to the female peahens. This display raises a question that puzzled Charles Darwin: in a world where survival is tough, how did such extravagant features evolve? Darwin believed that evolution happened through natural selection, where the fittest survive. However, the peacock's tail seemed to be a disadvantage, so he proposed another idea called 'sexual selection'. He suggested that females might choose mates based on beauty alone.

Darwin's friend, Alfred Russel Wallace, disagreed. He thought that if peahens chose the most attractive males, there must be a reason beyond just beauty. He believed the tail was a sign of some other survival advantage. Today, this debate continues, as studying peafowl behavior is challenging. However, the 200 peacocks at Whipsnade, who live like wild birds but are used to humans, provide a unique chance to study this.

Marion Petrie and her team at Whipsnade are exploring two main questions. First, do peahens really prefer males with the most impressive tails? Second, do these males have other advantages, as Wallace suggested, or is it just about looks, as Darwin thought? Observations show that peahens do prefer males with more eye-spots on their tails, which are linked to tail length. These males attract more mates. However, whether these males are better in other ways is still unclear.

William Hamilton from Oxford University suggested that showy male birds might be healthier and free of parasites, and their plumage shows this. There is evidence for this in other birds, but Petrie and her team haven't been able to test this in Whipsnade peacocks. This year, they are comparing the offspring of attractive and less attractive males to see if the former grow faster or are healthier. If so, it would support Wallace's idea that female choice is practical.

Finally, R.A. Fisher, a mathematician and biologist, proposed 'Fisher's Runaway' in the 1930s. He suggested that if a female chooses a male with a slightly better tail, their sons will inherit the tail, and daughters will inherit the preference for long tails. This cycle could lead to increasingly extravagant tails. Modern computer models show this could explain the peacock's tail, supporting Darwin's idea of 'beauty for beauty's sake' once the process starts."
CAE_66,"**THE BOAT OF MY DREAMS**

Tom Cunliffe believes the best boat design should mix old and new ideas. He applied this in his own boat, 'The Westerman'. This week, the Summer Boat Show in London is full of impressive yachts with the latest technology. Most of these yachts are based on design changes from 25 years ago. In contrast, my boat is quietly moored on a tidal creek on the south coast. Although designed last year, she looks like she could be 100 years old, which might make people think I'm a romantic dreamer. Maybe I am, but I doubt it. This boat benefits from traditional boat design, but modern technology made the job easier. However, while modern technology is essential in boat design and building today, it often shields crews from the real challenges of sea life. These challenges are often what sailors want to experience when they go to sea. I'm not saying sailors should suffer unnecessarily. I always make sure my boats have a coal stove for warmth and comfortable sleeping areas. But why go sailing if every sail operates automatically? Sometimes, dealing with sails is part of a sailor's life. And why should we move steering positions from the safe back of the boat to a risky spot halfway to the front? Sadly, this is done to create a cabin like an ocean liner, with a bed bigger than the one at home. For me, a boat should be a boat, not a floating cottage. When I bought my previous boat, Hirta, which I used to sail around Britain for a TV race series, the former owner said she had every comfort but no luxury. During my time with her, I learned how right he was. Her sails were heavy, and she had no pumped water, no electricity, no fridge, no central heating, no winches, and no electronics, especially for navigation. Yet, she was the kindest, easiest boat I have ever sailed. However, classic boats need a lot of care. After a back injury, I realized my 15-year relationship with her had to end. I couldn't find a suitable younger boat, so I decided to build a new one from scratch. The Westerman has never let me down. Although designer Nigel Irens and his assistant Ed Burnett are skilled with computer design, Irens first sketched this boat on a paper napkin and later used the computer. After creating a design, he carved a model, just like in the old days. We reviewed the model and then adjusted the design on the computer. The final version was perfect. The finished boat has crossed the North Atlantic and won four out of her first six races. She looks timeless, moves beautifully at sea, and her interior, made from reclaimed pitch pine, feels peaceful. This is because she was designed purely as a sailing boat, without focusing on furniture. This traditional method works well. She shows that you don't need to follow trends to be satisfied and that history can teach valuable lessons. Built with wood treated with a special glue, she is completely waterproof. She has all the advantages of a fiberglass boat but looks, feels, and sails like a traditional one."
CAE_44,"**RETREAT, RELAX, RECHARGE**

Health farms and country house hotels with spa facilities are seeing a rise in business. We asked five journalists to review some of these places.

**A. HENLOW GRANGE**

I was excited to visit Henlow Grange for six days because I needed to relax. My room in the large 18th-century house was very comfortable, and I felt calm immediately. On the first day, I rested and slept a lot. From the second day, I joined body conditioning classes like stretch and tone, yoga, and body alignment. The instructors are very skilled, and I felt more flexible as the week went on. They offer many treatments, such as aromatherapy, seaweed baths, manicures, and pedicures. The hour-long facial made me feel renewed. The staff were friendly and professional, creating an energetic and enthusiastic atmosphere. Henlow plans to renovate this year, adding a half-size Olympic pool and a Light Diet Room. You can also ride bicycles around the grounds. If you prefer to relax, you can read a magazine or walk in the garden. During my stay, my mood and appetite improved. I left feeling energized, and I plan to return. This is a perfect break for a stressed working woman. Save Room 5 for me! - Marcella D'Argy Smith

**B. SHRUBLAND HALL**

The calm atmosphere of this stately home was clear as soon as I entered the reception area. The Hall has a beautifully decorated library, a charming conservatory, and plenty of space, so you can enjoy solitude if you wish. Upon arrival, everyone receives a medical check-up, including weight and blood pressure. We were called patients, which felt strange since I am healthy. However, a shoulder issue found during the check-up was quickly addressed by the fitness instructor in group workshops and individual sessions. Each person follows a specific diet. I lost weight without fasting but had a headache on the second day from hunger. My daily menu included grapefruit and honey for breakfast, salads for lunch, and exotic fruit, yogurt, and hot broth for supper. If not fasting, you eat in the main dining hall, where the food is tasty and well-presented. You receive a massage or water therapy every other day, and extra treatments are reasonably priced. - Liz Gregory

**C. CAREYS MANOR**

Careys is not a health farm and doesn't claim to be. It's a lovely old manor with cozy log fires and a spacious lounge. If you're watching your calories, you might skip the gourmet food. The French chef creates rich sauces and creamy desserts. Luckily, the hotel has a gym and a soft-water pool to burn off the indulgences. You can choose a 'health-conscious' diet if you want to lose weight. There is a spa bath, steam room, Swiss shower, sauna, and treatment rooms. A highlight is the sports injury clinic, where I received expert advice on an old shoulder injury. The physiotherapist suggested good posture, exercises, and massage. Careys is comfortable and luxurious, relaxed and calm. If you want to explore, the surrounding countryside is beautiful. - Beverly D'Silva

**D. CLIVEDEN**

Cliveden is a grand country home and a five-star hotel that treats guests like royalty. It offers health and beauty treatments, a gym, saunas, a swimming pool, tennis, horse riding, and more. The 376-acre National Trust estate has beautiful woodland walks and gardens. Waldo's, a renowned restaurant, offers a menu that is hard to resist. The meal was excellent, especially the sticky-toffee pudding with banana ice cream. I went to bed happy! The next morning, I spent time in the gym to burn calories before my next meal. In the Pavilion, I enjoyed a facial with gentle heat and essential oils, followed by an aromatherapy massage. Cliveden offers fitness assessments, workouts, and beauty treatments if you want themâ€”before enjoying a meal at Waldo's. - Kay Letch

**E. SPRINGS HYDRO**

The best and worst thing about Springs Hydro is the carrot cake. It's the best because it's delicious, but the worst because it's 360 calories, which isn't ideal if you're trying to lose weight. You've been warned! The second best thing is the wonderful aromatherapy massage. I chose relaxing oils, fell asleep twice during the massage, and had a refreshing night's sleep. The modern, purpose-built premises are efficiently run, with up-to-date facilities and luxurious bedrooms. There are many therapists and beauty rooms, so scheduling appointments is easy. They offer a variety of treatments, from manicures and pedicures to deep-cleansing facials and body treatments. Guests include football teams, mothers and daughters, best friends, and singles. Ideally, I would visit here once a month. - Eve Cameron"
CAE_22,"**NATURAL TALENTS**

In the seven million years since humans split from chimpanzees, we haven't changed much genetically; we're still over 98% identical to chimps. On an evolutionary scale, what makes humans different from animals is a recent development. Our ability to create art and other uniquely human traits must come from a small part of our genes. This means that the differences between us and animals are mostly small. For example, both humans and animals use tools: chimpanzees use sticks, and sea otters use rocks. Monkeys have simple language with different sounds for 'leopard', 'eagle', and 'snake'. These findings show that there are few absolute differences between us and animals, except for art.

If human art comes from a unique genetic trait, it's interesting that our ancestors didn't create art for most of the time since they diverged from chimps. Early art might have been wood carvings or body painting, but these don't last over time. Clear evidence of human art appears with the Cro-Magnons around 35,000 years ago, with cave paintings, statues, necklaces, and musical instruments.

If we say our recent creativity sets us apart, how is our art different from animal creations? Three main differences are often suggested: human art is non-utilitarian, made for aesthetic pleasure, and learned rather than instinctive.

First, as Oscar Wilde said, ""All art is quite useless."" Human art doesn't help us survive or reproduce, unlike most animal behaviors. While human art communicates ideas, it doesn't pass on genes. Birdsong, for example, helps defend territory or attract mates, directly aiding gene transmission. By this measure, human art is different.

The second claim is that only human art is motivated by aesthetic pleasure. We can't ask birds if they enjoy their songs, but they mostly sing during breeding season, suggesting it's not just for pleasure. Again, human art seems unique here.

The third distinction is that human art is learned, not instinctive. Different human groups have distinct art styles that are learned, not genetically inherited. For example, songs in Tokyo and Paris are different, but people can learn each other's songs. Some birds, however, inherit their species' song and would sing it even without hearing it. It's like a French baby raised in Japan spontaneously singing the French national anthem.

The role of learning in human art is also seen in how quickly styles change. Geese honked 2,000 years ago as they do today, but human art evolves rapidly. Even casual museum-goers can tell a 20th-century painting from the Mona Lisa. Experts can often identify when and who painted a work. However, they might mistake the works of two mid-20th-century artists, Congo and Betsy, who were actually chimpanzees. Congo created up to 33 pieces in a day and was upset when his pencil was taken away. Their paintings were shown in a 1957 exhibition in London, and most were sold, a success many human artists can't claim.

These ape paintings blur the lines between human art and animal activities. Like human art, they had no utilitarian purpose and were made for the artist's satisfaction. You might argue that human art is different because it's meant to communicate, while the apes didn't care about sharing their work. But even some famous human art was created for the artist's personal satisfaction."
CAE_39,"**An Exciting Adventure**

The Taklamakan Desert in western China is one of the last unexplored places on earth. It is also one of the most dangerous. Charles Blackmore crossed it and lived to tell the tale. There are very few big adventures left and very few heroes. Children's stories used to be about brave explorers with sunburnt skin and eyes narrowed from looking into the distance on their journeys into the unknown. These days, you rarely find such people in stories, let alone in real life. Or so I thought until I met Charles Blackmore.

Blackmore's great adventure was leading an expedition across the Taklamakan Desert in western China. Its name means 'once entered you never come out', but local people call it the Desert of Death. He remembered the dangers and excitement of that amazing journey, in the calm atmosphere of his family home. The team he led included four Britons (one of them the group's medical officer), an American photographer, four Chinese experts on the area, 30 camels, and six camel handlers. It later turned out that the camel handlers had never worked with camels before; they were long-distance truck drivers. This misunderstanding could have cost everyone their lives and certainly put the expedition's success at risk.

This diverse group set out to cross 1,200 kilometers of the world's least hospitable desert, and Charles Blackmore has written a fascinating account of their journey. At the time, he was about to leave the Army after 14 happy years. He started the expedition for fun, to fill a gap in his life, to prove something. 'I had always thought I'd spend my whole life in the Army. I had been offered a promotion, but suddenly I felt I wanted to see who Charles Blackmore really was, outside all that. It was a huge risk. Tina, my wife, was very worried that I wouldn't come back as nobody had ever done that route; we went into it blind. In the end, it took 59 days to cross from west to east, and the desert was very kind to us.'

Anyone reading his extraordinary account of that crossing will wonder at the use of the word 'kind'. The team suffered terrible hardships: dysentery, extreme temperatures, severe thirst and dehydration, and the loss of part of their precious water supply. 'But', Blackmore explains, 'when we were at the limits of our endurance and the camels had gone without water for seven days, we managed to find some. We didn't experience the Taklamakan's legendary sandstorms. And we never faced the raw, biting desert cold that would have totally stopped us. That's not to say that we weren't fighting against challenges the whole time. The fine sand got into everything, especially blisters and wounds. The high dunes were torture to climb, for us and for the heavily loaded camels, which often rolled over onto us.

'What drove me on more than anything else was the need to survive. We had no backup plan. Neither our budget nor time allowed one. No aircraft ever flew over us. Once we got into the sandhills, we were completely on our own. 'I knew I had the mental strength for the trip, but I was very scared of my physical ability to do it. I remember day one -- we sat at the edge of the desert, and it was so hot that you couldn't breathe. I thought, ""We've got to do it now!"" At that moment, I was a very scared man.'

If it was like that at the beginning, how did they feel towards the end? 'When you've walked for 1,000 kilometers, you're not going to give up. You've endured so much; you've got so much behind you. We were very thin, but very muscular and strong despite our physical exhaustion. My body was well-toned, and my legs were like pistons. I could walk over anything.'

Midway through the book, Blackmore describes lying in the desert, looking up at a full moon, thinking of his family. How aware was he of the ordeal it must have been for them? 'Inside me, there's someone trying to find peace with himself. When I have doubts about myself now, I go back to the image of the desert and think, well, we managed to pull that together. As a personal achievement, I feel prouder of that expedition than of anything else I've done. Yet in terms of a lifetime's achievement, I think of my family and the happiness we share -- against that measure, the desert does not compare.'

Has Charles Blackmore found peace? 'I yearn for the challenge -- for the open spaces -- the resolve of it all. We were lifted by the sense of purpose. I find it difficult now to be part of the uniformity of modern life.'"
CAE_18,"Life was becoming overwhelming for Susan Harr, so she decided to unplug her gadgets and rediscover the joys of doing things by hand. Everyone loves technology because it gives us amazing gadgets that make life easier and give us more free time. However, we've been subtly convinced that technology is essential, and that's okay. But is it really? Using my hands doesn't consume energy like our gadgets do, and it doesn't harm the environment. A recent bad experience with my broken word processor, which cost me a lot to fix, made me question if gadgets are worth the trouble and expense. Are we as dependent on technology as we think?

Gradually, I've been letting household gadgets go as they break down. This makes me wonder what ""time"" technology really gives us. Is it just more time to buy more gadgets? If so, marketing experts have tricked us. When my gadget started making strange noises, even when unplugged, I left it in the backyard, where it now sits like a ghost. I'm no longer tied to a noisy machine, and I can take my time with my sewing. I was always a bit scared of those electric machines that rush towards your fingers. Best of all, I can take my sewing anywhere in a bag.

Of course, there are some gadgets I wouldn't want to live without. A year without a washing machine showed me how valuable it is. But losing other gadgets has been surprisingly nice. We were spending too much time in front of the TV, so I returned the rented color TV and went back to a small black-and-white one. It's hard on the eyes but makes us focus on what's worth watching. Now, we spend more time walking the dog, reading, talking, or doing other hobbies. One of my hobbies is sewing, and I no longer use my old sewing machine, which is now a plant stand. I can't afford a new one, so I sew by hand.

We've come to believe we can't live without technology, and even if we resist the idea that our lives would be unmanageable without it, we don't want to give it up. We feel sorry for past generations who had to do hard, tiring work. Even our brains are relieved by computers that do fast calculations and provide entertainment. But the time I spend sewing by hand is not boring, and there are many benefits. I can sew and listen to the radio or talk with family and friends. If it's a simple task, I can watch TV and feel less guilty about sitting in front of it because I'm doing something useful. It's a cozy feeling to sit by the fire and sew with a pot of tea.

I used to think sewing by hand was horrible, imagining long hours and eye strain. But there's something soothing about it, and it's satisfying to see my work improve. Things get done quickly, and life slows down to the pace of my hands. I'm free from the rush of modern life, where we hurry from one task to the next. I've also regained control of my sink, where I enjoy washing dishes and daydreaming. Now, I look around the house and wonder if we really need the freezer, microwave, or lawnmower. We could save a lot of money by doing without electric lights!"
CAE_62,"Charles Hurst, a cabinet-maker, earns his living by creating beautifully crafted furniture. When I meet him at his workshop in East London, he seems to be in a hurry. He greets me with a quick handshake and says, ""Well, fire away then!"" It's not clear if his abrupt manner is genuine or if he's just shy. His workshop is busy, filled with half-made furniture and planks of wood in various natural colors. Hurst has been in this business for ten years and has a great reputation. His order book is always full months in advance, even though he doesn't advertise. People know that if they want a well-made cupboard, table, bookcase, or kitchen unit, Hurst is the person to go to.

Finding a furniture-maker isn't difficult, but finding one who focuses on clean, simple lines is rare. Hurst is disappointed by some modern furniture and criticizes mass-produced, low-quality pieces. His quest for perfection and his talent are key to his success. Hurst is confident in his abilities, saying, ""I have a huge natural ability. I have always been good at making things."" He is self-taught and learned his craft by asking the right questions.

Most of his work comes from private clients, and some return repeatedly. He finds it satisfying to furnish entire homes. However, he admits that not all client relationships are smooth. He prefers clients who know what they want. Hurst is also willing to praise others when deserved, acknowledging that some are better than him. He criticizes craftsmen who take too long to make a single piece and dislikes degree shows where students try to make fashion statements. For Hurst, furniture should be practical and usable.

Despite his confidence, Hurst is not pretentious. As I leave, he shows humility, saying, ""After all, I am only making furniture."""
CAE_49,"Text: 'Three theories about sleep People spend about one-third of their lives sleeping. It seems clear, then, that sleep has an important role. However, what that role is remains uncertain. Scientists do not fully agree on why we spend so much time sleeping. There are three main theories. The most popular theory suggests that sleep is mainly for physical health. It says we sleep to keep our bodies healthy. In other words, while we sleep, our bodies repair any damage from the day and restore us to full strength. Another theory focuses on the learning benefits of sleep. This theory suggests that sleep helps us process the information we learn during the day, and without sleep, learning would not happen. A third theory is about energy, suggesting that we need sleep to recharge our energy for the next day.'"
CAE_31,"**ECCENTRICS**

An eccentric is someone whose behavior is unusual and who does not follow the accepted norms of society. This raises the question, ""What is normal?"" Most of us have our own quirks and oddities. It could be a love for entering newspaper competitions, a habit of collecting beer mats, or a tendency to write letters to the press about various topics. Eccentricity is about expressing our individuality. Inside us, there is a constant conflict between wanting to be unique and wanting to fit in. It's like having two trains on the same track, one called individualism and the other conformity. For most people, conformity is stronger. We want to be accepted, loved, and feel connected with others more than we want to stand out and be different.

People with unusual hobbies, strong opinions, or unconventional behavior often gather together. They form clubs, hold meetings, and organize events to share their interests or problems. The key word here is 'common'. They seek others who share what is usually seen as odd by family, friends, and neighbors. Being part of a group, even a small one, is comforting.

We all feel a tension between individualism and conformity. While most of us follow the crowd, we don't like to admit it. We feel the need to show our individuality, like when someone at a bar says, ""I say what I think,"" or when a new acquaintance says, ""You must take me as you find me. I don't stand on ceremony.""

At any time, we can choose to emphasize our individuality. Many successful people have done this. For example, Bob Dylan, the American singer, said, ""When you feel in your gut what you are doing and then dynamically pursue it - don't back down and don't give up - then you're going to mystify a lot of folk."" But this self-conscious assertion of individuality is not eccentricity, at least not at first. When a pop singer wears strange clothes for publicity, or a society hostess makes shocking comments to get noticed, that is not eccentricity. However, if they continue these actions until they become a natural part of who they are, then they might be considered eccentric.

The key aspect of eccentricity is its naturalness. Eccentrics do not try to be odd; they simply are. A true eccentric is not concerned with public opinion; they are barely aware of it. They do what they do because of who they are. This makes them different from enthusiasts, practical jokers, brilliant criminals, exhibitionists, and recluses. These people are very aware of the world around them and often act in response to it. Some want to make an impression on society, while others want to escape from it, but all are conscious of society. The eccentric, however, continues on their path regardless."
CAE_58,"**Natural Books: Influential Wildlife Classics**

We asked four leading naturalists to share the wildlife book that has influenced them the most.

**A. Geoffrey Lean**

Choosing the author was easy for me. As an environmental journalist, I've met many pioneers in the field, but none impressed me more than Barbara Ward. She was central to environmental issues in post-war Europe and developed a compelling philosophy from her experiences. As a young journalist, her work made everything clear to me. Picking the book was harder. It could have been ""Only One Earth"" or ""Progress for a Small Planet,"" but ""The Home of Man"" stands out. Despite its old-fashioned title, it focuses on the rapid growth of cities and the themes of sustainable development. I've read hundreds of books since, but none match its impact.

**B. Linda Bennett**

When I read ""Signals for Survival"" by Niko Tinbergen, I can vividly imagine the sounds and sights of a herring gull colony. This book brilliantly explains animal communication through words and pictures. After reading it, watching a gull colony transforms from chaos to a structured society. You can identify partners, boundaries, and families. Tinbergen, a distinguished behaviourist, wanted to share his findings with everyone. His collaboration with wildlife artist Eric Ennion resulted in a book that appeals to all wildlife lovers. Ennion's art, based on years of observing birds, captures their behaviours with minimal lines and colors. This is true field naturalist art.

**C. Lee Durrell**

""My Family and Other Animals"" by Gerald Durrell has had the greatest influence on my life. It led me to a wonderful husband and a career in conservation. This book solidified my love for the natural world. While researching animal vocalisations in Madagascar, I faced many challenges. But reading this book each night made everything brighter. It beautifully weaves together animals, people, joy, and beauty, showing a world worth saving. Some say humans are the worst species, but I remember Gerald as a boy, seeing the world as a family. This interconnectedness is a concept we all need to understand.

**D. Bruce Pearson**

I discovered ""The Shell Bird Book"" by James Fisher in my school library soon after its 1966 release. The 48 color plates of birds by Eric Ennion immediately caught my attention. I already had bird books and enjoyed identifying birds during holidays, which led me to sketch them. But this book offered much more. It included chapters on migration, the history of birds in Britain, and birds in music, literature, and art. This broad range of information and exciting images encouraged me to appreciate birds and nature more generally. It showed me that an emotional and creative response to nature is as valid as a scientific one. As art was my strength, this book opened a new path for me."
CAE_37,"**DO REVIEWS SELL BOOKS?**

We asked five top British publishers about how book reviews affect a book's success. Here is what they said:

**Publisher A**  
Reviews are crucial for publishers; they are the first part of the newspaper we look at. The Book Marketing Council found that when people were asked why they bought a book, more mentioned reviews than any other reason (like ads, word of mouth, or bookshop displays). Authors and publishers react differently to reviews. Both dislike getting no reviews, but publishers are usually calmer about bad reviews. They believe that any mention, whether good or bad, can boost sales as readers decide to see for themselves. Publishers enjoy reviews that match their own opinion of a book since they are often the first 'reader'.

**Publisher B**  
Publishers and the press both care about book review pages, but their needs differ: newspapers want to entertain their readers, while publishers want their books reviewed positively. Book reviewing is better nowâ€”more varied and less elitistâ€”than 40 years ago. However, paperbacks, which most people read, are often ignored. Weekly summaries aren't enough, and original paperbacks rarely get serious attention. Still, publishers need reviews, as they are a cost-effective way to make a book and author known. A lively review by a trusted name can boost sales, especially if there are several. Fame helps get a book into readers' hands.

**Publisher C**  
Reviews are vital for literary publishing; without them, we lose an essential lifeline. Our books are usually not by famous authors, so we rely on literary editors for exposure. Good reviews are more valuable than ads because readers trust them as unbiased. Reviews help sell books, but their impact on sales is hard to measure. Good reviews can launch a book and a career, but they need support from other factors like word-of-mouth, strong book trade response, and smart marketing.

**Publisher D**  
The link between publishing and reviewing in Britain? I wish I knew! In the US, the New York Times can make or break a book with one review. Here, bookshops often don't seem to care about reviews. It can take 20 years of great reviews for people to start reading a good writer's work. Yet, some poorly reviewed or unreviewed books are bestsellers. It's unpredictable, though non-fiction reviews often focus more on the reviewer's knowledge than the book itself.

**Publisher E**  
All publishers and writers dream of long, positive reviews. But do they sell books? I once published a biography with great reviews, but it flopped because people felt they didn't need to buy the book after reading the reviews. Does the reviewer's name matter? Thirty years ago, certain reviewers could influence the public. Now, it's more about the choice of an unexpected reviewer or the power, wit, or originality of the review that drives buyers to the bookshop."
CAE_2,"**WEATHERVANE MAKER**

Making weathervanes is an ancient craft, dating back to early Egyptian times. Today, this skill is still alive in Graham Smith's workshop. He is one of the few people in the country who make weathervanes by hand. Graham creates unique designs based on what his customers want. ""This way, I can make a special, personalized item,"" he says. ""Many of my customers are women buying gifts for their husbands. They want a unique present that reflects the man's job or hobbies."" This is very different from the traditional cockerel design, which is the most common for weathervanes. Graham's first weathervane was not a cockerel but a witch on a broomstick, which he made as a surprise gift for his wife. Friends liked it and asked him to make weathervanes for them too. ""I realized that there are endless possibilities for weathervane designs,"" he says.

Graham decided to focus on a weathervane business. He had trained as a precision engineer and worked in that field for 15 years. Then, he and his wife, Liz, decided to switch rolesâ€”she went to work as an architectural assistant, and he stayed home to care for their children and grow the business. That was five years ago, and he is happy with his new path. ""My previous job didn't have an artistic side, but this is exciting and creative,"" he says. ""I really enjoy designing.""

Graham has now created over 100 original designs. He pays close attention to detail and always gets the customer's approval for the silhouette design before cutting it by hand. Graham also keeps many traditional designs in stock because they are as popular as the custom ones. ""People are drawn to hand-crafted items,"" Graham says. ""They like the chance to get something a bit different.""

Graham does not plan to expand his business because he wants to keep it as a rural craft. ""I have found my place in the market. People love the individuality, and I get a lot of satisfaction from turning a simple shape into something almost lifelike,"" he says. ""For centuries, weathervanes have helped communities understand the weather by showing changes in wind direction,"" he explains. ""Now, with more people moving to the countryside, they want to add a unique touch to their homes. This has helped crafts like mine.""

Graham is now very busy, sending flat-packed weathervanes to clients around the world. Buyers from America and Denmark are especially interested. ""The price,"" he explains, ""depends on how complex the design is."" His latest request was for a curly-coated dog. Whatever the occasion, Graham can create a special gift."
CAE_68,"**Beginner Takes All**

Before it was even published, *The Horse Whisperer* was the most talked-about book of the year. This first novel by British screenwriter Nicholas Evans earned him record-breaking amounts of money. Here, he shares his inspiration and success story.

The start of the year was tough for Nicholas Evans, who was a screenwriter, producer, and aspiring director. Things went wrong when *Life and Limb*, a film he had been working on for months, suddenly fell apart. He was worried because it had been two years since he last earned any money, and this film was his only hope to keep the bank happy. A sensible person might have found a job, perhaps returning to television work. Instead, Evans made a bold decision. He bought a ticket to America to research his first novel for three months.

The idea for the story had been with him for a while, inspired by a farrier he met on Dartmoor. The farrier told him about a calm horse that suddenly became wild. Its owners were desperate until they found a gypsy who calmed the horse just by talking to it. Such people were called 'horse whisperers'. Evans was fascinated and started researching the topic, initially thinking of writing a screenplay. But after *Life and Limb* failed, he decided to write a book instead.

In the spring, he traveled across the US, visiting ranches and learning about horses and the people who work with them. ""It was a strange time,"" he recalls. ""I was observing people, but I felt alone and as if my life was falling apart. I had tried for ten years to succeed as a filmmaker, and now I was in debt, worried about feeding my children, and wondering if it was all a mistake.""

By August, he had returned home and written half of the book. The bank was pressuring him, so he showed the draft to a friend who was a literary agent. The agent thought it was ""fine"" and estimated Evans might get $30,000 as an advance. Evans needed more to pay off some debt and support his family. He had already spent seven months on the book and needed at least two more. He was also advised to write a 12-page summary of the rest of the book.

In October, the first 200 pages and the summary were sent to seven UK publishers just before the Frankfurt Book Fair. Within days, his agent called to say he had turned down an offer of $75,000. ""I said, 'You what?' And he said, 'It's OK, I just sense something is happening.'""

What happened next was remarkable. Within a week, the novel was sold to Transworld Publications in the UK for $550,000 and to Delacorte in the US for $3.15 million, both record-breaking advances for a first novel. ""We couldn't believe it; we were shocked. We never sent the manuscript to New York, and we still don't know how it got there,"" Evans says. It wasn't sent to Hollywood either, but soon major studios were competing for it. ""My UK agent wisely involved an agent there, and when he called to say, 'I think we can get $3 million outright,' we laughed in disbelief.""

The studios agreed to this amount, and they each presented their case to Evans. One night in October, he sat in his study while four top filmmakers called, one after the other, to offer $3 million for an unfinished novel.

Evans shared this story while we drank coffee on the verandah of his home. He mentioned that he had turned down an offer to write the screenplay for *The Horse Whisperer*. ""It's been such a fairy tale so far. I don't want to ruin it. Writing at that level is tough, and I don't want to become an employee of people I like and who have paid me so much. I'd hate to write a draft or two and then have them say, 'Thanks, Nick, but now we'll bring in someone else.'""

He planned to stay involved but from a distance. The success of his novel also brought new offers to back *Life and Limb*, but he wasn't sure he wanted to make it anymore. ""I think it would be wise to write another novel,"" he said."
CAE_23,"Text: 'Young Masters Age is a challenge for Bobby Fischer as he tries to make a comeback. Chess is now more than ever a game for young people. After 20 years away from the game, Bobby Fischer has returned to chess and is playing against his old rival Boris Spassky. Fischer's win in the first game was impressive, simple yet deep. However, as the following games have shown, this older, bearded chess player is not the same as he was in 1972. He is 49 years old, out of practice, and not in top shape. Spassky is even older. Chess has changed a lot in the last 20 years. A new era of professionalism began with Fischer's own influence on the game. The rise of professional chess has made winning more important than the scientific and artistic aspects. The main goal of modern players is to win. In international chess, a player's nerves and stamina are as important as their intellect and wisdom. The pressure of the game has always been high: a chess clock is used to make sure each player finishes the required number of moves in the given time - failing to do so means losing the game immediately. But now the playing sessions are longer, and many games are played without breaks. This increased pressure favors younger players. Over the past 30 years, each new world champion has been younger than the one before. It is notable that, of the world's ten highest-ranked players, eight are under 30. The way the game is played has also changed. Much of modern chess happens off the board - not just the psychological battles that Fischer is known for. Every professional must now focus on pre-match preparation, especially because computer databases have greatly impacted chess. A small portable computer can store one million chess games and provide instant access to hundreds of games of a potential opponent. In a recent match, each player had large teams of assistants working nonstop to find weaknesses in the other's strategy. The opening moves of a chess game are now analyzed in great detail. Being better prepared in the opening can decide the game. Today, the chess world has more top players than ever before. Hundreds of grandmasters compete for modest prize money worldwide. Success requires both physical and mental effort. A single game can last up to eight hours. For the chess master, this time is a constant struggle. A moment of lost focus can lead to disaster. So the players are always in a state of nervous tension. The chess clock adds to this tension. The end of the game often involves a frantic 'time scramble'. In these moments, each player has only seconds to make several moves or lose instantly. With minds racing and hands moving quickly, the masters make their moves and press their clocks with coordination that any athlete would admire. Such moments are not for thoughtful intellectuals. The game becomes a basic struggle where nerves, determination, and a strong will to win separate the winner from the loser. At the top level of chess, losing is very painful. Winning brings great satisfaction and a chance to recover from the nerves and exhaustion. But one win is not enough to win a tournament. The chess master must be ready to compete the next day. Most chess competitions last for 9-11 days, with games every day, and there is a year-round tournament circuit. World championship matches are even more demanding. The 1984 match between Anatoli Karpov and Gary Kasparov in Moscow had to be stopped after several months because both players were exhausted. Karpov lost about two stone (10kg) in weight. Can Fischer overcome these challenges? He once said, ""All I want to do, ever, is play chess."" This made his departure from the chess world after 1972 even more puzzling. But in some ways, it was a fitting end to his story. It made Bobby Fischer a legend. If he has returned for the money, he stands to gain a lot. Whatever happens in his match with Spassky, both will end up several million dollars richer. But if Fischer has come back truly believing he can prove he is still the best player in the world, the final result could be disappointing.'"
CAE_60,"**Fame and Fortune**

Imogen Edwards-Jones talks to some of the new British talents, from poets to pop stars, who are on their way to success.

**A** Nick Grosso, in his early 30s, has written three plays that critics love. He is now turning his first play, ""Peaches,"" into a movie script. ""It's low budget, but we don't know how low,"" he says. ""It won't be over Â£30 million, but it could be as low as Â£30."" The most surprising thing about Nick is that before writing ""Peaches,"" he had never seen or read a play. ""When I wrote the play, I never thought it would be performed,"" he says. ""It's set in a car. I probably wouldn't do that now because I know the practical issues. I knew nothing back then."" He left school at 16 but returned a year later. After finishing his A-levels, he joined the Young People's Theatre. ""I realized I wanted to write for actors. I wanted my writing to be heard, not just read, because of the rhythm and rhyme,"" he says. ""Suddenly, I was with people who thought like me. It was the first time I enjoyed being in an educational setting. It was very inspiring.""

**B** Comedian Simon Pegg, 28, has advanced a lot in his career since studying drama at Bristol University. He is now writing a TV comedy series and has just finished a demanding tour with comedy star Steve Coogan. He has always worked hard. Even at Bristol, he was practicing his comedy in clubs. ""University was very theoretical,"" Simon recalls. ""It made me realize I didn't want to be a serious actor and that I was more interested in comedy. People think comedy is the hardest job in the world, but it isn't. If you have courage and good material, it's wonderful to make people laugh."" He has performed with the comic group Funny Business, but his work with Steve Coogan has been the most successful. ""He saw my show, and since I was a big fan of his, he probably saw me imitating him,"" Simon admits.

**C** Ciaran McMenamin, 24, became known to the public when he starred in the series ""The Young Person's Guide To Becoming A Rock Star."" The critics loved it, and his career took off quickly. ""It's been a great opportunity for me,"" he says with a smile. ""I can now choose what I do, which is what I've always wanted."" This is a rare position, especially since he just graduated. But looking at Ciaran's early career, it's clear he was always destined for success. Encouraged by his mother, he went from lead roles at school to the Ulster Youth Theatre, where he stayed for four years. ""I used acting as an excuse not to do homework,"" laughs Ciaran. ""But I decided to pursue it because I was good at it and loved it."" Now he is waiting for the praise to come in, but when asked about fame, he becomes thoughtful. ""When you're 18, you think you'll love the photos and interviews, but you soon realize that's not why you act. It's about getting respect for doing good work.""

**D** Neil Taylor, 25, is the lead singer of the pop band Matrix, which has just signed a three-album deal with Domino Records. Neil and his bandmate Rick Brown are expected to be very successful when their single ""Chimera"" is released soon. ""The record company talks about a big hit, but I have no idea. For me, if two people buy it, I'll be happy,"" he says. Unlike many new pop stars, Neil has worked hard for his success. He left school at 16 and has been trying to break into the music business ever since. ""It's funny how things happen,"" he says. ""I was doing student gigs for eight years and was getting tired. I was about to give up when I met Rick Brown, who had contacts at Domino, and we formed Matrix. It couldn't have happened at a better time. There were times when I was very depressed, and I've been in some terrible bands. But hopefully, it will all be worth it.""

**E** Poet and author Stephen Richards, 27, has won more prizes, awards, and academic honors than many people twice his age. He is well-known on the poetry circuit, where he has been touring and giving readings for the past six years. Now his first novel, ""Hidden,"" will be published in March. ""It's a story of obsessive love. It was a strong idea that I couldn't express as a poem."" Stephen loved creative writing at school but became disillusioned with education later. ""I decided not to go to university, but when I got bored with stuffing envelopes at a theater, I decided I should."" After university, he published his first work, a children's book, in 1992. ""I don't think my parents expected me to be a writerâ€”they thought I'd be a reader because that's all I did as a child."" With his poetry receiving critical acclaim, moving into novels is brave. ""There's a structure with my poetry and less chance to make big mistakes,"" he explains. ""A novel can be any length, so there are more chances for bad words. My main goal is not to fall into a pattern of producing work without caring about the quality."""
CAE_1,"Text: A. Isabel, the main character in this quirky novel, is an art student who loves historical romances. At 31, she is looking for Mr. Right but worries her knobbly knees might be a problem. Despite this, she remains hopeful, which helps her and others in the story. The author writes with great energy, using a fast-paced style similar to early silent films, with chapter titles like 'Our Hero Feels Inspired.' B. This story is about the rise and near-fall of a local radio station in America. It is told from the perspective of Francis With, a smart but weak child. Francis works for WLT (With Lettuce and Tomato) Radio, started by Roy and Ray Soderbjerg to promote their sandwich shop. The station broadcasts a mix of singers, preachers, soap-opera stars, and announcers. The small-town American setting allows the author to use dry humor and simple writing. He takes the reader back to the 1940s and 1950s, a time of dime stores, old cars, and the radio. C. In this story, it is normal for a second husband to talk with his wife's first husband. So, when professor Richard Vaisey falls for a Russian poetess, he talks to his wife's ex. The poetess writes bad poetry, which bothers Richard, and she wants his help for her brother, who is in prison. The author skillfully untangles these issues with humor and insight into relationships, making it a fun and clever read. D. Two pairs of best friendsâ€”two women and two menâ€”meet in 1960s London and stay connected for 25 years. At the start of this long novel, one of them, James Hudson, an American businessman, is starting a newspaper, which his friend Richard Blake is editing. The newspaper launch is important, but so is the fact that the woman they both loved (and one married) was killed years ago. The story includes murder, ambition, love, and jealousy, with well-written characters that draw you in. E. This touching and funny story by a top American writer is about Ian Bedloe, who, feeling guilty for a past mistake, becomes the 'father' to his brother's three orphaned children. At 40, Ian is slowly becoming an eccentric bachelor, surrounded by the chaos of family life. The story explores emotions and focuses on Ian's tender relationship with the youngest child, Daphne. It's a warm book with a perfect mix of sadness and humor."
CAE_53,"**Volunteer Tourism: A Discussion by Four Academic Writers**

**A.** The direct impact of volunteer tourism on development is often questioned. Volunteers may help build homes or schools, but they usually pay a large fee to participate. This money, if given directly to local communities, could hire more workers than a single volunteer could replace. This is especially true for gap year volunteers, who often lack technical skills or professional experience. Many studies question whether these volunteers are truly motivated by a desire to help others or if they are seeking to gain 'cultural capital' for their careers. However, these projects might help volunteers become more ethical and socially responsible in their future careers.

**B.** Volunteering can lead to better international understanding, improved conflict resolution skills, and more participation in global affairs. It can also create international social networks among ordinary people. In this way, the benefits can be greater than the individual contributions, helping both volunteers and host communities. However, if volunteering is mostly done by people from wealthier countries, it may benefit these volunteers more than the communities they visit. These volunteers might use the experience to advance their careers, while the host communities gain little.

**C.** At its worst, international volunteering can be seen as a form of imperialism or self-serving career development for wealthy Westerners. At its best, it can provide technical assistance and foster an exchange of skills and cultural experiences. Volunteering can also raise awareness and commitment to fighting inequality, poverty, and unsustainable development.

**D.** Volunteer tourism aligns with the trend of life strategies focused on helping others. These strategies, which aim to 'make a difference,' can seem positive in an anti-political climate. They avoid big government and business but also bypass the democratic process, reducing development to individual charity acts. While volunteering is a commendable act, when it is promoted as sustainable development, it can degrade the true meaning of development. The politics of volunteer tourism can shift focus away from understanding global inequalities and the poverty experienced by many in developing countries."
CAE_55,"**Sound the Alarm: Stuart Harris Reports**

Many of us listen to the radio in the morning and need something to wake us up. That's where the clock radio comes in. But how do you choose a good one? Our panel, including myself, inventor Tom Granger, and broadcaster Paul Bridges, tested five models.

The first model has a 'dual alarm function,' but it doesn't work as expected. Instead of waking you with a buzzer and then letting you snooze, it lets you set two different wake-up times, one for weekdays and one for weekends. This model is priced similarly to the second one we tested, but it includes a cassette player, which is a good deal. You can fall asleep to your own tapes and wake up without news. We all thought the radio quality was excellent, but it's quite large, about the size of a rugby ball. Paul Bridges said, ""Any clock radio I buy has to leave enough space on the bedside table for my keys, wallet, glasses, and phone. I'm paranoid and always book a wake-up call in case the alarm doesn't go off."" This model was voted the best-looking and overall winner. Paul Bridges said he was ""in love with it,"" although the clock on his test model ""kept getting stuck at 16.00."" I liked the digital display with its grey numbers on a green background. The wide snooze bar is easy to tap with your eyes closed. However, the smooth buttons made me want to touch them like piano keys, which was a problem when I finally looked at the 50-page instruction booklet. The clock has a self-power backup, so you don't have to reset it if someone unplugs it to use a hairdryer or vacuum cleaner; we all liked this feature. However, setting it up was technically challenging, though mastering it made us feel ""cool"" and sophisticated.

Tom Granger described the model with an extra built-in lamp as ""unbelievably tacky."" ""You have to pull the light out of its socket to make it work, which makes me question the quality of the rest of it."" He had to read the instruction booklet twice to get it to work; the clock kept jumping from 12.00 to 02.00, so he had to start over. The light was hard to position; you couldn't read by it as it only shines on the clock, which is already lit. Paul Bridges found the lamp idea amusing but agreed the radio was hard to tune. The buzzer reminded me of ""action stations"" on a submarine and made me want to throw it across the room. Interestingly, this model is the third most popular on the market.

Aimed at young people, with its bright colors and matching strap, this model appealed to Tom Granger and me. ""I would choose this one because it stands out,"" he said. The traditional controls made it the only one we set up without reading the instructions. Unfortunately, the alarm has a 20-minute margin for error; the manual says, ""the alarm may sound about 10 minutes earlier or later than the pre-set time."" Paul Bridges laughed at this and said it was ""terribly fiddly"" and ""completely useless.""

The simplest and cheapest model scored points with Tom Granger because it ""seemed very standard and took up little space,"" and it has old-fashioned dial tuning. ""It's more intuitive to set up. With modern push-button tuning, you're never sure if you've pressed all the buttons in the right order, so you can't trust it will work."" He admitted that manufacturers had to improve radio quality because of button-tuning. I thought the tuning was crude, as did Paul Bridges, but we agreed the radio quality was fine. The buzzer on this model certainly works; it got me out of bed in just two beeps!"
CAE_50,"Text: 'Hedgehogs A hedgehog is a small mammal known for the sharp spines covering its body. Hedgehogs are found in many parts of the world, but none are native to America or Australia. All hedgehog species can roll into a tight ball when threatened, making their spines point outwards. The success of this defense depends on how many spines the hedgehog has. Some desert hedgehogs have evolved to be lighter, so they have fewer spines and might try to run from danger, using their ball-rolling ability only if necessary. Hedgehogs are mostly active at night and sleep during the day, either under bushes or in a hole in the ground. Although all hedgehogs can hibernate, not all do; if conditions are right, some stay awake all year.'"
CAE_25,"**Great Sportswomen on a Winning Streak**

Excelling in any sport is challenging, even for men, but women often have to work twice as hard. Training and competition leave little time for a normal life, so sacrifices are necessary. Despite these challenges, women are overcoming prejudice and breaking records. Here, we talk to some brilliant British sportswomen who are achieving their goals.

**A. Jill, 27, Skier**

""It's an amazing feeling to fly through the air and land cleanly, but it can be scary. Sometimes you don't feel well, or it's windy and you can't see, but you just keep going. It's not easy to have a career outside skiing because we train for ten months a year. You give up a lot of your social life and friends. But it was my choice. There are six men and three women in the British team. We all compete on the same courses at the same competitions and get treated the sameâ€”it's a young sport.""

**B. Caroline, 22, Cyclist**

""Two years ago, I borrowed a bike to take part in a charity race. I won overall just because I cycled faster than everyone else, which was amazing because I'd never cycled before! I'm well paid as a professional, and cycling has lots of potential for endorsements. However, I know I'm not ugly, and it worries me that people may think I've succeeded because of my looks, not because I'm the best cyclist. So I focus on cycling at the moment, rather than earning money. I do at least four hours of training every day on the bike, plus some stretching exercises, swimming, and running. My boyfriend's a cyclist as well, so he understands the time you have to put into itâ€”it would be impossible otherwise.""

**C. Annabel, 26, Rower**

""Rowing is hard for girls to get into because very few girls' schools offer it. So most don't start until they're 19 or 20, which makes it harder to succeed at an international level. Also, you usually have coaches who only stay a year or so. There's no continuity, so the women's squad is basically a mess. But it's great fun, and I love being fit, plus there's a good social life.""

**D. Ffyona, 24, Long Distance Walker**

""At 13, I dreamed of walking around the worldâ€”I didn't know just how big it was then! But Britain was too claustrophobic, too safe. I was very headstrong; I hated anyone having control over me. Now I am more tactful. Each walk has been different. The walk across Australia was the worst experience I've ever had in terms of pain. I was doing 50 miles and 21 hours each day with three hours of sleep in high temperatures and walking with 15 blisters on each foot. But I got the record! I had to because my sponsorship money was going to run out after 95 days. Men think that women are more likely to fail, so sponsoring them is always seen as a higher risk.""

**E. Lisa, 26, Saloon Car Racer**

""Some men have huge egos when they're drivingâ€”you see it on motorways. When I'm doing well, they don't talk to me. Being a woman has its disadvantages. When I get to a corner, the men think 'I've got to beat her,' so I've had a lot of knocks! You have to be naturally competitive and aggressive. It's very difficult to earn any money, and what I do make goes back into the sport. Women have been racing since the twenties and have always been seen as eccentrics. It's great that there are now more and more women taking up racing every year. For me, the appeal of saloon car racing is aiming for perfectionâ€”always trying to get around with a perfect lap.""

**F. Alison, 28, Triathlete**

""I get up at 5.30 three mornings a week to swim. I need Tuesday and Thursday mornings to catch up on my sleep. In the evening, I just cycle or run. Yes, I do fall asleep at my desk sometimes! There is a lot of nervous build-up beforehand, and when you're racing, you really push yourselfâ€”you don't feel good if you don't. Several times I've asked myself why I do it. The answer is a) I'm happier when I keep fit, b) I'm a slob at heart, and if I didn't make myself do this, I'd really be one, c) racing is very social. Men and women usually compete together, but when an event is covered in the press, 90 percent of the article will explain the men's event, and 10 percent will say, 'Oh, by the way, so-and-so won the women's event.' The prize money isn't as good either, of course. But now we've formed an International Triathlon Women's Commission, so we're working on it."""
CAE_34,"**The Day I Drew Picasso**

Richard Cork remembers the day he met one of the most famous artists of the century, Pablo Picasso. At 18 years old, Richard was traveling around Europe and Morocco before starting university. He was low on money and found a job painting boats in Cannes. One day, while at an open-air restaurant in Cannes harbor, he saw Picasso having lunch with his wife, Jacqueline, and three friends. Picasso was known to be a private person, so Richard was surprised to see him there.

Encouraged by a friend, Richard nervously approached Picasso to ask for his autograph. To his surprise, Picasso agreed and signed Richard's sketchbook. He even added a playful drawing on the page. Richard was thrilled and started a conversation with Picasso, though they needed an American woman at the table to translate because Picasso's English was not good.

After showing his friend the autograph, Richard was encouraged to go back and draw Picasso's portrait. Without asking for permission, Richard began sketching Picasso, who made funny faces to make the task difficult. Despite this, Richard continued drawing, feeling challenged by Picasso's playful behavior. Eventually, Picasso stopped moving and allowed Richard to study him closely. Richard noticed how youthful and intense Picasso's eyes were, despite his age.

When Richard finished, Picasso wanted to see the portrait. Although Richard was embarrassed, Picasso looked at it and nodded approvingly. Then, Picasso took the crayon and quickly drew a playful version of Richard's face, moving one eye onto his nose and capturing his smile with a single line. Richard felt like a character from one of Picasso's mythological drawings.

Richard asked Picasso to sign the drawing, but Picasso declined, saying Richard already had his signature. Despite this, Richard felt incredibly lucky to have met Picasso and received his attention. This encounter meant a lot to him."
CAE_12,"**Talking Shop: How Stores Make You Spend More**

Have you ever gone into a store and bought more than you planned? Here, we explain the tricks shops use to make you spend more money.

**A. The Image of Freshness**

Supermarkets know that customers value fresh produce. They often place fruits and vegetables at the store entrance or display house plants to create a fresh image. An in-store bakery might spread the smell of fresh bread throughout the store. The store's colors, like green, can also enhance this fresh image. However, most of what supermarkets sell, like frozen foods and cleaning products, doesn't match this fresh image.

**B. Displaying to Advantage**

The placement of products in a store is crucial for sales, especially in supermarkets. With computerized stock control, supermarkets know which areas attract the most shoppers. High-profit items or fast-selling products are placed in these spots. The saying ""eye-level is buy-level"" means that shelves at eye height are prime spots for products. Special offers in ""dump bins"" attract bargain hunters. ""Complementation"" is also popular, like placing salad dressings near salads or desserts near ice creams.

**C. Spreading Staples Around the Store**

Supermarkets often place low-cost essentials like bread and sugar far from the entrance. This forces shoppers to pass by more expensive items. Similarly, chain stores might place popular products far from the entrance, relying on customer loyalty to lead shoppers past other tempting items.

**D. Less Sells More**

Chain stores have changed how they display products. The Next chain, for example, moved away from the ""pile them high, sell them cheap"" method. Their stores have a ""boutique"" feel, displaying fewer items to seem exclusive. However, Next's clothes are as mass-produced as their competitors'. Their success is due to good store design and well-designed clothing.

**E. Tempting Totals**

Food shoppers often focus on the total bill rather than individual prices. Supermarkets use this by offering a mix of low and high mark-up items. Not everything in a supermarket is cheap. Some items, called ""loss leaders,"" are sold at a loss to attract customers. More often, low prices come from buying in bulk or meeting sales targets, which earn discounts from manufacturers.

**F. The All-Important Price-Tag**

In chain stores, shoppers buy fewer items and notice individual prices more. Pricing a blouse at Â£14.99 instead of Â£15 is still effective. This pricing also helps reduce theft, as staff must ring up a sale to give change.

**G. Lighting to Effect**

Both supermarkets and chain stores carefully plan their lighting. Chain stores aim for lighting that resembles natural light, so clothes look the same as they would in daylight. Supermarkets use special lighting and mirrors to make fresh produce look more appealing.

**H. Walk This Way**

Many chain stores use different carpeting to guide shoppers. One pattern marks the main paths, and another marks sales areas. These paths, called the ""Yellow Brick Road,"" guide shoppers through the store. However, not all shoppers follow them. Marks and Spencer, for example, use wood or marble for paths, encouraging shoppers to step onto the more inviting carpet in sales areas.

**I. In-Store Promotion**

As you enter a supermarket, large photos of delicious foods greet you, tempting you if you're hungry. In the U.S., some supermarkets use ""video trolleys"" with screens that advertise products as you shop. Sensors trigger ads relevant to the section you're in, like an ad for ready-made meals near the cook-chill section. These trolleys target impulse shoppers and reportedly increase sales by about 30%."
CAE_26,"Chris Bonnington, a 58-year-old mountaineer, is famous for climbing Everest in 1985. He has also created new climbing routes in Britain and the Alps and has written books like ""Quest for Adventure"" and ""Everest the Hard Way."" Robin Knox-Johnston, aged 53, started his sea career in the Merchant Navy. In 1968-9, he was the first person to sail around the world alone in his yacht, Sunhaili. He also set a record for crossing the Atlantic, taking 10 days from New York to the Lizard. Chris and Robin teamed up to sail and climb in Greenland, and they wrote about their journey in their book ""Sea, Ice and Rock.""

In 1979, while working on ""Quest for Adventure,"" Chris contacted Robin for an interview. Robin invited Chris to join him for a sail, where Chris could teach him climbing, and Robin could teach Chris sailing. It was Chris's first time on a yacht. They sailed, anchored, and then went ashore to practice climbing. Chris was impressed by Robin's calmness in difficult conditions. At one point, they reached a big drop, and Chris showed Robin how to climb down. Robin, used to using his arms on the boat, wanted to descend in his own way, which he did safely.

During their trip to Skye, Chris and Robin formed a strong friendship. Robin suggested they combine their skills for a trip to Greenland, which was a larger version of their Skye adventure. Chris admired Robin's leadership. Although the skipper usually makes all decisions, Robin involved everyone in the decision-making process. Chris found the sailing part boring and challenging, as he preferred land and wasn't handy with repairs. Robin, however, enjoyed sailing and fixing things. Chris sometimes felt useless, which was difficult for him. The yacht was crowded with six people in a space meant for four, unlike a mountain expedition where you can have some space.

When they reached Greenland, Chris led the climbing part of the expedition. He found it hard to be responsible for Robin's safety, as a fall could endanger both of them. Climbing Greenland's highest mountain, the Cathedral, was tougher than expected. Robin, not a natural climber, impressed Chris with his determination. On their first attempt, they climbed for 24 hours and were exhausted. Robin trusted Chris completely, even when they had to turn back. Despite worrying about the boat, Robin was eager to try climbing the mountain again.

The only tension between them occurred on the yacht home. Chris was supposed to take a watch shift at 4 am, but Robin let him sleep, thinking he could manage alone. Chris felt insecure, thinking Robin didn't trust him, but Robin reassured him it was a misunderstanding. By the end of the Greenland expedition, Chris realized that beneath Robin's tough exterior, he was a kind and sensitive person."
CAE_8,"**A History of the Apple**

Apples have been with us since ancient times, in many colors, shapes, and sizes. However, the late 20th century risks losing this heritage.

**Prehistoric Wild Apples (8,000 BC)**

Humans have eaten apples since prehistoric times. In Neolithic Britain, they spat out apple seeds. Around 10,000 years ago, they left apple remains near their homes in Switzerland and Italy. In Switzerland and near the Caucasus mountains, ancient people stored dried apple halves for winter. These were wild crab apples, small and shriveled, known in Ancient Britain as 'windings'. They were quite different from today's apples.

**Norman Knowledge (1000 AD)**

The French learned fruit-growing skills from the Romans, which were developed in monasteries. This knowledge, including cider-making, was brought to Britain. The dessert apple, Decio, was introduced by the Roman general, Etio. However, most Roman apple varieties did not suit the British climate, and Norman varieties became more popular. British monks continued to experiment and develop new apples, which are the ancestors of many Western apples today.

**Medieval Favorites (1200)**

Several apple types became popular in Britain during the 13th century. The Old English Pearmain, recorded in 1204, was the main dessert apple until the 18th century. Its cooking counterpart was the Costard, sold in Oxford markets from 1296 to the late 17th century, giving us the word 'costermonger' for a street fruit and vegetable seller. However, prosperity declined due to droughts, the Black Death, and the Wars of the Roses. Fewer apples were produced, and more were imported. This changed in the 16th century when Henry VIII sent his chief fruiterer, Richard Harris, to France to learn about apple cultivation. Harris returned with many grafts, including the famous Pippins, and created the first modern-style orchard in Kent.

**Settler Treasure (1750)**

By the 17th century, apples were so popular in Britain that settlers took them to Canada, Australia, the US, South Africa, and New Zealand. Captain Bligh took the first apples to Australia; Jan van Riebeeck took them to South Africa, and the Pilgrim Fathers carried them to America. In North America, the most famous apple-planter was John Chapman, or 'Johnny Appleseed'. Born in 1774, he planted apple nurseries from Pennsylvania to Indiana. The Indians saw him as a medicine man, and his love for apple trees, unusual clothing, and religious devotion inspired many folktales. He was said to be so kind to animals that he even slept with bears.

**Modern Delicious (1850)**

Around this time in Iowa, a Quaker farmer named Jesse Hiatt found a shoot growing from a dead tree's roots. It became an apple tree with a new apple, which Hiatt called 'Hawkey'. At a fruit show, a judge tasted it and exclaimed 'Delicious, delicious!'. In 1895, it was introduced to the market as 'Delicious' and became one of the most widely grown apples worldwide.

**Granny Smith (1850)**

Another famous modern apple was discovered in Australia by Maria Anne Smith. The daughter of convicts, Maria was independent and rejected her parents' criminal life. She worked as a midwife in Eastwood, New South Wales, where she was known as 'Granny Smith'. She managed the family farm and orchard. In 1868, she found a small tree growing from discarded fruit. She transplanted it and soon harvested the first major crop of green apples, which became famous worldwide. When asked about the tree, she said, 'Well, it's just like God to make something useful out of what we think is rubbish', referring to both the fruit and her convict origins.

**Uniformity (1950)**

Apples are now grown worldwide, from India to Africa. Most are grown commercially and come from just a few varieties, chosen for their red skin or ability to travel well, rather than taste. This uniformity is reducing the variety and gene pool of apples. While amateur gardeners in the UK have preserved many old apple varieties, the US has lost most of its apples from 100 years ago. Consumers are starting to demand more variety. We cannot rely on amateur gardeners to save apple diversity. We must value and protect natural diversity for everyone's benefit."

CAE_30,"Richard Nerurkar, a top British 10,000-metre runner, visited a high-altitude training camp in Kenya. Located ten miles south of the equator, a mountain track leads from a quiet road from Nairobi to Mount Kenya, the country's highest peak. This area, called Nanyuki, has been my base for winter altitude training in Kenya's Central Highlands for three years. However, I had never trained with Kenyan runners on their home ground until my fourth trip. During this visit, I competed in my first race in Kenya's thin air and stayed at the national team training camp, where top runners prepare for the World Cross-Country Team Championships. I was invited by the national team coach after finishing fifth in the World Championship 10,000 meters race, behind three Kenyans and a Moroccan. It was an opportunity I couldn't miss. Training at high altitude increases red blood cells, improving oxygen capacity, which has benefited many Kenyan runners. My first race in Africa, held in Nairobi, was also the continent's first international cross-country race. It was a humbling experience, as 41 runners finished ahead of me, all but three of whom were Kenyan. Despite this, I felt I had a good race. I don't think Kenyan success is only due to altitude. Kenyan runners have a simple approach to the sport. Their running style is effortless, their diet simple, and they love competing. The least discussed aspect of their success is their training. My stay at the Kenyan team training camp revealed their methods. The camp is at St Mark's College, 6,200 feet up Mt Kenya, surrounded by playing fields and tropical vegetation. It's basic, with few comforts. Athletes live with regular students, six to a room in dormitories. Their days include three workouts: an easy morning run, interval training mid-morning, and a steady run in the late afternoon. The day starts at six, with a briefing from coaches. ""Run easy, you have a hard job today,"" we were told. They cover about 40 kilometres daily, just short of a marathon. Sundays are easier, with only one 20-kilometre run. Life outside running is simple. A splash of water and brushing teeth are enough before breakfast, which is tea, bread, and boiled eggs. Lunch and dinner are similar: ugali (a maize dish), stew, cabbage or spinach, and tea. After running, we would drive to bathe in streams from Mt Kenya's glaciers. By the time I left, I appreciated Kenyan success even more. It's not just genetics, upbringing, or altitude. I believe the simple lifestyle, tough workouts, and passion for success are the real reasons behind Kenya's dominance in world distance running."
CAE_7,"**Hit and Miss of Mass Marketing**

Advertising is struggling. This isn't just because of the recession. Advertising started to decline in early 1989, before the recession hit hard. The issues with advertising are deeper and affect the whole world. The main problem is that advertising hasn't kept up with economic changes. Advertisers think in terms of mass markets and mass media, but as more brands and media options have appeared, target markets have become more fragmented. Even big brand campaigns should focus on smaller audiences, but they often don't. This is where advertising has gone wrong.

Consider your own shopping habits. When you go to a supermarket, you might buy 30 to 50 items. Many of these won't be advertised brands, and some will be multiple purchases of the same brand. You might only buy a few advertised brands from the 15,000 products available in the store. Over a year, you probably buy only a few hundred brands. For consumer durables, maybe a dozen a year. Cars? If you have a new car, it's likely provided by your employer. If not, you might buy one every three years. You don't buy many clothes either, and most aren't advertised brands. Even when you include confectionery, medicines, hardware, and services, you likely don't buy more than 400 different brands a year.

Compare that to the 32,500 branded goods and services advertised, according to Media Register. Let's focus on the 9,500 brands that Media Register lists and analyzes. The average person buys 400 of those 9,500, and not all because of advertising. That's about 4 percent. So, the claim that ""half of my advertising is wasted"" could be more like 96 percent wasted, but no one knows which 96 percent.

When you watch TV, count how many commercials are for brands you buy or might buy. For most people, it's about one in 16 (6 percent), so the other 15 (94 percent) seem wasted. You might think you're not influenced by advertising, but almost everyone thinks that. The truth is, most people don't buy most of the brands they see advertised. Waste is part of using media for advertising. It's unrealistic to think everyone who sees an ad will buy the product. People notice only a few ads and ignore the rest, so waste is unavoidable.

However, advertising can still be cost-effective. Many ads have shown it works. Advertising needs to reach many people to find the right audience, because advertisers can't know in advance who will respond. Media advertising works because it's a cheap way to communicate with many people. Still, waste is unpleasant. With smart targeting, advertisers can reduce waste by increasing the percentage of people who respond, but they can never know exactly who will respond. Even the best direct mail campaigns never get a 100 percent response.

This is a key difference between media advertising and face-to-face selling. A salesperson might succeed with every client they speak to, but this can't happen with media. If advertisers knew exactly who would respond, they wouldn't need media at all. This applies to all types of ads, from personal notices to soft drink commercials. Any advertiser who gains one million new customers (2 percent of the adult population) is doing well. For soap powder, the top brands would be thrilled with a million extra customers. Any campaign that wins over 2 percent of the population would be very successful, and that's a small part of the population. To succeed, advertising needs to target its message more precisely than ever before."
CAE_43,"Text: 'Charles Clover explores Britain's most environmentally-friendly home. Southwell in Nottinghamshire has some surprises. One is Southwell Minster, an ancient cathedral with medieval carvings of 'green' men in its chapter house. Another is Britain's greenest home, the 'autonomous house', created by Robert and Brenda Vale. The Vales use rainwater for washing and drinking, recycle sewage into garden compost, and heat their home with waste heat from appliances and body heat from themselves, their children, and their two cats, Edison and Faraday. The house looks traditional, with a clay tile roof, and blends with the town's nineteenth-century buildings. It was approved by planners even though it's in a conservation area. The solar-powered doorbell is silent, and the house is super-insulated with triple-glazed windows, making it very quiet inside. Once inside, you must remove your shoes. The house is very still. On a sunny day, the conservatory warms the air before it ventilates the house. Vale opens ventilation shafts and windows to create airflow because the house is draught-proofed. Even the cats have an air-locked door. The Vales, who teach architecture at Nottingham University, have been committed to the environment for a long time. They wrote a book on green architecture in the 1970s, The Autonomous House. They designed a building that emits no carbon dioxide and decided to do without mains water. They created composting toilets, installed rainwater tanks in the cellar, and used copper gutters to protect drinking water, which is filtered twice. Water from washing goes into the garden. They don't use a dishwasher to avoid strong detergents. Most features are designed to be environmentally friendly. 'We wanted to show it's possible to design a house that's less harmful to the environment without living in the dark,' says Robert. 'It wouldn't be medieval.' The only medieval aspect is the hall, which rises the full height of the building. The Vales pay no water bills. Last winter, the house used only nine units of electricity a day, costing about 70p, which is what other four-bedroom houses use on top of heating. Soon it will use even less when solar panels and equipment are installed in the garden. The house will use mains electricity for cooking and appliances but will generate extra electricity. There will be enough to charge an electric car. The only heating is a small wood-burning stove, rarely used. Is it warm in winter? One February night, Robert was reading and said it was too warm to light the fire. The room temperature was 18C, comfortable because there are no draughts or heat loss. Perceived temperature depends on these factors. An Edwardian lady was comfortable at 12.5C due to her clothing's insulation. People in old houses should live as they did then, he suggests, though this idea may not catch on. The house is low-tech, with little to go wrong. Most materials came from a builder's merchant and were installed by local craftsmen, making it cheap to build, costing the same per square metre as low-cost housing. Commercial builders resist this idea.'"
CAE_51,"Text: 'The camera never lies Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of the Sherlock Holmes stories, considered himself a rational man, even a scientist. However, in 1920, when he saw photographs of fairies taken in a garden, he believed they were scientific proof that these tiny creatures existed. He published the photographs with an article he wrote, acknowledging fairies as supernatural wonders. It wasn't until 1939 that the two women who took the photos admitted they were fake. They had simply cut out pictures of fairies from a book and placed them among flowers. The results are undeniably beautiful. But the simplicity of the trick challenges a basic idea of photography, that the camera cannot lie. But it can, and always could. Today, we are used to computer software allowing us to change our digital images, and it is a myth that photography ever had a true age of innocence. From the moment cameras began capturing reality, that reality was being altered.'"
CAE_11,"Blacksmiths

Throughout history, iron has fascinated people, and those who work with it, blacksmiths, have been seen as more than just skilled workers. Before the Industrial Revolution, blacksmiths were as respected as doctors and astrologers because they made weapons, armor, and farming tools. They were also celebrated as artists. In the 18th century, blacksmiths created the intricate ironwork for St Paul's Cathedral. The flowing metal designs of French and Belgian Art Nouveau buildings were also crafted by talented blacksmiths. However, by the late 1960s in Britain, blacksmithing was almost extinct because heavy industry no longer needed them, and modern architecture rarely used elegant wrought-iron designs.

In the past 10 years, there has been a revival of interest in blacksmithing due to a renewed interest in decorative architecture and more creative interior design. Despite this, much of the work still looks old-fashioned, with manufacturers promoting 'classical' or 'Victorian-style' gates and balconies. Trendy design stores often feature rusty candlesticks with decorative elements. Fortunately, there are alternatives, and upcoming events aim to promote the blacksmith's craft. The first event, an exhibition of forged ironwork by the British Artist Blacksmiths Association (BABA), opened last week at the Fire & Iron gallery in Leatherhead, Surrey.

Alan Dawson, BABA's secretary, says, ""We could be at the start of a new Iron Age, as both the public and blacksmiths are seeing things differently."" Power tools have made it easier for blacksmiths to work with metal, allowing them to bend, split, twist, and weld it with ease. ""In short,"" says Dawson, ""these artists now have a material that lets them express themselves."" About 250 pieces are on display, from bookends to a spiral staircase. Prices start at Â£90 and go into the thousands. Most of the money will go to the makers, but a portion will support the promotion of quality ironwork, says Dawson. His own works include an eight-foot gate and a lamp with a glass shade. ""My style comes from letting steel bend and flow when it's hot. It's like drawing with metal in space,"" he says.

Many artists are fascinated by iron. Unlike most metals, which are easy to shape when cold, iron and steel are tougher and more challenging. Susan May, a jeweler, says, ""It's magical because it's very soft when hot, but becomes rigid when it cools."" Ann Catrin Evans creates steel door-knockers and handles inspired by castles from horror films. One design looks like a ball and chain, another like a Celtic cross. ""I love that steel is cold and hard,"" she says. ""And it feels like it will last forever."" No other metal has given people as much visual pleasure or a greater sense of security. Iron will likely continue to be used decoratively for many years, as long as we avoid more rusty candlesticks."
CAE_14,"**THE DAY I GAVE UP SMOKING**

I thought everyone would be happy, but one of my colleagues was very angry. ""What do you mean?"" she shouted. ""If it was that easy, why didn't you stop years ago?"" I couldn't really explain how, one afternoon, I went from being a pack-a-day smoker to not smoking at all just four hours later. It even surprises me. The stop-smoking session was a mix of group therapy and hypnotherapy, and it happened exactly two months and three weeks ago. I hadn't planned to stop, and I didn't even really want to. For one thing, I was annoyed by the constant pressure from anti-smoking groupsâ€”and I still am. Also, I had low blood pressure and a family that lived long and healthy lives. I didn't cough or feel sick and seemed to recover from colds more easily than friends who had healthier lifestyles.

On that ordinary Thursday afternoon, I went to the Birmingham session of The Easy Way to Stop Smoking to write an article about other people trying to quit. ""I won't be trying to stop myself; it wouldn't be fair,"" I said firmly. ""Since I'm here to write, not to quit, it wouldn't be right to expect your method to work on me."" I thought I was being reasonable. After all, I really enjoyed smoking. It gave me real pleasure. I thought the counselor looked at me knowingly. We were encouraged to smoke as much as we wanted, and most of the afternoon was spent in a room so filled with smoke that we had to open the windows. I noticed with interest that when I was told to smoke, I didn't want toâ€”and neither did the others.

I guess what happened was that the stop-smoking messages made sense. Just as smoking had become a challenge against opposition, the idea of stopping started to feel appealing. The thought of not being a smoker began to make me feel strong. It was a private feeling that had nothing to do with anyone else. Could I also conquer the world? In many ways, it was easy. The physical craving, the desire for nicotine, which feels like hunger, faded after a minute or two, and I only felt it for four or five days. The one activityâ€”my workâ€”that I thought would be hardest without cigarettes didn't cause any problems. I had really believed that I wouldn't be able to meet deadlines without nicotine and that, for the first time, I would fail to write a story on time. Surprisingly, spending time at home on weekend mornings was the hardestâ€”and it still is. I'm starting to think that, for me, smoking was a way to avoid boredom; having a cigarette was an activity in itself. Yes, I do miss my cigarettes, but not too much. Each ""new"" experience as a non-smoker has to be facedâ€”eating out, waiting for a plane, checking into a hotel, a theater break. All are key moments when I would have smoked before."
CAE_63,"Dorothy Hodgkin is the only British woman scientist to have won a Nobel Prize, yet she is not well-known in her own country. Georgina Ferry, who is writing Hodgkin's first biography, has noticed that few people recognize Hodgkin's name. This is surprising because if a British woman had won a Nobel Prize in literature, she would likely be famous. Hodgkin, who passed away in 1994, was an extraordinary person. Her life mirrored significant changes in the 20th century, such as the progress of women's education and the globalization of science.

When Ferry started her research, she read scientific biographies and was advised to read about Linus Pauling, a friend and contemporary of Hodgkin. Pauling, a Nobel laureate in chemistry and peace, was not well-known in Britain, which surprised Ferry. This reflects a broader issue where scientific biographies are often undervalued. Some scientists, like Peter Medawar, have even suggested that scientists' lives are not interesting to read about. This attitude contributes to the idea that there is a divide between the arts and sciences, with few scientists being featured in bookshops.

However, this is changing. Scientists are becoming more visible in the media, like Richard Dawkins and Steve Jones, who appear on TV. This helps the public see scientists as relatable people. The publishing industry is also evolving, with more engaging scientific biographies being written. Richard Feynman's memoir, ""Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman?"", was a turning point, showing scientists as real people with personal lives.

Dorothy Hodgkin was dedicated to her scientific work, achieving major breakthroughs like solving the structures of penicillin, vitamin B12, and insulin. She balanced her career with a family life, having three children and a husband who was often away. Her ability to integrate her personal and professional life is inspiring. While her personal life may not directly relate to her scientific achievements, it offers valuable lessons.

Communicating the passion for science is challenging for biographers because many readers lack the scientific background to understand complex ideas. However, understanding science is not harder than learning Shakespeare or a new language; it just requires effort. It's unfortunate that many educated people are unaware of the contributions of scientists like Dorothy Hodgkin."
CAE_56,"Margaret and Her Water-Finding Skills

Margaret Wilkins is believed to have a special ability. She can use a forked hazel rod to find water underground. Many farmers, whose wells have dried up, ask for her help. Margaret and her husband run a well-drilling business. They use modern tools like drilling rigs and air-compressed hammers. However, to find water, Margaret only needs a forked hazel stick. Their success rate is over 90%.

This skill, called dowsing, is the ability to find water, minerals, and lost objects underground. Some people think it is a 'sixth sense'. There are many ideas about how it works, from physical explanations like magnetism to spiritual ones. One believable idea is that everything on Earth vibrates, and water vibrates more than other things. Dowsers might be very good at sensing these vibrations. Some say they can 'sense' water, while others say they can smell it, as smell is a very strong sense.

In recent dry years, the Wilkins have been very busy, with a waiting list of almost six weeks at one point. Most of Margaret's clients are farmers with dry wells. She says, 'We usually see customers only once because wells last a long time.' Other clients have remote cottages or barns, now used as holiday homes, where it is too expensive to run water pipes over long distances. Some clients are golf-course developers who need water for their clubhouses.

Margaret tries to find water 50 to 70 meters deep. 'You can't drill a well where farm waste or other waste might get into the water supply. The water we find is in cracks of hard rock, and if we bring it straight up, it should be clean. But in Cornwall, you have to watch out for iron because the area is rich in minerals.' Another important thing is electricity to power the pump. It is too costly to run electricity over long distances, so the well should be near existing power sources.

After considering all this, Margaret starts looking for water. On large areas like golf courses, she begins with a map and a pendulum. 'I hold the pendulum still and move it over the map. It swings when it is over an area with water.' After the map shows possible areas, Margaret walks over the fields with a hazel stick. 'Once I'm above water, I feel something strange; I sway a bit. When it stops, I use the stick to find the exact spot to drill.' She holds the two forks of the stick with both hands and pulls them slightly outward. 'When water is right below, the straight part of the stick rises. It's crucial to drill exactly where the stick indicates. If you're off by a little, you can miss the water completely. My husband also checks the same area; usually, we agree on where to drill. If we don't agree, we keep looking until we do.'

Margaret Wilkins is not alone in practicing this unusual tradition in the west of England. Anthropologists and writers have long been interested in this mysterious skill. Margaret calls it an 'intuitive perception of the environment', and that is the best way to understand why she finds water so well. If she didn't have this 'sixth sense', how could her family continue their well-drilling business successfully year after year?"
CAE_36,"**We Changed Lives for a Day!**

Have you ever thought about swapping lives with someone else for a day? Maybe you think it would be fun to try something different? We arranged this for four people. Read about their experiences.

**Amanda's Story**

Amanda, a 23-year-old mother with two daughters, swapped lives with her friend Cindy, a 30-year-old waitress at a busy London restaurant. Amanda had never been in such a lively place before. It was dark, noisy, and full of people. She had to learn quickly how to carry a tray of drinks with one hand. It seemed easy for the other waitresses, but Amanda struggled and dropped the drinks. She was embarrassed, but the other waitresses laughed it off, saying everyone makes mistakes at first.

By 11:30 am, a queue had formed outside, and Amanda felt nervous. Luckily, the orders were automated, so she didn't have to remember them. After a few hours, her feet hurt, and she found the loud music difficult to handle. She had to keep asking customers to repeat themselves, which was embarrassing. By the end of her shift at 5 pm, she was exhausted and wanted to soak her feet. She was surprised to hear it had been a 'quiet' day. Amanda realized that waitressing is not for shy people; you need to be outgoing and calm under pressure. She was not impressed with the pay and didn't receive any tips. Amanda was happy to return to her children, finding it easier than waitressing.

**Cindy's Story**

Cindy was nervous but excited to be a 'mum' for the day. She had been warned that Amanda's daughters were cheeky, but she thought she could manage. After Amanda left for work, Cindy had to dress and feed the girls, drop Sophie at school, and Katie at nursery. She thought she would have some free time, but Amanda left a note with chores to do. After picking up Katie, shopping, and having lunch, Cindy brought Sophie home, and the chaos began. The girls turned the sofa into a trampoline and screamed loudly. Cindy hoped they would tire themselves out, but they didn't. She managed to get them to bed by 8 pm, but they kept asking for water to stay up. Cindy found it exhausting to negotiate with them all evening. She realized how tiring it is to look after children and the responsibility involved. Despite this, she enjoyed the day.

**Rosemary's Story**

Rosemary, a 42-year-old dairy farmer, swapped with Hilary, a 30-year-old primary school teacher. On the farm, Rosemary wakes up at 5:30 am, so sleeping until 7 was a treat. She was unsure about what to wear to school. At assembly, she faced about 400 pupils and hoped to blend in. She helped with a maths class and a nature project involving snails. By lunchtime, she was tired but found teachers only have a short break. She attended a staff meeting and helped with athletics trials. After lunch, there was a silent reading lesson and a French lesson, where the children practiced on her rusty French. Finally, there was Physical Education, and Rosemary was exhausted. She found speaking in front of the class daunting. Despite the holidays, she preferred farming.

**Hilary's Story**

Hilary arrived at White House Farm at 8:30 am, surprised that Rosemary had been up for three hours. The farm has 100 Jersey cows, 15 calves, and about 800 ewes. Rosemary also makes ice-cream, yoghurt, and cream. Hilary spent the morning in the ice-cream parlour, bottling milk and packaging ice-cream. At lunchtime, she checked the sheep and helped a fallen ewe. She realized the importance of daily checks. After feeding the calves, she started milking, which took two-and-a-half hours. Hilary found the day lonely and missed the children. The hardest part was the lack of time off, as cows need milking twice a day. Farming seemed romantic, but the reality was different, with irregular income and dependence on the weather."
CAE_6,"A trumpet isn't just for Christmas... It's interesting how many musicians, even famous ones, come from homes without music. Hakan Hardenberger, the only son of non-musical parents in a rural area of southern Sweden, has become a unique trumpet player at the age of 30. His recordings introduce new music, including concertos by lesser-known composers from the baroque and classical periods, as well as new works. When you meet him, he appears even younger than his age, with a fresh and open manner, much like the sound of the trumpet. Recently, he played the Hummel Trumpet Concerto in one of London's top concert halls, and a television feature focused on his work and development, filmed in both the UK and Sweden.

Born near Malmo, his career began with a Christmas gift when he was eight. His father, who liked Louis Armstrong's music, decided to give him a real trumpet, not a toy. The gift was a success, and the boy played constantly. His mother contacted the second trumpet player in the Malmo Symphony Orchestra, Bo Nilsson, to give her son lessons. Nilsson, an emerging musician, immediately recognized Hardenberger's talent. Hardenberger is grateful for having such a dedicated teacher from the start, one who was passionate about the trumpet and connected with players worldwide.

Hardenberger explains that the trumpet is a primitive instrument with imperfections, and no two mouthpieces are the same. He believes in understanding these imperfections and working with them. From the beginning, he had the ability to find the right balance and develop his unique sound. Unlike John Wallace, a great British trumpet player who started in brass bands and orchestras, Hardenberger always saw himself as a solo artist. He admired the French trumpeter Maurice Andre, who also focused on solo performances, and collected all his records.

His parents supported his ambition to make a career out of trumpet playing. At 15, he needed to decide where to study. America was considered too far and dangerous, so at 16, he went to Paris to study with Pierre Thibaud. Thibaud reinforced his desire to avoid orchestras, comparing it to ""digging in the garden."" Hardenberger knew he played better than others his age, but it was during his first competition at 17 in Paris that he realized he had a special gift for communication. Thibaud suggested entering the competition for experience. Hardenberger learned the pieces for the first round and advanced to the second, where he knew most of the pieces. In the final, he faced a challenging concerto. He didn't win first prize, but he enjoyed performing and realized that even when he thought he ""played like a pig,"" people listened to him.

Hardenberger's honesty about his work might seem arrogant, but that's not true. He thoughtfully avoids analyzing his gift for communication, believing that trying to explain it might ruin it. He says, ""The power of the music lies in the fact that it can always move people."""

""I wake up at 6:30 am, go to the gym at 7 am, and start work by 8 am. I begin operating at 8:30 am. I operate all day on Mondays and Wednesdays, and some Friday afternoons. Most head surgeries take three hours, but some can last all day. I've worked ten hours straight without eating or using the bathroom. Deciding when and how to operate can be stressful. I don't feel stressed while operating, but I sometimes worry about the next day's plans. Brain surgery is often a last resort for patients, but when it succeeds, it's very rewarding. From 10 am to 1 pm, I have an out-patients' clinic where I explain the operations. I enjoy talking to patients, but time pressure can make it hard to comfort them if they get upset. I leave work between 6 pm and 8 pm. Some nights and weekends, I'm on call and always carry my pager. On holidays, I worry for the first three days about my patients, and I dream about operating at night. I find it hard to switch off.""

**Age:** 31  

**MARITA'S DAY**  
""I get up at 7:45 am, leave home by 8:20 am, take the train, and arrive at work by 9:15 am. On Mondays at 10:30 am, we have a meeting to discuss our projects, any problems, or if anyone needs help. We work in teams; mine has three senior designers, a company partner, and a junior designer. Only 10-15% of the work is design; the rest is production. I get a brief from the client, and if we're lucky, they have clear ideas about their goals, target market, and project form. I spend three to four weeks designing, researching, and developing the project. After presenting my ideas to the client and getting approval, we work out estimates and budgets, and I start hiring photographers and illustrators. I coordinate with printers to ensure everything is on time. I spend a lot of time managing people and need to communicate well with a wide range of people. Briefing them correctly is crucial. Once their work is in, I assemble everything and send it to the printers. Managing several projects at once can be very stressful. Deadlines are always near, and no day is the same. Lunch is at 1 pm for an hour, and we try to go to the pub. Otherwise, I have sandwiches and work through. It's great when a client likes your designs and the project succeeds, but disappointing when hard work is rejected. I get home at 7:30 pm at the earliest, often later. I find it hard to relax when I get back, especially if I'm very busy.""

""I usually get up at 7 am, but two or three times a week, I meet a long-haul flight and get up between 4:30 am and 5 am. At 10:30 or 11 am, I might go for a bike ride or swim. Since chauffeuring is a sedentary job, I have to watch my diet and exercise carefully. I usually have a big breakfast and just snack during the day. People often ask me to recommend restaurants, nightclubs, or shops, so I need to know my way around. Luckily, many jobs are pre-booked, so I can check routes beforehand. Not everyone is polite. Some passengers are anti-social, arrogant, or rude. But most are well-behaved, and I've built good relationships with regular clients. Sometimes I overhear conversations in the car and have to focus on driving and not listening. The press has tried to get me to talk about clients, but I won't. I work seven days a week, up to fifteen hours a day. I have to be careful not to get too tired. I try to go to bed by 11 pm.""

**TRACY'S DAY**  
""I get up at 7 am, leave home at 7:30 am, and start my first job. My assistant and I mostly maintain gardens we designed and landscaped. We do some commercial jobs, but most are in private gardens. We spend about an hour and a half at each house. Around 11 am, we get hungry and go to a local cafÃ© for a big breakfast. I often wish time didn't pass so quickly. In summer, I may work until 10 pm; in winter, until 4:30 pm. The business office is at home, so when I return, I listen to messages and return calls. If someone wants their garden landscaped, I usually arrange a consultation in the evening, around 7 pm or 8 pm. We specialize in using old materials, like bricks and unusual plants, to make gardens look aged. But sometimes people have fixed ideas that can be quite unpleasant. Still, it's satisfying to complete a landscape and see the blooms. It's hard to relax in the evenings because I can always hear the business line ring. I never have trouble sleeping because the work is so physical that I'm always exhausted. I'm not very strong, but I'm fit. Physically, it's a tough job, but it lets your imagination run wild.""

""I arrive at the site by 8:30 am. I'm the assistant resident engineer, overseeing the building of bridges and a retaining wall to prevent cars from driving into a quarry. I ensure contractors follow the schedule and specifications, with correct safety systems and minimal environmental impact. I help coordinate site professionals and solve problems. Contractors start at 6 am, so my first task is to check with the clerk of works about what's happened since I left. The rest of the day depends on what he tells me. There's usually paperwork from contractors or design queries to answer. Lunch is usually half an hour between 2 pm and 2:30 pm, but I tend to eat on the go. Contractors have set mealtimes, and when they're eating, it's easier to check the site. Checking their work can cause conflict, so our relationship must be open. I see the duty resident engineer once a day, but if something important comes up, I act immediately. I usually leave the site around 6 pm and am on call all the time."""
CAE_40,"**Careers: Six People Talk About Their Typical Working Day**

**A. Credit Card Executive**

I wake up at 6 am and reach the office by 7.30 am. I handle customer development programs for our regular credit card users. My duties include launching and managing the Membership Rewards scheme in major European markets. I stay in touch with current card users, attract new ones, and build relationships with partner companies. I spend the first 45 minutes organizing my day and then reply to emails. I manage all advertising for the membership program across Europe, so I meet with our marketing team and advertising agencies to plan strategies and future developments. I have meetings scheduled most of the day, but I keep my door open for anyone with questions. There are nine customer service units across Europe, and I travel to different markets once or twice a week to discuss issues. When I'm in London, I leave work between 6.30 pm and 7.00 pm.

**B. Record Company Executive**

I start work at 10.00 am and go through the mail, which includes ten to twenty demo tapes, letters from producers, concert information, and invoices from musicians and studios. The phone starts ringing around 10.30 am with calls from producers, publishers, and others. I have meetings throughout the day to discuss campaigns or projects for artists, involving the press, marketing, and the managing director. When I listen to demo tapes, I try to be constructive, knowing it's someone's life's work. I can tell if the sound fits our record label. After signing a band, we work on the first album, choosing songs, producers, and musicians. I share my vision of the album with the company for marketing and sales. I also oversee budgets and spending. I leave work at 7.00 pm at the earliest and often go to gigs, sometimes seeing up to five new groups a night. After gigs, I might visit an artist in the studio. My social life revolves around work, and I often get home by 1.00 am, when I play a record to relax.

**C. Sales Director**

I wake up at 8.00 am and drive to work, arriving by 9.30 am. I open the mail, check the diary for client visits, and wait to see who comes in. I enjoy showing people around the showrooms and making sales, knowing the furniture is going to a good home. We sell antiques from Â£1,000 to Â£6,000 and buy from London salerooms, country house sales, private clients, and overseas. Many items need restoration. We have a full-time restorer, and I work with gilders, picture framers, and paper repairers. I read the Antiques Trade Gazette while having coffee to stay updated on the business, and I often visit the Victoria and Albert Museum to compare furniture. I do the accounts monthly and the tax returns every three months. I go home at 5.30 pm, and it takes about an hour to unwind.

**D. Air Traffic Controller**

I work a set shift pattern, leaving home at 6.00 am for an early shift. At 7.00 am, I take over one of the four control positions in the tower. We rotate stations, working for about an hour and a half, then taking a half-hour break before returning to a different station. The air traffic controllers, supervisor, and watch manager work as a team to control aircraft movements. In winter, we handle about 1,000 movements a day, and even more in summer. Night shifts are quieter, allowing me to read up on new air traffic requirements between 12 and 4.00 am. It's crucial to be alert in this job, so I don't hesitate to call in sick if I'm unwell. The work is stressful, and it takes time to relax after a shift. I aim to become a watch manager and eventually a general manager of the airport.

**E. Shop Manager**

If I'm on an early shift, I leave home by 8.00 am. I start by setting up the electronic point-of-sale system. I ensure someone is at the till and coordinate staff lunches and breaks. I spend the morning helping customers, finding and ordering books for them. I enjoy serving customers, though it can be annoying when they expect you to gather a pile of books based on reviews. Between 2.00 pm and 4.00 pm on weekdays, publishers' reps visit the shop, and I discuss new titles for the coming months. I consider how many copies of a title the shop might sell. When featuring a new title, I ensure it's delivered on time. The early shift ends at 5.45 pm. Two days a week, I work a late shift, closing the computer system, locking up, and going home.

**F. Financial Analyst**

I listen to the news at 7.00 am, then get up and take a taxi to work, arriving by 8.45 am. I contact our freelance reporters to learn about events in the region I'm responsible for. I assess financial risk for multinational companies operating abroad, warning clients of potential issues in a country. I provide three services: an online executive preview or newsflash, a security forecast with a six-month outlook, and a travel information security guide. From 9.15 am to 9.30 am, I meet with editors to discuss stories. My first executive preview is due online by 10.00 am, and the second by 11.00 am, so I quickly follow up on stories. I type them, send them to my editor for approval, then re-check and make changes before they go through the system. I travel to Africa about three times a year to report on events or stay updated. I leave work around 6.00 pm. It's hard to switch off, and I'm often awake until 1.00 am."
CAE_45,"**Career Power: Take Control at Work**

A. **What Makes a Good Leader?**  
A good leader inspires and guides others. Leadership isn't about physical traits like height or just intelligence. Pat Dixon, author of ""Making the Difference: Women and Men in the Workplace,"" says leadership is about making things happen with people who are as enthusiastic as you are. Enthusiasm is crucial, and a good leader should speak clearly and confidently. Dixon says, ""It's having the confidence to say 'I believe' instead of 'I think'.""

B. **Recognizing Leadership Potential**  
John van Maurik, director of a Leadership in Management course, believes many people have more leadership potential than they realize. Becoming a leader involves recognizing and developing these hidden talents. We are all born with leadership potential; we just need the right environment to grow. While it's easy to see leadership in famous figures like Emmeline Pankhurst or Mahatma Gandhi, it can be harder to see it in our own workplace. Yet, leadership is essential for effective management.

C. **Reflecting on Leadership Styles**  
Think about the best and worst boss you've had. They might have been equally good at setting goals and meeting deadlines. But how did they achieve these? The best leader motivated and supported you. The worst made you feel unimportant and blamed you when things went wrong. The first led well; the second managed poorly.

D. **Leaders vs. Managers**  
Leaders and managers are different. Managers work within set boundaries, while leaders create new paths. Michael Shea, author of ""Leadership Rules,"" writes that a good manager can keep a company running, but a good leader can transform a struggling organization, whether it's a company, a sports team, or a nation.

E. **Improving Leadership Skills**  
Whether you're a boss or a middle manager, you can improve your leadership skills. Here are some lessons:  
- Leadership is best when chosen. Find your passions and act on them.  
- See yourself as a leader. Recognize your ability to lead.  
- Collaboration is good, but sometimes firm leadership is needed. Try different styles and see how outcomes change.  
- Set and beat goals. Identify where leadership can enhance your job effectiveness and career.

F. **Developing as a Leader**  
- Leadership develops from taking the lead, taking risks, and learning from mistakes. Learn to delegate, motivate, organize, and praise.  
- Your leadership style may not immediately win over colleagues. Keep improving communication skills. Your ideas and achievements matter more than being liked.  
- Be visible and accessible to those who matter. Remember, you don't have to lead all the time. Know where your contribution is vital and help others develop as leaders."
CAE_64,"**Films on Video: Reviews by Film Critic Nick James**

**A. Abyss**  
Before Titanic, director James Cameron created this intense Cold War thriller about oil rig workers and navy experts trying to save a nuclear submarine deep underwater. The banter and bravery of foreman Bud and his team remind us of heroes in Howard Hawks' films. The production design and special effects are impressive, but the dialogue and character development are weak. Despite the skilled filmmaking, the story is typical B-movie material.

**B. The Thin Red Line**  
This video release of Andrew Marton's version of the James Jones novel about the battle for Guadalcanal offers an interesting contrast to Terrence Malick's new film. While Malick's version is mystical and poetic, Marton's is a more traditional war movie, often truer to the book. It focuses on a single soldier and his relationship with his tough sergeant. Although Malick's film is richer and more complex, Marton's version has its highlights. The flashback scene, where the soldier dreams of his wife, is portrayed with a harshness that might work better than Malick's soft-focus imagery.

**C. On Guard**  
Loosely based on Paul Feval's 1875 novel, this entertaining swashbuckler is better than most musketeer adventures. It features a great villain in Fabrice Luchini's scheming politician, who causes chaos behind the scenes. Vincent Perez is an energetic, though short-lived, hero, and Daniel Auteuil, while perhaps too serious for this type of film, also shines as an acrobat-turned-swordsman. The filmmakers use costume-drama clichÃ©s with such wit and energy that it doesn't matter.

**D. Character**  
This is a visually striking but somber story set in early 20th-century Rotterdam. The detailed production and costume design make the film look like a museum piece. Jan Decleir is consistently gloomy as the harsh bailiff Dreverhaven, who is ruthless in evicting tenants. The tense relationship with his son is central to the story, but the filmmakers seem too focused on period details to fully explore the dark and intense narrative.

**E. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly**  
This digitally re-mastered video re-release highlights director Leone's skill. The sound editing is particularly notable, with every footstep and sound coming through clearly. The storytelling is relentlessly harsh, and whenever there's a pause, Morricone's magnificent music revives the excitement. Morally, there's little difference between the good (Clint Eastwood), the bad (Lee van Cleef), and the ugly (Eli Wallach), as they all act unscrupulously across the post-Civil War West.

**F. The Longest Day**  
The publicity for this three-hour Darryl Zanuck war epic boasts 'forty-eight international stars.' With four directors and 23,000 extras, it's an over-the-top production. The early scenes, where soldiers wait for the invasion, are as slow for the audience as for the characters. Logistically impressive, it demands a big screen for full impact. On video, the experience is inevitably reduced."
CAE_29,"**BOOK A**  
Steve Martin's *Compelling Evidence* is truly gripping. The story follows a lawyer trying to start a new practice after leaving a big law firm. He ends up defending his boss's wife, who is accused of murdering her husband. The trial scenes are exciting, with the verdict uncertain until the end, and there's a surprising twist in the final pages. This is an impressive debut in a popular genre.

**BOOK B**  
*Curtains for the Cardinal* starts with excitement and throws Sigismondo, a problem-solver for the Italian Renaissance aristocracy, into a mix of politics, church intrigue, and murder. We always believe he will solve the mystery and reveal the culprits. The plot is complex and the book is a bit long, but it's still very enjoyable.

**BOOK C**  
*File Under: Deceased* introduces a new detective, Leah Hunter, created by first-time author Sarah Lacey. Leah is a tax inspector who starts investigating when a strange man dies at her feet. Despite facing challenges and the disapproval of a local detective sergeant, Leah is determined and successful in her investigation.

**BOOK D**  
In *Double Deuce* by Robert B. Parker, the intelligent private investigator Spenser helps his friend Hawk to remove drug dealers from a poor area in Boston. The dialogue is quick and clever, and there is more philosophy than violence. As always, Parker provides high-quality entertainment.

**BOOK E**  
*False Prophet* by Faye Kellermann features detectives Pete Decker and Marge Dunn as they investigate an attack and robbery at the home of a famous film star's daughter. The author's easy writing style and insight into human behavior make this an enjoyable mystery.

**BOOK F**  
Diane Henry and Nicholas Horrock, a husband and wife team, wrote *Blood Red, Snow White*. It features another lawyer and a female client, but the action happens outside the courtroom. The lawyer becomes a victim as the story unfolds. The novel combines romance, money, and violence to create an engaging suspense story.

**BOOK G**  
*Dead for a Ducat* by Simon Shaw features actor Philip Fletcher as a potential victim. A funny group of characters gathers to film a Robin Hood story, but Philip feels this isn't the right direction for his career. While Shaw usually entertains, this shift from dark comedy to farce is not his best work.

**BOOK H**  
*Fall Down Easy* is Lawrence Gough's best book in a while. Canadian police are on the hunt for a clever bank robber who targets female bank tellers. The slow, well-paced build-up of tension and the portrayal of the smart, troubled robber make this a standout detective novel."
CAE_57,"Text: ""I might be too old for this adventure, but here I go! At 34, Tim Pozzi has left a good job to go backpacking. He thinks about why he and others his age decide to take this big step. This summer, I quit my job, decided to rent out my apartment, and travel in Southeast Asia for a year. You might think I'm lucky, but I'm 34 years old, and I'm nervous. It's not like I haven't traveled before. After university, I spent two years backpacking around North and South America, and when I came back, I was determined to do it again someday. But you know how it goes... I fell in love, started a career, bought an apartment, and got used to earning a salary. But I slowly realized I was giving up my own sense of worth for my salary. When I handed in my resignation letter, it felt like I was taking control of my life again. I now have no ties. Many of my friends are married with children, and while they wouldn't trade places with me, they envy my lack of responsibilities. I'm no longer in a relationship, and I have no strong career ambitions. I feel almost obliged to make the most of that freedom - if only for my friends' sake! Why am I so nervous? First, it's about making the necessary arrangements. How could I let someone else live in my home? And how would I organize the rental? And besides, I had to decide where to go. I'm a terrible procrastinator and am already several weeks behind my planned schedule. 'Might as well enjoy the summer in England,' I told myself. Then, 'Why not stay for the start of the football season?' Cutting emotional ties makes it even harder. I'm delaying because, deep down, I wonder if I can still handle backpacking. Will I be able to adjust to a simpler way of life? Will I feel out of place among a group of backpackers fresh out of school and university? Maybe not. I've found it's becoming more common for Britons in their late twenties and thirties to want to break free from the lives they've built and travel to foreign places. Jennifer Cox, from Lonely Planet guidebook publishers, sees a growing awareness that adventure is there for the taking: 'People who always say ""I wish I'd had that opportunity"" are realizing they can have it anytime they want. They just need to be brave, organized, and confident enough to do it.' For Danny, a 30-year-old accountant, and his girlfriend Tammy, a 28-year-old teacher, it's a chance to have one last adventure before settling down. They have bought a round-the-world ticket for a year. 'I'm ready to give up job security for the trip,' says Danny. 'There's always a thought in the back of your mind that, ""OK, I'm not moving up the career ladder, I'll be in the same position when I come back,"" but I think it's a risk you have to take. When I left the office, I threw my calculator into the river as a symbolic act of defiance!' For Matt, who had just left the Army, the year he spent traveling was a time of change. 'In the military, there's a set way of doing things, a pattern to how you solve problems. I went away because I needed to change this and get rid of this approach in some cases, to have a reasonable life as a civilian.' While there are as many reasons to go traveling at my age as there are travelers, there seem to be common factors. 'We have a much more flexible workforce today,' says Angela Baron of the Institute of Personnel Development. 'There are more people working on short-term contracts, so if your contract has just ended, you've got nothing to lose.' Larger companies are even adopting career-break policies. 'If you've spent a lot of time and money training someone, it's nice to know they're coming back at some point rather than going to work for a competitor.' For Dan Hiscocks, managing director of Travellerseye, a publishing company that specializes in the stories of 'ordinary' travelers, more people in their thirties are re-evaluating their lives. 'If you're not happy with what you're doing - and many people aren't - it's no longer about just sticking it out. Now people know that opportunities exist and that a job isn't ""for life"" anymore. Travel offers a chance to reassess, to step back and think about your life.' Is giving in to wanderlust just another example of my generation's inability to accept adulthood? Jennifer Cox thinks not. 'It's a sign of a better-educated, more stable society when we're less concerned with paying the bills than wanting to live a balanced life. We're actually taking the time to ask ""Is this what I want?"" Ben, a 32-year-old picture researcher heading to Central America for a year, doesn't believe he's running away. 'It's more about running towards something. It's trying to grab some things that I want for myself.' But he does feel some fear. 'It's the thought of what I'm leaving behind, that comfortable routine - just going into the office every day, saying ""hi"" to everyone, and sitting down with a cup of coffee.' I share Ben's concerns about leaving behind an ordered life with few challenges, and I'm not sure I'd be making this journey if I hadn't found my boss so unbearable. As Jennifer Cox points out: 'This is fairly typical. There's often a catalyst, like the end of a relationship or the loss of a job. Such an event can push people to go and do it.' It may have taken a helpful push to get me moving, but I'm now looking forward to the next 12 months with growing excitement. Whatever happens, I'll be able to take satisfaction in having seized life by the horns. And in that, I'm sure I speak for all of us older backpackers."""
CAE_42,"**Plugging in the Home**

Georgina McGuiness had taken a long break from journalism and felt disconnected from the technological changes. She shares how she turned her family home into an efficient workplace.

The Christmas before last, I turned 37 and realized I needed to restart my journalism career, which seemed lost in the ""technological plug-hole."" My resume was stuck in the 1980s, when typewriters were the latest technology. It seemed unlikely anyone would hire me to work on a computer in a newsroom. Most job ads required desktop publishing experience, which I lacked. I felt more capable of hosting a seminar on nuclear physics than designing a page on a computer. I was the family technophobe; even pocket calculators confused me, and I couldn't use the video timer. Clearly, I needed to act quickly to save my career.

Leaving home before the children did seemed difficult until I entered a competition in a local newspaper. Like a success story that only happens to others, my family and I won a computer package. We received a laptop for my husband and a personal computer for the family. We quickly adapted to this new world, and terms like cyberspace, Internet, and surfing became part of our vocabulary. We started chatting with strangers worldwide via the Internet. The children stopped watching TV, and I set up a mini-office in the kitchen with a phone-answering machine, fax, CD-ROM, and modem connecting me to the information superhighway. I had everything I needed to work from home and still take the children to school.

The children were confident with computers from school, but I was hesitant, fearing I would lose all my work by pressing the wrong button. I was wrong. Although not an expert, I learned the basic skills I needed. It was logical, easy, and foolproof. With perseverance, I learned more each day. I recently started freelancing for a magazine, writing about two articles a month, and I feel I have the best of both worlds.

How has the computer helped me? Since school, my desk was always a chaotic mess, and I often lost important notes. The computer made me organized, especially with office tasks. Spreadsheets help track income and expenses, and pre-formatted invoices and letterheads save time and effort. For a journalist, being online means I can research stories, ask for more information in journalism forums, and discuss working from home with people worldwide.

However, there is a downside to working from home. You can feel isolated from human contact. There are distractions, like household chores, and when the children are home, we argue over who gets to use the computer. But more people are buying multimedia PCs, not just for education and entertainment. In my street, a new type of home-based industry is emerging, avoiding the daily commute to the city.

So, what defines home workers as we move into the next century? A report called ""PC Usage in UK Homes"" describes the typical computer user as 38 and well-educated; 93% own a personal computer, and 32% have a CD-ROM; 38% have a laser printer, and 50% a modem. Considering this, I seem to be ahead of schedule. Who knows, one day I might email a column to a newspaper in Melbourne or even publish my own magazine from home. It seems the sky, or should I say cyberspace, is the limit."
CAE_59,"**The Tartan Museum**

The modern buildings of Scotland's national museum stand out in historic Edinburgh. But are its contents as impressive? Sally Varlow visited just before it opened.

You can't miss the Museum of Scotland. It's on the corner of Chambers Street in Edinburgh, with its large, yellow sandstone tower and unique buildings, topped by a hanging garden. Last winter, the building received mixed reviews: some praised it as a 'masterpiece', others were cautious, and some disliked it. Now, as the museum prepares to open, the exhibitions might receive similar reactions.

The museum tells Scotland's story with a variety of historical objects. It provides a timeline to help visitors but doesn't restrict the displays. It showcases national treasures like Mary Queen of Scots' jewels without overwhelming them with national pride. The main question is whether people will find the museum interesting enough to return.

Dr. David Clarke, head of exhibitions, wants the museum to be a visual experience for everyone, not just experts. He avoids using imaginative recreations of the past, believing the public deserves the truth. So, the museum shows what experts know, using explanation panels, captions, and some multimedia.

Inside, the museum's spaces are impressive. Galleries connect in different sizes and shapes, with pale walls that look like stone and deep display cases. Daylight streams through windows, creating a pleasant atmosphere to enjoy the exhibits.

The museum also has a Discovery Centre for children, thanks to a Junior board of 9- to 12-year-olds from across Scotland. They wanted to ride through the displays but instead got a hands-on centre for kids.

The Twentieth Century gallery on the top floor is the only temporary exhibition. It features objects chosen by Scottish people and others that impacted life in Scotland during the twentieth century. The Prime Minister suggested an electric guitar, while others chose televisions and toys. Although fun, it feels like a light solution rather than addressing serious issues. It might seem more substantial when the computerised bank of personal stories goes live.

Overall, Dr. Clarke believes objects vividly open windows to the past. The modern architecture works well inside, but whether it fits the location is another question."
CAE_54,"Text: 'The end of print may take some time Peter Preston Transition. It's a comforting word. Change can scare some people and challenge others. But transition means moving smoothly from the present to the future. However, when it comes to newspapers moving online, this transition is uncertain and uncomfortable. You might think it will happen eventually because print newspaper sales are dropping while visits to their websites are increasing. For example, The Daily Telegraph and The Guardian have seen print sales fall by 8% to 10% in a year, but their website visits are rising. This might be true, depending on factors like timing and location. Experts say so, but let's consider some things that don't quite fit. If sales in some areas have only slightly fallen, maybe the crisis mainly affects newspapers. Yet, the messages are mixed. The World Association of Newspapers reports that global circulation rose by 1.1% last year, with sales in Asia compensating for declines in the West. News magazines, expected to struggle in the digital age, actually saw a 5.4% increase. In both the US and Europe, some magazines declined, but many grew quickly. A similar trend is seen with books. E-readers like Kindle are popular, with sales increasing significantly. However, the value of physical books sold only dropped by 0.4%. So, it's not just screen or paper; it's both. Stories about young people abandoning newspapers are exaggerated. The National Readership Survey shows nearly 5 million people aged 15 to 35 read national dailies. In Europe, different countries have different trends. In Britain, print sales fell by 10.8%, but in Germany, the decline was only 7%, and in France, just 3.1%. These varied trends suggest a more complex situation than digital revolution predictions. In the US, media analysts once thought online ads would support the shift to digital, but with digital ad revenues falling, this idea seems outdated. Now, 360 US newspapers have paywalls. The best way to attract paying readers is to offer print and digital access together. Print is still important for selling online subscriptions, and print ads earn much more than online ones. This difference is challenging for newspaper companies because maintaining both print and online editions is costly. However, newspaper brands still have a strong presence in print, and being noticed online is harder.'"

People are the most interesting subjects to photograph. A photo with a person is usually more engaging than one without. However, photographing people well is challenging. Besides technical and artistic aspects, photographers must pay attention to actions, gestures, and expressions. Sometimes, the camera can make people act unnaturally.

**A. GROUPING PEOPLE**

Avoid straight lines in group photos. Ask people to stand at different angles and distances, or on different levels. You can also have some people sitting or kneeling in front so all faces are visible, or raise your viewpoint.

**B. POSING FOR PICTURES**

People often act unnaturally in front of a camera. They might become stiff. Help them relax by suggesting comfortable positions, like folding their hands or putting them in their pockets.

**C. THE RIGHT APPROACH**

Don't pretend you're not taking a picture when you clearly are, as this creates tension. Most people will agree to be photographed, though they might protest at first. They may become self-conscious, so you might need to guide them. A photo can be ruined if the subject looks aimlessly away, drawing interest elsewhere.

**D. EYE CONTACT**

A photo has more impact if the subject looks at the viewer. Ask them to look into the lens, but not necessarily to smile. They might not maintain this for long, so remind them before you take the shot. You can also say something funny or unexpected for a genuine reaction.

**E. CANDID CONCENTRATION**

Instead of direct eye contact, the subject can focus on something within the picture. This might be easier for them, and the viewer can follow their gaze. Candid shots are fascinating, and the subject's expression is crucial.

**F. EXPRESSIONS AND GESTURES**

Expressions and gestures reveal much about the subject. A laughing child, even if poorly dressed, makes the viewer smile, while a sad expression evokes sympathy. Look for familiar expressions like shrugs, winks, or thumbs-up. They are a universal visual language.

**G. SITUATION INTEREST**

While close-up shots have impact, the background can add interest and information. Exclude irrelevant details or blur them by focusing selectively. Ensure the subject isn't overwhelmed by the background; a wide-angle lens can help balance the subject and background.

**H. INTERACTION**

When people interactâ€”talking, arguing, or working togetherâ€”there are opportunities for great photos. Couples, mothers and babies, or teams make appealing shots. Look for eye contact or physical contact, like a handshake. Capture reactions with animated expressions or gestures.

**I. PEOPLE AND PLACES**

Many photos of people are taken on holidays to show the places visited. To improve these photos, use a standard or wide-angle lens and step back to include the whole scene. Ask subjects to come close to the camera, forming a foreground without blocking the background. An elevated camera position can help. A good photo balances the subjects and the place, sharing the viewer's attention.

**J. TO POSE OR NOT TO POSE?**

Decide why you want the photo. If it's to remember someone you met briefly, ask them to pose against a nice background. Family photos can be dull if they are all formal poses. Candid shots of events are more lively, especially when you know the subject well. A spontaneous photo can trigger memories better than a posed one."
CAE_65,"**Under Sarah's Spell**

Sarah Janson is a trompe-l'oeil artist. Her paintings trick the eye by creating the illusion of reality. In this interview with Joanna Watt, we learn more about her. 

Sarah Janson is one of the few artists who do not sign their work unless asked. She believes the work is more important than the artist. Janson is very modest and almost suggests her paintings create themselves. This attitude makes her a challenging interview subject. She admits, ""I just don't like to talk about myself,"" and is uncomfortable being photographed for the article.

However, once settled in her living room, filled with art, the interview becomes lively and entertaining. Janson has been a trompe-l'oeil artist for sixteen years. She studied drawing for two years at art school, earned a degree in graphic illustration, and worked at a publishing house. But illustration didn't satisfy her, so she joined a decorator named Jim Smart. He asked her to create a trompe-l'oeil piece, and she found her passion. She left to start her own business, feeling she was on the right path.

Janson's skills in observation and detail, developed through illustration, are crucial for trompe-l'oeil. She says, ""Trompe-l'oeil is the school of life. It's all about observation."" She insists she is still learning and believes that thinking you've mastered something means it's time to stop. She is honest about her weaknesses, like her struggle to paint bread, and her difficulties with math. When working on a large project for a chapel ceiling, she doubted herself, thinking, ""You're not Michelangelo.""

Janson often talks about her work as if someone else did it. Her trompe-l'oeil projects speak for themselves, standing out in a field that has seen a revival but not always with great results. She has completed many major corporate and private commissions. Her work is often inspired by architecture, like a dining room based on a Venetian palace or a painting that creates the illusion of extra rooms.

Trompe-l'oeil must do two things: trick the viewer and engage their imagination. Janson believes it should also be personal to the client. She enjoys working with clients, saying, ""That's where the ideas are born."" Some clients have clear ideas, while others do not, so she listens and tries to understand their imagination. Many clients become friends because she spends so much time with them during projects.

Janson praises her clients, saying, ""I am very grateful for the mad ones who have let me loose on their walls."" Her clients are happy with her work, which keeps her busy, despite her modesty. She repeats, ""I really don't like to shout about myself."" Like her work, she is restrained and believes things that shout become boring. However, you could never be bored with Janson or her work, which deserves more recognition."
CAE_61,"**Emotional Intelligence - The Key to Success**

Daniel Goleman explores the 'people skills' that are crucial for reaching the top in your career.

**A** The rules for work are changing. We are now judged not only by our intelligence or expertise but also by how well we manage ourselves and interact with others. This new standard is important in deciding who gets hired or promoted. It can predict who will excel and who will not. These skills are vital for future job opportunities, regardless of the field. They are different from what we learned in school. Doing well in exams is not enough. This new measure assumes we all have the necessary intellectual and technical skills. It focuses on social skills and personal qualities like initiative, empathy, adaptability, and persuasivenessâ€”collectively known as emotional intelligence.

**B** In a time when job security is uncertain, personal qualities are becoming more important at work. These have been called 'character', 'personality', or 'soft skills' in the past, but now we understand them better as 'emotional intelligence'. This is the ability to understand and manage our own and others' emotions, using them to guide our actions. In work, it includes self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills. Some think it means just 'being nice', but it can also mean confronting someone with the truth when needed. Emotional intelligence is not about expressing all feelings freely but managing them effectively to help people work together towards a common goal.

**C** More businesses are recognizing that emotional intelligence is essential for management. The more complex the job, the more important these skills become. Lack of emotional intelligence can limit the use of technical skills or intelligence. While some people succeed despite weaknesses in emotional intelligence, as work becomes more complex and team-oriented, companies that foster these skills have an advantage. In today's workplace, with its focus on teamwork and customer service, emotional intelligence is becoming crucial for success everywhere.

**D** Unlike IQ, which changes little, emotional intelligence can grow as we learn from life experiences. Studies show that people often become better at managing their emotions, motivating themselves, and improving their empathy and social skills over time. This growth in emotional intelligence is often called maturity. These skills can be learned and added to our personal toolkit, especially important when job stability is uncertain. Emotional intelligence is not a magic solution for struggling organizations, nor does it guarantee more market share or profits. However, if the human element is ignored, other efforts may not be as effective."
CAE_52,"Text: 'Should the media make money from content they don't own? Digital cameras and camera phones have made it easier to capture important events, but it is social media that has changed citizen photography. News often breaks on social networks, and some journalists now use them to find images during fast-moving events. Unfortunately, some reporters have used user-generated content (UGC) without asking for permission. Even though there is official advice that images on social media can be used without permission in special cases or if there is a strong public interest, there is still debate about whether this is right. Research shows that about one in ten people would film or photograph a news event, showing that UGC is important for the future of the media. However, to keep a good relationship with the public, the media must ensure people are properly rewarded for their work and always ask for permission.'"
CAE_28,"**Ancient Chinese Medicine in the West**

**Acupuncture's Origins and Use**

Acupuncture is a practice that is 2,000 years old. It is part of traditional Chinese medicine, which also includes herbal remedies, massage, diet, and exercise. Acupuncture is used to treat various conditions, but it is most known in the West for its role in pain relief. Some general practitioners, midwives, and physiotherapists use it regularly to help with pain.

**Understanding Traditional Chinese Medicine**

Traditional Chinese medicine views health as a balance of energy in the mind, body, and spirit. This energy, called Qi (pronounced ""chee""), flows through the body along paths known as meridians. There are twelve main meridians, each connected to an internal organ, and many smaller ones that distribute Qi to every cell. If the flow of Qi is disrupted, the body may become unbalanced, leading to weakness or illness. A traditional acupuncturist will try to identify where the Qi is imbalanced by checking your pulse, examining your tongue, and assessing your overall appearance. They will also ask about your medical history, current health, and lifestyle habits. Acupuncture involves inserting fine needles into the skin, sometimes with added warmth from herbs or pressure, to stimulate Qi flow.

**Acupuncture Points**

The points used in acupuncture are related to meridians and may not be near the area of pain. People often feel a dull ache or tingling when the needle is manipulated, either by hand or with an electro-acupuncture machine. Acupuncturists believe this sensation indicates the needle has reached the Qi. There are over 300 points on the main meridians, with many more used less frequently.

**Scientific Explanations**

Even without accepting traditional Chinese principles, Western doctors recognize that acupuncture can relieve pain. Scientific explanations suggest that acupuncture may work by stimulating nerves to block pain signals or by releasing natural pain-relieving substances called endorphins.

**Types of Pain Treated**

Many people with chronic pain turn to acupuncture when other treatments fail. It is commonly used for back pain, sports injuries, arthritis, headaches, migraines, and post-operative pain. Acupuncturists also claim to treat menstrual pain, facial nerve pain, and pain in terminally ill patients.

**Modern Developments**

Although acupuncture has been used in China for over 2,000 years, its use as an alternative to anesthesia in surgery began in the 1950s. This development helped convince some Western doctors of its effectiveness. In China, acupuncture is used in various surgeries, sometimes with electrical stimulation or drugs. It is said to eliminate pain without the side effects of conventional anesthetics, allowing quicker recovery.

**Effectiveness and Trials**

Clinical trials for acupuncture are challenging to conduct, but those that exist show that 50 to 80 percent of people find it effective for chronic pain. Acupuncturists report similar success rates, acknowledging that it may not work for everyone. For chronic pain, relief usually occurs after six or seven visits, with some improvement after two or three.

**Different Approaches to Pain**

Western and Chinese medicine have different views on pain. Acupuncturists take a holistic approach, considering the whole person rather than just symptoms. They spend time diagnosing underlying weaknesses in Qi and consider external factors like weather conditions that might affect pain. This approach is different from that of a typical medical doctor.

**Choosing an Acupuncturist**

Some medical professionals have traditional acupuncture training, while others, including many general practitioners, prefer scientific explanations. Traditional acupuncturists believe that only by using traditional Chinese medicine can deep, lasting changes be achieved. When choosing an acupuncturist, ensure they are qualified and will refer you to a medical doctor if necessary."
CAE_35,"P.D. James, whose full name is Phyllis Dorothy James, is a famous crime writer known for her complex and imaginative stories. Despite her quiet and authoritative presence, she admits to being shy. Her famous detective character, Adam Dalgliesh, reflects her own personality, or how she imagines she might have been if she were a man. Like Dalgliesh, she prefers to work alone, especially when writing, needing complete privacy.

James is modest about her success, even though her 12 detective novels are loved by readers worldwide. She admires the works of her friend Ruth Rendell, especially those written under the name Barbara Vine. Her reading preferences include women writers like Iris Murdoch and Anita Brookner, but she also appreciates male authors such as Graham Greene and Evelyn Waugh.

James's success came later in life. She was 42 when her first novel, ""Cover Her Face,"" was published. Born in Oxford and raised in Cambridge, she met her husband, Connor Bantry White, there. Her life has had its challenges; her husband returned from World War II very ill, and she had to work hard to support him and their two daughters. Her in-laws helped care for her children during these tough times.

While working full-time for the National Health Service and later at the Home Office, she used her organizational skills effectively. Her work in forensic science exposed her to the realities of crime, but it was the structure of crime novels that attracted her. She always wanted to be a writer and saw detective stories as a way to practice serious writing without drawing from her personal life.

James believes that writing detective stories is about creating order from chaos. Solving a crime in a story affirms the value of life, even if the life in question is not particularly likable. She emphasizes that nobody truly enjoys violence."
CAE_5,"**The Pen is Mightier than the Psychoanalyst**

The study of handwriting to reveal a person's character is gaining support. In some countries, if you apply for a job, you might be asked for a sample of your handwriting. Your handwriting could help decide if you are suitable for the job. Handwriting analysis, or graphology, is seen as a real science in many places. Researchers say it can help identify certain illnesses, like heart disease and cancer, and can show psychological states and emotional issues. Handwriting analysis is being used more for career guidance and during interviews. Many big companies hire graphologists to study the handwriting of potential candidates for important jobs. However, most doctors and psychiatrists are skeptical about the value of graphology. 

Patricia Marne, a professional graphologist for over 20 years, argues that they should take it more seriously. She believes handwriting can show psychological traits and some medical conditions. She says, ""Handwriting is a strong indicator of social class and intelligence. But more than that, it can assess mental ability and potential, whether a person should focus on arts or sciences, and whether they have a devious or open character."" According to Ms. Marne, graphology can be useful in assessing possible criminal tendencies: ""Criminals often have disturbed handwriting, mostly illiterate and poorly-shaped. Most criminals come from deprived backgrounds and have arrested emotional development. This often shows up in unusually childish handwriting and in going over letters several times. I can tell whether people are honest, manipulators, or reliable employees.""

""Young male offenders frequently have very high ascenders, indicating that they live in a world of fantasy and dream of making it big. Graphologists can tell whether violence is about to erupt, whether the writer is under unbearable pressure, and whether there are psychopathic tendencies. Handwriting can be used to predict would-be suicides."" Heart and lung problems can also show up, she says. ""You can't make a diagnosis from one sample, unless the writing is obviously shaky or disturbed. But if over time it changes or becomes disjointed, if there's a break in the signature which did not exist before, that could be a sign that something quite serious has occurred."" A severe emotional upset can also show up in a temporarily altered signature, she maintains.

Ms. Marne says handwriting can reveal other psychological characteristics. People with writing in which letters form ""threads"" instead of being individually formed are, apparently, devious and clever. Those who write mainly in capitals are trying to hide their true selves from others. Very light pressure indicates sensitivity and lack of vitality. Originality in handwritingâ€”how far the writer has deviated from copybook scriptâ€”indicates confidence and artistic ability. Disconnected writing is the main sign of a loner. Very small signatures indicate inhibition and an inferiority complex; circles over the 'i' are a bid for attention, and crossing the 't' heavily over the whole word is a sign of intolerance and a patronizing attitude.

Ms. Marne says it takes six years of study and experience to analyze handwriting accurately, and this must be combined with empathy and intuition. She feels more research is needed to put graphology on a proper scientific footing. This will happen soon, she believes. ""It's actually far more accurate than psychoanalysis, as you can tell the whole history of the person, including all their emotional crises, without asking them questions to which they may give wrong answers."" 

Interesting as all this may sound, there is little hard evidence to support such claims. Some psychiatrists are highly critical of them. Handwriting, they say, is a product of education, artistic ability, and the type of writing taughtâ€”and has no other significance."
CAE_41,"Text: 'Is your office working well? Fresh air and the right chairs are important for a happy, healthy workforce, according to a new survey. We visited four different offices to see how healthy and happy they were as work environments. Our expert panel included a building health consultant, an ergonomist who studies people's working conditions, and an occupational psychologist. Here are their opinions. Office A. Advertising Agency Building Health Consultant: This office is very simple; no central heating, no mechanical ventilation, windows open directly to the street. It's hard to see why this space works, but the people, who are part of a small, dynamic team, seem to have few complaints. They adapt to the seasons by opening doors and roof panels or using electric heaters, much like they do at home. This might be the key: a team of seven people have created a happy, homely work environment without any outside bureaucracy. Ergonomist: The furniture here has developed over time; no two pieces match. Much of it causes bad working postures. Chairs are old, most aren't adjustable, and many are broken. Although this environment is poor in that way, the staff have a varied work schedule, which they control -- office work, meeting clients, making presentations, and so on. This variety reduces the risk of fatigue, boredom, and muscle problems. Occupational Psychologist: Staff are happy with the variety of work and the flexible office space. They said their office was 'just the right size' -- small enough to know what colleagues are doing, large enough to be alone and focus on personal work. I found the office attractive and fun, showing both efficiency and creativity. Office B. News Service Building Health Consultant: While the office may not be very exciting, it seems comfortable and is not disliked by the staff. The air quality and general maintenance standards seem good. This is helped by a No Smoking policy. Ergonomist: I was not surprised to learn that the company had already used the services of an ergonomist. Chairs are excellent, lighting and computer equipment are good. Space provision is good, although the layout could be improved. But the environment is impersonal and unstimulating, with grey, bare walls. Occupational Psychologist: Walls are bare except for year planners and a poster about maternity rights. Most staff have been there for at least five years and relationships are satisfactory. The office could be improved if the desks were positioned to make sharing information easier. Success stories or information on upcoming projects could be displayed on the walls. Office C. Bank Building Health Consultant: An office that produces mixed reactions from those working in it. The feeling inside is like being in a glass case, viewed by, and viewing, many similar exhibits. Despite a mix of smokers and non-smokers in a relatively small space, the air did not seem stale. Even standing only 1.5 meters away from a smoker, it was not possible to smell his cigarette. Ergonomist: The office area is, unfortunately, very standard and uninspiring. The desks are adequate, but only just. Not all the chairs used for computer work meet requirements, but this is user choice. Computer screens are often on small desk units with lowered keyboard shelves; this is no longer considered appropriate for modern equipment. Occupational Psychologist: Staff are supportive of each other and well served by technology. Many communications awards are on display. The wood-colored paneling and brown carpet give a slightly serious effect. The office is a buzz of activity. Office D. Newspaper Building Health Consultant: It is hard to say anything good about this building. The air-conditioning control is very basic, causing large temperature changes. The space is cluttered and most people have inadequate desk space. The office is very dusty -- there are many places for dust to settle. The shed-type roof also collects dust, which, if disturbed, falls on those sitting below. Ergonomist: The furniture would be more suitable in a carpentry workshop than in a high-tech industry. Most of the chairs are of little use to keyboard users, especially those shorter than about 1.75 m. Many chairs are old, lack proper adjustment, and have armrests that prevent the user from getting close to the desk. Occupational Psychologist: Old brown chairs, dirty carpets, dust, and dirt everywhere. A lot of room for improvement -- the place needs a good clean-up, individual success could be more recognized, air conditioning needs to be improved immediately -- there are many smokers. Few conversations were happening when we visited; everyone seemed stressed and driven by deadlines. The company needs to adopt a policy of team-working.'"
CAE_38,"**Chewing Gum Culture**

Chewing gum is popular and classless, with Americans consuming 12 million sticks daily. Learn how this ancient habit became a major industry. Each stick of gum has fewer than ten calories, but it is considered a food and must meet the American Food and Drug Administration's standards. Modern gum is mostly synthetic, with added pine resins and softeners to maintain flavor and texture. 

In ancient times, Greeks chewed a resin from the mastic tree, found mainly in Greece and Turkey, to clean their teeth and freshen their breath. American colonists learned from the Amero-Indians in New England to chew resin from spruce trees. In the early 1800s, spruce gum was sold in the eastern United States, becoming the first commercial chewing gum there.

Modern chewing gum began in the late 1860s with chicle, a milky substance from the sapodilla tree in Central America. This gum was smoother and more elastic, leading to a new industry. However, attempts to grow sapodilla commercially have failed, so synthetic alternatives were developed as the market grew. Today, the few remaining chicle gatherers, called chicleros, live a tough and dangerous life, traveling long distances to collect sapodilla in humid conditions. They face threats from poisonous snakes, insects, and the chicle fly, which lays eggs in their ears and nose. Despite these dangers, chicleros climb trees with just a rope and an axe to collect the sap, which is then boiled into bricks at forest camps. Life at these camps is hard, with a basic maize diet and local alcohol.

Despite the harsh conditions, chicleros worry about their jobs. The U.S. once imported 7,000 tonnes of chicle annually from Central America, but last year only 200 tonnes were collected in Mexico's Yucatan peninsula. As gum sales have increased, manufacturers have turned to synthetic materials to cut costs and meet demand.

Gum producers are also finding creative ways to market their products. Gum is said to help you relax, boost energy, and reduce tension. It was even given to soldiers during both world wars. Its biggest claim is that it reduces tooth decay by increasing saliva flow, which neutralizes plaque acid and provides minerals like calcium, phosphate, and fluoride. Research continues on new textures and flavors, with glycerine and vegetable oils used to blend the gum base. Most new flavors are artificial, but some still need natural ingredients. Additionally, 137 square kilometers of America are dedicated to growing mint for the two most popular chewing gums in the world."

Ghanerao Hotel is located at the edge of the Aravalli Hills in a small village known for its craftsmen. It combines the calm of an English country house with Indian symbolism. The Ghanerao family has lived there for 400 years, and now Sajjan Singh and his wife welcome paying guests. The facilities are basic, with hot water provided by bucket, but this simplicity adds to its charm.

**B. NEW ZEALAND - HERMITAGE HOTEL, MOUNT COOK**  
The Hermitage Hotel on New Zealand's South Island is one of my favorite hotels. I discovered it by chance while climbing. We were flown near the top of a glacier, climbed to the peak, and then walked down. At the bottom, I was surprised to find this hotel. It is in a stunningly beautiful, wild, and high-up area. After a tiring climb, finding yourself in luxury, with someone playing Cole Porter on the piano, is extraordinary.

**C. MAURITIUS - BEACHCOMBER PARADIS HOTEL**  
On the southwest of Mauritius, the Paradis Hotel is on its own peninsula in a quiet part of the island. Driving from here, the road winds along the coast past empty beaches with only fishermen. The hotel is not small, and many enjoy the free watersports, but you can easily find solitude along nine kilometers of private beach. Swim a few yards into the Indian Ocean, and the hotel is hidden by palm trees. In the evening, sit on the beach as the light fades, and you'll feel far away from everything.

**D. ST LUCIA - LADERA HOTEL, ST LUCIA**  
The Ladera Hotel in St Lucia has one of the Caribbean's most dramatic settings. Quiet and remote, it stands 1,000 feet high, with open rooms looking out between the twin peaks of the Pitons to the Caribbean Seaâ€”a stunning view in the morning! The style is colonial, with mahogany and greenheart wood furniture, and four-poster beds with muslin netting.

**E. TURKEY - THE SPLENDID HOTEL, ISTANBUL**  
This hotel, on Buyukada in the Princes Islands, is perfect for escaping Istanbul's noise. The islands are an hour by boat and are idyllic. There are no cars, only horse-drawn carriages and beautiful 1920s wooden architecture. The islands are a mix of Key West and the Old South, and the landmark building is the Splendid. Made of wood, painted white with red domes, it's a copy of a turn-of-the-century hotel on the French Riviera. It's a bit run down now but still charming.

**F. FRANCE - CHATEAU D'ETOGES, EPERNAY**  
In the small village of Etoges, in the heart of Champagne, is a beautiful 17th-century chateau. Surrounded by a moat with two swans, the chateau was a family home until recently and has 20 unique rooms, some with four-poster bedsâ€”one even has a large billiard table. There are special weekend rates for two nights with breakfast and dinner, plus complimentary champagne (their own brand, if you want to take some home).

**G. KENYA - THE FAIRVIEW HOTEL, NAIROBI**  
The Fairview is a rare find in Africaâ€”a comfortable hotel without excessive luxury. It's a key stop for travelers resting from one safari and planning the next. Some guests arrive, see the gardens, rooms, and dining menu, and decide to stay longer. There are even apartments for those who choose to stay for months. The hotel's leafy grounds and scattered buildings are on Nairobi Hill, far from the city's busy center. It's a great place to watch the African sunset, sip beer, and look forward to a hearty dinnerâ€”like braised zebra and two vegetables, followed by jelly trifle.

**H. ITALY - HOTEL SPLENDIDO, PORTOFINO**  
The Duke of Windsor was the first to sign the guest book at Hotel Splendido. Since then, many famous people have visited, like Lauren Bacall and Humphrey Bogart, Liz Taylor and Richard Burton. Today, you might meet a soft drinks billionaire or a rubber-tyre heiress. This former monastery-turned-villa-turned-hotel is still splendid, as its name suggests, and has enough glamour to enhance any weekend break. The restaurant offers deliciously simple food, and there are fine Persian rugs and homemade pasta."
CAE_47,"Text: Sue Brown is a hotel inspector. Christopher Middleton watched her work. Just one minute into her inspection at the Globe Hotel, things start to go wrong. The receptionist is busy on the phone, unaware that she is ignoring an important guest. ""Hasn't even acknowledged us,"" Sue whispers. ""Very poor."" This is a common mistake Sue has seen many times in her 11 years as an inspector. ""But this isn't an ordinary three-star place,"" she says. ""It has three red stars, and I would expect better."" Red stars mean the Globe is among the top 130 of 4,000 hotels in the guide published by Sue's organization. Even before the cold welcome, there were issues. The entrance from the car park was through an unmanned door with a buzzer, leading to a long, empty corridor. ""Again, not what I had expected,"" says Sue. Things get worse. ""We seem to have no record of your booking,"" the receptionist says. Only three of the hotel's 15 rooms are occupied that night. One room on the top floor is not to Sue's liking: it's stuffy, and there's a large hole in the wall behind a wardrobe panel. Early in her career, Sue was known for being tough. ""The Woman in Black, I was called,"" she remembers, ""which was funny because I never wore black. And I've never been too tough."" The next morning, after paying her bill, Sue reveals her identity to the Globe's general manager, Robin Greaves. He looks terrified. Before she says more, he apologizes for the bad smell in the main lounge. ""We think there's a blocked drain,"" he says. ""The whole floor might need to come up."" Sue suggests they should not take guests into that room. ""Better to guide them to the other lounge,"" she advises. Greaves agrees and takes notes. He has been at the Globe for only five months and struggles to believe Sue when she says her feedback will help the hotel in the long run. Not everything is negative. Emma, the assistant manager, and Trudy, a young waitress, are praised for their work. Dinner was good enough to keep the hotel's two-rosette food rating. Greaves asks, ""What do we need to do to get three rosettes?"" Sue suggests, ""Don't serve a pudding that collapses."" The light in Greaves' eyes fades. Sue's job is to voice complaints that other guests might not express. ""Sometimes it's delicate,"" she says. ""Once, a woman complained I got her son fired. All I could say was he served me apple pie with his fingers."" Sue also writes a full report for the hotelier. They pay for her advice, as there is a fee to be in the guide. Being a red-star hotel is worth it. Greaves is relieved to hear Sue won't recommend removing the Globe's red stars. The bad news is another inspector will return in two months to check improvements. ""Good,"" Greaves says, not very convincingly. ""We'll look forward to that."""
CAE_48,"**Seven Up: Conquering the Seven Summits**

Mountaineer Doug Scott shares his experiences of climbing the highest peak on each continent, known as the Seven Summits. His journey began later in life, and he recounts them in the order he climbed them.

**A. Mt. Everest, Asia (8,848m)**  
Doug and his partner, Dougal Haston, were in a snow cave near the summit. Dougal started talking to someone who wasn't there, likely due to lack of oxygen. Doug also found himself talking to his feet, worried about frostbite. Despite these challenges, Doug felt confident with Dougal and managed to reach the summit.

**B. Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)**  
In April 1976, Doug and Dougal faced the world's most dangerous mountain. They carried all their gear on their backs, a first for a new route. The low air pressure made it feel like they were at a higher altitude. After a tough climb, they reached the summit.

**C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,895m)**  
In September 1976, Doug and Paul Braithwaite intended to climb Mt. Kenya but ended up on Kilimanjaro. They got lost in the jungle, struggling with scarce water. They eventually found a trail and reached the summit via the Umbwe route.

**D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)**  
In January 1992, Doug and his wife, Sharu, joined a group to climb Aconcagua. Bad weather delayed them, and they chose an easier route to meet their flight schedule. They reached the summit and met climbers aiming for the Seven Summits, inspiring Doug to consider the same goal.

**E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)**  
Doug realized he could climb Vinson Massif by guiding others to cover costs. In November 1992, his team reached the summit despite harsh weather. The experience was uplifting, though visibility was poor.

**F. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)**  
In summer 1994, Doug's team faced challenges on Elbrus, including a demand for a commission that was later waived. They reached what they thought was the summit, only to find another ridge. They returned safely the next day.

**G. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)**  
Doug's team aimed to establish a new route and connect with the Dani people. Despite warnings of danger, they climbed the mountain, reaching the summit by 11 am. This marked Doug's completion of the Seven Summits, celebrated with a standing ovation. Mission accomplished!"

Ingham has been designing wedding dresses since he was a schoolboy. At 16, he went to fashion school to learn how to cut and make clothes. Ingham also designs long, classic evening dresses with modern colors and fabrics. For those who prefer traditional styles, he offers a classic summer navy-blue suit, a staple in English women's wardrobes throughout the 20th century, but with a fresh twist.

**Sally Quail: Jeweller**

Sally Quail, who once worked for an art dealer, has no formal training in jewelry. She started designing her own engagement ring when she couldn't find one she liked. This led her to become a designer in 1990. Her pieces are now popular with many celebrities. Her signature style features large semi-precious stones set in gold, inspired by 18th-century jewelry. Recently, she has started using diamonds. 'It must reflect my age,' says 36-year-old Quail. 'I reached that moment in every woman's life when she wants a diamond, and that's when I began working with them.'

**Lily Grimson: Handbag Designer**

Lily Grimson entered the competitive fashion industry four years ago with only a basic course in art and design. Two of her creations have already been chosen for a major design exhibition. Grimson's handbags, handmade in the UK, are always noticed. They are glamorous, whether made from fine calfskin or heavy silk. Her combination of style and craftsmanship makes a Grimson bag special.

**Peter Little: Hairdresser**

For over 20 years, Peter Little has styled the hair of some of the world's most famous people. 'Most women want hair that looks natural and is easy to manage at home,' he says. His approach ensures clients never look like they've just left a salon. However, this natural look is expensive, costing Â£250 for the first appointment, with a three-month waiting list. Peter has also launched his own line of hairdryers and styling tools, allowing people to create their own styles at home.

**Penny Pratt: Florist**

Penny Pratt runs a small shop and is a flower consultant for a large supermarket chain. She also provides floral ideas to top restaurants. Despite having no formal floristry qualifications, she left her teaching job 10 years ago to pursue something different. Her simple yet modern flower arrangements have won many design awards, helping her establish her own London Flower School. She has also given successful lectures in Japan and the USA. She says, 'Flower arrangements are simpler these days. Keep them simple but strong, and don't use too many leavesâ€”they are too large and architectural. For wedding bouquets, the golden rule is: the flowers must be of the same species.'"
FCE_19,"**Five-star luxury meets modern technology**

The five-star Merrion Hotel has just opened in Dublin. It took nearly two years to convert four large eighteenth-century houses into this luxury hotel. This transformation allowed the installation of the latest technology for both staff and guests. General Manager Peter MacCann expects his staff to know guests by name, but for specific preferences, he uses the hotel's computer system. This system, which cost Â£250,000, helps treat returning guests in a special way, as expected in a five-star hotel. For example, if a guest requests certain music CDs during their first stay, those CDs will be ready for them on their next visit. This is possible due to the guest-history feature that records preferences.

Room temperature is a common complaint among hotel guests worldwide. At the Merrion, a high-tech system allows guests to adjust the temperature within three degrees of the standard 18Â°C. Additionally, the front desk can adjust each room's temperature between 14Â°C and 25Â°C. Business travelers, who are expected to make up 65% of the hotel's clientele, will appreciate the technology in their rooms. Each room includes three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that also works as a photocopier and printer, and a video-conferencing facility. To keep up with rapid technological changes, extra cables have been installed for future upgrades. Televisions are rented, not bought, so they can be easily replaced with newer models. DVD recorders can also be upgraded when needed.

Despite all this advanced technology, the hotel aims to make guests feel comfortable and not overwhelmed. The 145 bedrooms are large, well-furnished, and welcoming. The hotel also features a swimming pool, gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a beautiful garden. As with all luxury hotels, excellent food is essential. Chef Patrick Guilbaud, whose Dublin restaurant already had two Michelin stars, moved his business to the Merrion. This move benefits both him and the hotel. He designed a new, modern kitchen and enjoys better parking facilities. The hotel gains a popular and successful restaurant without financial risks. With advanced technology and a skilled staff, the Merrion is set to succeed."
FCE_24,"Artist Susan Shepherd is famous for her flower paintings. Her large garden, full of her favorite flowers like tulips and poppies, provides many of her painting subjects. Some plants grow wildly, spreading seeds everywhere. The garden has a beautiful mix of colors and shapes, especially along the flower borders that line the path from east to west. This beauty is partly thanks to the previous owners, who were passionate gardeners and left plants that Susan liked. She also inherited their gardener, Danny. Susan says, 'It was really his garden.' They got along well, and he understood her vision when she explained she wanted to paint certain plants.

Susan prefers to paint detailed studies of individual plants rather than the whole garden. Sometimes she paints groups of plants where they are, but usually, she picks them and takes them to her studio. 'I don't set the whole thing up at once,' she explains. 'I paint one flower, which might take a few days, then add another one, building the painting over time. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish.' Her busiest time is spring and early summer when tulips and poppies bloom. 'They all come out together, and you're so busy,' she says. She is also fascinated by how flowers change as they decay. For example, tulips change shape and open up after being in water for a day. 'When you first put them in a vase, they seem boring, but they change all the time with twists and turns.'

Susan has always been interested in plants. 'I studied botany at school and collected wildflowers from the countryside,' she says. 'I wasn't interested in gardening then; I thought garden flowers looked like fake ones sold in shops. To me, only wildflowers were real. I was amazed by how they grew in difficult places, like cracks in rocks or on cliffs.' Now, her garden includes plants from far-off places, but they seem at home there. She has a relaxed attitude towards her garden, like an aunt who lets children play freely as long as they don't cause harm. With two upcoming exhibitions and plenty of subjects to paint, she finds it hard to work in the garden. She has hired an extra gardener, but she knows that to stay connected to her work, 'you have to get your hands dirty.'"
FCE_13,"Many trees in the Brackham area were knocked down during the terrible storms in March. The town lost two big lime trees from the old market square. The removal of these trees changed the look of the town center completely, which upset some of the more traditional residents. Normally, Chief Inspector Douglas Pelham, the head of the local police, would have been among those upset. However, during the storm, when the wind even knocked down the mature walnut tree in his garden, Pelham was too sick to notice. A usually healthy man, he was seriously ill for the first time with bronchitis. When he first felt a headache and tightness in his chest, his wife, Molly, tried to convince him to see a doctor. Believing the police force needed him, he ignored her and kept working. This only made his memory worse and his temper shorter. Finally, his colleague, Sergeant Lloyd, took him to the doctor. By then, he was too weak to argue. Soon, she took him to the pharmacy to get his antibiotics and then home to his wife, who sent him straight to bed. On Thursday morning, when Molly told him the walnut tree had fallen during the night, Pelham couldn't understand it. On Thursday evening, he weakly asked about damage to the house, was relieved to hear there was none, and went back to sleep. It wasn't until Saturday, when the antibiotics started working, his fever went down, and he got up, that he realized the loss of the walnut tree had changed the look of the living room. The Pelhams' large house was in a big garden. It was expensive, but Pelham didn't regret buying it. The leafy garden gave a sense of privacy. Now, the storm had changed his view. Before, the view from the living room included the beautiful walnut tree. It didn't make the room dark because there was another window on the opposite wall, but it created interesting light and shadow patterns that hid the worn furniture the family brought from their old house. With the tree gone, the room seemed too bright, showing the shabby furniture. The view from the window was also unpleasant. The tall house next door, once hidden by the tree, was now visible, with its unattractive purple bricks and outside pipes. It seemed to have many upstairs windows, all watching the Pelhams' every move. 'Doesn't it look terrible?' Pelham said weakly to his wife. But Molly, standing in the doorway, sounded more happy than upset. 'That's what I've been telling you since we moved here. We need to buy a new sofa, no matter the cost.'"
FCE_16,"**Living in the Valley**

We had been living in our valley for sixteen months when we first realized the dangers in the surrounding hills that could threaten our survival. It was the year when the storms came early, even before November ended. Until then, we felt safe in our valley, protected by the hills. Soon, snow began to fall, reaching about 15 centimeters deep in a day. It almost blocked our lane and made the path by the stream slippery and dangerous. On the nearby hills, the snow was much deeper and lasted longer. Up there, the wind blew fiercely. In our valley, we only felt sudden gusts of wind; trees swayed, but the branches held firm. Yet, we knew we had reason to worry. The snow and wind were inconvenient, but they did not trouble us much. It was the river, the Ryburn, which usually flowed gently, that threatened us most. It reminded us of what could have happened if the water from the hills had not been controlled by a series of dams many years ago.

Soon, the snow started to melt. Day after day, we watched dark clouds gather over the hills to the west. Grey clouds spread over the valleys, warning of what was to come. We had seen enough of the sky; now we began to watch the river, which was becoming fuller and wilder every day. The snow was gradually washed away as more rain fell from the clouds, but high up in the hills, the reservoir was filling and was fast approaching danger level. Then it happened - for the first time in years, the reservoir overflowed. Up in the heights, it was like Niagara Falls, as water surged over the dam and poured into the stream below. The river seemed wild as the waters rushed down to its lower stretches. Just a couple of meters from our cottage, the stream seemed wild beneath the bridge. It was deeper than we'd ever seen it so close to our home, fiercely hitting its banks. For three days, we hoped it would stay below its wall. Fortunately, our hopes were answered as the dam held and the waters began to subside.

In the past, before the dam was built, the river had flooded the nearby villages in such a rage. Now, the dam controls the river's flow, and usually, all is well; the large amount of water from the hills, from snow and heavy rain, stays behind its barrier with just the occasional overflow. We can now enjoy, rather than fear, the large clouds over the valley and be amazed by the river's tremendous power. Thanks to this protection, we feel our home in the valley is still secure and safe."
FCE_21,"Film Critic Mark Adams reflects on his past ten years working as a film critic for a newspaper called The Front Page. Writing about films for The Front Page was his first real job. Before that, he had done some reviewingâ€”novels for other newspapers, films for a magazine, and various tasks for the radio. This is how he met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page, who also wrote for radio and TV. Tom hired him, but Tom wasn't mainly a journalist, or he might have been more careful in choosing his staff. Initially, Tom's idea was to have a team of critics handle art forms that didn't need specialized knowledge: books, TV, theatre, film, and radio. They would have a weekly lunch to choose from the artistic material Tom decided they should cover, with guests to keep things sociable. It all felt like a dream then: a new newspaper, and Mark was part of the team. It seemed unlikely that a new paper could succeed in a crowded market. It felt just as likely that a millionaire wanted to help him personally and was pretending to employ him. Such was his lack of self-confidence. The first time he saw someone reading the newspaper on the London Underground and turning to a page with one of his reviews, he didn't know where to look. Tom's original plan for a team of critics never happened. It was a good idea, but they didn't meet as planned, so everything was done by phone. It turned out that the public preferred to link a reviewer with a single subject area, so Mark chose film. Without Tom's initial push, they wouldn't have the current setup, where Mark writes an extended weekly piece, usually on one film. This way of working suits him well. He wouldn't have been interested in the usual film critic's role, which involves reviewing every film that comes out. That routine would make him lose interest quickly. He would soon be sinking into his seat on a Monday morning with a sigh, 'What terrible rubbish must I sit through now?'â€”a type of sigh often heard in screening rooms worldwide. The space he is given allows him to expand his argumentâ€”or forces him, in a dull week, to create something out of nothing. But what is his role in the public arena? He assumes people choose films based on the stars, the publicity, or the director. There is also loyalty to a 'type' or its opposite. It rarely happens that someone who hates westerns buys a ticket for one after reading a review, or a love story fan avoids a romantic film because of what the papers say. So if a film review isn't really a consumer guide, what is it? He doesn't feel he has a responsibility to be 'right' about a movie. Nor does he think there should be a certain number of 'great' and 'bad' films each year. All he has to do is present an argument. He's not a judge, nor would he want to be."
FCE_46,"Text: Why would a schoolgirl want to swim 1500m, cycle 40km, and then run 10km? Because ""it's fun."" Teenager with a love for endurance sports WANTED: Sports-enthusiastic training partner for a triathlete, preferably female. Opportunity to train with a potential Olympic champion. Must be very interested in distance running (regular 15km sessions), distance swimming (enjoys winter training in cold rivers), and distance cycling (likes 100km rides). Ability to do all three without resting is essential. The triathlon is becoming one of the most popular Olympic sports. Recently, it has attracted large crowds who are fascinated (and shocked) by athletes swimming 1500m, cycling 40km, then running 10km without stopping. It's exciting for spectators, but what makes the triathletes want to push their bodies so hard? And why would a 17-year-old girl with excellent academic results give up everything for the challenging experiences it offers? Melanie Sears hasn't yet learned the usual phrases about personal satisfaction, mental challenge, and higher goals that most athletes use when asked similar questions. ""You swim for 1500m, then run out of the water and jump on your bike, still wet. Of course, then you freeze. When the 40km cycle ride is over, you have to run 10km, which is a long way when you're feeling exhausted. But it's great fun, and all worth it in the end,"" she says. Melanie entered her first triathlon at 14. ""I won the junior section - but then I was the only junior taking part. It seemed so easy that I was waving at my teammates as I went around."" Full of confidence, she entered the National Championships, and although she had the second fastest swim and the fastest run, she didn't place. ""I was following this man and suddenly we came to the sea. We realized then that we had gone wrong. I ended up cycling 20 kilometers too far. I cried all the way through the running."" But she did not give up and is determined that she never will. ""Sometimes I wish I could stop because then the pain would be over, but I am afraid that if I let myself stop just once, I would be tempted to do it again."" Such determination draws admiration from Steve Trew, the sport's director of coaching. ""I've just been testing her fitness,"" he says, ""and she worked so hard on the running machine that it finally threw her off and into a wall. She had given it everything, but whereas most people step off when they realize they can't go any further, she just kept on."" Melanie was the top junior in this year's European Triathlon Championships, finishing 13th. ""I was almost as good as the top three in swimming and running, but much slower at cycling. That's why I'm working very hard at it."" She is trying to convince her supportive parents, who will cover the Â£1,300 cost of her trip to New Zealand for this year's World Championships, to buy a Â£2,000 bike (""It's a special deal, with Â£1,000 off) so she can try national 25 km and 100 km races later this year. But there is another price to pay. Her intense training sessions have made her a bit of a recluse. ""I don't have a social life,"" she says. ""I'm not a party animal anyway. After two hours of hard swimming on Friday nights, I just want to go to sleep. But I phone and write to the other girls in the team."" What does she talk about? Boys? Clothes? ""No, what sort of times they are achieving."" Where will all this focus end? Melanie has tried other events. She has tried the triathlon ""sprint,"" for example, where you only have to swim 750m, cycle 20km, and run 5km. She wants to enter even tougher events than the triathlon. ""The big trouble is, I have no one of my age to train with,"" she says. Funny, that."
FCE_70,"**The Collectors**

Amanda Roy writes about her love for collecting and why many people share this hobby. Collecting is a popular activity, with one in three adults participating. It is a world full of passion and excitement. But remember, only collect things you truly love.

Since ancient times, people have collected items. Early humans collected pebbles for their beauty and wore them as necklaces. Today, children still collect stones and seashells for their shapes and colors.

I have been a collector all my life, gathering everything from tulips to pottery and paintings. My first collection was stones from my parents' garden. At six, I went to a school in a remote part of England. My parents took me to a local museum filled with fascinating objects from the past, sparking my interest in collecting.

Many people share this passion for collecting. Some find it gives them control over their lives. For me, it's simply enjoyable. Famous collectors include the Duc de Berry in France, who had a 'room of wonders' with items like coconut shell cups and Oriental china. Catherine the Great of Russia collected over 4,000 paintings. You don't need to be wealthy to collect; I've collected tulip bulbs and china cups with great determination.

I once convinced another tulip collector to give me a tulip I wanted. Sadly, it was later stolen by another collector. I also collected 350 American rag dolls, searching across the USA for different designs. Unfortunately, this collection was destroyed in a house fire, which was very upsetting.

The way collections change hands interests me. A silver spoon once owned by a king or poet gains value. As small items become popular, their prices rise. Toys from the 1950s are now valuable investments, especially if you kept the original boxes. (I, unfortunately, threw mine away.)"
FCE_3,"**My Line of Work: Four People Talk About Their Jobs**

**Lisa - Exhibition Programmes Organiser, Science Museum**

I organize temporary exhibitions. This means I plan and design the exhibition and promote it. I need to learn about the exhibition topic first and then talk to experts to decide the main themes and goals. I plan what objects and pictures to show. I ensure the public understands the exhibition by planning interactive displays, workshops, and theatre. I also hire engineers and electricians to make sure the exhibition is safe. Before it opens, I help design and write brochures and leaflets to inform people about it.

**Janet - Teacher of London Taxi Drivers**

I start my day at 7.30 a.m. by checking the accounts. Then, I see what new maps and documents are needed for learning the routes for the London taxi-driver test. By midday, about 50 students are here, figuring out the best routes using the correct streets and turns. I help when there's a disagreement, like if a right turn is possible at a junction. When they're close to the test, I give them a simple route and then tell them they must find another way because the road is closed. The next student must find a third route, and I give a reason why they can't use it. This is to make them think.

**Sarah - Marine Conservationist**

I live by the coast and work from home. My job includes answering phone enquiries, creating educational materials, and setting up training courses. Sometimes, I go to our main office, but mostly I am by the coast. I work with schools and study centers and run courses for coastal managers and decision-makers about the seas. I take them out to sea in a boat to help them understand marine life better. This often changes their views, as it is different from making decisions on a computer. I am lucky because conservation is my hobby, so I enjoy my job. The downside is that I work for a charity, so we always need more money. This means I am always looking for more resources and can't achieve everything I want.

**Chris - Map and Atlas Publisher**

My work is varied. I ensure our publishing program meets market needs and keep stocks of about 300 books we publish. We have high standards for information and content. We get many letters from readers about issues like international boundaries, which need careful replies. I discuss future projects and current sales with co-publishers. I work with an enthusiastic team, which makes the job enjoyable. The downside, like many jobs, is too much administration, leaving less time for interesting tasks like product development and design."
FCE_10,"Text: 'No Title We always went to Ireland in June. Since the four of us started going on holidays together, we spent the first two weeks of the month at Glencorn Lodge in County Antrim. It's a big house by the sea, near the village of Ardbeag. The English couple who bought the house, the Malseeds, have added to the building, but everything has been done very discreetly. It was Strafe who found Glencorn for us. He saw an advertisement when the Malseeds still needed to advertise. 'How about this?' he said one evening and read out the details. We had gone away together the summer before, to a hotel recommended by friends, but it wasn't a success because the food was terrible. The four of us have been playing cards together for a long time, Dekko, Strafe, Cynthia, and myself. They call me Milly, though my real name is Dorothy Milson. Dekko got his nickname at school, Dekko Deacon sounding quite good, I suppose. He and Strafe were at school together, which is why we call Strafe by his surname as the teachers used to. We're all about the same age and live close to the town where the Malseeds were before they moved from England to Ireland. Quite a coincidence, we always think. 'How very nice,' Mrs. Malseed said, smiling her welcome again this year. She seems to know when guests are about to arrive, as she's rarely not waiting in the large, low-ceilinged hall that always smells of flowers. 'Arthur, take the luggage up,' she told the old porter. 'Rose, Tulip, Lily, and Geranium.' She referred to the names of the rooms reserved for us. Mrs. Malseed painted flowers on the doors of the hotel instead of using numbers. In winter, when not many people come to Glencorn Lodge, she takes care of little details like that; her husband handles redecoration and repairs. 'Well, well, well,' Mr. Malseed said, entering the hall through the door that leads to the kitchen. 'A hundred thousand welcomes,' he greeted us in the Irish way. He was smiling broadly with his dark brown eyes twinkling, making us feel like more than just another group of hotel guests. Everyone smiled, and I could feel the others thinking that our holiday had truly begun. Nothing had changed at Glencorn, all was well. Kitty from the dining room came out to greet us. 'You look younger every year, all four of you,' she said, making everyone in the hall laugh again. Arthur led the way to the rooms, carrying as much of our luggage as he could and returning for the rest. After dinner, we played cards for a while but didn't play as long as usual because we were still tired from the journey. In the lounge, there was a man on his own and a French couple. There were other people at dinner, of course, because in June Glencorn Lodge is always full: from where we sat in the window, we could see some of them strolling on the lawns, others taking the cliff path down to the seashore. In the morning we'd do the same: we'd walk along the sands to Ardbeag and have coffee in the hotel there, back in time for lunch. In the afternoon we'd drive somewhere. I knew all that because over the years this kind of pattern had developed. Since we first came here, we'd all fallen in love with every variation of its remarkable landscape.'"
FCE_67,"Text: 'Keeping the holiday-makers happy A chalet girl's work is never done, Sarah Sutherland-Pilch tells Veronica Lee - in between making beds and delicious dinners. This is the second year as a chalet girl for Sarah Sutherland-Pilch, a 24-year-old from West Sussex. Known by her nickname, Pilch, Sarah works for a company in Val d'Isere, France, cooking and cleaning for visitors who come to ski and stay in the wooden houses, known as chalets, that are typical of the area. Sarah graduated in French and History of Art from Oxford Brookes University last summer. Being a chalet girl isn't a career, she says, but a fun way to spend a year or two before settling down. 'It's a good way to make contacts. I meet successful people every week.' Sarah does not live in the chalet. She gets up at 7 a.m. to walk about a mile to the chalet, which can host up to 18 guests each week. She has her own breakfast before preparing breakfast for the guests. 'They get everything - porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants.' When the last guest has finished breakfast, by about 9:30 a.m., Sarah cleans up and either makes the afternoon tea, which is left for the guests to help themselves, or cleans the rooms - 'the worst part of the job,' she says. By about 11 a.m. she is ready to go skiing herself. She skis as much as possible. 'On a good day we can be up there until 4:30 p.m.' Sarah returns to the chalet in time to prepare dinner and takes a shower before doing so, but does not sleep. 'It's fatal if you do,' she says. Dinner, a three-course meal, is served at 8 p.m. and coffee is usually on the table by 10 p.m. Sarah clears away the dinner things and fills the dishwasher. 'There's nothing worse than coming in to a messy kitchen the next morning.' Sometimes she will stay and chat with the guests, other times they are happy to be left alone. 'Good guests can make a week brilliant - breakfast this morning was great fun - but some weeks, for whatever reason, don't go quite so well.' Sarah meets her friends in the chalet where she lives - and they go out at about 11 p.m. 'We usually start off in Bananas, might go to G Jay's and perhaps Dick's T-Bar at the end of the evening,' she says. But Sarah never stays out too late on Saturday night as Sunday is her busiest time of the week. 'A frightful day,' she says, 'when you certainly don't want to be cooking breakfast with a terrible headache.' Work begins earlier than usual on Sunday, since breakfast for guests who are leaving has to be on the table by 7 a.m. As soon as the guests are gone, Sarah starts cleaning quickly. 'We just blitz the place - clear the breakfast, strip the beds, get everything ready.' If she hasn't already done the week's shopping on Saturday, Sarah does it now. At around 3 p.m., the cleaning work done, Sarah then prepares tea for the new guests. 'They get here at around 4:30 p.m.' Sometimes they are confused and full of questions. I'm sure it's the mountain air that does something to them.' Between tea and dinner, Sarah takes any guests needing boots or skis down to the ski shop and then gets a lift back to the chalet from one of the ski shop staff. It is soon time for dinner duty again and perhaps a drink later, but not always. 'Sometimes I'm so tired I just have an early night,' she says. '"
FCE_27,"Miss Rita Cohen, a very small, pale-skinned girl, visited Seymour's factory one day. She looked much younger than Seymour's daughter, Marie, but said she was six years older. Rita wore overalls and big, unattractive shoes, and her pretty face was surrounded by a bush of wiry hair. She was so small and young-looking that Seymour found it hard to believe she was studying at the University of Pennsylvania, researching the leather industry in New Jersey for her Master's degree. A few times a year, someone would contact Seymour to ask if they could see his factory. Sometimes, he would help a student by answering questions over the phone or, if they seemed very serious, by giving them a short tour. Rita Cohen seemed almost as small as the children from Marie's third-year class, who had visited the factory years ago. Marie's father had shown them how he made gloves, especially Marie's favorite part, the laying-off table. At this table, the men shaped and pressed each glove by pulling it over steam-heated brass hands. These hands were very hot, shiny, and stood straight up from the table, looking thin and flat. As a child, Marie was fascinated by them and called them the 'pancake hands'. Rita asked, 'How many pieces come in a shipment?' Seymour replied, 'Between twenty and twenty-five thousand.' She took notes and asked, 'Do they come directly to your shipping department?' Seymour liked that she was interested in every detail. 'They come to the tannery. The tannery is a contractor. We buy the material, and they make it into the right kind of leather for us to work with. My grandfather and father worked in the tannery here in town. So did I, for six months, when I started in the business. Have you ever been inside a tannery?' 'Not yet.' 'Well, you need to visit a tannery if you're going to write about leather. I can arrange that for you if you'd like. They're primitive places. Technology has improved things, but what you'll see isn't much different from hundreds of years ago. It's tough work. It's said to be the oldest industry with remains found anywhere. Six-thousand-year-old tanning relics were found in Turkey, I believe. The first clothing was just skins tanned by smoking them. I told you it was an interesting subject once you get into it. My father is the leather expert; he's the one you should talk to. Start my father talking about gloves, and he'll go on for two days. That's typical: glove makers love the trade and everything about it. Have you ever seen anything being made, Miss Cohen?' 'I can't say I have.' 'Never seen anything made?' 'I saw my mother make a cake when I was a child.' He laughed. She made him laugh. An innocent with spirit, eager to learn. His daughter was at least 30 cm taller than Rita Cohen, fair where Rita was dark, but otherwise, Rita reminded him of Marie. The good-natured intelligence that filled the house when Marie came home from school, full of what she'd learned. How she remembered everything, neatly written in her notebook and memorized overnight. 'I'll tell you what we're going to do. We're going to take you through the whole process. Come on. We're going to make you a pair of gloves, and you're going to watch them being made from start to finish. What size do you wear?'"

Overall, he preferred being a caddy. Well, who wouldn't if golf was their passion? There were some downsides, though. A small flat fee is offered, plus a percentage of the winnings. The average earnings are between Â£25,000 and Â£35,000, and much of that goes on travel and hotels. He was 31 when he first caddied for the golfer Greg Norman. 'You're not just carrying bags. You're giving advice, using your knowledge against the weather, and trying to understand the course.' His accountancy skills were recently recognized by European Tour Productions when they made him a statistical data administrator. From cards brought in by the caddies, he compiles and analyzes the statistics of each day's play. The results are wanted by TV commentators, golfing magazines, and the golfers themselves. C. Martin Fern Martin Fern is the editor of the 'Food and Drink' pages of a daily newspaper, and one of his easier tasks is to try out what's available in the best restaurants. What does he think about restaurants that charge very high prices? 'For those who can afford it, it's their choice,' he says. 'I'd rather spend Â£120 on a meal I'll remember for the rest of my life than buy a microwave.' His talent as a cook led to the offer of a food column from a friend who edited a Saturday Review. For Martin, who was then a creative director at an advertising agency, it was a useful extra income. He was 42 when another newspaper called to offer him a full-time job. 'It meant a 50% cut in guaranteed income,' he says. 'But it was a chance to turn my passion into a profession.' He still does all the cooking at home and tries to keep his waistline under control by cycling a couple of miles to the nearest tube station. D. Dick Prince 'I started writing children's stories about 20 years ago,' says Dick Prince, one of Britain's most popular children's writers. 'Before that, I always loved words and enjoyed using them, but my writing was mainly poetry. Then I had this idea for a story. I had been a farmer and knew the problem of chickens being killed by a fox. So I wrote a kind of role reversal story called The Fox Busters, which became my first published children's story.' Where do his ideas come from? 'Well, it's not easy, I have to work at them,' he says. 'That's what I usually do in the mornings. I'm not up with the dawn, I'm afraid. After lunch, I spend another couple of hours typing out the morning's scribbles - all of which I do with one finger on an old portable typewriter rather than on one of those awful laptops. I get between 50 and 100 letters a week, and that is the part about being a writer that I enjoy the most. I do try to answer them all, but nowadays I have some secretarial help.'"
FCE_66,"In the lumberyard by the lake, where trees were turned into boards for building, there was an old two-story brick building. Around it were big piles of soft sawdust. These golden piles covered the yard all the way to the blue lake. That afternoon, with nothing else to do, all the boys followed Michael up a ladder to the roof of the old building. They sat with their legs hanging over the edge, looking at the lake. Suddenly, Michael said, ""I dare you to jump down,"" and without thinking, he jumped off the roof and landed on the sawdust, laughing. ""I dare you all!"" he shouted. ""You're all cowards,"" he said, trying to get them to follow him. Laughing, he watched them from the roof, looking scared, but one by one they jumped and got up smiling with relief. In the hot afternoon sun, they lay on the sawdust pile telling jokes until one of them said, ""Let's go up on the roof again and jump down."" They weren't very excited, but they all went up and started jumping off again until only Michael was left. The others were below, calling, ""Come on, Mike. What's wrong with you?"" Michael wanted to join them, but he stayed on the edge of the roof, licking his lips, with a nervous smile, wondering why it seemed like a longer drop this time. At first, they thought he was joking, but then they saw him clenching his fists. He tried counting to ten and jumping, but it didn't work. He tried taking a deep breath and closing his eyes. After a while, the boys started laughing at him; they were tired of waiting, and it was almost dinnertime. ""Come on, you're a coward. Do you think we're going to stay here all night?"" they shouted, and when he didn't move, they started to leave, still shouting. ""Who started this? What's wrong with you all?"" he called. But he stayed on the roof, looking sadly at the ground. He was alone for nearly an hour while the sun, like a big orange ball, slowly set beyond the lake. His clothes were wet from nervous sweating. Finally, he closed his eyes, slipped off the roof, fell heavily on the sawdust, and lay there for a long time. There were no sounds in the yard; the workers had gone home. As he lay there, he wondered why he couldn't jump, then he got up slowly and walked home, feeling very ashamed and wanting to avoid everyone. He was so late for dinner that his stepmother said coldly, ""You're old enough to get home in time for dinner. If you won't come home, you should stay in tonight."" She was a strong woman with fair skin, a little grey in her hair, and a patient smile. She spoke with controlled severity, but Michael, with his dark, gloomy face, hardly heard her; he was still thinking about the boys' grinning faces and their laughter."
FCE_44,"**Careers Advice**

Are you unhappy in your job but unsure how to change? Kitty Doherty offers some helpful advice. Many people looking to change careers are turning to careers advisers. You will need to write a brief history of yourself and take several tests called 'psychometrics'. These tests help create a summary of your skills and suggest possible careers and any retraining needed.

I decided to try Career Analysts, a large career advice organization. Taking the careers test felt like being back in my science exams. I was in a group of about ten people, answering questions quickly. I had to remember it wasn't about passing or failing. The psychometrics involved tasks like finding mistakes in lists of names and numbers and matching similar shapes. Afterward, I had a long chat with an adviser who used the test results to create a report with observations and recommendations. I agreed with most of the conclusions, though I was a bit disappointed with my performance in the scientific, technical, and practical tests. However, it was reassuring to hear that I had made the right choice in journalism.

Rethinking your career doesn't always mean a big change. Last March, after working as a marketing manager for a large insurance company for five years, 25-year-old Donna Laney lost her job. Her friends suggested she visit Career Analysts. 'Losing my job was a chance to step back and review my career,' says Donna. Some results were surprising. 'I didn't realize I had a talent for design. But I had to consider the cost of retraining against my financial commitments,' she says. Other suggestions included taking a year off to work in the Far East. 'I decided to use my existing skills and move into something more suitable than insurance. I'm now a Public Relations officer. I might have reached this point without Career Analysts, but they helped me see clearly what I wanted to do. I've recommended them to several friends who are all happy with the service.'

Some people feel they wouldn't have reached their goals without help. A visit to Career Counselling Services led 26-year-old Juliet Greene to make life-changing decisions. 'After working for a major bank for six years, I found my job dull and needed a new challenge. I had no idea what I wanted, so I went to Career Counselling Services with an open mind. The tests showed I was interested in sciences,' she says. 'I had four sessions with an adviser. The third session was recorded, which was helpful because you forget many things you say. After the fourth meeting, I decided to study geology and plan to start a degree course later this year. The advice from Career Counselling Services was worth the fee. I'm much happier and more positive now.'

However, careers advice doesn't work for everyone. Amanda Margetts, a 24-year-old sales representative, says: 'I reached a point in my career where I didn't know what to do next. I thought a careers adviser might suggest something new. Although I got many new ideas, I rejected them because they required a big salary drop or a lot of retraining. I wasn't told anything about myself that I didn't already know,' she says. 'You have to give the adviser a lot of personal information, and I felt that if I had told a friend the same things, they would have given similar advice.'"
FCE_22,"**Fun at the Dentist's?**

If you visit W. Lloyd Jerome's dental office in the center of Glasgow, you'll notice bright modern paintings on the walls and a stylish blue couch where patients sit during their check-ups. Jerome explains, ""Half of the people only go to the dentist when they're in pain instead of going for regular check-ups. That's because they're scared."" To change this, he has created a place where people feel comfortable. That's why he decided not to wear a white coat, as it often makes people think of pain. Jerome believes dental treatment should happen in a relaxed, interesting, and even enjoyable atmosphere.

This idea is surprising for many of us who usually think of dental visits as painful or at least very formal. Jerome says, ""If people are relaxed, entertained, and treated well, they will forget their past negative experiences."" One of his new relaxation methods is using virtual-reality headsets. ""We were the first practice in Britain to use them, and they're very popular. The headsets are used during the first check-up, where the patient sits comfortably on the blue couch and watches a film about underwater wildlife while I examine their teeth. Then the headset switches to a special camera, giving the patient a visual tour of their mouth."" Surprisingly, most patients enjoy this part of their dental visit.

Another important aspect is that the office smells more like a perfume shop than a dentist's. Today, it smells like orange. Jerome says, ""When people walk in, I want them to realize with all their senses that it's not like going to the dentist's. Smell is very important. The typical dental smell can make your heart race if you're scared of dentists."" I found the gentle smell in the office very pleasant.

Although he is known as Glasgow's most fashionable dentist, Jerome emphasizes that he takes his work very seriously. The relaxation techniques are important, but the quality of the treatment is the most crucial thing. For example, Jerome uses a special tool that sprays warm water on the teeth to clean them, instead of scraping. It feels a bit strange at first, but as long as people are relaxed, it's not painful at all.

Five years ago, Jerome went to the United States to research dental techniques. ""One thing I learned there was that when you make it easier for the patient, you make it easier for yourself,"" he explains. He sees his patient-focused approach as the beginning of a gradual shift towards less formality in the traditional British dentistry profession.

At that moment, a patient arrives. Jerome quickly goes over, offers him a cup of tea (herbal or regular), asks him what video he'd like to watch, and gently leads him to the chair. The patient seems to enjoy this five-star treatment, and it's no surprise. The office feels more like an elegant beauty salon than a typical dental practice."
FCE_39,"**Bitter Water Hits the Big Time**

Chocolate, which started in South America, is now a huge global business. At Easter, people in the UK spend over Â£230 million on chocolate. Eight percent of all chocolate is bought during this time. Only at Christmas do people consume more chocolate. Although large-scale chocolate production began in the 19th century, the cacao plant was first grown by the Aztec, Toltec, and Mayan civilizations in Central America over 3,000 years ago. The cacao tree is an evergreen, tropical plant found in Africa, South and Central America, the West Indies, and Southeast Asia. The fruit of this tree is the size of a melon and contains 20-40 seeds. When dried, these seeds become cacao beans, which are used to make chocolate. In English-speaking countries, they are often called cocoa beans, a misspelling from the 17th century when they were also called cacoa and cocao beans.

The Aztecs used cocoa beans as money and to make a drink called xocoatl, meaning 'bitter water' in their language, Nahuatl. In Aztec times, this chocolate drink was flavored with spices and used for ceremonies and welcoming guests. The Spanish found the drink tastier with cinnamon and sugar, but the recipe didn't spread to the rest of Europe for another century. In the late 17th century, chocolate houses were established in Europe's capital cities, where people gathered to drink chocolate. Until the 19th century, the chocolate drink was made from solid blocks of chocolate that had to be melted in hot water. But in 1826, CJ van Houten from the Netherlands invented chocolate powder by removing most of the cocoa butter from the crushed beans.

The age of the chocolate bar began in 1847 when a Bristol company, Fry and Sons, combined cocoa butter with pure chocolate liquor and sugar to make a solid block you could eat. A Swiss company then added milk solids, creating milk chocolate. At the start of the 20th century, the British chocolate market was led by French companies. In 1879, the English company Cadbury named their Birmingham factory Bournville (ville is French for town) to add a touch of French elegance. But then came Cadbury's famous Dairy Milk bar, which started as Dairymaid in 1905. Smart advertising linked it to the healthy qualities of milk from the English countryside, making it a strong competitor to the more luxurious French brands.

Currently, chocolate consumption in Britain has stabilized at about four bars each week. This has pushed manufacturers to find new ways to attract customers. The latest marketing strategy is the 'extended line,' where a simple chocolate bar becomes an ice cream, a soft drink, or a dessert to appeal to chocoholics tired of regular snacks. Meanwhile, cacao farmers are still affected by a drop in cocoa bean prices at the end of the 1980s. Since most cacao farmers work on a very small scale, many had to close their businesses. Perhaps you could think of them as you enjoy your next chocolate bar."
FCE_18,"**THE SHELL ARTIST**

At 83, Peter Cooke has mastered his art. He still wants to try new things like paper-making and feather-work, but for now, he focuses on creating delicate and unique objects from shells, a skill he has perfected over the past ten years. ""Tell me if I am boring you,"" he says as he shows me around his apartment filled with his work. There's a fine line between being a bore and an enthusiast, but Cooke is definitely the latter, thanks to his charm and the beauty of his creations.

He points to a pair of shell-covered ornaments above a fireplace. ""I won't mind if people don't buy them because I've grown fond of them, and to me, they're adorable. I never intended to sell my work commercially. Some friends visited me about five years ago and said, 'You must have an exhibition - people should see these. We'll talk to a man who owns an art gallery.'""

This led to an exhibition in London, where 70% of the objects were sold. His second exhibition opened at the gallery yesterday. Considering the high prices his pieces fetchâ€”around Â£2,000 for the ornamentsâ€”an empty space above the fireplace seems a small sacrifice for Cooke. There are 86 pieces in the exhibition, with prices starting at Â£225 for a shell-flower in a crystal vase. Cooke insists he has nothing to do with the pricing and is open about it: he claims no one else in the world makes work like his, and as the gallery owner told him, ""Well, you're going to stop one day, and everyone will want your pieces because there won't be any more.""

""I do wish, though,"" says Cooke, ""that I'd started this much earlier, because then I could have created really wonderful thingsâ€”the potential would have been there. Although the ideas are still there and I'm doing my best now, I'm more limited physically than when I started."" Still, his work is far from the common shell constructions found in seaside shops. ""I have a miniature mind,"" he says, resulting in boxes covered in thousands of tiny shells, little shaded pictures made from shells, and baskets of astonishingly realistic flowers.

Cooke has developed his own method and uses materials as he finds them. He uses the cardboard from laundered shirts for his flower bases, a nameless glue bought in bulk from a sail-maker (""If it runs out, I don't know what I will do!""), and washing-up liquid to clean the shells. ""I have an idea of what I want to do, and it just does itself,"" he says of his working method, yet the attention to detail, color gradations, and symmetry he achieves look far from accidental.

Cooke's search for beautiful, especially tiny, shells has taken him beyond his Norfolk shore: to France, Thailand, Mexico, South Africa, and the Philippines, among other places where he has searched for treasures to bring home. He insists he only collects dead shells and defends himself against those who accuse him of stripping the world's beaches. ""When I am collecting shells, I hear people's great fat feet crunching them up far faster than I can collect them; and the ones that are left, the sea breaks up. I would not dream of collecting shells with living creatures in them or diving for them, but once their occupants have left, why should I not collect them?"" If one considers the amount of luggage one man can carry home, the beauty of his work often surpasses the natural parts, making his argument quite convincing."
FCE_62,"**The Schoolgirl Model**

When 15-year-old Kira Langer is not traveling to amazing places and appearing on magazine covers, you will probably find her studying for her school exams. Jane Laidlaw learns more about her.

""I'm afraid Kira will be a little late,"" the receptionist at the agency told me. ""Oh, fine,"" I said, ""no problem."" I had been trying to convince myself that all the negative things I had read about models were not true, but words like difficult, vain, and unintelligent kept coming to mind. And now she was going to be late. How late? An hour? Three hours? Maybe she wouldn't come at all. What if she decided a visit to the hairdresser's would be more fun than talking to me? If she was late, she would be rushing. She could be in a bad mood and refuse to answer my questions.

But when the winner of the Looks magazine supermodel competition walked in, she was smiling, relaxed, and apologetic, and she was with her mother. Kira was not dressed in expensive designer clothes but in a simple black dress and trainers. There was no sign of a selfish attitude; she was just a very friendly, very tall, very pretty girl. All models under the age of 16 must take an adult with them whenever they work, she explained, and apart from looking incredibly young, her mother was a normal mum - visibly proud of her successful daughter.

Kira seems slightly puzzled by her new fame, which is understandable since it was completely unplanned. It was her older sister who decided that she should enter the model competition. ""She saw the competition and said I should go in for it,"" Kira remembers. ""I said no, but she sent some photos in anyway."" When the call came to tell her that she was a finalist, she was at school. Being selected for the final gave Kira the confidence to go through with it, and she performed perfectly. She won easily, and the Select model agency in London immediately offered her work.

Kira now finds that one of the hardest things she has to do is manage her two separate lives. But her friends and teachers have become used to having a star among them. ""They're really proud of me,"" she says. However, a few unkind people at her school are rude about her success. ""They say I have too high an opinion of myself."" This kind of remark must be hard for Kira to deal with, since there can't be many people as successful as her who are less self-important. But she says, ""They assume that because I've suddenly become a model, I can't stay the same. But the only thing that's changed is I've become more confident - not in a horrible way, but I'm able to stand up for myself more.""

As a busy model, though, her social life is obviously affected. The Select agency can call at any time and tell her that she is wanted for a job the next day. ""If my friends are going out together, I can't say I'll come, because I don't know what I'm doing the next day. I can't really make plans, and if I do, they sometimes get broken, but my friends are good about it. They don't say, 'Oh, you're always going off modeling now, you never have time for us.'""

Kira has the looks, ability, and support to have a fabulous career ahead of her. And not many people can say that before they even sit their school-leaving exams. I am about to finish the interview with the girl who has it all, and I ask what she would like to do as a career if she didn't have the outstanding beauty that seems certain to take her to the top of the profession. She pauses and replies, ""I'd like to do what you're doing."""
FCE_49,"**Father and Son Search for Gold**

Terence and Chris Madden, a father and son team, have traveled from Canada's cold north to Africa's heat in search of valuable metals. Terence, an explorer, and Chris, a mineral expert, believe their mine on a Welsh mountain might have up to 10,000 ounces of gold. After ten years of digging in the Welsh hills, they think they are very close to finding a gold vein worth five million dollars. Terence, 68, from Liverpool, said, ""As we dig, we are finding high levels of gold; now we just need to dig a few more meters to where it is concentrated.""

Their journey began when Terence read about gold worth millions in the ""Dolgellau gold belt,"" near the Welsh town of Dolgellau. They studied 19th-century mining journals and newspapers at the Welsh National Library in Aberystwyth to choose the best area to explore. After clearing the land and finding small pieces of gold in the rocks, they spent ten years getting permission from landowners, taking earth samples, and removing old cars and rubbish. They dug out 150 tonnes of greenstone rock to make a tunnel and a 10-meter shaft.

Now, they are running out of money. They need to find someone to invest Â£50,000 to dig a few more meters to reach the gold. Chris Madden says, ""At the moment, this looks doubtful, although we've got quite a few people we can contact.""

As news of their dig spread, the idea of finding gold excited both locals and gold diggers. Dolgellau depends on tourists, and residents are hopeful. Peter Woolven, manager of the Royal Ship Hotel, said, ""It would bring more people here if they are right, but if they find gold, I hope millions don't come and damage the hillside.""

The Welsh gold industry has declined since the late 1880s when many people worked in numerous mines. One of the last mines, Clogau-St David's, which made wedding rings for the Queen and the Princess of Wales, closed recently. However, individual gold diggers are returning. George Hall, another prospector, plans to dig a tunnel on the other side of the ridge from the Maddens. Hall, 70, said, ""Searching for gold is very emotional. It's adventurous and exciting, the wonder of uncovering hidden treasure. Maybe I'll be lucky this time."""
FCE_31,"**IN HOT WATER**

Rachel Mills is a scientist who loves exploring the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She is a lecturer at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University, where she teaches and researches marine geochemistry. This means she studies the chemical processes in the sea. When she isn't teaching, she goes on dives to study underwater volcanoes. She uses a small steel vehicle, about the size of a car, to dive three kilometers down into the ocean. Inside the vehicle, space is very tight, and she can easily touch the two pilots. They are used to these cramped conditions, where they can't stand or move much, and they must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can last 16 hours: three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours collecting rock and water samples, and three hours to return to the surface. If there is an emergency, they can press a panic button. This releases a small escape vessel that quickly rises to the surface, like a ping-pong ball in water. However, no one has tested it yet, and Rachel thinks it might not be a pleasant experience.

Rachel remembers her first time in the vehicle. It was on a ship's deck, and she got in with an instructor who explained the emergency procedures, including what to do if the pilot had a heart attack. They wanted to see how she would handle being in such a small space. Now, Rachel has completed six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian crew. They went to a site five days' sail west of the Canary Islands in the Atlantic. There, on the ocean floor, is a large area of underwater volcanoes with chimneys blowing out black smoke. The Russian team was placing scientific equipment to study the effects of a project that would drill a 150-meter hole through a volcano.

When not at sea, Rachel works in her office at the Oceanography Centre in Southampton. She says two-thirds of her salary comes from teaching, which she enjoys, but she does it to support her research on ""black smokers."" This is another name for underwater volcanoes, where water comes out of the rock and looks like black smoke. It flows out at one meter per second and at a temperature of 350 degrees Celsius.

Rachel recalls being scared only once, during a dive with an American team. They were towing equipment on a 50-meter rope when there was a sudden explosion. The shock waves hit their vehicle, and she thought she was going to die. They waited in silence, and when nothing happened, they were incredibly relieved to be alive.

Diving to the deepest parts of the ocean is an adventure for Rachel. Every time she looks out of the porthole and sees the chimneys, she feels a sense of wonder. She is at the bottom of the sea, seeing something no one else has seen before. After studying the black smokers for three years for her PhD, seeing them in person was an amazing experience."
FCE_58,"I was dirty, smelly, hungry, and somewhere beneath all that, suntanned. It was the end of my Inter-Rail holiday. My body couldn't take any more stress. My mind couldn't handle any more foreign timetables, currencies, or languages. ""Never again,"" I said, as I stepped onto home ground. I said exactly the same thing the following year. And the next. All I had to do was buy one train ticket, and because I was under twenty-five years old, I could spend a whole month traveling anywhere I wanted in Europe. Ordinary beds are never the same once you've learned to sleep in the corridor of a train, the rhythm rocking you into a deep sleep. Carrying all your belongings on your back in a rucksack makes you have a very basic approach to travel and encourages incredible wastefulness that can lead to burning socks that have become too unpleasant, and getting rid of books when finished. On the other hand, this way of looking at life is entirely in the spirit of Inter-Rail, for common sense and reasoning can be thrown out of the window along with the paperback book and the socks. All it takes to achieve this carefree attitude is one of those tickets in your hand. Any system that enables young people to travel through countries at a rate of more than one a day must be pretty special. On that first trip, my friends and I were at first unaware of the possibilities of this type of train ticket, thinking it was just an inexpensive way of getting to and from our chosen campsite in southern France. But the idea of non-stop travel proved too tempting, for there was always just one more country over the border, always that little bit further to go. And what did the extra miles cost us? Nothing. We were not completely uninterested in culture. But this was a first holiday without parents, as it was for most other Inter-Railers, and in organizing our own timetable we left out everything except the most immediately available sights. This was the chance to escape the guided tour, an opportunity to do something different. I took great pride in the fact that, in many places, all I could be bothered to see was the view from the station. We were just there to get by, and to have a good time doing so. In this, we were no different from most of the other Inter-Railers with whom we shared corridor floors, food and water, money, and music. The excitement of travel comes from the sudden reality of somewhere that was previously just a name. It is as if the city in which you arrive never actually existed until the train pulls in at the station and you are able to see it with your own tired eyes for the first time. Only by actually seeing Europe, by watching the changing landscapes and seeing the differences in attitudes and lifestyles, can you really have an accurate picture of the continent in your mind. Everybody knows what is there, but it is meaningless until you view it yourself. This is what makes other people's holiday photos so boring. While the train trip won't allow you to discover anything new in the world sense, it is a valuable personal experience. Europe is a big place, and Inter-Rail gives people the best opportunity to recognize this ... though in our case it didn't happen immediately."
FCE_37,"Arriving at an airport in another country and finding out your baggage is missing is very disappointing. At best, you might have to wear the same clothes for hours or days until the airline returns your luggage. At worst, you could be in a different climate, far from home, with unsuitable clothes. Airlines don't often say how many bags they lose, but regular travelers will eventually face this issue. Even the best airlines make mistakes, and no airline can guarantee your checked luggage will be on the same flight, especially if you have to change planes.

Here's how the system works: Airlines require you to check in early to give enough time for your baggage to be processed and loaded onto the plane. Minimum connecting times (MCTs) are set to ensure there is enough time to transfer baggage between flights. Usually, this system works well. However, extra security checks and air traffic problems can delay flights, causing the baggage system to fail. Human error or accidents, like a torn-off destination label, can also cause issues. These problems are more common at large transfer airports, called 'hubs', because they handle many bags. For example, last year, London's Heathrow airport managed over 41 million passengers, with nine million changing planes. British Airways alone had two million transfer passengers at Heathrow, mostly moving between Terminal 1 and Terminal 4. Even efficient airports like Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Singapore, and Zurich have bad days. The risk of losing baggage is higher at certain airports. In the United States, Miami airport is known for losing luggage when passengers connect to Latin America.

To avoid losing your baggage, choose direct flights when possible and check in early. If you must change planes or want a cheaper flight, try to fly with the same airline. Allow more time for connections by taking an earlier flight to the transfer airport, and label your luggage inside and out with your home and holiday addresses. Include your flight numbers. If your luggage still goes missing, contact the airline official in the baggage hall and fill out a property irregularity report (PIR) before leaving the airport."
FCE_2,"Text: 'The Kingfisher Wildlife photographer Charlie James is an expert on the kingfisher, a beautiful blue-green bird that lives near streams and rivers and feeds on fish. Old trees hang over the stream, partly shading the shallow water. Soft greens, mud browns, and the many shades of yellow sunlight are the main colors, as gentle as the sounds of water in the breeze. The bird moves quickly through the scene, like a flash of light and motion so striking you almost feel it. It disappears in a split second, but the image stays in your mind, its impact much larger than its size. Charlie James fell in love with kingfishers when he was young. He cannot explain exactly what attracts him to this little bird, which shows how much he cares for it. The kingfisher is part of legends. In Greek myth, it is a moon goddess who turned into a bird. Another story says the kingfisher flew so high that its top became the blue of the sky, while its underside was burned by the sun. There is some scientific truth in this. Despite the many blues in their feathers, kingfishers have no blue pigment. Instead, the structure of their feathers scatters light and reflects blue strongly. This is why a kingfisher can look bright blue or rich emerald green with a slight change in light angle. It's no surprise that some wildlife photographers are so enthusiastic about them. The colors, combined with the fact that kingfishers, though shy of direct human contact, can be watched easily from a hideout, create a lifelong passion. Charlie James's first hideout was an old blanket he put over his head while waiting near a kingfisher's favorite spot. The bird returned within minutes and sat only a meter away. But it took him another four years to get his first good picture. Meanwhile, the European kingfisher began to dominate his life. He spent as much time as he could by a stream rich with kingfishers. The problem was, school limited his time with the birds. So he skipped classes, becoming what he calls an 'academic failure'. But his interest in the world's most widespread kingfisher, the only one to breed in Europe, was noticed. At 16, he was hired as an advisor for a nature magazine. He then worked as an assistant to the editor and gradually became a freelance wildlife film cameraman. Now, he wants to make the ultimate kingfisher film. 'No speech, just beautiful images that say it all,' he says. 'I'm drawn to the simple approach. I like to photograph parts of kingfisher wings ...' His sentence trails off. He's thinking of the bird's colors, which still excite him after so many years. His photographs communicate some of his feelings, but as Charlie knows, there's much more to his relationship with the kingfisher than his work can show.'"
FCE_68,"**Conducting an Orchestra: Insights from Five New Conductors**

**A. ANNE MANSON**

Anne Manson, 30, had an unexpected start in conducting when she asked to watch Claudio Abbado's rehearsals in Vienna and ended up replacing an absent assistant. She later helped with another opera the next season. ""I had to lead the first rehearsal for Abbado. No, I wasn't nervous. I've always been comfortable in front of an orchestra,"" she says. Manson, originally from the US, works with a London opera company focused on modern music. She is also gaining recognition in Europe, supported by the British Arts Council, and has assisted Abbado on several projects since then.

**B. ANDREW CONSTANTINE**

Andrew Constantine, 31, believes the hardest part of conducting is convincing people to give you opportunities. He won a major competition in 1991 after failing in two others. Reflecting on this, he feels the timing was right: ""If it had happened earlier, I might have disappeared."" The competition opened doors for performances and a role as an assistant to a famous conductor. However, Constantine worries about being labeled as a ""competition"" conductor: ""If in three years my name is still linked to the competition, I'll be concerned,"" he says. ""But orchestras like the English Chamber Orchestra, who hired me after the competition, are inviting me back. If they don't, your career can fall apart.""

**C. WASFI KANI**

Wasfi Kani, founder of Pimlico Opera, enjoys the long rehearsal periods in opera. ""The music deserves four weeks of focus,"" says Kani, who began conducting seriously in her late twenties. After university, she worked in London's business district until Pimlico Opera became fully professional two years ago. Starting lessons with Sian Edwards was crucial for her. ""I saw her conduct and realized she was my sizeâ€”I had always been taught by much bigger people, which makes a big difference."" She appreciates the complexity of opera: ""There are many arguments, and you have to consider the singers' personalities.""

**D. ROGER VIGNOLES**

""Conducting came as a surprise, but it's fascinating,"" says Roger Vignoles, 48. It's not a strange move for him, as he started as a resident musician at an opera house and worked with good conductors. Last year, he was asked to direct Handel's Agrippina from the piano at a festival, something new for him. ""It was easier than I thought. I knew the music well and what I wanted it to sound like. I tried my best to achieve that. People respect my musical ability. I'm benefiting from all my experiences, both in musical style and performing. Now, I'll do whatever people ask to find out what I enjoy.""

**E. WAYNE MARSHALL**

In 1986, conductor Simon Rattle noticed Wayne Marshall, then a young assistant, and mentioned him to his agent. Marshall, now 32, soon found himself conducting a musical in London on short notice, a challenging start. He even dealt with musicians reading newspapers during the show: ""I was firm with them. I always gave a clear beat and got the best result I could. Many musicians don't seem to need much guidance from a conductor. But I'm not afraid to say what I want. If you show worry, it gets worse. I've never formally studied conducting, and no book teaches you how, but people have been kind to me. I'm determined and know what I like."""
FCE_23,"**Variations on a Theme**

If you want to take children to a theme park in Britain, there are many options. We asked five families to try out some of the best parks.

**Fun Island - The Burns Family**

Last year, we visited a large theme park in the US, so we thought Fun Island might not be as exciting. However, we were pleasantly surprised. The park is great for younger children, so our three-year-old felt included. The kids loved the Crocodile Ride and the Giant Wheel. There is a special dodgems ride for very young kids, which was a big hit. For older children, there are more thrilling rides like Splash Out, where you end up in a pool! After five hours, Steve and I were ready to leave, but the children wanted to stay because they were having so much fun. Our only complaint is that the park lacks atmosphere, and the scenery could be better. But the staff are very helpful, and the park is clean, well-organized, and safe.

**Wonderland - The McMillan Family**

None of us had been to a theme park before, so we didn't know what to expect. We thought Oscar might be too young, but he loved it. He was thrilled with the Mountain Train and especially liked Little Land, which has small models of famous buildings at his height! The older children enjoyed the ferris wheel and driving toy cars on a real road layout. We spent six hours there and appreciated the places to rest. The landscaping is perfect, and the staff are friendly and helpful. There is something for everyone, including adults.

**Adventure World - The Jeffree Family**

After seven hours, we still had more to see. The children loved the Big Top Circus, which had an amazing trapeze act that kept us excited. We went on the Terror Line, and although the girls were scared and kept their eyes shut, they said they enjoyed it. Their favorite ride was Running River, where you think you'll get wet, but you don't. For younger children, Toy Land is great fun. The children looked at the new ride, Fear Factor, but we were relieved they were too small to go on it! The park is well designed, so even waiting in line isn't too boring. It's very clean, and the staff are great. On one ride, I couldn't sit with both girls, so a staff member offered to go with one of them.

**The Great Park - The Langridge Family**

We arrived at one o'clock and were disappointed that the park was only open until 5 p.m. This is a great theme park for younger children because the rides aren't too scary. I'm usually scared, but even I had fun. We all loved Exotic Travels, a boat ride that starts calmly and then becomes very exciting. We waited for half an hour for Lightning River, and then it was over quickly! I didn't go on the Big Leap, but if you're brave, it looked great. If the children were older, they might have found it a bit boring, but they were the right age and loved it.

**Fantasy World - The Break-all Family**

The park's advertising says there is 'No Limit to the Fun,' and we agree. Europe's tallest roller-coaster, the Rocket, stands out, and Ben thought it was the scariest ride, although Jennie said the Hanger, where you hang upside-down 30 meters above the ground, was even scarier! There are about a dozen main rides, which the older children went on several times. Sarah was too small for a few of them, but she enjoyed the Long Slide. We found the staff's attitudes varied. Some were great with younger children, but the welcome wasn't always warm. You need a full day to enjoy Fantasy World. We wouldn't have dared tell the kids we were leaving early."
FCE_60,"**Running a Business in the Countryside: Five Women's Stories**

**A. Christine Hogan**  
Christine Hogan runs a computer-aided design business with a yearly turnover of over Â£200,000 and employs four full-time staff. She says, ""My customers are friends."" Christine and her husband moved from London to the countryside when their children were young. She wanted a job she could do from home. Having worked with computers before marriage, her husband suggested starting a computer-aided design business. It required a lot of money, and the beginning was tough. Christine was careful with finances, always informing the bank manager if she might overspend. Working from home saves money, and she can work in the evenings if needed. The business remains small, with local clients often collecting their work.

**B. Maggy Sasanow**  
Maggy Sasanow designs greeting cards from home. She says, ""I enjoy being independent."" After studying art at university, she wanted to work in a museum, but living in the countryside meant no such jobs were available. So, she started her own business, creating 50 different greeting cards sold to museums. She works in a large room upstairs. The downside of working from home is the constant distraction of household chores. Her business grows through word of mouth, without advertising. People send work from London because she is cheaper than other artists. Although she misses exchanging ideas with others, the benefits outweigh the drawbacks.

**C. Delia Turner**  
Delia Turner runs a curtain-making business that has faced ups and downs. She started eight years ago when the business was growing, and her turnover increased from Â£24,000 to Â£80,000 in two years. She managed six full-time curtain-makers but had to let them go due to economic decline, which was difficult as jobs are scarce in the area. Now, she makes curtains at home with her husband's help and employs women who work from their homes. Delia is ready to lower prices when needed and explore new opportunities.

**D. Tessa Strickland**  
Tessa Strickland manages the editorial and production side of her children's book publishing business from her farmhouse. She moved to the countryside three years ago for financial reasons and her love of the country. She enjoys flexible working hours, though 80% of her income comes from deals with Australia, the Far East, and North America, requiring calls at odd hours. The challenge is maintaining discipline to stop working. Tessa publishes children's books from various cultures, collaborating with authors and artists. Initially, she felt lonely, having gained all her professional experience in London.

**E. Meg Rivers**  
Meg Rivers runs a cakes-by-post business and a shop with a turnover of Â£250,000 a year, employing six people, some part-time. She started ten years ago at home, focusing on health by making fruit cakes with quality ingredients. As demand grew from friends and relatives, she began sending cakes nationwide. Seven years ago, she rented a small building where everything is made, employing a baker, assistant, and professional cake-icer. Meg no longer bakes herself, managing the business side instead. Her biggest challenge has been the financial aspect, as they started with limited funds."
FCE_1,"**Meet the Amazing Watkins Family**

The Watkins family is unique because not only are the sons talented musicians and composers, but their father, John, also makes musical instruments. When John and Hetty Watkins, schoolteachers from South Wales, needed a cello for their ten-year-old son, Paul, they found it too expensive. John decided to learn how to make one himself. He attended evening classes at the Welsh School of Instrument Making for about three years. After practicing with violins and violas, he successfully made his first cello for Paul. Paul used this cello until recently, as John improved his skills and made another one for him.

John has now retired from teaching to focus on making instruments full-time, crafting up to twelve violins a year. Selling a violin to the famous American musician Jaime Laredo was a significant achievement for him.

Both Paul and his younger brother, Huw, were encouraged to play music from a young age. Paul started with the piano and then moved to the cello, inspired by a cellist in his father's music group. Huw, on the other hand, chose the piano and composition, finding inspiration in Paul's success.

Paul, now 28, achieved great success with his father's cello, winning the string final of the BBC Young Musician of the Year competition. At 20, he became the principal cellist of the BBC Symphony Orchestra, a position he held until last year. He now plays a Francesco Rugeri cello, on loan from the Royal Academy of Music, which he says has a richer sound due to its age.

Paul will soon perform on television with the Rugeri cello in Elgar's Cello Concerto for the series Masterworks. However, he won't be able to watch it as he will be performing at the Cheltenham Festival the same night. Huw, now 22, will also be busy, as his String Quartet will premiere in London at the Wigmore Hall that evening. John and Hetty will have to manage their time carefully to follow their sons' musical careers in the coming weeks."
FCE_53,"**Looking after the countryside: THE NATIONAL TRUST**

The National Trust is an organization that aims to protect the British countryside. Gill Page visits the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales and talks to Gareth Roberts, a warden employed by the Trust to care for the beautiful areas it owns.

According to Gareth Roberts, a National Trust Warden needs common sense. 'You also need to be good with people because you deal with farmers, visitors, conservationists, and building firms all the time.' Gareth grew up on the Lleyn Peninsula and worked on his parents' farm until he got married. About 80 people applied for the job of National Trust Warden for the Lleyn Peninsula. In the end, Gareth's local knowledge and farming experience got him the job, even though he didn't have formal training. 'It's helpful that I still farm with my parents and can understand farmers' problems. Also, they can't fool me about anything!' he says.

His farming background helps him handle the physical work of the job, like building fences, planting trees, and constructing walls. Since joining the Trust, Gareth has learned more about nature conservation. 'When I was young,' he remembers, 'I used to collect flowers, butterfly larvae, and old birds' nests. I recently thought, where would I find all those things now? It's clear to me that farming has changed the countryside. It's not the farmers' faultâ€”they were just following government advice.'

Gareth says that when he started, farmers and conservationists were against each other. Now they talk and understand each other's views. 'We're close to bringing them together,' says Gareth.

Conservation is a big part of Gareth's work, along with allowing public access to the Trust's land, planting trees, and meeting with the Trust's tenant farmers. 'My job is to make sure tasks are completed efficiently and economically. I enjoy seeing projects finished, although I spend about half my time on paperwork.'

Gareth is passionate about his job and enjoys it, even though he is never really off duty. He especially likes talking to the public, although he admits, 'Some people's attitudes annoy me. They come in, demand everything, and leave as if they own the place. Being nice to them can be frustrating!' But as Gareth says, it all comes down to common sense. So, if you have plenty of that and like outdoor work, you might consider becoming a warden like Garethâ€”but don't expect a job to open up on the Lleyn Peninsula anytime soon!"
FCE_55,"**The Netball Captain**

In our series on women in sport, Suzie Ellis met England's netball captain, Kendra Slowinski. Kendra is leading England's netball team. When I met her, she was having a typical day before next month's World Championships: teaching at a local school and then training in a supermarket car park. I asked her, ""Don't you get strange looks?"" She replied, ""I'm too focused on my movements and my feet to notice anything else. I might see cars slow down, but that's all.""

""My whole life now is about being at my best for the Championships,"" says Kendra. ""I'm on a strict schedule to get as fit as possible."" These are her fourth World Championships, and they will be the biggest ever, with 27 countries participating. ""We'll have home support, which is special,"" she says. ""It's important to improve netball's reputation in this country. Playing here means more pressure. A home crowd will have expectations and give more support. People will expect us to start the tournament well.""

Their first game is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. ""As far as I know, we have always beaten them, but they'll be exciting to play. They have lots of talent."" The England team is currently ranked fourth in the world. But, as Kendra points out, the World Championships will be tough. ""You have to push yourself to play each day, there's no rest between games like in a series. You can still win a series if you lose the first game, but the Championships are different because there's only one chance.""

In the fifteen years she has been playing at the top level, the sport has become harder and faster. On the court, players are more aggressive. ""You don't train so hard not to win,"" says Kendra. ""But once the final whistle blows, you become a different person. We're all friendlier after the game.""

Netball is also using a more scientific approach to fitness testing. ""It's essential that we all think and train like world-class players,"" says Kendra. ""As captain, I think it's important to have a strong mental attitude and lead by example. I see my role as supporting and encouraging the team.""

""From the start, my netball career has been carefully planned,"" she says. ""I decided some time ago that this competition would be my last as a player."" She will likely coach young players in the future, but for now, she is focused on her last big event. As she leads her team in the opening candlelight ceremony, she might have a tear in her eye."
FCE_50,"**SPECIALIST MUSIC SCHOOLS**

How should parents handle a child with exceptional musical talent? It's not always easy to know the best way to nurture their gift. Some parents might not even notice their child's needs until the child becomes frustrated and difficult. While most schools can support children who excel in academic subjects, musically gifted children need special attention that regular schools might not provide, especially if music is not a priority there. These children, along with those encouraged by parents or teachers, might benefit from attending a specialist music school.

In Britain, there are five specialist music schools, which are relatively new. These schools offer a supportive environment for gifted children aged seven to eighteen to fully develop their musical skills with the help of professional musicians. At these schools, children spend one-third to half of their day on musical activities, such as individual lessons (up to three hours a week on their main and secondary instruments), playing in orchestras, chamber groups, voice training, conducting, and learning music theory. They also practice for several hours daily in well-equipped private rooms, sometimes with a teacher. The rest of their time is spent on a limited academic program focusing on essential subjects like English, math, basic sciences, and languages, though students can study more subjects if they wish.

All five British specialist schools are independent, with small classes and a high teacher-to-student ratio. Most students are boarders, meaning they live at the school full-time, which allows them to grow up with peers who share similar goals and interests.

What are the downsides? One major issue is the cost; boarding fees range from Â£12,000 to Â£17,000 a year. However, schools try to help parents of exceptionally talented children with scholarships and financial aid. Another concern is that not all parents want to send their children to boarding school, especially at a young age. Many school directors question the wisdom of admitting children as young as seven into such a demanding environment. They emphasize that their goal is to develop 'rounded and well-balanced individuals.'

There is a risk that separating musically gifted children from an early age can cause stress. Musical talent might fade during teenage years, and the pressure to succeed can lead to a sense of failure. However, specialist schools closely monitor each student's progress and offer support if needed. While many former students feel they gained a lot from the high-quality music education, some are concerned about the limited academic program, which is secondary to music. Many musically talented young people are also very intelligent and can handle academic challenges, feeling frustrated if their intellectual needs aren't met.

For these reasons, it might be better to wait until the child is old enough to decide for themselves before considering specialist education. Those who are also academically gifted might thrive in a less specialized environment, such as a school with an excellent music department or by combining regular schooling with musical training at junior departments of music colleges. These colleges offer Saturday morning lessons with top teachers and opportunities for orchestral and chamber music experience. However, this option may not be feasible for families living far from major cities like London."
FCE_25,"Artist Susan Shepherd is famous for her flower paintings. Her large garden, full of her favorite flowers like tulips and poppies, provides many of her painting subjects. Some plants grow wildly, spreading seeds everywhere. The garden has a beautiful mix of colors and shapes, especially along the flower borders that line the path from east to west. This beauty is partly thanks to the previous owners, who were passionate gardeners and left plants that Susan liked. She also inherited their gardener, Danny. Susan says, 'It was really his garden. We got along well. At first, he would say, ""Oh, it's not worth it"" about some plants I wanted, but when I explained I wanted to paint them, he understood.'

Susan prefers to paint detailed studies of single plants rather than the whole garden. Sometimes she paints groups of plants where they grow, but usually, she picks them and takes them to her studio. 'I don't set everything up at once,' she explains. 'I paint one flower, which might take a few days, then add another one, building the painting slowly. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish.' Her busiest time is spring and early summer when tulips and poppies bloom. 'They all bloom together, and you're so busy,' she says. She is also fascinated by how flowers change as they decay. For example, with tulips, 'you put them in water, leave them for a day, and they form different shapes. They open up and look amazing. At first, they seem boring, but they change with twists and turns.'

Susan has always loved plants. 'I studied botany at school and collected wildflowers from the countryside,' she says. 'I wasn't interested in gardening then; I didn't like garden flowers because they looked like fake ones sold in shops. To me, only wildflowers were real. I was fascinated by how they grew in difficult places, like cracks in rocks or on cliffs.' Now, her garden has many plants from faraway places, but they seem at home there. She has a relaxed attitude towards her garden, like an aunt who lets children play freely as long as they don't cause harm. With two upcoming exhibitions and plenty of subjects to paint, she finds it hard to work in the garden. She has hired another gardener, but she knows that to stay connected to her work, 'you have to get your hands dirty.'"
FCE_34,"**Keeping the Holiday-Makers Happy**

A chalet girl's work is never done, as Sarah Sutherland-Pilch explains to Veronica Lee, while she juggles making beds and cooking delicious meals. This is Sarah's second year working as a chalet girl. She is 24 years old and from West Sussex. Known by her nickname, Pilch, she works for a company in Val d'IsÃ¨re, France. Her job involves cooking and cleaning for visitors who come to ski and stay in the wooden houses called chalets, which are typical of the area. Sarah graduated in French and History of Art from Oxford Brookes University last summer. She says being a chalet girl isn't a career, but it's a fun way to spend a year or two before settling down. ""It's a good way to make contacts. I meet successful people every week.""

Sarah does not live in the chalet. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks about a mile to the chalet, which can host up to 18 guests each week. She has her own breakfast before preparing breakfast for the guests. ""They get everythingâ€”porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants."" After the guests finish breakfast, around 9:30 a.m., Sarah cleans up and either prepares afternoon tea, which the guests can help themselves to, or cleans the rooms, which she says is ""the worst part of the job."" By about 11 a.m., she is ready to go skiing. She skis as much as she can. ""On a good day, we can be up there until 4:30 p.m.""

Sarah returns to the chalet in time to prepare dinner and takes a shower before starting, but she does not nap. ""It's fatal if you do,"" she says. Dinner, a three-course meal, is served at 8 p.m., and coffee is usually on the table by 10 p.m. Sarah clears away the dinner things and loads the dishwasher. ""There's nothing worse than coming into a messy kitchen the next morning."" Sometimes she stays and chats with the guests; other times, they prefer to be left alone. ""Good guests can make a week brilliantâ€”breakfast this morning was great funâ€”but some weeks, for whatever reason, don't go quite so well.""

Sarah meets her friends at the chalet where she lives, and they go out around 11 p.m. ""We usually start off in Bananas, might go to G Jay's, and perhaps Dick's T-Bar at the end of the evening,"" she says. But Sarah never stays out too late on Saturday night because Sunday is her busiest day of the week. ""A frightful day,"" she says, ""when you certainly don't want to be cooking breakfast feeling exhausted."" Work starts earlier than usual on Sunday, as breakfast for guests has to be ready by 7 a.m. As soon as the guests leave, Sarah starts cleaning quickly. ""We just blitz the placeâ€”clear the breakfast, strip the beds, get everything ready."" If she hasn't done the week's shopping on Saturday, she does it now. Around 3 p.m., after cleaning, Sarah prepares tea for the new guests. ""They arrive around 4:30 p.m. Sometimes they are disoriented and full of questions. I'm sure it's the mountain air that does something to them."" Between tea and dinner, Sarah takes any guests needing boots or skis to the ski shop and then gets a lift back to the chalet from one of the ski shop staff. It's soon time for dinner duty again and maybe a chat with friends, but not always. ""Sometimes I'm so tired I just have an early night,"" she says."

**Mandie Currie**, a zoo-keeper, spent a day at the magazine Marie Claire. ""Choosing what to wear was hard because I usually wear a uniform. First, I went to a photo studio, then to press previews, all before lunch. The zoo is calm and peaceful, but here I was rushing around. Some of the fashion team seemed stressed, but my job isn't stressful. At a fashion shoot in the afternoon, I laughed thinking I'd usually be cleaning cages or handling rats. I'm interested in how magazines work, but I love my job at the zoo, so I'll stay there.""

**Alice Cutler**, a fashion assistant at Marie Claire, spent a day at London Zoo. ""I arrived in leather boots and dark blue trousers. The zoo gave me a green polo shirt to work in, which was good because I got very dirty. As I stroked an elephant, I thought Mandie was probably packing clothes. By five o'clock, I smelled bad, but I had a great day. When I retire from fashion, I might work with elephants, but maybe in Africa.""

**Karen Hodson**, a nurse at Hammersmith Hospital, joined the TV gardening show Ground Force. ""I was excited to meet the team, and Alan Titchmarsh, the presenter, was really nice. I liked being in the fresh air. Sometimes, I don't see daylight because of my shifts. It was hard work but fun. I thought I was strong, but I felt weak compared to the team. My idea of gardening didn't include hard work or careful planning. I'm more enthusiastic than effective, so I won't leave my job.""

**Charlie Dimmock**, a landscape gardener with Ground Force, worked a shift at Hammersmith Hospital. ""I made beds and gave out tablets. I thought I might faint, but I was surprised it didn't bother me. The friendship among the nurses is great, and it felt very 'girlie' compared to my usual male environment. I feel my job is less important than nursing. My day at the hospital wasn't exactly pleasant, but it was satisfying.""

**Lucy Harvey**, a personal trainer, spent a day with Ryanair as cabin crew. ""I changed into the uniform, and I felt differentâ€”people looked up to me. Before the flight, our supervisor talked about safety and what to do if someone had a heart attack, which I knew from my fitness training. When passengers boarded the flight to Paris, I gave out magazines. Everyone stared at me, and I felt self-conscious. On the return flight, we had 80 schoolchildren who wouldn't sit still. I wished I was back in the gym with one sensible adult.""

**Sonia McDermott**, an air hostess with Ryanair, spent a day as a personal trainer in a gym. ""I was worried about this swap because I don't exercise. I was amazed at how much attention you give to one person. In my job, you meet 130 passengers four times a day. I was surprised at lunch to see some trainers didn't eat very healthily, but they all drink lots of water. I wouldn't swap my job for this. However, it inspired me to join a gym and try to be healthier."""
FCE_26,"**On the Rails: Five Celebrities Share Their Favorite Train Journey Memories**

**Andrea Thompson - Newsreader**  
I fell in love with the south of France a long time ago and try to return as often as I can. There's a local train from Cannes along the coast that crosses into Italy. It takes you past some of the most amazing sea views. No matter the weather or time of year, it is always enchanting. Out of the other window, you see some of the best gardens and homes in France. You feel like you're peeking into the lives of the rich and famous. The travelers are always lively, with a mix of tourists and locals, all enjoying the breathtaking journey.

**Raj Patel - Explorer**  
I've enjoyed many rail journeys over the years, but my favorite is the Nile Valley Express, which runs across the desert in northern Sudan. Growing up in South Africa, I missed a family train trip from Cape Town to the Kruger National Park because I was considered too young and troublesome. When I moved to England as a teenager, I still hadn't traveled by train. London Waterloo was the first real station I saw, and its great glass dome amazed me.

**Betty Cooper - Novelist**  
I owe a lot to one train: the Blue Train, which took my husband and me on our honeymoon across France to catch a boat to Egypt. On the train, my husband gave me a pink dress, which I loved. Someone mentioned that pink is good for the brain, and I've worn the color ever since. What I remember most about the journey is how lovely it was to travel through France and then by boat up the Nile to Luxor. It was the perfect way to relax after the wedding preparations.

**Martin Brown - Journalist**  
We were working on a series of articles about a round-the-world trip and had to cross a desert in an African country. There wasn't a road, so we took the Desert Express. The timetable was unreliableâ€”we were just given a day. We heard that the driver would often wait for days to depart if he knew people were still on their way. When it appeared, hundreds of people climbed into and onto the carriagesâ€”people even traveled on the roof for free. During the night, the train crossed some of the most beautiful landscapes I've ever seen. It was like a dream, like traveling across the moon.

**Arisu Mezuki - Actress**  
Most people form their favorite impressions of trains when they are young, but not me. I grew up in Singapore and Cyprus, where I saw very few trains. It wasn't until I was a teenager that trains became important in my life. I made a film featuring a railway in Yorkshire. Most filming took place on an old, disused line maintained by volunteers. That's where my passion for steam trains began. When we weren't filming, we rode the train whenever we could, and when I returned last year, it was as if time had stood still. Everything was still in place, even the gas lights on the station platform!"
FCE_8,"Text: 'Trying to get published? If you're wondering where to send your story, our expert Margaret Stubbs has the advice you need. Readers often ask, 'I have written this story/book. Can you tell me who to send it to?' The first thing to know is that you should research your markets and learn about publishers while improving your writing skills. Turning words into something sellable requires knowledge about the 'writing game'. Whatever you write, you need to understand the markets you are targeting. The best way to do this is by reading everything relevant you can find. Use your local library and visit bookshops and newsagents. Reading widely will guide you on what kinds of writing publishers are accepting at any time. This knowledge must be updated as new publications appear, editors change jobs, and magazines change direction. New titles come and go all the time. Publishers are always looking for new talent; as writers, we must give them what they want. At first, you may not be sure what you want to write. Let's say you want to write short love stories. The first thing to do is find out which magazines publish love stories, a limited market these days, and get recent copies. Familiarize yourself with the stories they buy, noting who the readers are. These readers expect different things from their magazine, and the editor focuses on their needs. Writers often send me their stories saying, 'This has been rejected three times - am I wasting my time? Do I stand a chance?' As a former teacher, I never discourage anyone. But it's unlikely the work is ready for publishing; I try to give an honest opinion, but always positively. The problem is most new writers are too eager to send their work out, often before they are ready. If you've only written one story or article, it's unlikely to be published. That almost never happens. When you hear about 'success', you usually find the person has been in publishing or journalism for years before their success. When you send off your work for the first time, start on more work while waiting for a reply; write ten more stories, even twenty. Each one will be better than the last, and you'll start to think of yourself as a writer, and your fluency and confidence will grow. Don't throw any of them awayâ€”improve them instead. Also, I advise not showing your work to anyone else, especially in the early stages. Remember, every successful writer has faced many rejections before succeeding. Do everything you can to advance your writing career. See if there's a creative writing course near you. If not, join a local writers' group to gain ideas and confidence from other aspiring writers. Think of yourself as a writer and practice writingâ€”every day if possible.'"
FCE_4,"On the last day of a difficult year, I was at the Baltimore railway station, waiting for the 10.10 train to Philadelphia. The station was busier than I expected. Usually, it felt airy and clean, but now it was crowded. Elderly couples with matching luggage filled the benches, and college students sat on the floor with their bags. A well-dressed, grey-haired man was walking around, talking to strangers. He approached a woman sitting alone and asked her something. Then he came to a girl near me with long blond hair. I had thought about talking to her myself. The man asked, ""Are you traveling to Philadelphia?"" She replied, ""I'm going north, yes."" ""But to Philadelphia?"" he insisted. ""No, New York,"" she said. ""Thanks, anyway,"" he replied and moved on. Now, he had my full attention. I heard him ask an old lady, ""Are you traveling to Philadelphia?"" She said, ""Wilmington,"" and he moved on to another couple. I stood up and moved closer, pretending to look at the train platform. I was going to Philadelphia, but he didn't ask me. I understood why; I probably seemed unreliable to him. He glanced at me and then walked to the other end of the waiting area, looking stressed. ""Please!"" he said to a woman reading a book. ""Tell me you're going to Philadelphia!"" She looked up, about thirty-five years old, like a schoolteacher. ""Philadelphia?"" she said. ""Yes, I am."" ""Could I ask you a favor?"" he asked. I stopped a few feet away, pretending to check my watch, though I didn't have one. The woman seemed cautious. The man noticed and said, ""Nothing too difficult, I promise!"" My train was being announced, and people started moving toward Gate E. I heard the man explain, ""My daughter is flying out this afternoon for a study year abroad, leaving from Philadelphia. She forgot her passport. She called home from the station in Philadelphia, not knowing what to do."" The woman listened sympathetically. I would have stayed quiet, waiting to see where this was going. ""I told her to stay put, and I would find someone here to take her passport,"" he continued. It seemed suspicious. Why didn't he go himself if it was so urgent? ""Why don't you go yourself?"" the woman asked. ""I can't leave my wife alone for that long. She's in a wheelchair,"" he replied. This seemed like a weak excuse to me. I looked at them. The man held a padded envelope, not a plain one, which would have been more logical. It seemed stapled shut. Be careful, I thought to myself."
FCE_30,"**Gary and Me**

John Moore, a restaurant owner, writes about his relationship with his son Gary, a famous TV chef.

I believe everyone gets a chance in life. My son, Gary, got his chance with cooking, and my chance was to run a restaurant. When I heard about the opportunity, I quickly went to see the place. It was in very bad condition, but it was perfect for what I wanted. Starting this business reminded me of my childhood. I remember my mother going to work in a factory and me feeling upset because I was left alone. With that in mind, I thought, 'We want time for family life.' My wife focused on taking care of the children and did all my accounts, while I ran the business. We lived above the restaurant back then, and we always made sure to have meals together. This has been very beneficial for our children, Gary and Joe. They're both very confident. From a young age, they would come down and talk to our regular customers. This gave them a great start in life.

Gary was quite energetic as a child. We had a corner bath, and when he was about seven, he thought he'd jump into it like a swimming pool and knocked himself out. When he was older, he had to work for pocket money. He started with odd jobs, and by the age of ten, he was in the kitchen every weekend, so he always had plenty of money at school. He was disciplined. He used to wake up even before me in the morning. If you run a family business, it's for the family, and it was nice to see him helping out. Gary wasn't very academic, but he excelled in the kitchen. By the age of 15, he was as good as any of the men working there, and sometimes he was even left in charge. He would produce over a hundred meals, and from then I knew he'd go into catering because he had that talent. So when he came to me and said, 'Dad, I have to do work experience as part of my school course,' I sent him to a friend of mine who has a restaurant.

Gary recently started playing the drums and now has his own band. Who knows what will happen to the cooking if the music becomes successful. My advice to Gary would be: if you try to do two things at once, you might not succeed in either, so focus on what you know you can achieve. He understood when I said to him: 'Gary, if you're going to get anywhere in life, you've got to do it by the age of 30. If you haven't done it by then, it's too late.'

Gary went to catering college at 17, and on his first day, he and the other new studentsâ€”who are usually complete beginnersâ€”were given what's supposed to be a morning's work. But within an hour, Gary had chopped all his vegetables and sliced all his meats. He'd prepared everything. That's my son for you! In the end, he was helping other people out. None of us can believe how successful Gary's TV cookery series has become. I'm extremely proud of him. I've always tried to tell him that if you want something, you've got to work very hard for it because no one gives you anything. He's seen the opportunity he's been given and grabbed it with both hands. You know, you talk to your children as they grow up, and if they only take in ten percent of what you've told them, you've got to be happy with that. The things Gary says, the things he does, I think, well, he must have listened sometimes."
FCE_7,"Finding an affordable flat in Dublin was as difficult as finding gold during a gold rush. The best way to find a place was through personal connections: if you knew someone who knew someone leaving a flat, that often worked. But for Jo, who had just arrived in Dublin, there were no personal contacts, no one to inform her about a vacant bedsit. So, she stayed in a hostel and searched for a place. For Jo, Dublin was a big unknown. She felt like she was stepping into the unknown when she took the train to work there. She never questioned why she was going. Everyone at her school assumed she would leave. Who would stay in a small, remote town? That's all she heard for years. Everyone wanted to leave, experience life, and have a real existence. Some of her classmates went to towns like Ennis or Limerick, where family would help them settle. But none from Jo's year were going to Dublin. She was going alone. Jo's mother thought it would be great if she stayed permanently in the hostel, which was run by nuns, ensuring her safety. Her father hoped the hostel was warm, as they were known to be cold. Jo's sisters, who worked as waitresses, thought she was crazy to stay in a hostel for a week. But Jo didn't know they were still thinking and talking about her as she answered an ad for a flat in Ringsend. It offered 'Own room, own television, share kitchen, bathroom.' It was close to the post office where she worked and seemed too good to be true. She hoped it would be nice, that they would like her, and that it wouldn't be too expensive. There wasn't a queue because it was more 'Third Girl Wanted' than 'Flat to Let.' The mention of 'own television' made Jo wonder if it was too fancy for her, but the house looked ordinary. It was a red-brick terraced house with a basement, but the flat was upstairs. A cheerful girl with a college scarf, clearly a failed applicant, was coming down the stairs. 'Desperate place,' she said to Jo. 'They're both awful. Common as dirt.' 'Oh,' said Jo and continued climbing. 'Hello,' said a girl with 'Nessa' on her T-shirt. 'Did you see that snobby girl leaving? I can't stand her type.' 'What did she do?' asked Jo. 'Do? She didn't have to do anything. She just looked around, made a face, giggled, and said, ""Is this all there is? Oh dear, oh dear,"" in a posh accent. We wouldn't have her here, would we, Pauline?' Pauline wore a very colorful shirt, almost as bright as her hair. Jo noted with surprise that Pauline was a punk. She had seen punks on O'Connell Street but hadn't talked to one before. 'I'm Jo, I work in the post office and I called about the flat.' Nessa said they were about to have tea. She brought out three mugs; one said 'Nessa,' one said 'Pauline,' and the other said 'Other.' 'We'll put your name on it if you stay,' she said kindly."
FCE_43,"**Behind the Dolphin's Smile**

People love dolphins. We enjoy watching them at seaside marinas, in movies, and on TV. However, the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society says dolphins are in serious trouble. Mark Simmonds reports on their decline.

Dolphins are special to us. They are very intelligent, understand human emotions, and make us dream of freedom in the wild seas. TV shows like ""Flipper"" and ""Seaquest"" have made us love them even more. But these happy images hide the truth about dolphins living in polluted and overfished seas today. The number of North Sea harbour porpoises, a type of dolphin, has dropped by up to 89,000.

You might think such popular animals are protected by law and live in special marine reserves. Unfortunately, this is not true, and the lack of protection could become a major wildlife disaster. There are forty different kinds of dolphins worldwide. In northern Europe, the most common are the striped, common, bottlenose dolphins, and the smaller harbour porpoise. The first two live far out at sea and are rarely seen. We know little about them. The large grey bottlenoses and harbour porpoises used to be common near European coasts. Bottlenoses are very social and were found on the Channel coast and in British rivers like the Thames. Now, they are only found in the Moray Firth in Scotland and Cardigan Bay in Wales. The few that remain show signs of stress.

Dolphins' complex habits make it hard to know why their numbers are falling. Overfishing, which reduces fish stocks and threatens local fishing industries, also threatens dolphins. Porpoises need to find food quickly. If fish are overfished in one area, they may not survive long enough to find food elsewhere. They can also get caught in fishermen's nets, which they cannot see. Modern fishing methods use huge nets that float or are pulled quickly through the sea. Recently, many dead dolphins have washed up on the beaches of France and Cornwall. Marks and cuts on their bodies show they were caught in these nets.

Waste and other substances in the sea can build up in dolphins' bodies. For example, pesticides dissolve in fat, so dolphins can absorb them, and they accumulate in their bodies. Female dolphins then produce milk rich in pesticides, passing the poison to their young. There is a recorded case of a young dolphin dying from its mother's milk.

Perhaps the most controversial threat to dolphins is human disturbance. Dolphins live in groups and use sound to understand their world. In the sea, noise pollution from ships and oil wells travels four times more efficiently than in the air. This may disturb dolphins in ways we do not yet understand."
FCE_51,"**GETTING FIT**

Exercise is very important for your mind, body, and spirit. It helps you stay balanced when life feels chaotic. You might be tired of hearing about fitness, but it's really good for you. There are many reasons to exercise and very few reasons not to.

Exercise makes your muscles stronger and changes your body shape quickly. It increases muscle power and helps you stand or sit with good posture. Good posture is how you hold your body. Exercise also prevents muscle imbalances that can cause injuries. It improves your heart, lungs, and blood circulation. 

You might have heard these reasons before and feel bored, but here's something new: exercise can help with depression, tiredness, and sleep problems. It also helps control stress and can relieve some medical conditions. 

If these reasons don't convince you, common sense should. Exercise is good for you. There are many types of exercise like aerobics, jogging, and weight training. Be careful not to train too hard or with too much weight, as it can cause injuries. Start slowly and consult your doctor if you're unsure.

Good posture is important for improving your body shape. A stiff or sagging body looks unattractive and lacks energy. If you slouch, imagine a helium balloon pulling your head up. This helps you breathe better and makes your body look slimmer. 

Stretching your muscles improves flexibility and helps prevent injuries. Stretching should be part of your exercise routine and should be done slowly and carefully. The best exercise routine includes a warm-up, stretching, an energetic workout, and a cool-down period."
FCE_11,"**IN THEIR NATURAL HABITAT**

What makes film-makers Amanda Barrett and Owen Newman leave their home comforts for months? The search for the perfect shot. Among all the creatures in the jungles and plains of East Africa, two of the hardest to find are producer Amanda Barrett and cameraman Owen Newman. They are currently in the Ngorongoro Crater, which has experienced six months of almost continuous rain, leading to unexpected problems. Newman explained that they had to buy an expensive tool so that whenever one of their vehicles gets stuck in the mud, Amanda can pull him back to safety. Their partnership has produced some of TV's best wildlife films, like their well-received film on leopards. Even while this film about Africa's shyest cats was being shown, they were already back in the wild, this time following the equally shy jackal. This is common in television partnerships. Travelling film-makers have been exploring the globe to capture exotic wildlife since television began. I spoke to Newman about their partnership during one of his rare visits to a safari lodge. 'We do have occasional arguments but we tend to get over them quickly,' he says about his colleague. Neither sees themselves as the leader, and he says they get along well because they both view animals similarly. 'When we are on the move, we set up our tents each night. But this time we have a more fixed camp, and since we start at 5 a.m. each morning, we make tea the night before and keep it warm in a vacuum flask.' Their daily diet consists of pre-packed meals heated by whoever is available. 'It's not unusual for us to be out for up to eight weeks at a time, so catering can cause some panic,' says Newman. It can be a tough life, but being alone in remote areas allows them to get close to the animals and become part of their lives. Newman recalls filming a family of lions where one lioness would regularly greet their car as part of her routine. Newman first worked with Barrett in 1988 on a film called 'The Great Rift', and two years later, they teamed up to film Arctic foxes. Since then, they spend four months on location to gather enough material for each half-hour film. Before they start, they must submit a script for approval. 'Amanda and I developed a good working relationship from the start,' says Newman, 'because we shared the same ideas and vision. We aim to create films rich in atmosphere, capturing the true spirit of the place and animals, and touching people's hearts. I believe evoking an emotional response is better than appealing only to their intellect.'"
FCE_14,"**The Netball Captain**

In our series on women in sport, Suzie Ellis met with England's netball captain, Kendra Slawinski. Kendra leads England's netball team. When I met her, she was having a typical day leading up to next month's World Championships: teaching at a local school and then training in a supermarket car park. I was surprised about her training location. 'Don't people stare?' I asked. 'I'm too focused on my movements and my feet to notice,' she replied. 'I might see cars slow down, but that's it.'

'My whole life is about being at my best for the Championships,' says Kendra. She follows a strict schedule to reach peak fitness. These are her fourth World Championships, and they will be the biggest ever, with 27 countries participating. 'We'll have home support, which is special,' she says. 'It's important to improve netball's reputation in this country. Playing here means more pressure. A home crowd will expect us to start well.'

Their first game is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. 'As far as I know, we have always beaten them, but they are exciting to play. They have a lot of talent.' The England team is currently ranked fourth in the world. But, as Kendra notes, the World Championships will be challenging. 'You have to play every day, with no rest between games. In a series, you can lose the first game and still win. But in the Championships, there's only one chance, and you must be ready.'

In her fifteen years at the top level, the sport has become tougher and faster. Players are more aggressive on the court. 'You don't train so hard not to win,' says Kendra. 'But after the final whistle, we become different people. We're all friendlier after the game.'

Netball is also using a more scientific approach to fitness testing. 'We must think and train like world-class players,' says Kendra. As captain, she believes it's important to have a strong mental attitude and lead by example. 'I see my role as supporting and encouraging the team.'

'From the start, my netball career has been carefully planned,' she says. She decided some time ago that this competition would be her last as a player. She will likely coach young players in the future, but for now, she is focused on her final big event. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she might have a tear in her eye. Her loyal supporters will be with her every step of the way."
FCE_63,"Rachel Mills is a scientist who spends a lot of time at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She teaches and researches marine geochemistry, which means she studies chemical processes in the sea. Rachel is a lecturer at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she isn't teaching, she goes into a steel vehicle, about the size of a small car, and dives three kilometers down into the Atlantic Ocean to study underwater volcanoes. Inside the vehicle, space is so limited that she can touch the two pilots. They are used to these conditions, which mean they can't stand up or move, and they must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can last for 16 hours: three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours gathering rock and water samples, and then three hours to return to the surface.

If there is a problem and they need to get to the top quickly, they can hit a panic button. The outside drops away, leaving a small circular escape vessel that gets released, and it quickly goes to the surface, like a ping-pong ball in water. No one has tested it yet, but Rachel thinks it wouldn't be a pleasant journey.

Rachel didn't know how she would react the first time she climbed into the vehicle. It was on the deck of a ship, and she got in with an instructor. He explained the emergency procedures, including what to do if the pilot had a heart attack. They were testing her to see how she would react in such a small space. Now Rachel has made six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian crew. They went to a site five days' sail west of the Canary Islands in the Atlantic. On the ocean floor, there is a large area of underwater volcanoes, with chimneys blowing out black smoke. The Russian team was dropping off scientific equipment to study the effect of a program that would make a hole 150 meters through a volcano.

When she isn't at sea, Rachel is in her office at the Oceanography Centre, Southampton. Two-thirds of her salary comes from teaching, which she loves, but she does it so she can continue her research into the ""black smokers."" This is another name for underwater volcanoes, where water comes out of the rock and looks like black smoke. It pours out at a rate of one meter per second and at a temperature of 350 degrees.

The only time Rachel was frightened was when she first went down with the Americans. They were towing equipment on a 50-meter rope when there was an explosion. There was a loud bang as the shock waves hit their vehicle, and she thought, ""I'm going to die."" They stared at each other in silence, waiting. When nothing happened, they couldn't believe it. The relief was incredibleâ€”they were still alive!

Diving to the deepest part of the ocean is such an adventure. Every time Rachel looks out of the porthole and sees those chimneys, she feels a sense of wonder. She is at the bottom of the sea, and no one else on this planet has ever seen them before. She studied the black smokers for three years for her Ph.D. When she finally saw them for real, it was an amazing feeling."
FCE_56,"**Interview Tips**

First impressions are very important. Studies show that people form opinions about us within the first few minutes of meeting. They notice how we dress, our eye contact, our body language, how fast or slowly we talk, our volume and tone of voice, and the words we use.

Mary Pearce studied to be a teacher. She says, ""I worked hard to earn my degree. When I finally graduated, I was very confident."" She applied for a job at a nearby primary school and got an interview with the Head Teacher. ""I noticed a small hole in my jacket that morning,"" she recalls. ""I would have changed, but I knew it would make me late, and I always think it's important to be on time."" Mary didn't get the job. One of her friends, who also teaches at the school, told her the Head Teacher's only comment was, ""If someone doesn't take the time to present her best image at an interview, what kind of teacher is she going to be?""

Simon Grant, a hotel manager, says: ""Interviewees who look as if they care about themselves are more likely to care about their jobs. People think it's what's inside that counts, but in an interview, you should aim to come across in the best possible way."" Yet many people ignore the importance of having a professional image.

For example, Janet Goodwood worked for ten years as an administrative assistant in a large accounting firm. When the office manager retired, she applied for the position but wasn't even given an interview. ""I thought it was a mistake, so I asked the Director of Personnel what had happened,"" she says. ""He told me I didn't fit the image of an office manager. He suggested I improve my wardrobe before I applied again for promotion. I was shocked. I do a very good job, and the way I dress shouldn't make any difference.""

Movement and gestures also influence an interviewer's first impression of a candidate. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian discovered that 7% of any message about our feelings and attitudes comes from the words we use, 38% from voice, and a surprising 55% from our facial expressions. When our facial expressions and our words send different messages, the listener will trust the non-verbal message more. So make sure your words agree with your body language. Mixed messages will only confuse the interviewer.

It is also important not to appear too desperate for the job or too eager to please. When Sheila Rice, a marketing specialist, applied for a promotion, her interview went so well she was offered the job on the spot. ""I was delighted,"" she recalls. ""But I reacted to the offer with too much enthusiasm. Once the boss sensed how excited I was, he knew I wasn't going to turn him down. Consequently, he offered me a lower salary than I'd hoped for. I'm sure I could have got more had I managed to control my excitement.""

Finally, what we say and how we say it will contribute to the success of an interview. David Artesio, the manager of an employment agency, suggests that it's a good idea to learn about the company before you go for an interview. ""The annual report, for example, will tell you about areas of company involvement. Mention an area that interests you during the interview. This will give a positive note and convince others of your interest in the company."" Business consultant Marian Woodall suggests you have a few questions ready and avoid speaking in long, confused sentences. As she puts it, ""Poor communicators talk in paragraphs. Successful communicators talk in short sentences and even in highlighted points."""

**The Farmer**  
Matt Froggatt used to work as an insurance agent in London, but now he runs a sheep farm. ""After 14 years in business, the City went from being exciting to a grindâ€”no one was having fun anymore. I hadn't planned to leave for another five or ten years, but then I was made redundant unexpectedly. The payout wasn't great, but it was enough to start the farm. My big break came when I met the head chef of a local hotel with one of the top 20 hotel restaurants in the country. By supplying them, my reputation grew, and now I also sell meat by mail order. I'm glad I'm not stuck in an office anymore, but it's surprising how little has changed: I still work 80- to 90-hour weeks and sell a product.""

**The Painter**  
Ron Ablewhite was a manager in advertising but now earns a living as an artist. ""Painting started as a hobby, but I found it more exciting than my job. Taking redundancy to become an artist seemed logical. The career counsellor I spoke to was surprised when I said, 'I don't want to go back to where I've been.' Most people in their mid-forties need to return to work quickly for financial reasons. But we married young, and our children didn't need our support. Moving to the north of England, where we knew no one, was a leap into the unknown. We left our friends, but our friendships have survived the distanceâ€”many visit us now.""

**The Hatmaker**  
After five years as a company lawyer, Katherine Goodison started her own business in her London flat, making hats for private clients. ""Being a lawyer was fun and well-paid, but the hours were terrible. I didn't want to become a senior partner and work even more, so I left. People said I'd get bored, but that hasn't happened. The secret is having deadlines. In fashion, there are collections, next year's styles, the seasonâ€”there's always too much to do, so I keep a strict schedule. I'm happier and less stressed now. I do miss socializing with colleagues, though. What I love about this job is being fully responsible for the product. If I do a bad job, it's on me. You care when working for a company, but when your name is on everything, you care even more.""

**The Masseur**  
Paul Drinkwater worked in finance for 16 years before becoming a masseur at the Life Centre in London. ""I started in financial markets at 22, setting up deals. I liked the adrenaline but never found the work rewarding. I almost got made redundant in 1989, but I resigned and traveled for a year instead. During that year, I tried to figure out what I wanted to do. I was interested in health, so I visited top gymnasiums and talked to the owners about starting up. I knew I needed qualifications to change careers, so I took various massage courses. Then I got part-time work at the Life Centre. I have no regrets. I used to feel out of control, but now I have peace of mind and control over my future. That's the best part."""
FCE_6,"Text: 'Dedicated to their sports Four young sports stars talk about their lives. A Darius (runner) I've always loved sports. I tried many, but I was best at football and athletics. At 14, I had a chance to join a professional football club, but I chose athletics instead. My proudest moment was competing for my country in the youth team and winning a medal. Unfortunately, it didn't get much media attention, which was disappointing. I hoped for sponsorship because training is expensive. I train at home in winter and then go to Florida for three weeks before the season starts. It's fun there with great facilities and nightlife. But you must be disciplined. If friends invite me out before training, I have to say no. I wish I didn't, but dedication is important in this sport. My main goal is to reach the next Olympics - that would be amazing. B Gabriel (surfer) The surfing community is small, so you meet the same people at competitions. Professional surfers are serious, and the best waves are often at dawn, so you have to avoid late-night parties. I don't mind that much, but I love sleeping in, which I often have to skip. It's worth it, though, because without dedication, I might not have won the National Championships last year. After a win, I celebrate with a big night out, and if there's prize money, I go somewhere nice. The sacrifices are worth it because winning the championship got me a TV show about surfing. I guess I'm a bit of a celebrity now. C Dieter (yacht racer) With five guys on a boat, we have a lot of fun. We're traditional and always celebrate a win in style. Some say we act childishly when out, but we don't seek media attention. Reporters seem more interested in our celebrations than our race results. I'm away for eight months a year, so it's nice to come back, hang out with friends, and do normal things. You can't focus on the sport all the time - it's not healthy. I'm known in sailing, but I've only been recognized in public a few times. I'd hate to be a celebrity. I get nice letters asking for signed pictures, and I reply to each one. It takes time, but it's worth it. D Tomas (tennis player) It's great to feel the crowd's support when I walk on court. At the last tournament, it got a bit crazy with people crowding around. Still, I enjoy being recognized by fans when I'm out shopping. It has downsides, though. My last girlfriend didn't like the attention from female fans. Tennis players travel a lot, and that's why we broke up, I think. It was hard, but you have to make sacrifices in any sport; you must be serious and professional. It doesn't bother me much.

FCE_33,"**Young Shoppers**

Shopping in supermarkets with children can be very challenging for parents. One mother describes it as ""absolute murder"" because her children want everything they see, like sugary cereals, Disney videos, or comics. She can't afford all these things and feels guilty if she gives in to their demands, as she believes it's not good for them. However, she also feels bad for always saying no and worries that her children aren't learning how to make their own choices. 

Research shows that children ask for something every two minutes during a supermarket trip. Over Â£150 million is spent each year on advertising aimed directly at children, mostly on TV. This amount is expected to grow, and supermarkets are where this advertising is most effective. Children often don't understand why their parents can't buy everything they want, and arguments about health don't seem convincing compared to the appealing ads they see.

Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, though these ideas aren't always correct. It's good for parents and children to talk about food because if children only learn from TV ads, they get a biased view. Parents feel frustrated because they have to compete with advertisers and often end up disappointing their children.

The Independent Television Commission, which oversees TV ads, doesn't allow advertisers to tell children to ask their parents to buy things. But as Dibb notes, the goal of advertising is to persuade people to buy, so the effect is the same.

Deciding which of their children's requests to agree to or refuse can be stressful for parents. One mother says she discusses food with her children and has taught her son to be critical of ads. They now have fewer conflicts in the supermarket because her children don't ask for things she won't buy.

Parents admit they are sometimes inconsistent in their responses. Mike, a father of two, says they refuse to buy sweets for their son because they're unhealthy, yet they buy treats for themselves. He finds it hard to be consistent, as his decisions depend on his mood.

Supermarkets could help reduce conflicts by removing sweets from checkout areas or offering supervised play areas for children. Although parents might spend less without their children, the idea of shopping without their demands could attract more customers."
FCE_20,"**Five-star luxury meets modern technology**

The five-star Merrion Hotel has just opened in Dublin. It took nearly two years to convert four large eighteenth-century houses into this luxury hotel. This transformation allowed the installation of the latest technology for both staff and guests. General Manager Peter MacCann expects his staff to know guests by name, but for specific preferences, he uses the hotel's computer system. This system, which cost Â£250,000, helps treat returning guests in a special way, as expected in a five-star hotel. For example, if a guest requests certain music CDs during their first stay, those CDs will be ready for them on their next visit. This is possible due to the guest-history feature that records preferences.

Room temperature is a common complaint among hotel guests worldwide. At the Merrion, a high-tech system allows guests to adjust the temperature within three degrees of the standard 18Â°C. Additionally, the front desk can adjust each room's temperature between 14Â°C and 25Â°C. Business travelers, who are expected to make up 65% of the hotel's clientele, will appreciate the technology in their rooms. Each room includes three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that also works as a photocopier and printer, and a video-conferencing facility. To keep up with fast-changing technology, extra cables have been installed for future upgrades. Televisions are rented, not bought, so they can be easily replaced with newer models. DVD recorders can also be updated when needed.

Despite all this advanced technology, the hotel aims to make guests feel comfortable and not overwhelmed. The 145 bedrooms are large, well-furnished, and welcoming. The hotel also features a swimming pool, gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a beautiful garden. As with all luxury hotels, excellent food is essential. Chef Patrick Guilbaud, whose Dublin restaurant already had two Michelin stars, moved his business to the Merrion. This move benefits both him and the hotel.

With advanced technology and a skilled staff, the Merrion is set to succeed."
FCE_40,"Text: 'Where I get my energy Emma Marsden asked six women who live life to the fullest to share their secrets. A. Jeanette Kupfermann Journalist and author: 'I think it's excitement. I need to be doing something challenging. When I'm learning something new, I feel a lot of energy. Anything with rhythm gives me energy, too - right now, I'm learning flamenco dancing. Dance is wonderful, very expressive, and energizing. I think you can feel tired if you're bored or feel life has no purpose. Being effective in the world - even in a small way - gives you energy.' B. Linda Kelsey Magazine editor: 'I have a lot of work, but I enjoy it all - I love being at work, it's not a chore. If you enjoy something, it doesn't make you feel down even if you're tired. I need a good amount of sleep, so when I get it, I feel great. When I only get six hours of sleep a night, I feel a bit off. I know exercise gives me energy, but it's hard to find the energy to do it! I do a yoga class once a week before work and try to do a workout tape at home. But if I've exercised, my mood improves a lot. I feel very low in the office between 3 and 5 in the afternoon and think it's probably good to eat something then.' C. Annie Nightingale Disc jockey: 'I don't eat healthily to get my energy - I think it's natural enthusiasm and being positive. I really can't stand people with negative attitudes. I'm quite naive - I think we should all enjoy our lives, seize the moment. Enjoyment comes first. You have to achieve things and set goals. I enjoy what I do, and the last two years have been very exciting. In my job, there are lots of lively young people, and you can't help being affected by that. I love rushing around for work, having a busy life. I'm very sociable. I enjoy taking photos but I'm not sure if I'm good at it. I rush to get them developed and can't wait to see them. I've also started writing words for imaginary songs - it's just for fun and a good way to relax my mind when I'm traveling.' D. Floella Benjamin Author and children's TV presenter: 'My energy comes from the things I do and enjoy. I believe in what I'm doing, both at work and at home with my family, and I think being positive about life helps. That's why I love working with kids; they give so much and have a natural resilience. Energy is like a natural chemical, triggered by communicating with others - just try smiling at people and feel the thrill when they smile back. It's much better than feeling sorry for yourself. Although I try to eat healthily and don't smoke or drink, I don't have an exercise plan. The most energetic I get is running around with the kids and playing with them.' E. Deborah Moggach Author and playwright: 'What I love doing more than anything is making a garden out of a wasteland. I did that once. The garden was solid concrete - I broke up all the concrete and added lots of soil. It was better than any workout or tennis. The other thing that gives me energy is knowing someone wants to read what I'm writing - I find it hard to write without an audience. And I like sneaking into a farmer's land or a wood. If I'm caught, I say ""Oh, what a wonderful wood, I didn't know it was private,"" and so on. I like it because it's childlike.' F. Katherine Monblot Therapist: 'I believe you must have an interest in and respect for what you do in life. I like to take risks and I get bored quickly, which keeps me motivated. Doing things you don't want to do wears you out. I used to be a member of various committees and resented the demands they made on my time. You only have a certain amount of energy, so direct it into the things that are most important to you.'"
FCE_45,"**ICE SKATING**

Ice skating has been around for thousands of years. Archaeologists have found skates made from animal bones. These bone skates were used until iron was introduced in Scandinavia around 200 AD. In Scandinavia, the upper classes considered skating an important skill. In the early 1900s, skating was elegant and reserved. However, at the 1924 Winter Olympics, 11-year-old Sonja Henie brought a more athletic style, making skating more popular. Today, skating combines art and athletics, making it both graceful and physically challenging.

For beginners, balance and control are crucial, and speed comes with practice. Your body position is important for balance. Keep your legs slightly bent and knees bent to center your body weight; this means leaning slightly forward. Relaxation is very important in skating. To start, your heels should almost touch, and your feet should point outwards. Push forward with your back foot and make a small movement with the other foot. It seems simple, right? As you practice, you can gradually make longer movements.

Learning how to fall is one of the first skills a skater should learn. Even professional skaters fall. To avoid injury, try to stay relaxed when you fall, which reduces the impact. To get up, use your hands to kneel, then stand. Once you can move confidently on the ice, you can try different styles like figure skating, freestyle, distance, speed, and pair skating. The best way to start is by learning figure skating and then basic freestyle. Most ice rinks offer guidance, so you can quickly learn basic figures and then move on to turns, jumps, and spins.

If you watch good or professional skaters, you'll notice how relaxed they are and how smoothly they move. To achieve this, you should regularly practice exercises. Skating with a stiff body can be dangerous, so warm-up exercises should include those for the legs, back, and shoulders, focusing on the ankles and knees. After a long or intense session, do the same exercises to prevent stiffness.

Skating improves balance, coordination, relaxation, and movement. It benefits heart and lung health and strengthens the body. Combined with swimming or jogging, it offers a great program for overall health and fitness."

Seeing a talented child win a medal can be very emotional. Julia Gregson spoke with three young stars and their mothers about the joys and challenges in their lives.

**A. Annika Reeder, 15**

Annika won a gold medal in gymnastics at the Commonwealth Games. She dreams of becoming a physiotherapist and competing in the next Olympics. ""The work is very hard right now. I don't have time to watch TV, hang out with friends, or do much besides gym and school. I try to take training one day at a time. When I'm extremely tired, my coach sometimes gives me a day off, but usually, I just keep going. You can't take too many days off, or you get stiff.""

**B. Annika's Mother**

""Annika showed great potential from a young age. I've seen parents push their kids, and it doesn't work. To perform at Annika's level, you have to want it yourself. People often say we've sacrificed a lot, but they don't see what the sport has given us. We love it and what it's done for Annika. Before gymnastics, she was a shy girl who sucked her thumb and hid behind me. Now, she's met people worldwide and gained confidence from her success.""

**C. Sarah Stokes**

Sarah started show-jumping at ten and has won the British National Championship. ""It's good my parents like show-jumping because they train me and take me everywhere in the horse box. Shows last from one to five days. I never get tired of itâ€”I love the excitement and fun. Even without my parents, I would do it because I'm determined. I'm glad they are happy when I win, but I'm not doing it for them. My goal this year is to qualify for the British young riders (under-18) team. My big dream is to win a gold medal at the Olympics.""

**D. Sarah's Mother**

""Sarah's passion for horses started when she first sat on one at age 1. At 5, she would get up early to exercise her pony. To qualify for major shows, you have to compete all over England. To save money, we sleep in the horse box's living area. Sarah is well-organized and 100% happy on a horse. Watching your child succeed at something they love is unbeatable.""

**E. Jane McShane, 10**

Jane is Britain's Under-14 Chess Champion. ""Tournaments are really friendly. I know everyone, and it's fun. When I play, I don't concentrate much. I should, but I just look around and don't think too hard. I'm not worried about getting a big head; I don't talk about my success at school. I don't like feeling embarrassed.""

**F. Jane's Mother**

""Jane played her first chess game at 5. My father said, 'Let's see if she likes it.' He tried to teach me when I was young, but I was bored. Jane loved it from the start. By the end of that day, she knew all the moves, and by 6, she was beating adults. Of course, I'm pleased when she wins, but if she wanted to quit tomorrow, I wouldn't stop her. I don't want to discourage her because she's exceptional. If she has this gift, let her reach her potential."""
FCE_29,"Text: 'It's true - we're all getting taller. Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy after school. 'What do you want to be?' asked the teacher. 'The flagpole on a ship?' The teacher had a point because Chris, at fourteen, was already almost two metres tall. Today, at 228 cm, he is Britain's tallest man. Every decade, the average height of people in Europe increases by another centimetre. Every year, more truly tall people are born. Interestingly, this does not mean we are creating a new super race. Instead, we are returning to our ancient size. We are losing the effects of generations of poor diet, with dramatic results. 'We are only now beginning to reach our true potential,' says palaeontologist Professor Chris Stringer. 'We are becoming like the Cro-Magnons again - the people who lived 40,000 years ago.' For most of history, our ancestors got food from many sources: women gathered herbs, fruits, and berries, while men hunted animals. One study found they ate 85 different wild plants. Then, about 9,000 years ago, agriculture was invented, with serious consequences. Most green areas have been taken over by farmers, so just three carbohydrate-rich plants - wheat, rice, and maize - provide more than half of the calories we eat today. This poor diet has harmed human health and growth. Over the centuries, we have lived on soups, porridges, and breads that left us underfed. In one study in Ohio, scientists found that when people started growing corn, healthy hunter-gatherers became sickly, underweight farmers. Tooth decay and diseases increased. Corn, once thought a blessing, was a health disaster, according to some anthropologists. However, agriculture spread because farmed land could support ten times more people than hunter-gathering. The fact that most people relying on this system are poorly nourished has only recently been addressed, even by wealthier nations. Only in Europe, the US, and Japan are diets now reflecting the richness of our ancestors' diets. As a result, the average man in the US is now 179 cm, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm. It is a positive trend, though not without problems. Heights have risen, but the world has not changed much. A standard bed-length has stayed at 190 cm since 1860. Even worse, leg-room in planes and trains seems to have shrunk, while clothes manufacturers constantly revise their products. The question is: where will it end? We cannot grow forever. We must have some upper limit. But what is it? According to Robert Fogel, it could be as much as 193 cm, and we might reach it this century. However, scientists add a note of caution. Individuals may be growing taller due to better nutrition, but as a species, we are actually shrinking. During the last ice age, 10,000 years ago, humans were slightly rounder and taller - an evolutionary response to the cold. (Large, round bodies keep heat better.) Since the climate warmed, we have become thinner and smaller, even when well-fed. As the planet continues to heat up, we may shrink further. In other words, human growth could be offset by global warming.'"
FCE_57,"**Studio Audiences: What It's Like to Be in One**

Have you ever wondered what it's like to be in the audience when a TV show is being filmed? Cosmo Landesman explored this experience. Studio audiences are a regular part of TV production, yet they remain a mystery to many. When we see them excited on game shows, we often wonder: who are these people?

Studio audiences are sometimes seen as the least prestigious of all live audiences. Some people in the TV industry even look down on them, treating them poorly. I used to think that studio audiences were just people eager for a brief moment of fame. However, there is no typical studio audience. They come from all walks of life, including different classes, jobs, and income levels. TV shows try to attract various types of people for different programs.

For those of us who enjoy watching TV at home, it can be hard to understand why someone would want to watch a show in a studio. Why go through the trouble of getting tickets, traveling, and sitting for hours in an uncomfortable studio when you can watch the same show at home? One idea is that people hope to appear on TV, even if just for a moment. I didn't believe this until I met Angela, who said she came for the chance to be on TV. Another reason might be curiosity about how TV shows are made. But the most common reason I heard was simply that a friend gave them a ticket.

Most of us have never been in a studio audience, but we think we know what it's like. We imagine sitting tightly packed with strangers, following signs that tell us when to clap or laugh. This might be true for some shows, but not all. As one studio manager said, ""We always hope a show is good enough not to need these signs.""

Is there a real difference between watching a show in a studio and watching it at home? For Claire, being in a studio is ""more exciting,"" while Charlotte enjoyed feeling part of live TV. ""Last year I saw my favorite comedian. Watching him live is different from seeing him on TV at home,"" she said. Personally, I missed seeing the live actors because my view was blocked. The opening scenes were so far away that I ended up watching them on a studio screen.

Going to a studio might not be the best way to watch TV, but that's not the point. For most people in the audience, it was simply a fun and free night out."

**Bruce**  
I don't like landscapes that are completely wild. I find the human touch important. It's the same when I travel abroad. I am attracted to lovely villages with old temples, not empty deserts. When I was eight, I went to school in England. On Saturdays, I would cycle to the village of Lastingham in its beautiful valley. Cycling was a way to escape school. I loved exploring the bleak hilltops, the sheltered valleys, and old villages. Coming from Scotland, I found the landscape familiar yet different, and I still visit today. I used to write about my adventures in my private diary. In a way, that was my first attempt at travel writing, which later became my career.

**Sophia**  
There is a miniature railway from Hythe to Dungeness, run by amateurs. I always travel first class as it doesn't cost much more than the regular fare. The scenery is not spectacular. The train moves across Romney Marsh with its sheep and alongside a canal. But there is one part of the journey I always look forward to - when our miniature world takes a detour through back gardens. For a few moments, we passengers see people at random points in their day, making a cup of tea, doing the washing up, unfolding a deckchair. I see myself in their eyes, a woman in a tiny train carriage, looking into other people's homes. It's the ordinariness of the landscape that attracts me. Just fields, sheep, and a distant grey sea. That makes me look more closely, to search for something that opens my eyes.

**Matthew**  
The Hartland Peninsula is a remote and beautiful coast. The beaches are hard to reach and scattered with rocks, so there are not many crowds here. They attract a few brave surfers, but most visitors prefer to reflect on the majesty of the sea. The coast, which faces the Atlantic, is known for shipwrecks. There are coast walks you can combine with trips inland up beautiful damp valleys, full of oak trees, ferns, and wildflowers. We stay in modest self-catering accommodation with a family who have some property in the village of Southole.

**Annette**  
My favourite place in England is the Trough of Bowland, a landscape of wide-open moorland perfect for hiking. There are not many residents and not many visitors either. It's an unknown corner, empty and remote, and I like the feeling of space. I discovered the area by chance when I was a student, and since then I've made an annual visit, either alone, with my boyfriend, or now with my son. It has changed little since my first visit. Having a child makes these visits more special. It makes me sad that he's growing up in an urban environment.

**James**  
I bought Glenthorne, my favourite house in Britain. It was about finding pure peace and reconnecting with my English roots and coming home. I grew up in what is now known as Sri Lanka, but at twelve, I went to school in Devon, in the west of England. I used to cycle around the moors and village backstreets. We had a story about a place we would never cycle past: if you went down the driveway, you'd never return. That place was Glenthorne. It's the place of my dreams. It's a magical, secluded, romantic house. You can't hear anything except the sea, wind, and birds."
FCE_42,"**HAPPY HUNTING GROUND**

We are a family that loves animals and enjoys being around them. One afternoon, my daughter called me at work, excited because she had found a pine snake. ""Can we keep him?"" she asked. I agreed, but only for one night. We had a special tank for temporary animal guests, and one night was enough to admire them and check our natural history book.

I got home late and started cooking when I heard screams from my sons' bedroom: ""Oh, Mother! Help! Do something!"" I rushed in to find Domino, our cat, with Bianca, a white mouse given to me as a Mother's Day gift, in his mouth. Domino was running around the room, trying to escape with his catch, while the kids waved their arms to stop him. I jumped into the chaos and tripped, landing on the floor. As I considered how to stop Domino, I noticed the snake escaping from its tank.

The room was a mess of cat, mouse, kids, and snake, with the dog barking loudly. I quickly turned off the boiling pot in the kitchen and returned to the chaos. I managed to grab Domino by the tail and rescued the mouse, which was unharmed. Interestingly, this mouse was caught by Domino three more times but lived to old age.

Feeling confident, I turned my attention to the snake. It was not easy to handle, but I sat on the floor like a snake-charmer, trying to calm it. Eventually, the snake relaxed, and I carefully lifted it. I took it to the end of the garden, hoping it would choose to live in the garden shed. When I released its head, expecting it to attack, it instead wrapped around my shoulders like a shawl, seeming comfortable.

We stood there, my four children, the snake, and I, in the evening light. My eldest, DJ, explained, ""You know what it is, Mum? You're nice and warm, and the shed isn't."" We gently encouraged the snake to move on, and it slowly climbed up the wall and disappeared over the roof. As the last bit of its tail vanished, my three-year-old, Clay, summed it up for all of us: ""Boy, that was one big snake!"""
FCE_59,"Text: 'Drop me a line! In our fast world of phones, fax machines, and computers, the old-fashioned art of letter writing is at risk of disappearing. Yet, for me, receiving a letter is special in a way that no other form of communication can match. There is the excitement of its arrival, the pleasure of seeing who it is from, and the enjoyment of reading it. Letter writing has been part of my life for as long as I can remember. It probably started with the little notes I would write to my mother. My mother also insisted I write my own thank-you letters for Christmas and birthday presents. It didn't matter how short or untidy they were, as long as they were letters. When I left home at 18 to study medicine in London, I would write once a week, and so would my mother. Occasionally, my father would write, and it was always a joy to receive his long, amusing letters. Most of the letters from home were about everyday events concerning my parents and their friends. Of course, we also made phone calls, but it is the letters I remember most. There were also letters from my boyfriends. In my youth, I seemed to attract people who had to work or study away, and I could only stay in touch by writing. But instead of harming the relationships, letter writing seemed to improve them. I found that I could often express myself more easily in writing than by talking. I love the letters that come with birthday or Christmas cards. Notes are appreciated, but how much better to have a year's supply of news! And it's even better when it's an airmail envelope with beautiful stamps. My overseas letters arrive from Mangala in Sri Lanka, from someone I trained with over 20 years ago, and I have a penfriend in Australia and another in Vancouver. Then there's the lady who writes to me from France. If we hadn't started talking in a restaurant on the way home from holiday, if my husband hadn't taken her photo, and if I hadn't asked her for her address, I would never have been able to write to her. More importantly, if she hadn't replied, we would be poorer for it. As it is, we now have a regular correspondence. I can improve my French (she speaks no English); we have stayed at her home twice, and she has stayed with us. My biggest letter-writing success, however, came this summer when my family and I stayed with my American penfriend in Texas. We had been corresponding for 29 years but had never met. Everyone was amazed that a correspondence could last so long. The local press even considered it worth reporting on the front page. I am pleased that my children are continuing the tradition. Like my mother before me, I insist they write their own thank-you letters. My daughter writes me little letters, just as I did to my mother. She and my son have penfriends of their own in Texas, organized by my penfriend. I strongly urge readers not to let letter writing become another 'lost art'. '"
FCE_54,"**Careless Tourists Damage Ancient Alpine Rock Art**

Tens of thousands of ancient pictures carved into rocks at one of France's most important tourist sites are being gradually destroyed. Scientists and researchers are worried that the 36,000 drawings on rocks in Mont Bego in the French Alps are being damaged so quickly that they might not survive for future generations. The mountain, once a place for prayer and worship, has 4,000-year-old drawings cut into bare rock. These include pictures of cows with horns, cultivated fields, and various gods and goddesses. However, as more people visit the site, the pictures are being ruined by careless graffiti.

Jean Clottes, chairman of the International Committee on Rock Art, says, ""People think that because the pictures have been there so long, they will always be there. But if the damage continues at this rate, there will be nothing left in 50 years."" He has seen tourists stepping on the drawings, wearing away the rock and the artwork. Some visitors even take parts of the rock home as souvenirs. ""When people can't take a good enough photograph, they rub the drawings to get a clearer picture,"" he said. ""The drawings are polished by the weather, and if the sun is shining and visitors can't see them properly, they simply rub and scrape them to make them look fresher.""

Other researchers describe how people arrive with long sticks with sharp ends to scratch their own drawings or even their names into the rocks. But experts disagree on the best way to preserve the drawings. Henry de Lumley, director of the Museum of Natural History in Paris, believes the only way to save the site is to make the whole mountain a 'no-go' area, allowing the public to visit only on guided tours. Otherwise, he says, the site will be completely destroyed, and important research work will be reduced.

Clottes disagrees. ""The measure proposed by Henry de Lumley is the most severe, and while it is the most effective, it is also certain to bring about protests from people who live there,"" he said. ""The site was classified as a historic monument years ago by the Ministry of Culture, and we must do as much as possible to save what is there.""

David Lavergne, the regional architect, also wants to avoid closing the site. ""Henry de Lumley's idea isn't ideal,"" he said. ""Our department feels that the best solution is to let people look at the site, but because the area is very big, it is difficult to prevent visitors from damaging it. I would prefer that everyone was able to look at it, but the main problem is financial. We do not have the funds to employ the necessary number of guards. We may have to consider charging a fee. There seems to be no prospect of government funding.""

In Nice, Annie Echassoux, who also worked on researching the site, is worried that as the mountain becomes easier to reachâ€”tourists can now avoid the three-and-a-half-hour walk by hiring vehiclesâ€”the damage will increase rapidly. She thinks the only solution is to rope off the area and provide guides. ""You can't say the plan can't go ahead because there is no money,"" she said. ""That is not good enough. Money must be provided because the Ministry of Culture has classified this area as a historic site. If we don't take steps, we will be responsible for losing the drawings for the next generation."""
FCE_32,"**Young Shoppers**

Shopping in supermarkets with children can be very difficult for parents. One mother says, ""They want everything they see. If it's not the latest sugary breakfast cereal, it's a Disney video or a comic. Usually all three. I can't afford all this stuff, and if I give in, I feel guilty for buying unhealthy things. But I also feel bad for saying no all the time, and I get stressed even before we leave home. I try not to take them shopping, but then I worry they won't learn how to make their own choices. I can't win.""

Research shows that children ask for something every two minutes during a supermarket trip. More than Â£150 million a year is spent on advertising aimed directly at children, mostly on TV. This amount is likely to grow, and supermarkets are where this advertising works best. Children often don't understand why their parents say no to buying things, and arguments about health don't seem convincing compared to the attractive ads.

Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says, ""Most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, though these ideas aren't always right. It's good for parents and children to talk about food because if children only learn from TV ads, they get a one-sided view. Parents don't like competing with advertisers and having to disappoint their children.""

The Independent Television Commission, which controls TV ads, doesn't allow advertisers to tell children to ask their parents to buy things. But as Dibb points out, ""The goal of advertising is to make people want to buy something. So even if they can't say, 'Tell your mum to buy this,' that's still the effect they want.""

A big stress for parents shopping with children is deciding which requests to agree to and which to refuse. One mother says she talks a lot with her children about food and ads, so they don't ask for things she won't buy. Parents also admit they are not always consistent. Mike, a father of two, says, ""We say no to sweets because they're bad for him, but we buy chocolate for ourselves. It's nice to buy treats, and it's normal for children to want them too. But I still get annoyed by their demands. It depends on my mood. If I'm feeling good, I'm more likely to say yes. It's hard to be consistent.""

Supermarkets could help reduce conflicts by removing sweets from checkout areas or offering play areas for children. Even if parents spend less because their children aren't with them, the idea of shopping without a child's demands might attract more customers."
FCE_65,"**Going up the wall**

In the past, climbers went to mountains. Now, challenging climbs can happen anywhere, indoors or outdoors. The crowd is silent. High above them on the climbing wall, hanging upside down by two fingers, is French climber Francois Lombard. He is competing in the World Cup Climbing Championships at Birmingham's National Indoor Arena. This arena is more famous for the TV show Gladiators, but both events have one thing in common - The Wall. The possibility of these events is due to new and fast-developing technology.

Before the mid-1960s, climbers practiced on cliffs where there were many good climbing spots. In winter, they either braved the cold, went walking, or climbed on snow and ice in Scotland. As the sport grew, it became important for top climbers to stay fit. With cliffs unusable for much of the year, they used brick edges or stone buildings to train. This helped them keep their fingers strong and avoid boredom from not climbing.

Soon, many sports centers started building walls specifically for climbing, using bricks with special edges to grip. Many of these early walls followed the example of Don Robinson, a physical education teacher who, in the mid-1960s, built a climbing wall in a corridor at Leeds University. Robinson had the idea of setting natural rock in concrete blocks, which could be part of a wall. Many climbing walls like this were built in sports halls across the country in the 1970s, but they had design problems. Walls could only be vertical, while real cliffs have features like overhangs and angled slabs. Another issue was that once built, the walls couldn't be changed, and climbers would get bored with the same holds.

In 1985, a Frenchman, Francois Savigny, created a material that he shaped into forms like those on cliffs. These could be attached to any wall and removed when climbers wanted a new challenge. French manufacturers also started experimenting with panels on a steel framework. Concrete was too heavy for overhanging walls without major construction, but steel frames could be set up anywhere as free-standing structures. A system of interchangeable fixtures gave climbers endless new holds."
FCE_61,"Text: 'So you want to be an actor? If you tell someone that you want to be an actor, they will probably say it's 'risky' very quickly. And acting is indeed a risky career. There are more actors than there are jobs for them. When you decide to become an actor, some people you thought were your friends might say you're crazy, but others might react differently. Everyone will give you different advice. But it's a personal choice, and only you can be responsible for achieving your dream. There are no easy paths - no exams to pass, and no guarantee that after your training, you will succeed in the profession. It's all about luck and talent. However, there is a need for new faces and talent, and there is always the chance of excitement, glamour, and sometimes big rewards. People often ask me to define talent, which everyone is looking for. I think it's natural skill plus imagination - imagination is the hardest to judge. It also involves courage and belief in what you are doing and how you present it. Why do people want to act? It's often hard to explain why you want to act. In theatre, the important thing is the moment of connection between the actor and the audience. This connection is central to all acting and motivates actors. If you ask actors how they succeeded, they might just shrug. They don't know. They know some things about themselves and their techniques, but they take nothing for granted because they know they are only as good as their current job, and their fame might not last. Disappointment is the actor's biggest enemy. Last month you might have been out of work, selling clothes or waitressing. Suddenly you get an audition, but even if you want the job badly, you might not get it. So actors often don't talk about their chances. They find ways to protect themselves from the stress of competing for a role and the possibility of rejection. Nobody likes being rejected. And remember, the possibility of rejection is there from the moment you start auditioning professionally. You are saying you are available, willing, and hopefully talented enough for the job. And, in many ways, it's up to you, because if you don't care enough, no one else will care for you.'"

FCE_28,"Text: 'It's true - we're all getting taller Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy after school. 'What do you want to be?' asked the teacher. 'The flagpole on a ship?' The teacher had a point because Chris, at fourteen, was already almost two metres tall. Today, at 228 cm, he is Britain's tallest man. Every decade, the average height of people in Europe increases by another centimetre. Each year, more very tall people are born. Interestingly, this doesn't mean we are creating a new super race. Instead, we are returning to our ancient size. We are losing the effects of generations of poor diet, with significant results. 'We are only now beginning to reach our true potential,' says palaeontologist Professor Chris Stringer. 'We are becoming like the Cro-Magnons again - the people who lived 40,000 years ago.' For most of history, our ancestors ate a wide variety of foods: women gathered herbs, fruits, and berries, while men hunted animals. One study found they ate 85 different wild plants. Then, about 9,000 years ago, agriculture was invented, with serious consequences. Most green areas have been taken over by farming, so now just three carbohydrate-rich plants - wheat, rice, and maize - provide more than half of the calories we eat today. This poor diet has harmed human health and growth. Over the centuries, we have eaten soups, porridges, and breads that left us underfed and underdeveloped. In one study in Ohio, scientists found that when people started growing corn, healthy hunter-gatherers became sickly, underweight farmers. Tooth decay and diseases increased. Corn, once thought a blessing, was a public health disaster, according to some anthropologists. However, agriculture spread because farmed land could support ten times more people than hunter-gathering. The fact that most people relying on this system are poorly nourished and stunted has only recently been addressed, even by wealthier nations. Only in Europe, the US, and Japan are diets now reflecting the richness of our ancestors' diets. As a result, the average man in the US is now 179 cm, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm. This is a positive trend, but it has its own problems. Heights have increased, but the world hasn't changed much. A standard bed-length has stayed at 190 cm since 1860. Even worse, leg-room in planes and trains seems to have decreased, while clothing manufacturers constantly update their product ranges. The question is: where will it all end? We cannot grow forever. There must be a natural upper limit. But what is it? According to Robert Fogel, from the University, it could be as much as 193 cm, and we might reach it this century. However, scientists add a note of caution. Individuals may be growing taller due to better nutrition, but as a species, we are actually shrinking. During the last ice age, 10,000 years ago, humans were slightly rounder and taller - an evolutionary response to the cold. (Large, round bodies retain heat better.) Since the climate warmed, we have become slightly thinner and smaller, even when well-fed. As the planet continues to warm, we may shrink even more. In other words, human growth could be offset by global warming.'"

**The Farmer**

Matt Froggatt used to work as an insurance agent in London, but now he runs a sheep farm. ""After 14 years in business, the City became less exciting and more of a grind. I hadn't planned to leave for another five or ten years, but then I was made redundant unexpectedly. The pay-off wasn't great, but it was enough to start the farm. My big break came when I met the head chef of a local hotel with one of the top 20 hotel restaurants in the country. By supplying them, my reputation grew, and now I also sell meat by mail order. I'm glad I'm not stuck in an office anymore, but it's surprising how little has changed: I still work 80- to 90-hour weeks and sell a product.""

**The Painter**

Ron Ablewhite was a manager in advertising but now earns a living as an artist. ""Painting started as a hobby, but I found it more exciting than my job. Taking redundancy to become an artist seemed logical. The career counsellor I spoke to was surprised when I said, 'I don't want to go back to where I've been.' Most people in their mid-forties need to return to work quickly for financial reasons. But we married young, and our children didn't need our support. Moving to the north of England was a leap into the unknown. We left our friends, but our friendships have survived the distance, and many visit us now.""

**The Hatmaker**

After five years as a company lawyer, Katherine Goodison started her own business in her London flat, making hats for private clients. ""Being a lawyer was fun and well-paid, but the hours were terrible. I didn't want to become a senior partner and work even more, so I left. Some people thought I'd get bored, but that hasn't happened. The secret is having deadlines. In fashion, there are always collections and seasons, so you need a strict schedule. I'm happier and less stressed now. I do miss social interactions with colleagues, though. What I love about this job is being fully responsible for the product. If I do a bad job, it's on me. You care more when your name is on the promotional material.""

**The Masseur**

Paul Drinkwater worked in finance for 16 years before becoming a masseur at the Life Centre in London. ""I started in financial markets at 22, setting up deals. I liked the adrenaline but never found the work rewarding. I almost got made redundant in 1989, but I resigned and traveled for a year instead. During that year, I tried to figure out what I wanted to do. I was interested in health, so I visited top gymnasiums and talked to the owners. I knew I needed qualifications to change careers, so I took massage courses. Then I got part-time work at the Life Centre. I have no regrets. I used to feel out of control, but now I have peace of mind and control over my future. That's the best part."""
FCE_5,"**Onto a Winner**

Two brothers are discovering that a childhood game is great for business. Dave and Norm Lagasse, two brothers in their forties with bushy beards, are in their simple home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA, remembering their childhood. In front of them is a wooden board with round plastic pieces. They are playing the old game of pichenotte, which they say is unique. Their grandfather, Lucien Rajotte, a grocer from Quebec, Canada, brought the game to the USA and introduced it to his family. Soon, the family played the game almost every weekend and holiday, and as Dave says, they were 'having the best time ever'. Eventually, the family moved to New Mexico. But they didn't forget Grandpa's pichenotte board, made from old wooden food crates, and continued to play often. Visitors were often intrigued because the game was unknown in southern USA. 

Three years ago, Dave noticed the old pichenotte board was cracked and worn, so he decided to make a new one. It turned out beautifully. A relative saw it and wanted one, then a friend wanted another. Curious about the interest, the brothers took one of Dave's new boards to a sports bar in Santa Fe. 'People started to watch,' says Dave, 'and say, ""No way I'm playing that silly game."" Then they'd sit down, and soon you couldn't get them up from the table!' When people asked about the game's origins, Dave researched and found its roots were likely in India, where a similar game called 'carroms' exists. It was adapted into a game called 'squails' in Britain, and British emigrants brought it to Canada a century ago. Pichenotte is the French-Canadian version that developed in Quebec.

Pichenotte, played by two to four people, is a game of skill. Each player gets 12 pieces or 'pucks'. These are 'flicked' across a wheel-like board using the middle or index finger. Flicking a puck into a small hole scores 20 points. Three rings around the hole are worth 15, 10, and 5 points. Eight tiny posts are obstacles. The game usually lasts two minutes. Seeing its popularity at the Santa Fe bar, the Lagasses made more boards and took them to markets and craft fairs. Crowds gathered, money was exchanged, and the game's popularity grew. Championships began, and a trophy called the 'Lord Pichenotte Cup' was created. As word spread, the boards sold quickly. The brothers decided to make pichenotte their full-time business. They set up a workshop in their garage and started producing boards. Over 450 have been made so far. Made of birchwood and mahogany, each board weighs 12kg and is 1cm thick. Norm explains, 'They're very durable, as they have to stand up to lots of wear.' They sell for $595 each on the brothers' website. There are no professional pichenotte players or TV coverage yet, but the brothers hope their garage will one day house a luxury car instead of tools and wood. Until then, they enjoy playing the game they believe will bring them success."
FCE_41,"**WELCOME TO THE MODEL VILLAGE**

When you first enter the Model Village, it's hard to believe that just a few years ago, this was a piece of waste ground, flat and covered with brambles. For years, it was seen as useless land. The careful planning and hard work of one man, with constant support from his wife, transformed this land into the masterpiece you see today. Many thousands of tons of soil and clay were moved to change the flat site into the sculptured landscape you see now. Although bulldozers and digging machines helped, it also required a lot of hard work. Once shaped, about 1,000 tonnes of topsoil were brought in to create the lawns, flower-beds, and rockeries.

In creating the Model Village, hundreds of trees and shrubs were planted. These had to be carefully chosen for the area. Only plants that could handle the salty air near the sea and the strong winter winds could be used. Most plants came from local garden centers, but some came from as far as Canada and New Zealand.

The whole village was designed by Colin Sims, and the models, over 100, were individually made by him over nine years since the village first opened in 1972. The models are made from various materialsâ€”stone, concrete, specially treated wood, and plasticsâ€”to withstand all kinds of weather. Initially, Colin needed help from experts to understand how different materials would last in changing weather, but he soon became an expert himself. You will notice that a constant scale has been strictly followed, and even the smallest details on the models have been carefully made. This was achieved through patience and unique construction techniques.

The Model Village has become a very popular attraction, known for its high standard of workmanship and maintenance. The techniques used here have been used in other model villages around England and are even taught in some college courses on modeling. All the model buildings in the village show traditional British architectural styles and are not based on one specific place or structure. One of the most impressive buildings is the Manor House, a typical 13th-century stone structure with a brick tower and stone walls, based on the style of manor houses in the West Country. As you walk around the village, you will also see the Castle, St Mary's Church, a zoo, and a mini golf course, the latest addition to the village.

We ask you to stay on the paths during your visit and not to touch any of the models; a slip can mean hours of repair work for us. Photography is allowed from the pathways only. Dogs are welcome on a short lead. To enhance your enjoyment, you will find buttons in front of some working models. Press these to make the models operate. At the end of your visit, we welcome any comments you might have. New models are always being planned, and your ideas can help us create a more varied and interesting display. We also want to know if any models are not up to the standard of the rest of the village. We are continually updating the models and need to know which ones need attention. We hope you enjoy your visit and look forward to seeing you again. Don't forget to tell your friends about it."
FCE_69,"Week after week, British tabloid newspapers publish pictures that invade people's privacy and break the editors' code of practice. Although pop stars sometimes pose for paparazzi, this is not common. Usually, these photos cause great harm to public figures when their private moments appear on the front page. However, very few people use the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), an organization set up to handle such issues. These pictures rarely serve the public interest. Do intimate photos of pop stars help solve crimes? How did a picture of a famous actress on a hotel balcony protect public health and safety? The actress has previously complained about long-lens photos, and since she was in a hotel, where there is a 'reasonable expectation of privacy', she had a good reason to complain, but she didn't take any action. It is scandalous that the PCC did not investigate on its own. It should also look into the recent outrageous story about a pop star's love life. Like the actress, the pop star has not made a formal complaint. Shouldn't the PCC take the lead on these and other shameful attacks? Initially, this seems like a good idea. It would likely result in many decisions against newspapers, reported by their rivals and broadcast on TV and radio. The public would not support the newspapers, and editors would have to stop publishing such material. Even photographers would be affected, as it would no longer be financially viable to wait for unsuspecting celebrities. If the PCC decided to act as a 'police officer', which it technically could, there would be several challenges. How would it decide to start an inquiry? Should it encourage the victim to complain? And if the person still refused, should it continue anyway? Additionally, celebrities and royalty might expect every story about them to be investigated and be upset if it wasn't. Above all, the role is too large. How could the PCC realistically monitor all of the British press: national, regional, and magazines? Then there is the embarrassment factor. No matter how seriously someone's privacy has been invaded, would they want the further embarrassment of an investigation? Most people likely want to move on with their lives. Some may have other reasons for staying quiet. A worse story might exist that they have kept from the press, and they fear it could become public if they complain. In other words, even the PCC might become the enemy. A British comedian also suffered when he and his wife were secretly photographed on their honeymoon in the Caribbean. He didn't complain then, nor more recently, when his family was photographed during a holiday. He feared that the newspaper, News of the World, would re-run the pictures with a new story about his 'fury', claiming it was just a bit of fun and that, as a comedian, he should have a sense of humor. This fear is understandable. People believe they will become targets again if they challenge the tabloids. It is hard to find an easy solution to this serious problem."
FCE_38,"Text: 'There is a lot of advice for college graduates starting their first job. In this article, we will talk about moving to a second job. We are not talking about those looking for a second temporary job while searching for a permanent one. Nor are we talking about those leaving a bad job in the first few weeks. Instead, we will focus on those of you taking a real step in your career, choosing a job that matches your goals now that you have some experience, skills, and an idea of where you want to go. What kind of job should you look for? It depends on your long-term goals. You need to ask yourself if you want to specialize in a certain area, move up to higher responsibility, or change to a different field. Whatever you decide, choose your second job carefully. Plan to stay in it for two to three years. This job will be important when you apply for your next job. It should show that you are serious about your career. Most importantly, it should help you grow and give you more responsibility. By the way, if you want to travel, now is the time to do it. You can do temporary work when you return, and then get your second job. Future employers will be glad to see that you have traveled and are not likely to leave again. Juliette Davidson spent her first year after leaving St. Aldate's College working for three lawyers. It was a perfect first job because 'OK ... they were very supportive. I learned about office work and improved my word processing skills. However, there was no room for growth. One day I quit, bought a plane ticket, and traveled for a year.' Juliette now works as a Personal Assistant to Brenda Cleverdon, the Chief Executive of Business in the Community. 'In two and a half years I have become more capable and my job has really grown,' she says. 'From the start, my boss wanted to help me develop. My job title is the same as when I started, but my duties have changed. From mostly typing and phone work, I now handle most of the correspondence and budgets. I also deal with various questions, from chairmen of large companies to people wanting to start their own business. Brenda involves me in all her work and gives me specific projects and events to organize.'"
FCE_17,"Confident people: what's their secret? Confident people might seem like they were born that way, but most will say it's a skill they learned because they needed to. Nina Hathway asks five people how they became confident.

A Jenny: When I left school, I was very shy and thought I would always be that way. At twenty-five, I was asked to help at my daughter's school. I didn't think I could do it, but I surprised myself by doing well. Someone there suggested I take a university course. I was very nervous on my first day, but my confidence grew, and I became more outgoing. Working at the school was a turning point in my life.

B Michaela: It started four years ago when my father got sick, and I had to take over the family business. I was scared and became too aggressive and impatient. I thought that's how confident people acted, but I learned otherwise. To be confident, you have to believe in yourself. If work gets too demanding, I don't feel guilty about leaving some tasks for the next day. When faced with something difficult, I remind myself I have nothing to lose. Fear makes you lack confidence, so I talk to myself to set aside those fears.

C Lisa: People think I'm very confident, but the calmer I look, the more terrified I am. I had to learn to look confident because it's important in TV. Interviewing people helped me see that most of us get tense in important situations, and we feel calmer when we talk to someone friendly. The best advice I got was from my mother when I worried about wearing the right clothes. She said, 'Who's looking at you? Everyone's too busy worrying about themselves.' I also think you gain confidence by facing things that scare you. I was nervous for my driving test, but I passed. After that, I felt I would never be that frightened again.

D Barbara: My confidence comes from enjoying my work, but it's something I've built over the years. If you keep going and learn from mistakes, you're more confident next time. I work hard and am popular in the restaurant, but maybe one out of ten people doesn't like me. I don't let that bother me. You have to like yourself for who you are, not try to be what others expect. My company offers training courses, which have built my self-esteem. They also encourage setting manageable goals. It helps to achieve something tangible rather than aiming too high and ending up with nothing.

E Kim: After college, I worked as a secretary and would sit in meetings, not always agreeing but too scared to speak up. Eventually, I found the confidence to make my point. When I first worked in politics, I had never spoken in public and would shake with nerves. I told myself, 'Don't be silly. People do this every day, so you can too.' I found it helpful to jot down notes, like a comfort blanket. I don't think anyone isn't a little nervous about public speaking. The real secret of confidence is telling yourself, 'Nothing is impossible.'"
FCE_47,"**Visit to Malaysia**

Paul Forster attends a kite-flying festival and spends a night in the forest. Adnan Ali smiled as I gave him his torn kite. ""You should keep it,"" he said. ""It's a traditionâ€”if the line breaks, finders are keepers. Besides, I have many more."" He pointed to a pile of beautifully decorated kites at his feet. Each kite was exactly 120 cm wide and long, made of tissue paper and split bamboo. We sat next to them under the shade of the trees behind the Beach of the Seven Lagoons in Kelantan, looking at Malaysia's biggest kite festival. In the center of the beach were 10 platforms where helpers held up the kites. A row of competitors, holding their kite lines, waited for the countdown. When the whistle blew, the crowd cheered, and the kites soared into the sky like rockets. Over 500 men and boys had registered for the competition, which lasts five days each year. Each participant entered four different kite designs, judged on decoration, stability, and flying efficiency. ""Flying kites isn't hard,"" said Adnan, ""but making them requires real skill. Visit me at home, and I'll show you how it's done."" I accepted his invitation, one of five I received that day. At his house, I drank cold milky tea and ate fish crackers in a large room. As night approached, he invited me to return the next day to help rebuild his kite, but my plans didn't allow it. Instead, I explored the southern part of the state, driving towards Kuala Lumpur into mountains covered with lush rainforest. I took a wrong turn, and the road ended at a river. A boat was there to ferry people across. Nearby, a small sign caught my attention. It pointed up a path into the forest and read: ""Jelawang Jungle 3 km."" It would have been helpful to know that most of this distance was uphill, steep, and slippery. When I reached the track, I found a man with a flask of tea. This was Baba, who managed a tented kitchen and several bamboo huts. I decided to stay, trying not to think about insects under my thin mattress. The night was completely dark, filled with various sounds. A waterfall roared nearby, and many creatures moved and squeaked. In the morning, there was a stunning view of five ranges of green mountains. In the afternoon, it rained. First, the wind, then lightning hit the treetops. Moments later, I was soaked. Sliding downhill, I wondered how the large butterflies avoided the heavy raindrops. I also worried about my car being swept away (it sometimes happens) and the risk of drowning if I opened my mouth. Luckily, the car was still there, covered in mud, at the bottom of the track. In Kota Bahru, Kelantan's capital, people asked me questions: ""Where are you from?"" ""How old are you?"" But they were very friendly. Kelantan might be famous for its kites, but I remember it more for its kindness."
FCE_48,"**What kind of shopper are you?**

Everyone shops, whether they like it or not. But people shop in different ways. Do you know what type of shopper you are? Abby Edwards asked some people ...

**A. Melanie, 22, dancer**

I'm a shopping addictâ€”I can't spend enough money! When I have cash, I'm out shopping, and it keeps me happy. I find it hard to ignore sale signs. My boyfriend is just like me, so we often shop together. We're an addicted couple!

**B. Brenda, 40, office manager**

I'm a reluctant shopper. My husband does most of the food shopping because he cooks and knows what he wants. I don't spend much time shopping for clothes. I take my 6-year-old son and 14-year-old daughter to buy clothes, but I don't enjoy it because we all have different tastes. I don't spend money on myself often, so when I do, I feel guilty and rarely tell my husband the real amountâ€”I always say I spent less! The real price always sounds too high.

**C. Juliet, 28, personnel manager**

I only shop for essentials. I hate shopping and only go when I must. When I do, I know what I want and won't settle for anything else. I find shopping tiring and there's always something else I'd rather do.

**D. Anita, 35, TV producer**

I like to look around sometimes, but I usually know what I want and where to find it. I don't waste time and get in and out quickly. I do have some mistakes hidden in my wardrobe, so maybe I'm a careful shopper who sometimes makes wrong choices!

**E. Lizzie, 41, secretary**

I don't enjoy shopping at all. I really dislike shopping for clothes because I can never find what I want or anyone to help me. The shops are too noisy, everything is messy, and I find it a nightmare. Luckily, I rarely have to shop for clothes because most of my clothes are given to me. For food shopping, I go to the local supermarket once a week and finish it quickly!

**F. Lisa, 22, actress**

I'm probably a happy shopper. Sometimes I go out to look around the shops with my friends, and we often end up buying things. I don't usually have a specific item in mind, but if something catches my eye, I'll buy it.

**G. Suki, 26, art gallery assistant**

I'm a careful shopperâ€”I like going, but I don't buy much. I usually know what I want and rarely go overboard. Sometimes I shop to cheer myself up, but I often feel worse because I've spent too much!

**H. Ann-Marie, 29, nursery worker**

I love shopping, but only on certain days and never on a Saturday because it's too busy. I'd say I'm a careful shopper. I always have a good idea of what I want, and I never buy things immediately. I have to check other shops in case I find a better dealâ€”it takes me ages!

**I. Linda, 32, restaurant manager**

I'm an unwilling shopperâ€”maybe because I work in the city center, the shops have lost their appeal for me. When I have to shop, I'll drag myself out, but I don't try things on because it's too much trouble. Clothes I buy don't always fit, but I don't mind too much. I'd rather make a few mistakes than spend a lot of effort shopping!"

During the Easter holidays, young visitors can join a quiz about ""Surprises."" The quiz sheets are free and can be picked up at the Orange Street entrance. Children will be guided to 14 surprising paintings and asked questions about them. The quiz is available during normal gallery hours from 25 March to 9 April.

**New Picture**

The Gallery now has a beautiful still life by the Dutch 18th-century painter Jan van Os. This large painting (89.1 cm x 71 cm) of flowers and fruit is painted in light, bright colors on wood. It is one of the first of its kind in the Gallery. The painting is signed and dated 1777 and 1778. It is common for such paintings to have two dates because the artist waited for different flowers to bloom in their seasons to paint them. This picture was generously donated to the Gallery by Miss Violet Churchman in memory of her sister Ida Nancy. It is now on display in Room 25.

**Special Exhibition**

The exhibition ""Painting in Spain during the late 18th century"" opened in the Sunley Room on 15 March. The Gallery recently acquired works by three Spanish painters from this period: Paret, Melendez, and Francisco Bayeu, who are the main focus of the exhibition. They are joined by Francisco's brother Ramon, Antonio Gonzalez, and two Italians who worked in Spain during these years - Corrado Giaquinto and Giovanni Battista Tiepolo. The exhibition runs until 31 May.

**Lecture News**

The series of lectures related to the special exhibition continues every Wednesday. On 5 April, Lizzie Barker will discuss the work of Melendez. On 12 April, Sarah Symmons will lecture on Luis Paret. On 19 and 26 April, Juliet Wilson will talk about Francisco Bayeu. On Tuesdays in April, Erika Langmuir will explain how artists often ""tell a story"" through their pictures.

Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, although the kitchen isn't always as tidy when they're cooking! As adults, we're always learning more about food.

Millions of people of all ages enjoy a hobby that is both interesting and fun. Every year, more people start their own stamp collection and find an interest that can last a lifetime. Starting your collection is easy because stamps are everywhere. Holiday postcards from friends, birthday cards from aunts, and letters from pen pals can all give you stamps from around the world.

Once you start collecting seriously, you might want to join the Stamp Collectors' Club. This club helps collectors get new British stamps. As a member, you can order special sets of new stamps for your collection. You can receive these in three ways: we can send you a complete set of stamps on an envelope addressed to you, send the same stamps in a colorful information pack with interesting facts, or send you the individual stamps to arrange in your own special book.

The Stamp Collectors' Club has about 70,000 members, and you could become one too. A two-year membership costs just Â£5, and there is a discount if a group joins together. This is great value for money. When you join, the Club sends you a Starter Pack at no extra cost. This includes 100 stamps to start your collection and an attractive box to keep them in. You also get a helpful 4-page guide to collecting, with more suggestions on how to add to your collection and useful addresses of shops and businesses that sell stamps.

Every two months, you'll receive a copy of the club magazine. It is full of competitions and quizzes and gives you the chance to exchange stamps with members around the world. Why not start an adventure that will give you years of pleasure? You'll spend many happy hours looking at the amazing variety of stamps in your collection or searching for unusual ones that are out there waiting to be found.

PET_21,"Text: 'MONEY What is money? The pound, the dollar, or the franc are like units of measurement, such as a gram or a kilometre. The difference is that you can use money to buy things. For example, a five-pound note can buy a book, a big bag of sweets, or a couple of cinema tickets. However, the note itself is just a piece of paper that costs very little to produce. Thousands of years ago, people didn't have money like we do today. There were no banks or shops. Back then, Mr Green the farmer would trade the corn he grew for Mr Hive's honey. This was a direct exchange between two people, each having something the other wanted. Over time, most societies created their own 'currencies' to make trading easier. These different currencies eventually started to connect, which is why today everyone uses a national currency.'"
PET_46,"**Write a Winning Story!**

You could win Â£1,000 in this year's Fiction Prize and have your story published in Keep Writing magazine. Ten other lucky winners will receive a cheque for Â£100. We are looking for people who can write great stories. The judges, including Mary Littlejohn, a novelist, Michael Brown, a TV reporter, and Susan Hitchins, the editor of Keep Writing, want interesting and original stories. Last year, detective fiction was very popular, but the winner wrote a love story. You can write about anything you like, but here is some advice to help you:

**Write About What You Know**

This is important advice for every writer. Last year, most people who wrote for us followed it. Love, family, and problems with friends were the main topics. However, you need to make ordinary situations interesting so people want to read them. Write about everyday things in a new and surprising way.

**Get Your Facts Right**

Don't describe a town or explain how something works if you are not sure about it. Only write about things you know well.

**Hold the Reader's Attention**

Make the beginning interesting and the ending a surprise. A bad ending is the worst. Develop your story carefully and think of something unusual for the end.

**Think About the Characters**

Make the people in your story come alive for the reader. Use well-chosen words to make them seem real.

Your story must be your own work, between 2,000 and 2,500 words, and typed, double-spaced, on one side of each sheet of paper. Even if you are close to the deadline, we cannot accept stories by fax or email. You must include the application form with your story. We cannot return your story or discuss our decisions. You should not have had any fiction published in any magazine or book in this country, and the story must not have appeared in print or recorded form, like on radio or TV, anywhere in the world. Your Â£5 fee will go to the Writers' Association. Make your cheque payable to Keep Writing and send it with the application form and your story to us. The closing date is 30 July, and we will inform the winner within one month. If you win, you must agree to have your story published in our magazine."

Hypatia's father was the director of Alexandria University, and he ensured his daughter received the best education possible. This was unusual because most women at that time had few chances to study. After studying in Athens and Rome, Hypatia returned to Alexandria and began teaching mathematics. She quickly became famous for her knowledge of new ideas. Although we have no copies of her books, we know she wrote several important mathematical works. Hypatia was also interested in technology and invented several scientific tools to assist her work. At that time, many rulers were afraid of science, and anyone connected with it was in danger. One day in March 415, Hypatia was attacked in the street and killed.'"

PET_27,"Grass Grass is one of the most successful plants in the world. There are over 9,000 different types of grasses, and they are found everywhere on Earth. They are the only flowering plants that can live in the cold environments of the Arctic and Antarctic. Grasslands support many kinds of animals, from small insects and birds to large animals like cows and lions. All these animals depend on grass in some way. Grass grows back quickly after it is cut or damaged. Unlike other plants, new leaves grow from below the soil, not from the top. This allows large groups of animals to live in one area. Once they have eaten all the grass, new grass starts to grow, providing a fresh meal."

Since she was a child, she has been drawing clothes and designing patterns. She never told her parents, who own a supermarket, that she wanted to make her hobby a career. She thought they wanted her to choose a more traditional job, so she studied management at university. After graduating, she moved to London and worked at an advertising agency. She had to go to industry events but couldn't afford the designer clothes she liked, so she started making her own skirts and tops. Her friends loved her clothes and asked her to make some for them too. She found a small shop in London that agreed to sell her designs on a sale-or-return basis. Her clothes were very popular, and nothing was returned. This success encouraged her to leave her advertising job, take a Â£20,000 loan, and start her own womenswear label. Kal's parents were not upset about her career change and promised to support her, which made her very happy. Her clothes are now sold in over 70 stores, and her business earns over Â£500,000. Her designs appear in fashion magazines, she creates clothes for pop stars, and she has gained public recognition by winning this award. Her business has grown a lot, and she feels very fortunate.

PET_49,"Mark Ottaway traveled by train from Darwin, in northern Australia, to Adelaide, in the south. The Ghan train crosses Australia from the warm north coast through endless desert to the cooler Southern Ocean. It is often called the 'famous Ghan', but it is known for being late. The idea of a rail link between Darwin and Adelaide started in the 1920s with a line from Adelaide to Alice Springs, but flooding often made it hard for trains to pass. A new line was finished a few months before my trip. The railway was built for speeds up to 115 kph, but the Ghan is not a high-speed train. There are few stops, and most passengers are on holiday. The Ghan does not offer luxury like the Orient Express, though the food is excellent. The railway was originally for carrying goods, not passengers. It was thought that sending goods from Europe to Australia's south via Darwin and the train, instead of by ship, would save time and money. The Ghan claims to be the world's first north-south transcontinental railway. As I waited to board, everyone seemed excited about the journey. Most of my fellow travelers were Australian pensioners eager to board. Our first stop was Katherine, where the Ghan waited four hours. Some passengers took a boat trip up the gorge. I left the train at Alice Springs for a two-day trip to Uluru (Ayers Rock) with a small group and a guide. Climbing the rock is not encouraged now, so we walked around it and watched the sunset. From Alice Springs, there are two trains a week going south, so many passengers stop here. After Alice Springs, the view from the train is mostly flat land with cattle. But at dawn on the third day, we reached the foothills near the Southern Ocean. My journey ended, and although the train might not have met all the promises of the advertisements, it took me to some of the most amazing sights in Australia."
PET_31,"Climbing to the top of Britain

Every year, thousands of people climb Ben Nevis in Scotland. Because it is so far north, the weather can be very cold. Climber Keith Hewitt talks about his first time on Ben Nevis. It was February, and it was my first big winter climb. We planned to climb the north face of the mountain to Tower Ridge. This climb is six hundred metres high and is probably the longest climb in Britain. We planned to camp for three days in the 'Carries', which are like big bowls in the mountain walls halfway up. We carried tents, sleeping bags, and metal spikes for our boots. You need these spikes because the snow can be so hard that it feels like walking on ice. Even though some of us were very experienced, we packed all kinds of safety equipment, like lights to attract attention, hard hats, and extra clothing. The weather forecast was perfect, with no strong winds, but we still felt nervous when we started. Climbing Ben Nevis in winter is always a challenge. The path soon became steep, and my legs felt heavy. I was the weakest in the group, so I had to rest more often. The others sometimes stopped to let me catch up, but as soon as I reached them, they started again. I promised myself that I would always train properly before a climb in the future. After 200 metres, we reached the start of Tower Ridge, the path that would take us to the top of Ben Nevis. It is only a metre and a half wide, and the mountain drops hundreds of metres on each side. We knew we had to stay calm and focus on every step as we moved slowly along it. After seven hours of climbing, we reached the top. On a clear day, you can see the sea and all the way to the island of Skye, 48 kilometres away. However, we weren't so lucky because a mist had come down. On Ben Nevis, getting back down to camp can be as challenging as going up. You need to read a map properly because a wrong turn could lead to slopes that are too dangerous to go down in winter. I was glad we decided to take turns doing that job. That first time, I only really enjoyed the experience when I was safe in the tent. But at least I made it to the top."
PET_58,"Anna's New School

This week has been very exciting because we have just moved into our new school building! It's an amazing place. The builders used wood for the whole building, just like our old school. However, this new school is one of the first in my country to be very environmentally friendly. It took months to build, so we watched the whole process. It was exciting to see the builders clear the space for it, although it meant losing some lovely open land. The noise from the building machines was very loud, and the builders often had to stop because of heavy rain. We started to think the building would never be finished.

Now, we have five classrooms, which are huge - much bigger than in our old school next door, which was very old. We share one room with people from the town when they need it for meetings. There's also a nursery, a lovely dining room, and big changing rooms that we are excited to use once our new sports field is ready.

When you enter the school, one of the first things you notice is that there are no heaters! Instead, the heat comes from us - the children, the teachers, and the computers. The building is designed to keep all the heat inside - and the sound too, so if we sing in our classrooms, it feels like we're in a concert hall!

Another interesting thing is that the school roof has a tree on top! The builders put it there because it's a custom in Austria, where the roof was made. The electricity for lights and computers comes from a wind turbine on a hill behind the school. We visited it with our teacher yesterday, and it spins very fast. It's so big that it can be seen from miles away! We took some pictures to put on the website.

Even though we are already using the school building, some parts still need to be added. For example, we are putting on a play for parents, but we have to go back to our old school hall to do it. The new hall will be ready by next year. We are so happy with our new school, and our teachers say we will learn much faster now that we are in it!"

They are well equipped for hunting underwater because they have excellent vision and can sense movement through special lines on the sides of their bodies. This makes sharks very dangerous for smaller sea creatures that become their prey. Although sharks are similar to other fish in some ways, their bodies are different. For example, unlike other fish, most sharks need to swim constantly to breathe and stay alive, so they rarely sleep. Additionally, if sharks are turned over on their backs, they can stop moving completely. This is a useful technique for researchers who often need to handle sharks. It allows them to learn more about these fascinating creatures.'"

I tried to speak Russian, and then they started speaking English, so we could communicate.

PET_55,"THE ICEHOTEL

For many years, people visited the Arctic in the summer to see the land of the midnight sun. In winter, however, only a few people lived there, enjoying the snow and ice alone. By the late 1980s, people started to see the cold winter as something positive. In the winter of 1990, a French artist named Jannot Derit was invited to open an exhibition in a special igloo (a building made of snow) in the small town of Jukkasjarvi on the frozen Torne River. This building, called Arctic Hall, attracted many visitors. One night, some foreign guests thought it would be interesting to sleep in the Arctic Hall. The next morning, they were very happy with their experience, and this led to the idea of an ice hotel. Today, it is famous worldwide.

When winter starts, a team of snow builders, architects, and artists from around the world come to Jukkasjarvi to build the hotel for that year. As soon as one part is finished, it opens to visitors and overnight guests, while other parts are still being built. The first part is ready in December, and each week a new part opens until January 7th, when the hotel is complete. Since the ICEHOTEL is built outside using natural winter materials, the completion date can change depending on the weather. In spring, when it gets warmer, the hotel melts.

Inside the hotel, the temperature is always between -5Â°C and -8Â°C, no matter how cold it is outside. Warm clothing like overalls, hats, and gloves are included in the cost of staying at the hotel. Guests should also bring sweaters, a scarf, and plenty of wool socks. It is best to wear shoes that are larger than usual to fit thick socks. If you plan to visit, you can buy warm sweaters, wool socks, and more on the ICEHOTEL website. You can order these items when you book your visit, and they will be delivered to your room when you check in.

The hotel is in the village of Jukkasjarvi, 200 km above the Arctic Circle, but only 15 km from Kiruna airport and 17 km from Kiruna train station. You can arrange bus transport from the airport or train station to the ICEHOTEL."

The shop's regular hours will be 9 am to 9 pm every day, but Homestyle had said it would stay open for the first 24 hours. However, it had to close within half an hour of opening. A police officer who was called to the shop said: 'The police knew a big crowd was expected, but people were not patient. The shop filled up quickly, and the managers wisely decided to close the doors. The people outside got angry because they thought everything would be sold before they could get in, and they refused to wait quietly until there was room for them inside. Another problem was the long line of cars trying to reach the car park. What surprised me was that many people left their cars in the middle of the road and walked the last few meters to the shop. This blocked the road completely.' One customer, Jenny Smith, who got into the shop, said: 'I waited for three hours and didn't have time to buy what I wanted. But the staff were very calm and explained what was happening. They had no choice, as it wasn't safe. So I'll come back when they reopen, but I won't wait in line again.'"

PET_34,"Free-diving in the Caribbean

Tanya Streeter holds four world records in free-diving, a sport where people dive deep into the ocean on one breath. In 2003, Tanya made history by diving 120 meters deep and returning to the surface without help. She had gone deeper the year before but used a balloon to come back up. This time, she held her breath for over three and a half minutes, becoming the first woman to break a man's world record in any sport. Fourteen safety divers watched her dive at different depths. Despite reports of serious accidents with other divers, Tanya believes free-diving is safe if you focus on safety and training.

Most free-divers specialize in one or two types of events, but Tanya's training routine stays the same. She spends two-thirds of her time training on land at the gym, and the rest in the pool and ocean. She uses an exercise bike to improve her heart fitness but avoids running to protect her knees, preferring fast walking instead. When she starts practice dives, she usually travels away from home. She aims to do fourteen dives over four weeks, resting every other day to avoid getting tired, which could ruin her preparation.

When not training, Tanya often appears in public to promote sports products and supports environmental causes by doing research or making films. Growing up on Grand Cayman in the Caribbean, she loved swimming and exploring rock pools. Tanya says her life now is like living her childhood dreams. She is well-known in some countries, so people listen to her about environmental issues. In the future, Tanya, now in her thirties, plans to keep breaking her own records. She started free-diving at twenty-five and doesn't plan to retire anytime soon."
PET_12,"CARTOON FILMS

Cartoon films have very few limits. If you can draw something, you can make it move on the cinema screen. With new ideas and advanced computer programs, cartoons are becoming exciting again for people of all ages. By the end of the 1970s, the cinema world thought cartoons were only for children. But soon after, a few directors had some original new ideas. They showed that it was possible to make films where both adults and children could enjoy the fun. However, not every cartoon film was successful. The Black Cauldron, for example, did not do well because it was too scary for children and too childish for adults. Directors learned from this mistake, and film companies began to make a lot of money again."
PET_26,"New TV Star Caroline Benson talks about her first TV role 'I never thought I would spend part of my first year at university filming The Finnegans. I had only acted in school plays before, but I loved the book since I was eleven. My grandmother always said I was like Polly Finnegan, and I imagined playing her. I took a year off to travel before starting university. While I was in Chile, my mother emailed me about plans to make the book into a TV drama. I knew I had to try for the role. My mother was surprised but sent my photo to the director and convinced him to meet me. I flew back and got the part. Filming started a week after university began, so I got permission to be away for three weeks. When I returned, I woke up at 6.00am to write the essays I missed. I didn't tell my university friends, but they found out and thought it was great. It was an amazing experience, and I'm so lucky. After university, I want to make acting my career. I'm not from an acting family, but my grandfather was an opera singer. I've tried for other TV roles but haven't received any offers yet. I don't know how I managed everything because I had a busy social life too. When filming ended, I didn't know what to do. I've since acted in two college plays. Unfortunately, I haven't been home much, and now that my first year at university is over, I'm going to Greece for the summer with friends.''"

Today, 'The Body Shop' is an international company growing quickly worldwide. Over the years, I have learned a lot. Much of what I have learned is in this book because I believe our company has valuable ideas about running a successful business without losing our core beliefs. This is not a typical business book, nor is it just about my life. The main idea is that to succeed in business, you need to be different. Business can be enjoyable, it can be run with care, and it can have a positive impact. In business, as in life, I need to have fun, feel a sense of family, and be excited by surprises. I have always wanted the people who work for 'The Body Shop' to feel the same way. Now, this book shares my ideas with the world and makes them public. I like to think there are no limits to our 'family' and no limits to what we can achieve. I find that an exciting thought. I hope you do, too.'"

PET_30,"Honey is a sweet liquid made by bees. It is made of water and sugars. Bees can travel up to seventy-five thousand kilometers and visit over two million flowers to make just half a kilo of honey. The color and taste of honey depend on the type of flower the bees visit. There are more than three hundred types of honey. Lighter-colored honey usually has a milder taste than darker honey. In ancient times, honey was the main sweet food because sugar was very rare. Honey was very valuable to the ancient Egyptians, who used it as payment. Today, honey is made and eaten all over the world. Research suggests that it can help prevent tiredness and improve athletic performance. However, honey is not just food - it can be used for sore throats and is found in many skin and hair-care products."
PET_7,"Norwich, the capital of East Anglia in Britain, has been a place to live for over two thousand years. It started as a small village by the River Wensum. By the time of the Norman invasion in 1066, it had grown into one of England's largest towns. Norwich is known for its religious diversity, with two cathedrals and a mosque. The first cathedral was built in 1095 and recently celebrated its 900th anniversary. In 1994, Norwich celebrated the 800th anniversary of receiving a Royal Charter, which allowed it to be called a city and govern itself independently.

Today, Norwich is smaller compared to cities like London or Manchester, with a population of about 150,000. However, in the 16th century, it was the second-largest city in England. It continued to grow and became wealthy, known for having as many churches as weeks in the year and as many pubs as days in the year. Now, there are fewer churches and pubs, but in 1964, the University of East Anglia was established in Norwich. With a growing student population and success as a commercial center, Norwich offers a variety of entertainment options: theatres, cinemas, nightclubs, cafes, restaurants, and arts and leisure centers. The city also has a football team called 'The Canaries', with green and yellow colors, though the reason for the name is unclear.

A modern shopping center, 'The Castle Mall', is one of the city's attractions. For over two years, the people of Norwich lived with a large hole in the city center as builders worked on the project. Nearly a million tons of earth were moved to create a city center park on the Mall's roof, with water pools and trees. The local people are happy that the old open market remains next to the new development. Both areas are successful, showing that Norwich has combined the best of the old and the new."
PET_43,"The Albuquerque Balloon Festival Every autumn, the sky above Albuquerque, a city in the southwestern United States, fills with bright colors. This is the Albuquerque Balloon Festival, a nine-day event held every year. The first festival was in 1972 to celebrate the 50th birthday of a local radio station. It started with about a dozen hot-air balloons taking off from a car park in the middle of Albuquerque. Since then, the festival has grown. This year, at least a thousand balloons from over a third of the countries in the world are expected at its current location outside the city. What to see The pilots stay in radio contact and light up their balloons' burners at the same time. These are called 'balloon glows' and are great for taking photos. You need to arrive just after nightfall or before 5:30 am to see these 'glows' as the balloons rise into the dark sky. During the day, you can walk among the balloons and talk to the pilots as they get ready for take-off. The balloons come in all sizes and colors, some shaped like animals, cartoon characters, or famous products like soft drinks and fast food. Kids will love it. In the afternoon, you can take a balloon flight over the desert with one of the many companies offering rides. Another option is to take the cable car from the desert floor to the top of the nearby mountains, the longest ride of its kind, and enjoy a view of the festival from above. There are many other attractions for visitors of all ages, including balloon races and fireworks on the opening night and the last three nights of the festival. The Albuquerque Box This is a local wind pattern that is perfect for balloonists. The Sandia Mountains protect the balloons from strong winds and create gentler winds at different heights. This allows skilled pilots to control the direction of their balloons by rising or descending. Practical advice Buy your tickets in advance online to avoid long waits to enter the festival site. Wear several layers of thin clothing. It can be cool at night and in the early morning, but during the day, sunglasses and sunscreen are essential. Bring a flashlight for night events and, of course, your camera. If you use film, you'll need high-speed film for evening and night pictures."
PET_51,"The Eden Project Since it opened, the Eden Project in the south-west of England has become one of the UK's most popular tourist spots. At first glance, the large 'biospheres' on this former industrial site look like something from a science-fiction movie. Each biosphere has a different climate zone, showing visitors how important the relationship between people and plants is. It is surprising to see how many products we use every day come from plants: wood, rubber, fruit, rice, sugar, coffee, and chocolate, for example. Over 135,000 different types of plants are grown here. No matter how cold the weather is outside, computer-controlled electric heaters keep the plants at the right temperature. In the Rainforest Zone, the air is always damp because of a large waterfall. Another zone recreates the environment of the Mediterranean, California, and South Africa, and there are plans to build a desert zone soon."

There are enjoyable pieces by famous writers like Candia McWilliam and Rose Tremain. Interestingly, the less well-known writers seem to focus mainly on food. Be cautious with Jane Harris's Those Nails - it's best not to read it right after eating, as it has some very unpleasant scenes that might upset your stomach! There is excellent work from nineteen poets, including R. S. Thomas and John Burnside. There are also pieces from novels-in-progress by Jim Crace and Jane Rogers.

""It's the time when you are learning about the world."" Margaret, who lives in London, prefers to take students at three and four, although she often makes exceptions for eager five-year-olds. When she began teaching the violin in 1972, her first class was made up of her children's five-year-old school friends. Margaret's students have group lessons. Each group has about twelve students, and each lesson lasts an hour, once every two weeks. Additionally, each student has one individual lesson a week with her. Parents also need to attend the classes. It is important that the parents show interest in the lessons. From the earliest lessons, students learn to play by ear. They do not try to read music until they have been playing for several years, and for a long time, there is a big difference between their playing and reading of music. Margaret says that her method is not meant to produce great violinists, and she always suggests that students who perform particularly well should leave and study the violin using more traditional methods.'"

Tom Wilcott is now on bass guitar, replacing Simon McVee who left the band last year, and Tom Simpson has joined as the drummer. From the first song, which is a dance tune, it is clear that the band is moving away from slow songs. The second song is also a dance tune and is even louder and heavier. Most of the later tracks are in the band's usual slow style. These two tracks will surprise many fans, but they could easily become hit singles because they are excellent. Singer Rob Letchford shows his talent by hitting each note perfectly. Fans should be thankful he recorded the songs before he had throat problems, which caused the band to cancel their next tour. (Anyone who bought tickets need not worry as all the concerts will be rescheduled once Rob recovers.) On this CD, Moonshine shows they can create perfect music in different styles, from the slow ones we know to the ones that make you want to dance. I felt that the best songs were at the beginning, and the last few tracks were not as good. Despite this, 'Here Again' is sure to be a big hit and bring more success to the band.'"

He saw it for the first time in 1769. Interestingly, even though San Francisco Bay is a great natural harbor, it was discovered from land, not from the sea. In 1849, thousands of people came to San Francisco hoping to find gold. However, it was not the gold seekers who became wealthy. The richest people made their money by owning banks and law firms, and they built large houses on a hill called Nob Hill.

They complain about the lack of women in the sport but use this as an excuse not to provide separate changing facilities. I put up posters, and 40 women, both young and old, fit and unfit, joined. They were all interested in losing weight, but I don't think they had really considered running before. When they thought about it, they imagined difficult training. They didn't think about chatting and smiling while running in beautiful places, like by a river. At first, they ran for only a minute, but now they can run for thirty minutes. They've also learned from other runners about diet and staying fit in general. I wanted to support women's running, and I've enjoyed watching their progress - almost as much as they have.'"
PET_40,"**THE HISTORY OF THE IDITAROD - THE LAST GREAT RACE ON EARTH**

In the 1880s, gold was found in Alaska, the northernmost state of the USA. Many people moved there, hoping to become rich. New towns were quickly built and expanded. One of these towns was named Iditarod, meaning 'far, distant place'. In 1909, Iditarod grew so fast that it briefly became the largest city in Alaska. During the summer, boats could deliver essential supplies to these towns, but in winter, the rivers and ocean froze, making access impossible. So, in 1910, a winter trail was created for teams of dogs pulling sleds. They carried mail, food, and clothes to the gold miners. This trail was called the Iditarod Trail. It took about three weeks for a dog team to travel across Alaska. They stopped at 'roadhouses' where the drivers could rest and eat, and feed their dogs. The trail was used every winter until the 1920s when airplanes replaced steam boats and dog teams as the main transport method. However, the dogs had one last moment of fame in 1925, when a disease called diphtheria struck the city of Nome. The disease could be treated, but the nearest medicine was in Anchorage, on the other side of Alaska. Airplanes were still new, and it was uncertain if they could fly in such cold weather. Also, Carl Eielson, the only pilot skilled enough for the flight, was away. So, it was decided to use dog teams to transport the medicine. The journey covered over 1,000 kilometers, mostly along the Iditarod Trail. It took twenty teams just six days to complete the trip. Leonhard Seppala, a Norwegian who came to Alaska for gold, traveled the first 400 kilometers. He relied on his dog Togo to navigate through the blinding snow, and Togo proved to be a reliable guide. The last part of the journey was completed by Gunnar Kaasen, who had driven dog teams in Alaska for 21 years. His lead dog was Balto. At one point, Balto refused to go further, saving the team from falling into icy water. The diphtheria outbreak was stopped, and Balto became a hero. Today, a dog sled race is held every year from Anchorage to Nome, following the route of that famous 1925 journey. It is called the Iditarod and is known as 'The Last Great Race on Earth'."

The story appeared in a local newspaper, and Jose Craveirinha, who had supported other African athletes, learned about Maria. He went to meet her and saw her playing football outside the club. He immediately noticed she was fast. 'He talked to me about athletics. I didn't know what he meant. The only sport I knew was football. Then he bought me running shoes and took me to train. It was very hard work, and my legs really hurt.' But Jose visited her parents and convinced them she could succeed and this would help end their poverty. They agreed to let him take her to train. In 1991, she finally accepted an invitation to train in the United States. She had refused before because she knew she would miss her family. Her background was different from the girls she met in the US. She explains, 'They were good athletes, but while I worried about my parents having enough to eat, they worried about dresses and make-up.

PET_59,"**JAZZ By Katie Atkins, aged 14**

I play the trumpet in my school jazz band. Last month, we had a jazz competition with bands from local high schools, and our band won! Each band wore different costumes, from black school uniforms like ours to bright T-shirts. We didn't look like adult professional bands, but we were all used to performing in competitions, so the quality of playing was amazing, especially since everyone was so young. Players from each band even made up new tunes right there on stage. It was exciting to watch, but even better when my band played on stage!

We have a great jazz band at my school, but not everyone who wants to play in it gets acceptedâ€”only about half do. But anyone who is eager to play goes to jazz practice before school, and we often spend time together after school, listening to jazz and learning its language. There are also trips to jazz summer camps across the country. I've been to a couple and learned a lot.

Adults are often surprised that young people are getting interested in jazz. My music teacher thinks it's because pop music isn't challenging enough for people like me who are serious about music. But I find it exciting because it's both new and old at the same time. You can create your own music, but you also feel you're part of its history, as you're playing on stage like great jazz performers before you.

My school is really lucky because we have great teachers and parents who have supported us all the way. Without them, we'd never get anywhere with our music!"

PET_28,"**Antarctica Sightseeing Flights Website**

Welcome to our website. Here is what you need to know before booking a flight. During the short Antarctic summer, Antarctica Sightseeing Flights takes tourists in a large passenger plane (Boeing 747) from Sydney, Australia, over Antarctica and back. Flight dates for next year are not confirmed yet, but if you book now, your deposit can be moved to another date if we need to change the schedule.

**Questions**

These are answers to the most common questions about Antarctica Sightseeing Flights.

**How long is the flight?**

The flight usually lasts 12 hours. About four hours into the flight, we start seeing the first sea ice and icebergs. We spend four hours flying over Antarctica and the rest of the time returning home. During the flight, experts who have lived on research stations in Antarctica give talks about the environment and history, and answer questions. A camera near the pilot, connected to the video system on board, shows you the pilot's view from take-off to landing.

**Will I get a seat next to a window?**

All passengers receive two boarding passes. Halfway through the flight, passengers switch to the seat on their second boarding pass. Business and first-class passengers will have a window seat for half of the flight and a seat next to a window for the other half. Economy passengers will have a window seat or a seat next to a window for half of the flight and an aisle seat for the other half. While over Antarctica, we encourage passengers to move around the plane so everyone can enjoy the views. The pilot flies in long 'figure 8s' over interesting spots so both sides of the plane can see the sights well.

**What happens if the weather is bad?**

We have 17 different approved flight routes. Our captain checks the satellite cloud images on the morning of the flight and chooses the route with the clearest views.

**Will I see penguins and other wildlife?**

Most Antarctic wildlife lives at sea level, over 3,000 meters below the plane, so we can't see them clearly. We do not land on Antarctica, mainly for environmental reasons. To see Antarctic wildlife, you would need to join a boat tour.

**Can I take photographs?**

Yes, you can! All cameras are welcome. We even offer some fun onboard photo opportunities where you can try on Antarctic cold weather clothes."
PET_35,"Text: 'Little Chefs For a group of children aged between ten and fifteen, Saturdays are spent learning serious cooking. Their weekly lessons in small classes are so popular that there is a waiting list of 30 children who want to join. Parents pay Â£280 for the course where their children can have fun and learn to make good food. Class member Bill, aged ten, says, 'I love my mum's cooking and now I can do it better than her. The teachers make us laugh, especially when we sit down with them to share the food we've made.' Flora is twelve, and she's having trouble with onions. 'I love cooking. I made a meal for ten friends, and they really enjoyed it. Then my mum suggested I take up a hobby, instead of doing nothing at weekends. I was happy staying at home, so I wasn't too keen at first. I'm really glad I decided to come, though.' Their teacher, Philippe, says, 'It's great fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, although the kitchen isn't always as tidy when they're cooking! As adults, we're always learning more about food. If parents interest their children in cooking while they are young, they'll have enough skill to make food for themselves when they leave home.''"
PET_5,"Winter Driving

Winter driving is dangerous because it is hard to predict what will happen, and accidents can occur easily. Fog might appear suddenly over a hill. Ice can be hidden under melting snow, ready to make you lose control. A car coming towards you might unexpectedly slide across the road. 

Rule Number One for driving on icy roads is to drive smoothly. Sudden movements can make a car hard to control. So, when you turn the wheel, use the brakes, or speed up, do it gently and slowly. Imagine you have a full cup of hot coffee on the seat next to you. Drive in a way that you wouldn't spill it.

Rule Number Two is to be aware of what might happen. The more ice there is, the further ahead you need to look. Test how long it takes to stop by gently braking. Remember, you might be driving faster than you think. Generally, allow double your normal stopping distance on wet roads, three times on snow, and even more on ice. Try to keep control of your car at all times to avoid trouble."
PET_41,"Craigie Aitchison

The painter Craigie Aitchison was born in Scotland. He moved to London planning to study law, but instead, he went to art school. There, he found traditional drawing classes difficult, but he continued painting. In his late twenties, he received money from the Italian government to study art, and he became interested in early Italian artists, which is reflected in some of his work. He loved the greens and browns of the Italian fields and the clear light there, and he wanted to capture this light in his paintings. This led him to paint colors thinly, layering them from light to dark, but he says he's never sure what the results will be. He explains, 'It's a secret - because I don't know myself. I don't start by painting yellow, knowing I'm going to put anything on top.' Like many talented people, Aitchison makes it sound easy. 'Anyone can do the colors - you can buy them. I simply notice what you put the colors next to.' Unlike some artists, he never makes drawings before starting a painting, as he feels that if he did, he might get bored and not complete the painting. Instead, Aitchison changes his paintings many times before they are finished. This is why his favorite models are people who don't ask to see their pictures while he's painting them. 'If I feel they're worried and want to look at the painting, I can't do it.' Since moving to London, he has not felt part of the Scottish painting scene. He says he is not interested in following any tradition, but just paints the way he can. However, his work still influences young British painters."
PET_38,"Text: 'Rock Band Two years ago, our 14-year-old son, Ben, asked us for a drum set for his birthday. At first, we were against the idea because of the noise. 'It's better than watching TV or playing computer games in my free time,' Ben argued, 'and it'll keep me out of trouble.' In the end, we agreed. 'All right,' we said, 'but you must think about the rest of the family and the neighbors when you play.' That was just the start. Because drums are not easy to move, the other members of Ben's band began coming to our home with their guitars and other electric equipment. So, for several hours a week, the house shakes with the sound of their instruments and their teenage singing. At least Ben's hobby has been good for our health: whenever the band starts practicing, my husband and I go out for a long walk. And I must admit that, although their music may sound a bit strange, they are a friendly and polite group of young men. I cannot judge their musical skill - after all, I didn't expect my parents' generation to like the same music as I did when I was a teenager - but they do play regularly in local clubs for young people. Our main worry is that they won't spend enough time on their schoolwork because of their music, though this hasn't happened yet. I always tell Ben how important his studies are. But one thing is certain - Ben was right: it has kept him out of trouble and he is never bored.'"
PET_17,"Atlantic College

Last week, I visited Atlantic College, a top private school in Wales. This school is special because it gives young people important experiences outside the classroom, along with preparing them for exams. The students, aged 16 to 18, come from all over the world. They study in the morning and in the afternoon, they do useful activities like helping on a farm, assisting people with learning difficulties, or checking rivers for pollution.

One of the best things about Atlantic College is its diverse student body. Students come from different social backgrounds and countries. Since the fees are PS20,000 for two years, many students need financial help. Grants are available, and a quarter of the students are British, with many receiving government support to attend.

""I really admire the college for promoting international understanding among young people,"" said Barbara Molenkamp, a student from the Netherlands. ""You learn to live with and respect others, even those you don't like. During the summer holidays, my mother noticed I argued less with my sister.""

In conclusion, Atlantic College provides an excellent education with methods that truly work."

I decided to go to university after being away from school for fourteen years. As a secretary, I was earning a decent amount of money, but I was bored because the job didn't challenge me. I felt stuck and became more and more unhappy. I envied the students at the local university because they seemed happy and full of hope. I wanted to be part of that. However, now that I'm a student, I find it hard to connect with younger classmates. They often mistake me for a lecturer and ask me questions I can't answer. I also feel distant from the lecturers because, even though we are the same age, they know much more than I do. But I am grateful for this chance to study because I know a qualification is needed for a rewarding job, which is very important to me. Unlike most eighteen-year-olds, I prefer spending weekends with my books rather than going out partying. There are also typical student benefits like long holidays and discounts at theatres and cinemas. I often wonder what I'll do after university, but I hope that continuing my education at this age has been a good decision.'"

After driving it for 1,500 kilometers, he sold it and made two larger cars. In 1903, he founded the Ford Motor Company. By using strong but light steel, he created affordable cars for ordinary people. In 1908, he introduced the first Ford Model 'T', which cost $825. Soon, he was selling 100 cars a day. By 1927, the Ford Motor Company was valued at $700 million. Early Ford cars were simple and inexpensive, but this simplicity sometimes meant fewer options. Henry Ford famously said about the Model T, ""You can have any color you like, as long as it's black."""

The winters in Canada are so cold that the birds would die if they stayed. Last spring, Bill Lishman found sixteen young Canada Geese on his farm. They had lost their parents. Bill thought, 'These young birds won't know what to do in the autumn.' Bill had a small plane and decided to teach the birds to follow him.

KET_46,"Corryvale Farm is located in the west of England. Stephen and Jenny Blackler run the farm, where they keep cows and chickens and sell milk and eggs. However, most of their income comes from Jenny's sheep. She owns 50 sheep, and each sheep produces enough wool for six sweaters. Every six months, Stephen shears the wool from the sheep to prevent them from getting too warm. 

Five years ago, Jenny decided to make sweaters from the wool and sell them at country markets. Unfortunately, it was summer, and the hot weather meant people were not interested in buying sweaters. So, she decided to make socks instead. The socks became very popular because they were affordable, durable, and easy to wash. This marked the beginning of Jenny's business. Initially, she made the socks at home, but as her customer base grew to thousands, she had to send the wool to a factory. Now, all the socks are produced by machines in the factory.

Jenny's socks come in six colors, five sizes for all ages, and are designed for different activities like walking, sports, and skiing. The busiest time for Jenny is Christmas, as Corryvale socks are a popular gift. In Jenny's office, the walls are covered with letters from satisfied customers from around the world."

KET_10,"Text: 'BURGLARS LOVE THE AFTERNOON Most house burglaries happen between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m., according to the police. Inspector Ian Saunders told our newspaper that house burglaries have increased by more than 30% compared to last year. He also mentioned that 67% of burglaries occur when people leave a door or window open. He explained that night-time burglaries are rare because families are usually at home then. However, he said that winter afternoons are ideal for burglars because it is dark, making it easier for them to go unnoticed. Many houses are empty at that time since people are often still at work. Inspector Saunders suggested leaving lights on in living rooms and bedrooms when you go on holiday to deter burglars. He also encouraged neighbors to watch over other houses on the street when people are away and to call the police if they notice anything unusual. 'We can also advise you on how to make your house safe,' Inspector Saunders said. 'This kind of help is free.''"

KET_44,"Text: 'The History of Farming Before farming began, people searched in forests for plants or fruit to eat. This meant they moved constantly to find food. However, around 12,000 years ago in the Middle East, people started to grow their own food. These were the first farmers. Farming allowed people to stay in one place, and their villages gradually expanded. Some villagers could then focus on other tasks, like making clothes, because farmers provided food for everyone. Unfortunately, farming was challenging when the weather was bad, and some people didn't have enough to eat. Today, farmers can produce more food, and it travels thousands of kilometers from where it is grown to our homes.'"

Bollywood films often feature romantic love stories, with singing and dancing as key elements. These films are also popular outside India, earning Bollywood over $500 million last year from international sales. Indian actors make more films annually than Hollywood actors, but they earn less money.

It stays inside its mother for about fifteen months. An adult rhino weighs over 200 kilos and can live up to 50 years.'"
KET_4,"Text: 'THE HISTORY OF THE LONDON POLICE Today, there are policemen everywhere, but in 1700, London had no policemen at all. A few old men used to guard the city streets at night, and they were not paid much. About 300 years ago, London was starting to grow. The city was very dirty, and many people were poor. There were so many thieves stealing money in the streets that people stayed in their homes as much as possible. In 1750, Henry Fielding began paying a group of people to stop thieves. They were like policemen and were called 'Bow Street Runners' because they worked near Bow Street. Fifty years later, there were 120 Bow Street Runners, but London had become very large and needed more policemen. So, in 1829, the first Metropolitan (or London) Police Force was started with 3000 officers. Most of the men worked on foot, but a few rode horses. Until 1920, all the police in London were men. Today, London police are quite well paid, and for the few police officers who still ride horses, the pay is even better than for the others.'"

KET_7,"Text: 'Visit the Edinburgh Festival! Every year, thousands of people visit Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland, to join the Edinburgh Festival. For three weeks in August and September, the city is full of actors and artists from around the world. They come for the biggest arts festival in Britain. During this time, the streets are lively with music and dance from early morning until late at night. You can even watch artists painting on the streets. One of the highlights of the Festival is the 'Fringe', where students perform comedy shows in small venues like halls and cafes. Many tourists come to see new films and plays and listen to music by famous musicians. This year, there are over five hundred performances with actors from more than forty countries. Tickets for these shows are quite cheap, and it is often easier to see your favourite star in Edinburgh than in London. So, plan to visit Edinburgh next summer, but remember it can be hard to find a room, so consider booking your hotel now!'"
KET_43,"Text: 'ICE-FISHING If you drive north from Toronto for three hours, you will reach Lake Nipissing. In winter, the lake turns into ice, and thousands of Canadian fishermen go there each weekend. They build small wooden houses on the ice and paint them in bright colors. Then they sit inside to catch fish that swim under the ice. Bob Marvisch has been coming here at this time of year for twenty-five years. 'You need clothes that are light but warm: two pairs of socks and gloves, several thin sweaters, and a snow suit on top. Catching the fish is easy,' he says. 'First, you break the ice and make a small round hole in it. Next, you take a fishing line and put some bread on it. Then you put the line through the hole and into the water. You pull the line up when the fish eat the bread. They are between ten and twenty centimeters long. Some people like to eat them, but when I have caught three or four fish, I prefer to have some chocolate or another snack! Today I have caught twenty-five! It's a great sport and you can meet some nice people here!''"

KET_11,"Madame Tussaud's

A very famous tourist attraction in London is Madame Tussaud's museum. At this museum, visitors can see wax figures of famous people. Madame Tussaud was born in France in 1761. Her uncle, who was a doctor, created wax figures of people and opened a museum for them in Paris. Marie helped her uncle with his work. In 1789, during the French Revolution, Marie was put in prison. While there, she had to make wax copies of the heads of famous people who had died, including Queen Marie Antoinette. In 1795, Marie married Francois Tussaud, and in 1802, she moved to London with her wax figures. She opened a museum there, and her figures can still be seen today."

Initially, bicycles were costly, and only wealthy individuals could afford them. These early bicycles looked very different from the ones we see today. Later, as bicycles became more affordable, many people started buying them. People began using bicycles to commute to work and for leisure. Nowadays, cars are used more than bicycles because they are much faster and keep you dry in the rain. However, some people still prefer cycling to work. They argue that there are too many cars in city centers, making it hard to find parking.'"
KET_63,"Text: 'The Elephant Show by Daniel Allsop, age 14 Last summer, I went to Thailand for a beach holiday with my family. One day, we visited a park near our hotel. It had beautiful flower gardens, but we were mainly interested in the elephant show. We went to a large square with seats on three sides. Three elephants came in with their keepers and stood in front of a big piece of white card. Each elephant got a paintbrush and started to paint on its own card. Sometimes, the keepers gave the elephants a new brush with paint and took the old one away. Slowly, following their keepers' instructions, the elephants drew pictures on the cards. I couldn't believe what I was seeing! One picture showed a river, another a tree, and the third a bunch of flowers. When the keepers held up the paintings, everyone wanted to buy one. We gave the elephants the bananas we brought for our lunch. Twenty years ago, elephants worked in the forest. Now, they don't work there anymore, but the smartest of these animals live in special centers where visitors can watch them.'"
KET_56,"Text: 'Big Cats There are many different types of big cats. They vary in size and have different appearances and behaviors. Tigers are the largest of the big cats. They can be up to 3.7 meters long from head to tail. Unlike most cats, tigers enjoy water and often lie in it to cool down when it's hot. Lions are unique because they live in large family groups called prides. Several lions work together to hunt for food for the pride. They usually live in open, flat areas where they can see far and easily track other animals. All big cats need excellent eyesight to catch smaller animals for food. They also need to be fast and very strong.'"

Although ostriches have wings like all birds, they cannot fly. Instead, they use their wings to help them change direction while running. Ostriches can run very fast, reaching speeds of 65 to 90 kilometres per hour, making it hard for predators to catch them. Baby ostriches are about the size of chickens and take around 3 years to grow into adults. Ostriches eat plants and can survive for many days without water.'"

We interviewed her last week at a snowboarding competition in Switzerland and asked why she started snowboarding. She said, ""I've always enjoyed all kinds of sports, especially skiing, so snowboarding felt like a natural choice. It doesn't take long to learn, and you can become quite skilled in a few months."" 

We asked if she practices a lot. She replied, ""In winter, I snowboard in the mountains every day from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. I also run and bike. But I love doing all of it! I enjoy the competitions and being in the mountains. It's so beautiful. But free-riding, which is doing what you want when you're not competing, is the best thing in the world for me.""

We also asked what is important when learning to snowboard. She said, ""You can learn quickly, but you need lessons. It's also important to have the right clothes so you don't get wet because, at first, you spend a lot of time falling down!"""

The Marangu path, which is five kilometers long, is considered the easiest. It takes about five days to climb and is very popular with tourists. However, only half of the climbers make it to the top. This is often because the weather can change quickly. At the start, it might be hot and wet, but at the top, there is ice and snow, and the temperature can drop below 20 degrees.

An otter can close its ears and nose, allowing it to stay underwater for several minutes.

KET_61,"Gail Rollins is one of the top runners in Edinburgh. This summer, she aims to compete in the 10,000 metresâ€”and possibly the 5,000 metresâ€”at the European Championships. In the past, Gail was famous for finishing second in major competitions. However, she always laughed and smiled, which made people in her hometown admire her. Everything changed in 2004 when she participated in her first half-marathon, a long road race. She won with an impressive time, the fastest of the year for any British woman runner. Gail's manager and husband, Mike Rollins, also used to race when he was younger, but he had to stop competing after injuring his right leg. He can still run a bit and sometimes trains with Gail. However, it's not enjoyable for Mike when Gail overtakes him and he can't keep up. Gail trains hard, doing a long run in the morning and fast runs in the afternoon. She always takes a break from running on Sundays. ""I am with her all the time,"" says Mike. ""Sometimes I ask, 'Are you sure you should be eating that?'
