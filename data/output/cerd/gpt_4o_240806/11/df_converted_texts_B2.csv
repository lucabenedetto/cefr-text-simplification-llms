CPE_15,"Text: 'Garbage in, garbage out Charging families for each bag of rubbish they produce seems like a good idea for the environment and economy. But it might not be. In many developed countries, people have their rubbish collected regularly. They put their rubbish bags or bins out, and a special truck takes them away to a landfill. Economists find this strange because it is usually free. Households pay for this service through local taxes, but a family that fills four bins pays the same as an elderly couple that fills one. However, rubbish disposal is not free. The more rubbish people throw away, the more collectors and trucks are needed, and the more local authorities pay in landfill fees. This is a basic economic problem: if rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish. The obvious solution is to make households pay for the waste they produce. This would encourage them to throw out less and recycle more, assuming local governments provide recycling points. But as Don Fullerton and Thomas Kinnaman, two American economists, found, this approach can have unexpected and sometimes disappointing results. They studied several American towns and cities that started charging households for rubbish. The most common system is to sell stickers or tags for rubbish bags or cans. Only bags with these labels are collected. In a study of Charlottesville, Virginia, a town of about 40,000 people, residents were charged 80 cents for each tagged bag. The number of bags fell by 37%, but this was mainly because people crammed more garbage into each bag, a trick called the 'Seattle stomp'. The weight of rubbish collected fell by only 14%. In 25 other Virginian cities without a pricing scheme, it fell by 3.5% anyway. Some people also resorted to illegal dumping to avoid paying. This is hard to measure, but it might account for 30-40% of the reduction in collected rubbish. One positive result was a 15% increase in recycling, suggesting people chose to recycle rather than pay for rubbish removal. However, many were already recycling before the fee. In a later study, Fullerton and Kinnaman found that pricing does reduce rubbish weight, but not by much. A 10% increase in sticker prices cuts rubbish by only 0.3%. This is lower than in other studies, but not surprising. To reduce rubbish a lot, people would need to buy less of everything. A small tax on rubbish is unlikely to make a big difference. Other factors, like income and education, might be just as important. In richer towns, people throw out more rubbish and have less time for recycling. Should we say charging for rubbish is a bad idea? Not at all. Free disposal is too cheap. But simple policies can have complex effects. Detailed economic models are often needed to understand them, and sometimes the results are not what we expect.'"
CPE_19,"Theodore Zeldin explores how our work life might change. Do you feel respected and appreciated at work? Today, just having a successful career is not enough. Many professions feel undervalued, and even famous individuals often feel bitter. Loving your job used to be special, but now you must consider how your work affects you as a person, your mind, character, and relationships. This is important because if your skills make you boring or unable to talk to others outside your field, or if you're too busy to gain wisdom or use your imagination, then no amount of status or money will make up for your lack as a person.

I am exploring how work can focus on fulfilling these personal goals, rather than just shaping us for industrial needs. Work should not only create wealth but also be a meaningful way of life, helping us discover hidden talents and meet diverse people. However, this change doesn't mean ending unemployment. As people become more educated, they want jobs that are interesting and useful. A career should be like a work of art, with a fulfilled person at its center.

Even middle-class jobs are losing their appeal. Doctors are often more stressed than their patients, accountants worry about ethics, architects rarely use their creativity, and administrators are stuck in bureaucracy. Middle managers are losing confidence, and companies are getting smaller. Efforts like decentralizing decisions and rewarding performance haven't gained employee commitment. In Britain, only 8% of employees strongly feel their values match their organization's.

I am studying various jobs to see how they shape or harm people. I've looked at how different cultures expand human potential and create courage. Now, I'm focusing on finding more satisfying ways to work. Many experts work on extending the life and income of companies, but we also need to evaluate ourselves as people and decide who we want to spend our lives with. How many of us feel truly alive at work? How many are like part-time slaves, stuck in jobs because we see no other choice?

Take hotel workers, for example. They make up 10% of the workforce in the hospitality industry. Many intelligent and lively people work long hours for low pay and prestige because hotels haven't changed much since the days of the Ritz. Hotels are not just places to sleep; they are like mini United Nations where people from all over the world meet but often don't interact. Many hotel staff are foreigners eager to learn new languages and cultures, but they have limited interaction with guests. Hotels could be cultural centers, connecting guests and the city, and using the skills of their staff better. But accountants often limit this by focusing only on profit.

It's time to rethink work from a human perspective, not just a financial one. Work is a relationship. As people seek independence and want to design their own jobs and choose colleagues and customers, they need to communicate beyond professional jargon. True conversation is more than just communication; it creates respect and understanding, allowing people to change through the experience. Every meaningful conversation can change the world a little bit."
CPE_24,"**Broadcasting: The Social Shaping of a Technology**

The word 'broadcasting' originally meant spreading seeds by hand over a large area. This is not just an agricultural term; it also represents the idea of planned growth and success. The metaphor suggests a central source of seeds, or resources, meant to spread and grow. The question is why a new technology that sent words and pictures electronically was organized in a way that fit this metaphor.

Television, like the telegraph and telephone, is a form of communication. However, from the start, it was seen as a central 'mass' medium. Sending broadcasts from a central place to private homes matched the social and economic structures of modern societies. Other ways of organizing television were tried but remained just experiments.

Two lesser-known alternatives show what television could have been in a different social setting. In the early 1930s, radio amateurs in Britain experimented with two-way television as a possible replacement for the telephone. Magazines like Radio News published articles on building TV transmitters and receivers. However, in 1938, the British Radio Manufacturers Association set standards that pushed these grassroots efforts aside.

In the USA, television was mainly a medium for public viewing in the early 1930s and was seen as a competitor to the film industry. In Britain and Germany, most people watched TV in public places. Although the idea of grassroots, two-way television was unlikely to succeed, public viewing systems were operating in several countries in the 1930s. However, the potential threat to home-based TV did not happen. Manufacturers saw the opportunity for mass sales of home TV sets as prices dropped.

As working-class people improved their living standards from the 1920s, the dream of a home filled with entertainment became possible for many in Western countries. This trend is now happening globally. There is a link between social modernization and the structure of broadcasting. As societies became more centralized, traditional communities broke up, leading to new ways of life. People became more mobile and isolated, making central broadcasting a way to reach everyone with important information and create a sense of national community.

Broadcasting became the dominant form of radio and TV because it met the needs of modern societies. It also played a role in democracy by providing equal access to information for political, social, and cultural participation. However, as television changes, the term 'broadcasting' might become outdated, referring only to a specific phase of social modernization."
CPE_13,"**Clutter**

Sometimes it feels like no matter how many things you own, you never feel safe. It's normal to want a home that meets your needs, but sometimes the desire to get more things goes too far. Modern advertising is made to make us feel insecure. It often tells us that if we don't have certain things, we are not good enough. To see how much you are affected, try not to read any advertising signs next time you walk down the street. These expensive messages influence us in strong ways without us even knowing it. We see them everywhere - on TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, t-shirts, the internet, and more - all telling us to buy, buy, buy.

**Caves**

Research centers and universities around the world have spent years studying caves, focusing on their origins, water systems, and life forms. Caves are a small but mysterious part of nature, which makes us curious and eager to learn more. This has led to a lot of research. Caves have been studied for a long time, especially in places where they have affected how people live. However, because visiting many caves requires physical skill, cave research is often done by both scientists and amateurs who explore caves for fun. There is a unique overlap between professional cave studies and amateur explorations.

**Weather Watch**

Many observant people, using only their senses, laid the foundations of meteorology, which has developed since the 17th century into the advanced science we have today. Satellites and electronic tools send us endless weather information quickly, and computers solve complex math problems faster than humans can. Meteorological theory uses long words that are hard for non-professionals to understand. It might seem like there is no room for simple weather knowledge, but that's not true. Human experience is still important for turning computer data into weather forecasts. Human observations can still provide unusual evidence that helps professionals understand the atmosphere."
CPE_16,"**MUSIC AND THEATRE**

Until recently, I believed opera was mainly theatre. Now, I think it's more about music. I worked at a national opera house and learned that music is the priority. This makes sense, but I come from the theatre world, where the spoken word and the actor are most important. In theatre, there is no one directing the action once it starts, and the audience usually understands the language spoken.

At musical performances, like concerts or operas, many people, including me, may not have a deep understanding of music. Some might feel embarrassed by this, but most are amazed by the performers' skills. A talented singer or musician shows the result of years of hard work. Watching top-class music is like watching a sports event; we see something similar to what we do, but at a much higher level.

Theatre audiences have different expectations. They often don't understand an actor's skill and aren't as impressed by something that seems close to what they could do. They don't usually admire an actor for delivering a long speech, though they often ask, ""How do you learn all those lines?"" This doesn't mean theatre audiences are more or less demanding than music audiences; many people attend both. It suggests that in theatre, audiences and performers meet on more equal terms, no matter how challenging the material.

Should music learn from theatre about this relationship? I think so. Music performances are naturally theatrical, full of emotion and drama. However, the way music is presented often highlights the difference between performers and audiences, which can feel hierarchical. For example, strict dress codes and high respect for conductors and soloists emphasize this gap. On the other hand, audiences sometimes interrupt performances by clapping at the wrong times, which can disrupt the flow of the music.

Is there a solution? Yes, much is being done to attract new audiences to concerts and operas and to make 'serious' music more accessible. I remember a special event, Jonathan Dove's community opera ""In Search of Angels,"" which moved from place to place in a cathedral and then into the town. It was a high-quality musical experience that involved the audience directly.

I wish music had more of the risk and boldness that theatre can show. Sometimes, using unusual locations can surprise both performers and audiences. It might be uncomfortable, with poor acoustics or cold temperatures, but theatre audiences have learned to be adventurous. Most plays are performed in a traditional way, similar to concerts, but I believe music conventions can and should change.

I am just an enthusiast who loves theatre and music. I want both to succeed and for more people to enjoy them as much as I do."
CPE_21,"**Sand**

While I admire sand's amazing ability to be turned into useful things like glass and concrete, I am not a big fan of it in its natural form. To me, it is mainly an annoying barrier between a seaside car park and the water. It blows in your face, gets in your sandwiches, and hides important things like car keys and coins. When you are wet, it sticks to you like glue and cannot be removed, even with a strong water hose. But, strangely, the moment you step onto a beach towel, get into a car, or walk across a clean carpet, it falls off you. For days after, you find piles of it on the floor every time you take off your shoes, and more comes off when you remove your socks. Sand stays with you longer than many illnesses. No, you can keep sand, as far as I am concerned.

**Lock and Key**

The search for a safe home, for privacy and security, has existed since humans first built permanent homes. The simple wooden beam behind the door may have changed to an electronic lock opened by a plastic card with many combinations, but the desire to keep out the 'bad guys' remains. The appeal of a lock and key is partly psychological. Recently, some companies have tried computerized locking systems, where smart cards, swiped through a 'reader', control electronic locks with a digital command. But people don't like them. You might accept it at work, but at home, everyone wants the comfort of turning a physical key in a lock. As a result, when one locksmith company created a new electronic system, they made sure to include a real metal key in the device.

**Modern Art**

I was nervous about visiting the new Tate Modern gallery because, like many people, I can't understand modern art. I know I like some of it, especially furry things, neon light sculptures, and large photographs. Maybe if I knew more about it, I'd have an opinion on more things. Then again, you're not supposed to approach it like a school essay. The point is not to understand art, but to let it speak to you. This is a great idea, but it never worked for me. However, this new gallery tries to give visitors a real understanding of the reasons behind the works. The first thing I noticed were the labels, proper labels that put a work in context and actually told you what it was trying to say. Instead of staring blankly at the pictures as I used to, these pieces of information helped me understand."
CPE_46,"**Every Picture Tells a Story**

Adapting novels for film often means reducing, condensing, and deleting parts of the story. This can be frustrating for writers but also enlightening. When working on a script, I noticed how much dialogue and description from a novel could be removed while still conveying the same message. This doesn't mean the original text was unnecessary. It's about the different ways stories are told in books and films. In novels, certain details, like character traits or speech tags like ""he said,"" are repeated to help readers understand. In stage drama, which is mostly speech, real conversation is imitated, sometimes to the point where the dialogue seems redundant and only serves to show that people are talking, without clear communication.

**Watching Movies**

Watching movies can transport you into another world, making you forget about reality for a while. Once the film ends and the lights come on, you're back in the real world. In the past, movies were seen as just entertainment, not art. Many people, including our parents and teachers, thought this way. They enjoyed movies but didn't consider them a form of art.

**The Film Studios**

The Leiper Film Company studios were a mix of different buildings, with a confusing layout. There were a few permanent landmarks, like the Script Department, but many rooms looked the same and were hard to find. The studio had three main entrances, all similar, and none had a place to ask for directions. Strangers rarely visited because the studio didn't encourage it. However, employees knew their way around and worked together to create films that offered audiences a break from everyday life.

**Film-makers**

Many people dream of making movies. Bookshops sell guides on scriptwriting and film production, and universities offer courses. Competitions offer cameras like the one Robert Rodriguez used to make El Mariachi, a film that cost $7,000 and made him a famous director. Rodriguez achieved his dream early, making his breakthrough film before turning 25. In the past, filmmakers took time to develop their skills, working as editors, writers, or cinematographers. Directors like John Huston and Fred Zinnemann made their first successful films later in life. Today, without the support of studios, aspiring filmmakers often have to be independent and resourceful."
CPE_3,"In those days, the council houses covered the western side of the city: rows of crowded, dull homes in orange half-brick or pale white stucco. In summer, chemicals from the May and Baker factory, two miles away, filled the air with a strong smell of sulfur. The most common sight in that part of Norwich early in the morning was a paperboy wrinkling his nose in disgust as he walked up to someone's front door. Most of my early life I've forgotten. But I remember sitting, or maybe balancing, near an upstairs window, looking at the houses as they disappeared into the distance. Later, there are other vague memories - faces I can't name, my mother ironing towels in a house that I don't think was ours, snow falling over the turrets of the great mansion at Earlham. It's no surprise that my mother appears in these early memories. I remember her as a small, precise, and often angry woman, whose anger I never understood and couldn't calm. Even as a child, when I went with her to the small shops in Bunnett Square or on longer trips into the city, I sensed her unusual personality. She was the most solitary person I have ever known, as alone in a room full of people as on a moor. She also had a strict sense of propriety uncommon on the West Earlham estate, which sometimes led to furious cleaning or handwashing and instructions to 'behave properly'. As a moral code, this was beyond my understanding: even now I'm not sure I understand it. Specifically, it meant not walking into neighbors' gardens or damaging their rose bushes; it meant sitting quietly for long periods in the dining room, with your hands folded, listening to radio programs my mother liked; it meant - oh, many rules and restrictions. Over time, other figures appeared in these strict early scenes. Despite her solitude, my mother had friends. There was Mrs. Buddery, who was obsessed with the Royal Family, Mrs. Winall, who said nothing except to agree with the main speaker, and Mrs. Laband - more lively than the others, and somewhat disapproved of by them. It was only later that I realized how poor their company was; they formed a sad and depressing group, talking about bad legs, the cold weather, and ungrateful children, a category I often felt I belonged to. Looking back, it felt like a heavy weight, made up of the West Earlham houses, my mother and her friends, and the need to 'behave properly', was on my shoulders, and that I had to grow up quickly to free myself from it. This was easier said than done. Growing up in West Earlham at this time followed a set pattern. Until you were five, you stayed at home and got in your parents' way (I remember boring days, when I was about four, playing on a rug in the front room while my mother sat coldly in an armchair). Then, the September after your fifth birthday, you went to Avenue Road infants school, half a mile away towards the city. The lucky few had a mother with a rickety bike and a child seat - these were strange contraptions made of cast-iron with makeshift safety straps. As far as I remember, my mother left me in the care of other children in the street for this journey. If I remember anything about these early years, it's the summer holidays, those days when you occasionally saw the world outside West Earlham: an old man who lived next to Mrs. Buddery and told stories about his time in the Merchant Navy; a charity event once, at a house far away on Christchurch Road, where a kind woman gave out lemonade and tried to interest me in something called the League of Pity - a kind of junior charity, I think - only for my mother to dismiss it, saying its organizers were 'only after your money'. My mother often talked about people having selfish motives, and she had a deep distrust of politicians. If she thought of the House of Commons - and I'm not sure she could imagine such a thing - it was like a rich post office where wealthy people opened letters filled with five-pound notes sent by a gullible public. No doubt I exaggerate. No doubt I overlook her good qualities and focus on her weaknesses. But there was little kindness in my mother; it had all been taken from her. To be fair, my mother wasn't unaware of her role in my education. On some Sundays, she would take me - in my 'good clothes' - on the 85 bus to the Norwich Castle Museum. Here, hand-in-hand, cautious but aware of the free entry, we would walk through rooms of paintings by the Norwich School of Artists. My mother wasn't completely against this activity, and she almost developed opinions on the different subjects. I remember her stopping once in front of a painting of a Roman soldier in full battle gear to say, 'Well, I wouldn't like to meet him on a dark night!' I recall this as the only time my mother tried to make a joke."
CPE_10,"**Philadelphia Avenue**

I walked down Philadelphia Avenue on the odd-numbered side. The evening was getting darker, and the air was thick with a light, prickly rain. This side of the street was familiar to me since childhood. Our neighbors were the Matzes and the Pritchards, and there was Han Kieffer's grocery store. My first friends, all girls, lived in the Kring's and the Pottses' houses. Each house was unique to me, just like the small channels in the sidewalk that carried rainwater to the street. As the street went downhill, the houses seemed to become less grand, with lower porches and smaller front yards. Over time, changes occurred: wooden porch railings were replaced with wrought iron in a Southern or Spanish style. In Shillington, some houses became stores, and some stores, like Pep Conrad's and Han Kieffer's, became homes again. I wondered how people lived in these spaces that used to be shops.

**Bachelor Fads**

Rick Gilbert, a furniture designer, lives in a flat that used to be a curtain warehouse. It has typical loft features like exposed brickwork and large doors. However, Gilbert didn't want an open-plan space because it was hard to separate work from home life. He used a large sheet of corrugated plastic to divide the space, creating a hallway and leading the eye to the kitchen. He wanted the kitchen to be a neutral area for both cooking and meeting clients. To balance the modern look of the plastic and steel, he used light wood for the floors and filled the flat with sentimental furniture from his parents and markets.

**Bruce Chatwin**

Bruce Chatwin's life was full of secrets and stories, making him a unique writer. His first book, ""In Patagonia,"" published in 1977, changed travel writing. It combined imagination, excitement, and deep insight. Chatwin often mixed fact with fiction to make his stories more interesting. He believed that through travel, one could discover histories that seemed to exist just to inspire future explorers.

**Swimming**

During a heavy summer rain in 1996, I swam in the pool behind my house. The rain created small fountains on the water's surface. As the storm grew stronger, the pool seemed to rise to meet the sky. It was then that I thought of swimming across Britain, following the rain to the sea. I wanted to escape the routine of swimming laps and explore the wild, mysterious parts of the world. Swimming, like walking and cycling, allows us to break free from the official version of things and rediscover what is old and wild."
CPE_67,"Text: 'CRYING Charles Darwin thought that humans cry for no clear evolutionary reason. He was probably wrong. More recently, scientists have noted its social importance. Psychiatrist John Bowlby emphasized crying's role in forming the bond between mother and child. Many think that tears, especially in children, show helplessness. But why adults cry is harder to understand. The sound of crying seems less important than the visual signal it sends. In early human groups, crying might have helped build trust and social connections. Tears can also have other reasons. We might cry to show sympathy for those facing great injustice. Additionally, tears can come unexpectedly, sometimes to our embarrassment, when we hear inspiring music or speeches. We might cry during a sentimental movie, but interestingly, this happens more often when we are with others than when we are alone. The social role of crying seems clear, but research is ongoing.'"
CPE_27,"**The Heat is On**

We all know about global warming, but how much warmer will the Earth get, and how will it affect us? Many people have an idea of what global warming is, but its exact consequences are unclear. A warmer climate will likely change the weather everywhere. Since the atmosphere is connected to everything on our planet, changes in climate will affect plants, animals, water, and soil. Humans rely on these natural resources to produce food, build cities, and support billions of people. Any changes to these resources are important.

The problem is understanding how the world will change and what causes these changes. Over the last 100 years, human activities have increased the levels of certain gases in the atmosphere, which are linked to global temperature. These gases are likely affecting the global climate, but we don't fully understand the global heat balance, making future predictions uncertain. We do know that greenhouse gas levels have changed with global temperatures over the past 40,000 years, suggesting a strong connection.

Research shows that the Earth's surface has warmed by about 0.6°C over the past century. Most scientists believe this warming is not natural and is partly due to human pollution. Scientists use computer models called general circulation models (GCMs) to predict future climate conditions. These models use physics and chemistry to analyze temperature, pressure, solar radiation, and other factors. However, they are simplifications and have limitations. Despite these challenges, most agree that climate change will happen faster than before.

GCMs predict that by 2100, the average global temperature will rise by 1°C to 3.5°C, sea levels will rise by 15-95 cm, and precipitation patterns will change. Extreme weather like heatwaves, floods, and droughts may become more common. These changes could affect ecosystems, such as forests and grasslands, and the resources we depend on, like food and water. Some effects might be irreversible and harmful, but not all. Some regions might benefit from climate change. For example, in Australia, warmer temperatures have increased wheat yields since 1952.

However, many predicted effects of climate warming are negative. Small climate changes can affect water availability, especially in dry regions or areas with existing shortages. The Mediterranean Basin is one example, where rainfall patterns have changed. Glacial processes might also change, affecting ice and wildlife habitats. The Arctic ice cover might melt completely, which could help marine transport but increase iceberg risks.

The most dramatic effect of global warming could be rising sea levels, caused by warmer water expanding and melting ice. With half of the world's population living in coastal areas, rising sea levels could lead to severe consequences, like flooding in cities such as London, New York, and Tokyo. Many people could lose their homes, creating environmental refugees. Small island nations might be most affected, as they could disappear entirely, causing devastating impacts on their people and cultures."
CPE_66,"Text: 'Mission to Mars Wanted: a middle-aged, married couple for a 501-day round trip to Mars. Applicants must be physically and emotionally strong. This will be the profile of the first astronauts to go to Mars if multi-millionaire Dennis Tito's plans to launch a capsule on 5 January 2018 are successful. The capsule will take the crew to about 160 km above Mars. The spacecraft will use Mars's gravity to return to Earth without using more fuel, as saving fuel is very important. The 2018 date is set because the next time Mars and Earth are in the right position for a launch is in 2031. It's a big challenge, but the race is on to create systems with new technologies. If these can be ready in time, the spacecraft might succeed. But even if it never leaves Earth, the work to reach these goals will still be useful for future missions.'"
CPE_44,"**Aesthetics**

Sometimes, the very existence of art can make it hard to understand aesthetic theory. This is because art is often seen as just physical objects like buildings, books, paintings, or statues, separate from human experience. However, the true essence of art is what it does to our experience. This misunderstanding can hinder our understanding of art.

Moreover, the perfection and long history of admiration for some art pieces create conventions that block new insights. Once an art piece becomes a classic, it often gets disconnected from the human conditions that created it and the effects it has on people's lives. When art is separated from its origins and its impact on experience, it becomes difficult to understand its broader significance, which is what aesthetic theory tries to explain. Art is often placed in a separate realm, away from other human efforts and achievements.

A key task for anyone writing about the philosophy of fine arts is to reconnect art with everyday experiences. Just like mountains are part of the earth, art should be seen as part of human experience. To understand art, we need to look at the ordinary experiences that we don't usually consider as aesthetic. We must take a detour to understand art theory, focusing on understanding and insight.

For example, we can enjoy flowers without knowing about plants, but to understand them, we need to learn about soil, air, water, and sunlight. Similarly, to understand art, we must start with the raw experiences that capture our attention and bring enjoyment.

Many people enjoy things like movies, jazz, and comic strips without considering them as art. When art is confined to museums and galleries, people seek enjoyable experiences in their daily lives. Even those who oppose the museum view of art often share the same misconception that art is separate from ordinary life. The best appreciation of art happens when it is closely connected to everyday experiences."
CPE_22,"**Observing Lions**

People often imagine lions hunting as a perfect team. In the evening light, a group of lions quietly moves from the shadows and surrounds their prey. Lions seem to be very social animals, working together for a common goal, like getting their next meal. However, after many years of watching lions in the wild, we have a different view. When we began our research in 1978, we wanted to find out why lions hunt together, raise cubs, and scare off rivals with loud roars. If an animal's success is measured by how many surviving offspring it has, then working together might not always be beneficial. If an animal is too generous, others might benefit at its expense. So, why do lions cooperate? We thought we could answer this in two to three years. But lions are very good at doing nothing. Like the noble gases krypton, argon, and neon, lions are often inactive. It has taken many research methods to learn about their behavior. Since wild lions can live up to 18 years, we are only now starting to understand the answers to our questions.

**Pop Music Review**

The release of Bedrock's third album was a big moment for the band. ""New Life"" started a movement that changed rock music in the country for the rest of the decade. The old style of serious music with plain clothes and loud guitars was replaced by a lighter, more melodic style. The album mixed social observations and strong emotions with sounds like fairground organs and brass bands. Humor and irony were important, and the singers didn't hide their accents. Bedrock showed they were good at collecting and observing different styles and were clever songwriters. They wrote about traditional English topics like sunbathing and Sunday afternoons. But the album's real strength was in its gentle, sad songs like ""So Low,"" a beautiful tune about weather, and ""To the Brink,"" a serious ballad. The beauty of ""New Life"" is its high quality - 16 tracks with no filler, which is rare in the era of long CDs.

**Extract from an Autobiography**

As a child, I was fascinated by stories of ""The Sibyl,"" wise women who had influence in the ancient world. I first heard about them in a story my mother told me. An old woman from Cumae offered Tarquin, King of Rome, nine books for 300 gold pieces. He refused, and she burned three books, offering the remaining six for the same price. When he refused again, she burned three more books. He bought the last three for the full price. I realized there was a lesson in the story about salesmanship and life. I was sometimes a lonely child. I would ask to play with other children and be refused. My mother told me to do something interesting so others would want to join me. It worked, and I never forgot that lesson. When I had the chance to write a travel book, I looked for something I wanted to learn about, something relevant to my life. I'm not a big traveler, and I sent my editor a long list of places I didn't want to go. I'm interested in ruins because I like traveling through time in my mind.

**What Becomes of Your Manuscript?**

When you submit your manuscript, it will likely join a pile waiting to be sorted. This pile is called the slush pile. The person sorting it is usually a junior editor or an experienced person who works part-time. They don't have much influence, but they want to find something original. The junior editor wants to make a name for themselves, and the experienced person wants to keep their job. If they think your novel is promising, they will pass it to a senior editor. Eventually, it will be discussed at a meeting. The editor will need to justify accepting your novel based on its quality and potential sales. They will also consider if you seem like a long-term author, which you will have assured them of in your letter. Another important factor is how promotable you are, as a new novel needs all the help it can get. Publishers often like to meet a potential author before making an offer."
CPE_39,"**Advertising on Trial**

If you worked in an advertising agency in the early 1990s, it might have been a very challenging time for you. The recession was severe, lasting longer and being more intense than expected. In Britain, 1991 was particularly tough: the GDP went down, interest rates stayed high, consumer spending dropped, over half a million people lost their jobs, and many homes were repossessed. Every business was affected, especially the vehicle and building industries, which saw a 30% decline. Many people and companies in different countries suffered.

Advertising professionals were not the only ones losing jobs, but those who kept their jobs felt a lot of pressure. They were expected to help improve company profits and were closely watched by their colleagues and bosses. They also had to do more with smaller budgets, being told that ""less must be more."" Despite these challenges, the importance of marketing was growing. Companies started focusing more on producing what customers wanted rather than just what was convenient for them. This shift increased the status of marketing professionals but also added to their responsibilities.

Marketing was seen as a solution to many problems, and since about half of marketing budgets were spent on advertising, the pressure was on advertising professionals. The 1980s were good for advertising, but the 1990s started with a downturn. This was partly due to the economy, but also because companies began questioning the value of advertising. They wanted to know exactly what they were getting for their money and whether it was worth it.

Client companies wanted better strategies, targeting, creativity, media placement, and thinking from advertising agencies. They wanted the best people working hard to produce excellent work. Advertising professionals faced the same challenge as their clients: doing more with less. This was difficult due to the recession, high production costs, and a reluctance to take risks, which are often necessary for good advertising.

Other challenges included demographic changes, the growing power of retailers, changing consumer needs, the rise of sponsorship, stricter legal restrictions, and the challenge of advertising abroad. These factors forced advertisers to reconsider how effective their advertising was. There was pressure to make sure more of their advertising worked.

Help for improving advertising was not easy to find. Companies and agencies were busy dealing with these challenges and were not eager to share their successful strategies. Conferences and seminars offered some help, but books on advertising often did not. They tended to over-praise advertising work, which was not always of high quality or good value for money. This did not help those responsible for advertising in client companies."
CPE_18,"**The Lure of the Kitchen**

When I was at university, I decided I wanted to be a chef. This was an unusual choice among my friends. Cooking was not a popular job that most of us wanted. Being a chef seemed unattractive: the work is long, stressful, and not well-paid. But these things didn't stop me. I was unhappy at university. The work was hard, and the social life was closed and self-important. Being a chef seemed like the perfect solution to this. It promised seriousness and honesty that I felt was missing in my college life. But my desire to cook was not just because I was a student. It also showed an artistic ideal. I first saw this ideal when I ate a meal at a famous London restaurant. It was amazing. I still remember my starter. I finished that meal wanting to thank the chef who made it. I felt happy for days afterwards. After this, I wanted to learn the secrets of this wonderful art. I changed my student life to prepare for my future in cooking. My history degree felt empty, distracting me from my true path. I learned about cooking by reading cookbooks, visiting markets and delicatessens, and making fancy meals.

**The Swimming Instructor**

The school's swimming instructor was a former drill sergeant, small and muscular, with tattooed arms. When I asked him to teach me how to dive, he told me to sit on the pool's edge, put my hands above my head, and roll forward, pushing off with my feet. I practiced that move until the hour was up. The next time, he had me standing upright and diving off the edge. The instructor was strict, and every time I surfaced, he looked at me with disapproval: 'Don't look down, look up!' 'Keep your legs straight.' 'Point your toes, I said!' The next week, I went up onto the high board. It was a fixed board, and its front edge bent slightly downward. It seemed very high as I stood there, trying to gather my courage. Gradually, the echoing voices disappeared, and I felt as if I were in silence. I waved my arms as I had been taught, tried to look up, not down, and jumped into space. For a brief moment, I was flying. When I hit the water, I crumpled awkwardly, and my legs were all over the place. The instructor looked at me with contempt and shook his head. But even he could not lessen my happiness. That's what they mean by 'free as a bird', I thought.

**The Traveller**

For those of us who value a comfortable bed, running water, and the chance of living at least until tomorrow, the idea of the traveller is both confusing and interesting. These are people who choose to risk their lives by climbing dangerous mountains, sailing alone through rough seas, eating insects if necessary, and living for months in the unknown. It is easy to see such people as odd, and indeed they are, like hermits, freefall divers, or writers. They exist, but their strange world is far from our everyday experience and can be ignored, we tell ourselves. We can return to our world of microwave ovens and phones, glad that our only risks are predictable ones like crossing a busy street.

**Sailing**

Jonathan Raban is afraid of the sea, saying it is not his natural place, which is probably why he spends so much time on it. He does not claim to be a top sailor, though he is clearly a good one. His main reason for sailing is that, as a writer, he likes to write about his experiences. Sailing provides exciting stories for him to write about. Raban's small boat has an electronic device that gives sailors their exact position anywhere on earth. While he likes this tool, Raban has a simple view of other sailing aids. He thinks the invention of the compass was a mistake, causing a 'break in the relationship between man and sea'. Raban believes that since it was invented, the compass has become the main focus for sailors, so they no longer study the waves and feel the sea. The ocean, once full of life, is now just a space. Since the job is just to stay on course, the helmsman can be replaced by an autopilot for long periods. This may be why Raban had time to look so carefully at the waves."
CPE_62,"**Holiday Reading**

Summer gives us two great joys: leaving home and reading books. These joys are closely connected. Books help us feel more at home in the world. We can relate our experiences to those in books from long ago or faraway places because there are fewer human types than there are people. In books, we find our own thoughts and feelings. Authors can describe situations we thought we were alone in feeling, or express our thoughts with clarity we can't match. What is unclear in us is clearly expressed in books, especially if written by someone from a different place or time. We feel grateful to these authors for reminding us of who we are. Through reading and travel, we escape the dullness of habit. Our eyes are most open during our first days in a new place, or when reading a great book. Books guide us to notice things we ignored before. Our mind becomes aware of new things. We notice the sky, a friend's behavior, or a sadness we didn't know we felt.

**Author's Note**

These travel reflections were published as articles in the Observer newspaper over seven years. I have restored some small cuts made by the editor, but added very little. I corrected some mistakes, but only if they were details I should have gotten right. I could have made more improvements, but that process would never end. For example, in the second article about China, I thought the Hong Kong dollar would stay strong, but it fell a year later. If I rewrote the piece to predict this, it would no longer be a report from that moment. Like any traveler, I was there at that moment, not knowing what would happen next, and trying to understand what had already happened. This is the story of mass travel: the world opening up to people who can afford a ticket. But I believe that travelers are not blind. Even a postcard can have a purpose.

**Ecotourism**

If there were awards for tourism phrases that have been overused, 'ecotourism' would win. The term appeared in the early 1980s, when people became more aware of the environment. Tour operators realized that travelers wanted to believe their trips wouldn't harm the environment. It quickly became a popular marketing term. Now, 'ecotourism' includes anything from living with remote tribes for two weeks to a one-hour boat trip in Australia. Any tour involving culture, nature, wildlife, or adventure is called ecotourism. The original idea was to help people make informed choices, but the lack of rules left many travelers confused.

**Transylvanian Journey**

I lost my notebook from my Transylvanian journey for 50 years, but found it again by luck. It helped me remember that time and write about it, but it wasn't perfect. In Transylvania, I had an easier time than expected, staying in hospitable country houses for weeks. When I stopped moving, I stopped writing, thinking there was nothing to record. I was slow to start writing again, and sometimes only took notes instead of writing a full story. I worried that some details might be out of order, so I added warnings. But then I realized this wasn't a guidebook, so I let the story tell itself."
CPE_49,"**Fashion**

Fashion is often thought of as a modern idea, linked to the growth of capitalism in the 1800s and 1900s. However, many fashion historians argue that fashion, in terms of style and design, has a long history. They often start with the rise of markets and trade in the 1500s and 1600s. As societies have become more complex, populations have grown, and new technologies for making different types of clothing have been discovered, the meanings of clothing have also become more complex. Today, it is hard to say exactly what any piece of clothing means. For example, a man's suit, which seems very uniform, can have different meanings in different situations and to different people.

**Writer**

Reports of publishers fighting over new manuscripts have given a false idea of what life is like for most novelists. For those not at the top of the best-seller lists, there are two ways to make a living. The smartest among us write in the evenings and have other full-time jobs that are secure even if the book doesn't sell well. Others, like me, do various jobs, such as teaching, workshops, and writing articles. I've heard of writing jobs at a chocolate factory, but I've never gotten one. Somehow, by juggling part-time jobs and credit cards, and often with help from friends, the novel gets written.

**Sudden Fame**

The small venues we were playing at around the country started to sell out, and extra security was needed to manage the growing number of excited fans. We had to use secret entrances to avoid being surrounded by fans. On the few nights we weren't working, it was hard to leave the house without being followed by fans. In just a few days, we became celebrities. Our fans watched our every move, and our management and others took care of all our needs. Even though I was always shy, I felt a strange confidence that only shy people in similar situations might understand. In short, I was emotionally overwhelmed."
CPE_31,"**Music - The Challenge Ahead**

Technological advances are changing our lives at work, home, and during leisure. Susan Hallam talks about their effect on music in Britain. In the late 20th century, there were more ways to listen to music, like radio, TV, records, tapes, CDs, videos, and new multimedia methods. However, live music performances and full-time jobs for musicians have decreased. It seems clear that access to music will keep growing because it meets many human needs. National events always include music, and for individuals, it offers many activities, both formal and informal. A society without music is hard to imagine. The question is not if there will be music in the 21st century, but what kind of music it will be and if people will still want to learn musical instruments.

I believe people will still want to learn instruments. The music industry is a big source of income in Britain, and musical skills will remain important for jobs, especially in media. Besides job importance, playing an instrument may help develop skills early on. Research in the USA suggests that listening to or making music can improve spatial reasoning, a part of intelligence. While these results need more proof, other studies in Europe show that group music lessons can improve social relationships in school and help children focus, especially those with behavioral issues. Further research is looking into whether playing an instrument can help develop skills that can be used in other areas. For example, regular practice might help with good study habits and concentration, and playing in concerts might teach punctuality and organization. Because of these reasons, there will likely be a demand for music lessons in the short term.

What about the long term? Will there be a change in focus, and if so, what direction? I think two things might happen. First, the types of music people listen to will become more varied, with new genres mixing different styles. Second, technology will be used more in composing and performing music, making it easier for people to compose without needing technical skills. However, this might further reduce the need for live performances and musicians who only perform live. Alongside this trend, more people of all ages might want to participate in making music. These activities will likely be community-based and reflect the community's musical traditions.

If this future is to happen, what should the music profession do to prepare? Instrumental teaching will need to change. More people should be able to learn different instruments throughout their lives. This will affect the music curriculum and how progress is measured, requiring adaptation to stay relevant for more people. Ultimately, it will need to include a wider range of musical skills. Training musicians will be crucial. They must motivate, inspire, and teach learners of all ages, work with large and diverse groups, and gain communication, social, entrepreneurial, and management skills for community work. This is a big change from traditional methods and will require accountability. Positively, it offers a chance for music educators to show the high quality of music teaching available.

Finally, we need to raise the profile of music. Music is important in our lives but is often taken for granted. Everyone in the music profession should work together to change this."
CPE_58,"**The Actor's Craft**

Actors sometimes face criticism and disrespect. This often happens when they talk about their work in interviews, as required by their film or theatre companies. Instead of using simple explanations like dancer Pavlova, who said, ""If I could tell you, I wouldn't dance it,"" actors often use clichés or get caught up in gossip. Paul Scofield, a famous actor, once wrote that an actor's work is only alive and interesting when performed. Discussing it makes it seem theoretical and empty. Acting has no strict rules, except maybe being heard clearly. With each new play, actors start fresh, learning and growing with the characters and the writer's insights. When a play ends, actors feel empty until the next project. This emptiness is noticeable when discussing theatre work.

**A Review of Hamlet**

Adrian Lester's performance as Hamlet is a mix of youth and maturity, showing simplicity and confidence. His control over the text and his physical presence make him a standout actor. Lester plays a tense young man with hidden anger, using sharp wit and humor that make him both strong and likable. His performance is skillful, even if understated. Watch how Lester's body seems ready to come alive. Handy's portrayal of Horatio gives a similar impression of being moved by an inner force. This raises questions about acting and behavior: Is acting an imitation or a creation of real behavior? What drives these performances, both morally and physically? This is a key question in theatre.

**One Director's Approach to Rehearsal**

This director's rehearsal process starts with ""dropping in."" The stage manager projects the script on a screen. Actors listen quietly when others speak, noticing the effect of the words. When it's their turn, they look at the screen, understand the first phrase, think about its meaning, wait for the impulse to speak, and then speak. For example, with the line ""Queuing all night, the rain, do you remember?"" actors breathe, let the thought settle, and visualize a scene, like waiting in line for a concert. They find the impulse to speak, which the director calls ""The pathway to the line."" Impulses can come from outside or inside. Actors look into each other's eyes and consider their character's situation. The director encourages not to plan or judge in advance, but to trust that something will happen.

**The Perfect Theatre**

The perfect theatre should make you feel your presence matters. Going to the theatre is an event, and the staff should recognize this. It's discouraging if the staff treats it like just another job. The theatre should create a connection between the performer and the audience. Everyone should feel they have a fair view of the actor, not too far away, able to hear and see clearly. The auditorium's size is important; it should suit the human voice and body. If it overwhelms the actors, it's not right. Many late 19th-century theatres got this right, shaping auditoriums that embrace the stage. Theatres with a sense of history, like worn steps in a church, give a feeling of past human presence. You can't please everyone with plays, and you can't predict what the audience will want. When visiting the theatre, you want to see something unexpected, or you might as well stay home."
CPE_37,"**Paul Simon and Rock and Roll**

In the 1950s, rock and roll was mainly popular among young people. However, its real importance was the big impact it had on middle-class and older people. It also opened the door for the next generation of rock stars, who listened to it and felt that this new, exciting music would be a big part of their lives. For Paul Simon and other young people in the US, the main way to hear this new music was through Alan Freed's radio show, Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party. Freed's show was a must-listen for many future rock stars. Like young John Lennon, who listened to Radio Luxembourg in Liverpool, Paul Simon was captivated by the music on Freed's show. He was ready to move from just listening to music to creating his own.

**Snow Adventure**

There was no clear path, but I thought I would be safe if I walked carefully. The wind was strong, pushing me as I slipped on the ice. Suddenly, the snow beneath me gave way. I fell into a hole about four feet deep. The snow had formed a thin layer over a gap between two rocks, which I broke through. I climbed out, feeling shaken and worried, thinking about what could have happened if the hole had been deeper. I sat against a pine tree sticking out of the snow to think about my situation. In an hour, I had only traveled about half a mile. It was clear I needed to change my plan.

**Qualitative Research**

There are many books that try to help researchers with qualitative research. While they talk a lot about collecting data, they often don't explain how to analyze it. Many people find data analysis mysterious. So, we asked different social scientists who have done qualitative research to talk about their methods. The goal was to share insights about data analysis, not to create a guidebook. This means making hidden methods more clear. Although this seems easy, it is actually quite difficult. We let our contributors present their work in different styles, including personal stories and more formal approaches."
CPE_2,"**Screen Learning**

A few days ago, I saw my six-year-old eating noodles in a funny way. He was pulling them up with his teeth and trying to look fierce. ""I'm a little dinosaur,"" he said. He was acting out a scene from a TV show he watched recently. I asked him what he remembered about dinosaurs, and he didn't remember much. Many people are excited about learning through the internet and computers, but is learning from a screen really effective? One writer shared his experience with an interactive program he tried with his son. The father read the words carefully, but the son was more interested in playing with the pictures. ""If he had spent ten minutes with a book, he might have learned something,"" the father said. Television, as shown by my son and his noodles, is a medium that gives impressions and suggestions. Research shows that learning happens best in an environment where there is dialogue with teachers or parents. It needs to be guided. Using new technology to teach children is fine, but formal education still plays a big role.

**Hollywood**

By 1918, most of the world's film-making had moved to Hollywood. Local people didn't like it, seeing their area of Los Angeles changed by these newcomers. But in the end, they accepted it because of success, which is important in America. Success in Hollywood means making a lot of money at the box office. Hollywood knows a good film when it sees one: a film that might make a star, but must make money. In less than a century, Hollywood grew from a small village to a town as famous as New York, Rome, or Paris. Physically, it has changed a lot: a century ago, you would walk through orange groves to the village store. Yet, in some ways, it is still like a village - small-minded, with limited views - just a part of Los Angeles. For those who live and work there, the main topic is films: how much money they made, who is dating whom, who has been betrayed, and who is working on which project. Successful people often try to leave: to work there, but live somewhere else. Yet, it is still the place where almost everyone in show-business eventually goes.

**Photography**

Photography was invented by nineteenth-century artists as a new art form. These artists wanted a lasting and accurate record of what they saw around them, and they found it. The new combination of light, lens, shutter, and a flat surface with light-sensitive chemicals created images that were more lasting, more realistic, and more detailed than what painters could create in weeks or months. This worried other artists; after their initial excitement about the new images, art critics argued that photography was not art. They said that photography was too connected to the real world and that pictures made by machines could not be considered creative works of art. Despite the critics, photographers knew they had found a new art form, a new way to express themselves. They used the new tools like other artists used brushes and pencils - to interpret the world and show their vision of nature and the people in it.

**Book Illustration**

During the time when book illustrations were in black and white, it was common for every children's book to have some form of illustration. This also included many novels for older readers, although this decreased as fewer copies were printed. Children's publishing was still very active, but it was mostly done on a low budget, which led to a lot of routine and average work. However, the best artists always did their best work. The black-and-white archive is a mix of junk and treasure, a great place for research or browsing, where you can find immediate discoveries or start to appreciate a rich artistic period. The real treasures are likely to be shown to the public again, either through reissues of individual titles, new books about the artists, or exhibitions of original books and drawings. There are signs that, after being ignored for a while, this is starting to happen, and the usual process of bringing back old styles is at work. Eventually, a smart publisher will see the potential for a series of classic children's book illustrations from this period, either in reprints or in new editions using the original artwork if it still exists."
CPE_68,"**Blogging: Sharing with the World**

Some time ago, a website warned about the risks of public check-ins, which are online announcements of where you are. The website's message was clear: you might think you're just telling the world, ""Hey, I'm here,"" but you're also letting everyone know you're not at home. This highlighted the growing concern that sharing too much online can have negative effects. The internet offers many chances to share our lives with a global audience, promising things like wealth and fame. So, we dive into the online world, sharing confessions, personal photos, and stories. But soon, we realize that the internet can be dangerous and overwhelming.

This might sound depressing, but don't lose hope. There is guidance from a group of early internet users. In the early days of the web, they explored these challenges. They lost jobs, made and lost friends, and dealt with the ups and downs of being famous online, all before social media existed. These early users, the first bloggers, have already experienced what many of us are going through now. Before we forget their stories, it's worth learning from them. As the saying goes, those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.

In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started posting on the ""WWW,"" as it was called then. The web was mostly used by students, scientists, and a few young people like him. The web was created at CERN, a physics lab in Switzerland, to help researchers share their work. Hall saw it as a chance to share his life. He created a detailed online autobiography with words, photos, and art. In January 1996, he started a daily blog, and many people were drawn to his bold use of this new medium. Hall's rule was simple: if you crossed his path, you might appear on his site, and no topic was off-limits. While some saw him as an exhibitionist, others saw his work as art.

One day, visitors to Hall's site found it replaced with a video titled ""Dark Night."" He shared that he had fallen in love, but when he wrote about it online, he was told, ""either the blog goes, or I do."" He realized that sharing his life online made people not trust him. He stopped blogging, but the problem remains. Sharing online is great, but if you expect it to make people like you, you'll be disappointed.

In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a web worker in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job at a software company. One day, a colleague sent her blog to the company's vice presidents, including some she had mocked, and she lost her job. Experts call this the ""online distribution effect"": the feeling that we can say things online that we wouldn't say in person. But our online and real lives are connected, and ignoring this can lead to big mistakes.

Armstrong's story ended well. Though she was upset and stopped blogging for a while, she got married and restarted her blog, focusing on her family. Now, she is a successful ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing supports her family. Once an example of online mistakes, she has become skilled at sharing her life carefully. Armstrong learned an important lesson: just because the web lets us say anything, it doesn't mean we should."
CPE_23,"**Enough Sleep?**

Many people today feel tired all the time. In busy and wealthy countries, more people are having trouble sleeping and feeling anxious. In the USA, research shows that 40 million Americans have serious sleep problems. In Britain, some popular books have characters who can't sleep or are set in sleep research labs. People are interested in sleep: how it works, its benefits, and sleep problems. A main concern is that people need more sleep. A top sleep researcher says, ""People sleep less when they're busy. They wake up early to avoid traffic.""

A sleep researcher did an experiment. He let people sleep up to 14 hours a night for a month. It took them three weeks to settle at about eight-and-a-quarter hours of sleep. This shows they needed more sleep than they were getting.

In Europe, a university in the English Midlands studies sleep. They look at how tiredness affects sailors, how airport noise affects sleep, and the dangers of driving when tired. They find volunteers through student newspapers. Volunteers are paid and asked to change their sleep patterns. Dr. Louise Reyner reassures them: ""Some worry because we put electrodes on their heads, but we can't see their dreams or thoughts."" The lab focuses on physical effects.

In a dark room, there's a driving simulator. Volunteers come at 2 pm, when people naturally feel sleepy, after a short or no sleep. They drive while answering questions. The road seems endless, the sun is bright, and the air is warm. Many deny they'll fall asleep. Dr. Reyner has a video of one trying not to. At first, he sits upright, eyes open. Then he blinks more and nods off. Each time, he wakes up suddenly, but the car has already veered off the road. Coffee might help. Dr. Reyner says two cups can make you a safe driver for over half an hour, even with no sleep. She suggests tablets, energy drinks, and caffeinated gum for alertness. Shift workers could use them.

What do we know for sure about sleep? Humans, like other mammals, sleep in a daily cycle. During sleep, we go through four stages, from light to deep sleep. Dreams usually happen in light sleep, and the brain stops the body from moving to prevent injuries. Beyond this, there are theories. Some say sleep repairs the body, restores muscles, or rests the brain. But these might also happen when awake, so it's unclear. Scientists are sure women sleep half an hour longer than men, and older people need less sleep, but they don't know why.

When asked about sleep's purpose, some researchers say, ""Sleep helps us pass time safely."" Sleep patterns may have been different in the past. A history professor found that between 1500 and 1850 in Britain, people had different sleep routines. They went to bed at nine or ten, woke up after midnight for an hour, then had a ""morning sleep."" This time was used for thinking, remembering dreams, or even stealing. The poorest benefited most from this quiet time. By the 17th century, with more artificial light, the rich started sleeping like we do now. The industrial revolution made most people work longer in lit buildings, changing sleep patterns.

Outside Europe and America, the old sleep pattern was common until recently. In some non-western places, there are no strict bedtimes. People sleep for a few hours, then get up. Continuous sleep isn't possible due to noise, fire watching, and predators. It seems people everywhere need more sleep."
CPE_60,"**Simplified Text:**

I was wearing very expensive cowboy boots, each costing 800 dollars, standing on rocks in the Arizona desert. I had the full cowboy outfit, but I wasn't a real cowboy. I looked at the Arizona mountains and realized I didn't belong there. I had flown in from Denver early in the morning, thinking I might look like a cowboy. But when I saw a real cowboy at the Phoenix airport, I knew I didn't fit in. He wore a sweaty T-shirt, needed a shave, and carried a dirty bag. He looked at my new boots, raised an eyebrow, and left without a word.

I used to be a racing driver, and I loved it. I was addicted to driving fast cars, but I don't do it anymore. I wondered what I should do now. A racing driver should have other plans for when they stop racing. I thought I had some, but they didn't work out. I tried to be a commentator for races, but there were too many other ex-drivers doing that. I also tried to sell classic cars, but nobody was buying them that year, so I quit.

Being an ""ex"" anything is hard. People don't want to hear about how I almost became a World Champion. Even if I had won, people would only listen for a short time. Last year's champion is old news. I don't want sympathy because I had a good career and made money. But I miss racing. I miss the thrill of driving fast cars and the excitement of almost risking my life. I miss the attention from fans and reporters. Now that I don't race, my phone hardly rings, and I have a lot of free time.

I looked at the blue sky and noticed some small birds in a cactus. They seemed to be telling me to leave their nest alone. I realized I had a lot to learn about life outside racing."
CPE_1,"**Vancouver**

In the last ten years, many people from all over the world have moved to Vancouver, in western Canada. In the evenings, residents like to walk down the city streets, and if you join them, you will probably hear a different language every few steps. People come to Vancouver for its mild weather, beautiful location between the ocean and the mountains, clean and safe environment, and educational and job opportunities. Some people complain about how quickly new buildings have appeared, but there is no doubt that new residents and the growing tourism industry have helped the city grow. Locals used to call Vancouver 'Terminal City' because it was a gateway to other places. Although the name is not used as much now, Vancouver is more of a gateway than ever.

**Putting Pen to Paper**

Journalists like me are usually not good at writing letters. Some say this is because we don't like writing something we won't get paid for, but I don't think we are that focused on money. It's more likely that because we always try to make a big impact in our work, we lose the natural feeling of writing a letter. Real creative artists, who don't think about the effect of their work (even if they rewrite it many times), don't have this problem. I believe that understanding the impact of their words is the true test of a real artist. When Shakespeare wrote his famous lines, he probably didn't think about how the mix of long words made them powerful, but it showed he was a great writer.

**Supermarket Opening**

In the past, opening a new supermarket in Britain was a big event. You could expect a soap opera star, a radio DJ, or a minor royal to cut the ribbon. Now, new supermarkets open so often that celebrities are no longer needed. Why pay a famous person when anyone can open it for free? Last week, waiting pensioners didn't care who opened the new Superbuy store, as long as they were first in line. One customer heard that the first five men would get a bottle of aftershave, and the first five women would get flowers. This news spread quickly through the crowd, making those at the front feel proud and those who came later feel envious."
CPE_53,"**Citizen Kane**

When the film *Citizen Kane* was finally released in 1941, it faced a lot of controversy. The release was delayed because distributors were afraid of what William Randolph Hearst, who was thought to be the subject of the film, might do to them. Despite getting mostly great reviews, the film was not a commercial success at first. It was television that later made it popular again. *Citizen Kane* is perhaps the one film that has inspired many people to become filmmakers. This is even more surprising because it was Orson Welles's first film. Welles always said that its success came from not knowing what he could or couldn't do, so he just did what he wanted. He had an amazing team, including cameraman Gregg Toland, screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, and special-effects expert Linwood Dunn. When Welles and Mankiewicz decided to create a story about a newspaper owner who was similar to Hearst, Welles knew he had found the perfect project for himself as both director and actor. He took the opportunity with great energy.

**Dermot and Carmel**

Dermot thought Carmel was acting a bit strange that morning. He mentioned twice that he might be late and not to worry if he stopped by the golf club on his way home. He needed to chat with someone, and that was the best place to do it. Twice, Carmel nodded her head in a friendly but distant way, as if she hadn't really heard or understood. ""Will you be all right? What are you going to do today?"" he asked. She smiled and said, ""Funny you should ask that. I was just thinking I had nothing to do all day, so I was going to walk downtown and look at the shops. I thought it was almost a sinful thing, just wasting the day."" Dermot smiled back. ""You're allowed to enjoy yourself. And as I said, if I'm late, I won't need anything to eat. So don't go to any trouble."" ""No, that's fine,"" she said.

**Title Race**

Tea boy? No, I'm a mobile lukewarm beverage resource facilitator.

Human nature provides the most entertaining of comedies. A recent study showed that job titles are a major cause of envy and unrest at work. A survey by a top recruitment firm found that 90% of employers and 70% of employees admit that titles create divisions among colleagues. Surprisingly, the survey found that 70% of office workers would be willing to give up a pay raise for a more 'motivational' or 'professional' job title. If our vanity is so strong that it even overcomes basic greed, we are indeed in trouble. The truth is that in these modern times, nobody wants to be seen as a subordinate. The titles being discussed focus on ability (like specialist or coordinator) but are really just nicer ways to say the same thing."
CPE_55,"Text: I was in Vienna to take photographs. Taking photos was more than just my job; it was a big part of my life. I loved how light could change a scene and how one picture could capture the essence of a place or person. I always hoped to take the perfect photo, as long as I had film in my camera. I once took a photo of a smoke plume from a burning oil well that became famous. It was luck, but they say you make your own luck. After that, I became a freelance photographer, but things didn't go as planned. The mid-nineties weren't as successful as I had hoped, even though my photo was on the cover of Time magazine. That's why I was in Vienna, not somewhere more newsworthy. But I was still taking photos and getting paid for it, which was good enough for me.

I got the Vienna assignment by chance. I had taken photos for a picture book called ""Four Cities in Four Seasons"" featuring London, Paris, Rome, and Vienna. I had just finished the London photos when I was told that the Austrian photographer, Rudi Schussner, had left the Vienna job. The publishers liked my work and offered me the job. I was free, unlike the other photographers, and I was happy to go because things at home weren't great. A week in snowy Vienna sounded perfect.

They put me up at the Europa hotel in the heart of the old city. I had been to Vienna before with my wife, but it was a busy summer trip, and I didn't take many photos. This time, in cold January, it was different. I knew I would enjoy it and take great pictures. The first day, I just rode the trams around the city, getting a feel for the place. I hadn't seen Schussner's work from other seasons because I wanted this to be my Vienna. A photograph captures a moment, and I was waiting for the right moment.

The next morning, I was out at dawn. Snow had fallen overnight, making Stephansplatz look untouched and empty. I wasn't sure how to capture the cathedral in one shot because its spire was tall, and the base was large. I might have to settle for a partial shot, but it could still be magical. Photography has always had a magical quality, even when you understand how it works. Watching a photo develop is still mysterious. That's why what happened at Stephansplatz that morning didn't surprise me."
CPE_50,"**Kinetic Art Rejoice**

Something amazing has happened: London's serious Hayward Gallery has become a place of wonder. This change wasn't due to a big-budget, flashy show, but rather a unique look into a nearly forgotten part of the last 60 years. A new exhibition explores the history of kinetic art, which is art focused on movement, in the twentieth century. It shows that creating artworks that move by themselves or explore the idea of movement has been an ongoing, though often unnoticed, theme in creative work of this century. The exhibition, curated by Guy Brett, who has studied this subject for a long time, includes a wide range of paintings, drawings, documents, and films on kinetic art. These are presented with little text, allowing visitors to enjoy making their own connections and discoveries.

**David Hockney**

Hockney's work attracts many people who might not usually be interested in art. This could be because his art is figurative and easy to understand, or because it offers an escape from everyday life. Some people might be more interested in Hockney's charming personality and humor, which makes him popular in the media. Some critics think Hockney is just an overrated minor artist. However, one could argue that he seems minor because being popular is not always accepted today, not because his work lacks depth. Hockney himself knows his limits and believes it's not fair to dismiss his work because it doesn't fit an abstract idea of greatness. He doesn't claim to be a great artist and knows that only the future can truly judge his importance.

**Window-shopping - an art exhibition**

In recent years, I've seen many contemporary art exhibitions, some brilliant and some mediocre. What bothers me are shows that push a hidden agenda, suggesting a common attitude among certain artists. Sometimes this works, revealing new trends, but often it feels forced. As a curator, I wanted to create a show that was the opposite of this. With seven artists, I took over a space in an empty warehouse. 'Window-shopping' was a collection of individual artworks connected only by the fact that they were art. For example, Sam Cole's knitted cats chased each other on a toy train track, while Matthew Crawley's video camera experiment flickered on a monitor. These works didn't fit into a themed exhibition, but why not show them together? They didn't interfere with each other and, through their contrast, added something to each other. I haven't made any big statements about contemporary art, but maybe there aren't any to make about an activity where artists set their own rules.

**Art History**

People who enjoy paintings sometimes hesitate to analyze them, fearing it will spoil their experience. Some say that art historians, who focus on theory, ignore the pleasure of looking and the act of creativity. This idea is like thinking that knowing a recipe's ingredients and cooking method takes away from the taste of a dish. Enjoying something doesn't mean we can't also know a lot about it. In fact, knowing more might make it more enjoyable. Pleasure is complex, and how we experience it can be questioned. It is also influenced by history. Our preferences are shaped by the values of the society we live in. While the importance of instinctive responses to art is recognized, the idea that intellectual understanding undermines the sensuous experience is an old belief from a time when art was seen as separate from thought."
CPE_25,"**Metals**

Stone Age people might have been interested in metals because they wanted to decorate themselves. Imagine sitting by a river, waiting to catch a fish, when one of our early ancestors found a shiny yellow pebble. It didn't feel like stone, but it was beautiful. This is how gold might have become important to early people. Gold is easy to shape, so it quickly became popular. Copper might have been found by accident too. Once people saw how useful copper tools were, they searched hard for copper ores and ways to extract the metal. This is how metalworking became an important skill for our ancestors.

**St Ives**

We were silent as we carried our bags down the winding, cobbled street leading to the town center. We struggled against the strong wind and tried to avoid the cold waves crashing over the promenade. The streets were empty, and the shutters on every waterfront cottage were tightly closed against the storm. We had watched the weather get worse as we arrived in St Ives on the small railway. As the grey skies darkened, visiting Cornwall in the off-season without a car seemed like a bad idea. I had convinced my friend to come with promises of walks along the beautiful Cornish coast and cozy evenings by the fire.

**Computer Modelling**

Studying the past is difficult because it is gone. The people who lived through good and bad times are no longer here. The reasons they settled in certain places or formed communities are forgotten. Archaeology gives us some clues, but we can't test our ideas with experiments on past cultures. We can't watch the past like a movie. However, computer modelling can help us recreate ancient landscapes and fill them with virtual communities. These digital people have some needs and abilities like real humans. We can set rules for them and change conditions, like reducing rainfall or increasing population, to see how this digital society reacts."
CPE_34,"**Vervet Monkeys**

Cheney and Seyfarth describe a day when the dominant male vervet monkey in their study group noticed a strange male nearby. This stranger wanted to join the group, which could mean trouble for the current leader. To keep the stranger away, the dominant male used a clever trick. Whenever the stranger tried to approach, the leader gave an alarm call that vervets use to warn about leopards. This scared the stranger back into the trees. The plan worked well until the leader made a mistake: he gave the alarm call while calmly walking across open ground himself.

**What Cats Catch**

In a survey in the English village of Felmersham, people collected prey caught by their cats. Over a year, seventy cats caught over 1,000 animals. An American professor saw these numbers and estimated that cats in Britain might be killing 100 million birds and small mammals each year. However, this calculation is not accurate because most cats live in towns and catch fewer prey. The important question is whether these numbers are sustainable. The answer seems to be yes, as many people feed birds in winter, and gardens provide nesting sites. The survey showed that cats are significant predators but not destroying Britain's bird population.

**Buffalo's Day**

Buffaloes are very important to marsh people and are well cared for. Every morning, the buffaloes leave their sleeping area slowly and with groans, heading to the reed beds. They stand at the edge, complaining about the day's work, until the leader finally moves into the water. Once in the water, they seem to forget their purpose and may stay there for a while. Eventually, they swim away, appearing tired and almost submerged, spending the day among the reeds and bulrushes, eating green shoots.

**PICASSO, Pablo**

In 1940, Picasso painted several fish still lifes while staying in the fishing port of Royan. One painting shows a fishmonger's slab with a crab and some soles. The sea creatures look alive, but the painting is hard to read because Picasso used overlapping and interlocking transparent planes. The thin paint and cool colors create a calm underwater world. However, there is tension in the painting, with fish baring their teeth and a crab with open claws, suggesting an impending battle. The sharp forms and a chain around one fish add a sense of danger, giving the painting a symbolic edge."
CPE_12,"**Photography**

Over the past 150 years, photography has been used to capture all parts of human life and activity. In this short history, photography has grown in its ability to capture time and space, allowing us to see quick moments and visualize both large and small things. It has shown us images from faraway places on Earth, distant parts of the solar system, and the social issues of modern life. Photography has become one of the most important ways to express human experiences.

However, using images to record events has a much longer history. The first pictorial recordings date back to the Upper Palaeolithic period, about 35,000 years ago. We are not sure why early cave paintings were made—whether they showed real hunting events, served as magic to increase animals for hunting, acted as religious symbols, or simply decorated living spaces. But images seem to be deeply connected to human culture.

Throughout history, people have questioned how accurate visual images are and their role in society. The idea that ""seeing is believing"" has always given special importance to images. When photography was invented in the mid-19th century, it promised to provide a truthful visual record. The camera, working like the human eye, was seen as a machine that could capture a fixed image, similar to what we see. This chemical fixing of images was considered a natural phenomenon and a cultural achievement, creating images that artists had long tried to make by hand.

Because of the camera's realistic ability to copy what we see, it was thought that everyone could understand photographs. This led to the idea that photography might be a ""universal language."" For example, in 1933, photographer August Sander said that even an isolated Bushman could understand a photograph of the sky. However, with the rise of global communication in the late 20th century, we need to ask if photographs can really cross cultural differences. Is photography as limited by culture as language is? Our familiarity with photos might make us overlook the complex ways they show 'reality.'

Photography is often seen as providing clear evidence, making it seem like a transparent way to communicate, blurring the line between what we see and its photographic representation. It's common for someone to show a photo and say, ""this is my grandson.""

Since its invention in 1839, photography technology and attitudes have changed a lot. Photography has moved from being a simple record-keeper to becoming part of 'mythic time.' Photos, once immediate and personal, have become historical documents, revealing much about the people and society that created them.

I aim to show that the camera is not just a silent recorder of events. Photography does not just reflect culture; it can drive social and political change. For example, the cultural changes of the Italian Renaissance were influenced by new ways of visual representation. Similarly, photography has played a major role in creating the media culture of today, while also showing the harsh realities of the world."
CPE_26,"**How to Write Poetry**

Telling people how to write poetry is tricky. Writing poetry needs spontaneity, but one wrong move can ruin everything. It's risky to act like an expert, so instead, I suggest that beginners should read a lot, write often, and free their imagination in any way that works for them, without going too far. Some people need a stable life to write a poem; others write to escape sadness. Some follow a schedule, while others wait for inspiration. All methods are correct, as long as they are not just copying others. It's important to find your own voice, listen to it, nurture it, and let it grow. One day, it will be strong enough to stand on its own.

**The Short Story**

In a short story, there is no space for too many characters or long descriptions. Flashbacks should be brief and only used if necessary to explain something. A good way to do this is through a quick memory in the main character's mind, which can help move the story forward. Dialogue is very useful because it can show different sides of a question quickly and keeps the reader interested. Overwriting can ruin a short story, but being brief doesn't mean making it too simple. Conflict and action should be strong, and every word should matter in a short story.

**Screenplays**

Writing a screenplay is like playing chess. Many chess players make moves without knowing what will happen next. They might see one or two moves ahead, and that's enough for them. Over time, they learn that chess is more about long-term strategy than short-term tactics. They start to see the whole game, not just individual moves. In chess, as in screenplay writing, the more you practice, the more you understand its complexities.

**Looking at Writing**

Charles Darwin once said that humans naturally speak, but writing is not instinctive. Language is found in all societies, and while languages change, they don't get better. All healthy children learn to speak without lessons. When children are together without a common language, they create one. Writing, however, has been invented only a few times in history, in complex societies, and it improved slowly. Until recently, most children didn't learn to read or write, and even today, many struggle. Children are naturally good at speaking, but writing is a skill that must be taught carefully. We need to understand how writing works and how to teach it to children."
CPE_8,"I have never started a novel with more doubt. I call it a novel only because I don't know what else to call it. I have little story to tell, and I don't end with a death or a marriage. Instead, I leave my reader uncertain. This book is about my memories of a man I met only occasionally, and I don't know much about what happened to him in between. I could make up details to fill the gaps and make my story more complete, but I don't want to do that. I only want to write what I know. To avoid embarrassing people who are still alive, I have given the characters in this story made-up names, and I have taken care to ensure no one can recognize them. The man I am writing about is not famous. He might never be. When his life ends, he might leave no more trace than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the water's surface. Then my book, if read at all, will be read only for its own interest. But maybe his chosen way of life and his unique character will influence others, so that, long after his death, people might realize he was a remarkable person. Then it will be clear who I am writing about, and those who want to know about his early life might find something useful in my book. I think my book, despite its limits, will be a useful source for my friend's biographers. I don't claim that the conversations I recorded are exact. I never took notes, but I have a good memory for what matters to me, and though I have put these conversations in my own words, they truly represent what was said. I mentioned earlier that I have invented nothing, but I have taken the freedom that historians take to put words in the mouths of people in my story that I did not hear myself. I did this to make the scenes more lively and realistic. I want to be read, and I think I am right to make my book interesting. The smart reader will see where I have used this technique and can choose to ignore it. Another reason I started this work with worry is that the people I write about are from another culture. It is very hard to know people, and I don't think you can really know anyone but your own countrymen. People are not just themselves; they are also shaped by where they were born, the home they grew up in, the games they played, the food they ate, the schools they went to, the sports they played, and the poets they read. These things make them who they are, and you can't know them just by hearing about them; you can only know them if you have lived them. You can only know if you are them. Because you can't fully know people from another country just by observing, it is hard to make them believable in a book. I have never tried to write about anyone but my own countrymen, and if I have done so in short stories, it is because you can describe characters more briefly. You give the reader broad hints and let them fill in the details. In this book, I don't claim that my characters see themselves as I describe them; they are seen, like my main character, through my own eyes."
CPE_4,"**POETRY RECITALS**

Throughout history, the world of literature often seems confusing to those living in it. It is only later that people can see the clear patterns and important figures. Today, poetry is especially complex with many different styles and opinions about how poetry should be presented, criticized, and taught. There is a debate between two main groups: the 'literary' poets, who write poems to be read on the page, and the 'popular' poets, who prefer performing their poems to an audience. However, this division is not strict.

Public poetry readings have become more common over the past twenty years. These events happen in various places, like small towns, schools, colleges, and arts festivals. Poets are often expected to perform their work in public, which has mixed results for them. For 'pop' poets, who write their poems to be performed, public readings are beneficial. Their poems are usually simple and easy to understand when heard once. However, on the page, their lack of depth and technique can be more obvious.

On the other hand, poets who focus on the craft of poetry, aiming to include deep passion, thought, and rhythm in their work, may not be fully appreciated by an audience hearing their poems for the first time. The risk is not that they will copy the style of entertainers, but that they might choose to read only their simpler works to connect quickly with the audience.

Listening to poetry readings cannot replace reading poetry on the page, but it can be a fun and educational experience. Hearing poets read their work can help listeners understand the emphasis and rhythm of the poems. It is helpful if the audience can follow along with the text or already knows the poems.

The main reason for popular poetry recitals, sometimes mixed with music, is to make poetry enjoyable and accessible to everyone, not just a select few."
CPE_30,"**Oral History**

Historians are increasingly using oral evidence, but this method has challenges. It is not realistic to think that someone's story is a perfect reflection of the past. During an interview, both the historian and the person being interviewed influence each other. The historian chooses who to interview and what topics to cover. Even if the historian just listens, their presence can change how the person remembers and talks about the past. The final account is shaped by the historian's social position and how they understand history, which can affect the informant. Historians must acknowledge their role in creating new evidence. Even without the historian, the informant's memories are not directly connected to the past. Memories can be influenced by other sources, like the media, or by feelings like nostalgia or later life grievances. These emotions can make the testimony seem convincing, but they might not be from the time being discussed.

**Animal Science**

There are two main ways to study animal science: the physiological approach and the whole animal approach. Physiologists focus on how the body works, such as how nerves and muscles work together to create behavior. The whole animal approach looks at the behavior of the entire animal and what affects it. Within this approach, psychologists and ethologists are different. Psychologists usually study learning in a few species, like rats and pigeons, in labs. Ethologists study natural behavior in animals, often in the wild. Although these fields are different, they are starting to work together more. Physiologists often claim their methods are more basic, but understanding behavior also requires studying it at a behavioral level. Describing a bird's nest-building by looking at nerve cells is like trying to read a book with a microscope.

**The Social Sciences**

Students new to social sciences face a challenge: they must learn both the content and the methods of the subject. They need to understand the knowledge in textbooks and how this knowledge is gathered and organized. These two parts are closely connected. Because we all experience social life, we might think social sciences are just common sense. However, each social science goes beyond common sense. Each focuses on a specific part of social life, uses specific study methods, and has its own concepts. These concepts are the basic ideas that form the 'logical basis' of the subject, allowing social scientists to go beyond everyday understanding and distinguishing one discipline from another.

**Classical Architecture**

In Ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was more than just building structures. The Roman architect Vitruvius said architecture involves order, arrangement, proportion, symmetry, propriety, and distribution. He used Greek terms for some of these ideas, likely from an earlier Greek source. Utility and function are not part of his definition, though he later discusses the best forms for different structures. Initially, the focus is on architecture as an art. The origins of classical architecture are complex. There was a long history of simple constructions in Greece and Italy that did not meet Vitruvius' artistic standards. These simple forms contributed to later architectural ideas. Despite its elaborate appearance, the classical temple is essentially a simple, single-roomed structure."
CPE_7,"The two sisters kept Lily's driving a secret from Chen for a while. Lily would drive around the allotments, the railway line, and the gasworks, even jumping a small bridge with all four wheels in the air, which was her only mistake. She finished her drive by the gasworks, surrounded by the smell of sulphur. Surprisingly, Chen was amused by his wife's secret driving. ""So you can really drive, Lily? Well done!"" he said. Mui thought men were strange; Chen should have been upset, but instead, he was excited and started planning a trip with Lily. They decided on a Monday at the start of next month, the quietest day of the week, to leave early and return by midday, so they wouldn't lose any customers. Meanwhile, Lily would practice driving around the allotments. Mui, despite her doubts, bought a road map and got a ten percent discount, which impressed Chen. Lily felt a bit insulted by Mui's lack of trust in her navigation skills.

Within an hour of leaving home, they were looking at the English Channel. Lily drove perfectly. Even Mui, sitting in the back ready to give directions, had to admit this. On the road, Lily overtook a few slow vehicles with great skill, and Mui kept quiet about her worries. Chen even applauded. After passing through the gasworks of a seaside town, they drove along the empty promenade. Lily parked in a small street with many empty parking spaces. She wasn't sure about the road markings and preferred to pay a fee rather than risk being towed or fined. This carefulness might ease Mui's worries. On the way, Lily noticed her sister's tense face in the mirror, which she used often. It might be best not to mention worries that Mui hadn't thought of.

Lily locked all the van doors and checked each one. ""Don't worry,"" Chen joked. ""No one will want that old van."" The sisters were annoyed. Lily accused Chen of being ungrateful, and Mui scolded him for being too proud and fooled by appearances. Surprised, Chen took Man Kee ahead to look at the sea. He sat his son on the railing and held him. Man Kee was a soft, warm, and increasingly responsive child. He put his small hand on his father's sleeve. In that moment, Chen decided to raise his son his way. Man Kee would learn about business and grow up to own many restaurants. The grey sea made Chen feel thoughtful as he planned his son's future.

There was smoke near the horizon, and then a ship appeared, shining in the morning sun. Chen used a telescope to look at it. At first, he couldn't find it, but then he saw it: a small, old, rusty ship. He lifted Man Kee to the eyepiece. ""Do you see the ship, Son?"" he asked. ""It's a special ship for people like us. It's small and old, but we know it's the ship that will take us home when we're done here. It will take you to your homeland, which you've never seen."" Chen kissed Man Kee's head. Lily and Mui joined them. Lily put her arm around Chen. ""The little old ship,"" Chen said. ""Let your mother see, Son."" Man Kee didn't want to let go of the telescope, and when he finally did, the view was gone. By the time Chen found another coin, the ship was over the horizon, and Lily only saw seagulls following the ship's path."
CPE_43,"Title: The Well

I had read that if you looked from a deep hole, you could see stars during the day. I convinced you to help me test this idea. You watched as I pulled up the well bucket, steadied it, and climbed in. I asked you to lower me down. I didn't think about how heavy the bucket would be or that you might not be strong enough to hold it. You tried to hold the handle but then let go. I fell into the well and hit my head. I saw strange lights, like stars in cartoons when characters get hit. At first, I was dazed, then scared, then relieved, and finally angry at you for letting me fall. I was also worried about what Mother would say. You called down to ask if I was okay. I was about to shout back when you called again, sounding scared, which stopped me. I stayed still, watching you through my eyelashes. You ran off to get help. I quickly climbed out of the well and hid in the shadows near the moat bridge. I heard voices from the castle. Mother and Father came with you and Arthur. Mother was upset, and Father told Arthur to use the winch. You looked pale and shocked. I felt a mix of excitement and fear. Then I noticed the trail of water drops I had left. I was scared someone would see them. Father shone a flashlight into the well. The drops shone in the sunlight, but no one noticed them. Mother was screaming, which made me feel guilty. I realized my prank had gone too far and could lead to serious trouble. I regretted not thinking it through. I came up with a plan. I left my hiding place, pretending to be weak and hurt. I cried out and then collapsed on the cobbles. Mother comforted me, and I told them I found a secret tunnel from the well to the moat. I said I crawled and swam through it to escape. I thought they believed me until Father asked me to repeat the story. I hesitated, and his eyes narrowed. I added that the tunnel had collapsed, so no one could check it. Father looked at me with disbelief and said, ""Don't be ridiculous, boy,"" with contempt. He walked away. Arthur looked at me with pity, seeing through my lie. His look was a silent rebuke, making me realize the seriousness of my actions."
CPE_51,"**REMOVAL DAY**

Susan, a widow, is moving out of her family home now that her children are grown. The moving van had ""Removers of Distinction"" written on it, and Susan noticed that everything special about the house was being packed away. Fred, the removal man, was carefully wrapping fragile items, while his team was not as gentle. Susan was leaving a beautiful four-storey house that overlooked a small harbour. The memories of her children growing up there lingered in the air like dust. 

When they first bought the house, her son Robert, who was five at the time, had asked, ""Mum, when you buy a house, how do you get it home?"" Now, Robert was there helping with the move, making sure Susan didn't mention the piano. Francesca, her daughter, was also helping, insisting that only she could handle the Steinway piano properly.

Fred, the removal man, commented that Susan didn't look like she was going to cry. Susan asked if people often cried, and Fred said they did, usually when everything was packed up. Susan could understand why. She remembered the day they moved in, which was similar to today but in reverse. The piano had been the first thing brought in, and it got stuck on the stairs. The removal men struggled with it for hours until Peter, Susan's late husband, found a solution. They had to take out a window and use a crane to get the piano inside.

Now, Susan was worried about the piano again. The banister rails were still not quite right from the last move. She thought she should have warned the movers, but it was too late. Fred reassured her that they just had the piano left to move. Susan was nervous, but Robert and Francesca were there, watching. 

As the piano was carefully moved down the stairs and out the door, Susan felt on the verge of tears. But when it was safely outside, Robert started laughing, and soon all three of them were laughing together, relieved. As they walked down the path for the last time, Susan's only tears were tears of laughter."
CPE_11,"Text: 'Online Book Reviews for Everyone

Is do-it-yourself book reviewing just harmless fun? From the start, the idea of open access to the Internet was important. In theory, anyone could publish anything online. But in practice, some technical skills were needed, especially in the early days. However, one area that truly opened up to everyone was book reviewing. With Amazon.com, the first popular online bookstore, anyone could try writing book reviews. Amazon's idea was simple: anyone could write what they thought about a book and give it up to five stars. Each book had its own page, and new reviews appeared automatically. This allowed Amazon to have many free reviews, and buyers could see what other readers thought, not just the publisher's description or professional critics' opinions. Other online bookstores did the same, but Amazon, with over 80% of the online market, had the most customers and reviews.

This open system led to some problems. Thousands of reviews were submitted daily, so it was hard to check them all. Amazon had a team to make sure reviews followed their rules. Reviews with just one word, personal attacks, bad language, spoilers, or references to other reviews were not allowed. But reviewers were anonymous, and bad reviews were only removed if Amazon found them. This allowed for some mischief. For example, writers could give their own books great reviews. One writer, Lev Grossman, was upset by bad reviews of his first novel, so he wrote some positive ones himself. His trick worked until he admitted it in an article, and the fake reviews were removed.

Authors could also comment on their books by clicking a link. Most authors used this to encourage readers to buy and enjoy their books. Some even shared their email addresses to talk directly with readers. However, Amazon did not check if the comments really came from the authors, except for famous ones. A little-known writer once pretended to be John Updike, calling himself 'over-hyped', but it was removed as a fake.

The real trouble came from readers' reviews. When James McElroy's book about a cheerleading team was published, it got good reviews from the press. But people in the book felt betrayed and used Amazon to express their anger. Many critical reviews appeared but disappeared after a few days. Despite this, Amazon saw the many reviews as good for business. Reviews were meant to be a 'forum to talk about a book', not a chat room, so bestsellers were watched closely to ensure fair reviews. Silly reviews were more common on less popular books. For example, a children's book called The Story about Ping inspired funny reviews because 'ping' is also a tech term. One review humorously compared the book's plot to Internet technology.

Most reviews on Amazon were serious, and they gave a good idea of whether a book was worth buying. Writer George Orwell once said that reviewing too many books meant pretending to have feelings about them. This makes the open review process seem like a good thing.'"
CPE_14,"**Art in Modern Times**

In the last two hundred years, people often think that every artist must rebel against the art of their time. Art is admired for being unique, revolutionary, and sometimes shocking. We like to admire artists whose work was not appreciated a hundred years ago. But when it comes to modern art, we often hesitate and say an artist has gone too far, and what they do is not art anymore. The media often say this for us, and we agree because we expect art to be confusing and new. We don't notice the old themes and methods in today's art. We think artists should be different from us, with special talents that break the rules. In the past, people asked artists to create art for specific purposes, and it was part of everyday life. Today, we let artists do what they want and get upset if they try to be more ordinary.

**Picture This**

I will describe a situation and ask an important question. An artist chooses a piece of text from an art book. The text talks about the variety of pictures and says, ""There is no end to the number of different kinds of pictures."" The artist asks someone to make a canvas and take it to a sign painter. The sign painter writes the text on the canvas in simple black letters. My question is: Is the finished product a painting?

**Underground Encounters**

At the Mercury Gallery, London until 26th June

It is common for successful painters to stick to one style. Collectors expect artists to continue in the same way, and trying something new often disappoints the public. Gallery owners prefer safe choices, and the art-buying public likes consistency. Some artists, like Picasso and Hockney, successfully change styles. Eric Rimmington is another artist trying something new. His new show replaces his famous still lifes with paintings of the London Underground. Railways interest Rimmington, and his new exhibition, ""Underground Encounters,"" includes 40 paintings and drawings of this underground world.

**Extract from a Novel**

I have come to this island with a few books. The villagers joke that only a sick person would choose such a remote place to rebuild. I am here to heal myself. Apart from an old woman who comes to clean the house, I am alone. I am neither happy nor unhappy; I feel like I am floating in memories. I spoke about the uselessness of art but did not mention its comforts. The comfort of my work lies in the ability to reorder reality through art. Our everyday actions hide the true meaning of life. For artists, art is a way to deal with what hurts us in life, not to avoid destiny but to fulfill it through imagination. Otherwise, why do we hurt each other?"
CPE_63,"**Family Business**

""Look here, it's no good!"" said my Dad. We were in the car going back to London. My father, with my brother Maurice, had just picked me up from the fancy girls' school I attended. He had also just been to Parent's Day, where I received the Latin prize and the prize for doing best in my final exams. He had a long talk with my headteacher, and now we were heading home for the holidays.

""What isn't?"" I asked, though I guessed what he was thinking from his unusual silence. He usually talked a lot. ""You can't fool me. You'll do what you want now,"" he said. ""With all those certificates, I was told you will get a scholarship to Oxford.""

""So?"" I said, trying to be brave. ""Mightn't that be useful?""

""I also hear,"" he continued, and I knew a confrontation was coming, ""that you want to be a barrister. A barrister of all things!"" My father knew a lot about barristers and the law.

""I just said that,"" I replied. ""I couldn't think of anything else to say!""

""And apparently,"" he went on, ""you have the right personality - you can quickly understand a lot of information, you talk well, and you enjoy performing.""

""I don't know about that,"" I said. ""All I know is what I see in TV dramas.""

""Be that as it may,"" he continued, ""I feel your heart's never going to be in the business now. Obviously, you'll go to Oxford University, and after that, I can't see you wanting it.""

The problem was that, like many children of family businesses, I felt trapped by family expectations. I saw other career options and wanted to explore them. At the same time, I didn't want to upset my father. I wasn't as scared of him as Maurice was - I was the favorite - but I found him intimidating.

""It's too soon to know,"" I said weakly.

""I tell you you're not going to want to join us,"" said my father, who was often right about these things, ""and it's a pity because you've got the gifts - the brains, the nerves, the vision.""

""There's still Maurice,"" I said, sulking. My father snorted. We both knew Maurice hated the business.

""Anyway,"" I continued, ""you could always use me as a sort of consultant.""

My mother wasn't around to help - she had died when I was young, and my father raised me and Maurice. Maurice was two years younger, and because he was motherless, I got used to taking care of him. It wasn't hard. I loved Maurice. Because the business was successful, we lived in luxury - a big house in London, fancy schools, nice clothes, parties, theatres, operas. My father knew many people - politicians, actors, businessmen - and our house was full of interesting conversations.

""I tell you what,"" my father said. ""You can help us during holidays until you leave Oxford, and then if you decide to leave us, you can. It will give you some pocket money and be a real help to me.""

""OK,"" I said, relieved to avoid immediate decisions and my father's sulks if I opposed him. This was how he controlled us.

So it happened. In my last term at school, and then during university vacations, I helped out, never more than twice a year, and always on safer tasks. I became one of the smarter students, with a little house, a small but powerful white car, designer clothes, and a black dress with a Paris label for my final exams.

In my last term, my father visited me and took me to a village for a meal and a chat. There were only a few weeks left. My tutor predicted I would get a First Class degree (in Law), and I knew that if I stayed focused, he might be right. I felt confident and concentrated.

This was not to be. My father told me that, in about a week, he needed me for one last assignment, the most important business the family firm had ever attempted, and that it would be worth my while.

""But Dad,"" I protested, ""I've got my final exams coming up, and I need to concentrate on that. It's really important that I do well, and I don't want to think about anything else right now.""

I could tell that such pressures were beyond my father's imagination (or maybe he was jealous of my life away from him?) and that he would see a refusal as a betrayal in his time of need.

That was not all. As he described the procedures, I saw more clearly than ever before the single-mindedness of my father - the clarity and resourcefulness with which he worked, his dynamic energy, and perfect self-control. In his way, he was a sort of genius, and I respected that. It made my own plans seem less important.

""All right,"" I said. ""I'll do it."""
CPE_56,"Simon Costello realized that buying the house in Pembroke Square was a mistake within a year of moving in with his wife, Lois. They could only afford it by being very careful with money, which wasn't ideal. At first, it seemed like a good decision because Simon had many successful cases, and Lois had returned to her job at the advertising agency with a salary increase to thirty-five thousand. Lois was the one who pushed for the move, arguing that their flat wasn't suitable for a family, and they needed more space, a garden, and a place for an au pair. These needs could have been met in a less expensive area, but Lois wanted more than just space. She felt their old address wasn't suitable for their social and professional status. 

To save money, Lois decided one of them should use public transport. Since her job was far away, Simon had to take the crowded tube, which made him resentful. He often thought about his grandfather's house in Hampstead, where his grandmother took care of the family and supported her husband, a lawyer. But times had changed, and Lois made it clear that her career was as important as Simon's. Their lifestyle depended on both their salaries.

Now, their situation was threatened by Venetia, who was very upset. She had confronted Simon with accusations. She claimed that Brian Cartwright, whom she defended successfully, said Simon knew about jury bribery in a past case but did nothing. She also mentioned shares given to Simon's fiancée. Simon denied everything, but his denial felt weak even to himself. He wished he had been prepared and said something different. Venetia's anger and disgust were intense, and Simon worried about the impact on his career. He didn't know what Venetia might do, but even a rumor could ruin him."
CPE_36,"I chose this place to live because I thought I could be anonymous among people who didn't care if the rented houses were falling apart or if the gardens were overgrown. But I was wrong. People in the shops soon start to recognize you. The roses next door remind me that the gardens were once loved. Usually, I stay inside trying to forget about summer, but tonight, I am watching the birds flying between the trees and roofs. I have cleared some space in the garden for a chair, and my arms are scratched from the plants. It is a small London garden where plants must grow tall to survive. 

'Been doing some clearing, I see,' says my upstairs neighbor, Jaz, leaning out of the window. She is a writer with several unpublished manuscripts, and I sometimes have to pretend to like them because I am an English teacher. I have her latest manuscript now. 'How's the work going, Jaz?' I ask. 'In no other job do you have to explain yourself so often,' she replies. Then she says, 'I'll bring something to drink.' I don't want Jaz in the garden, and I realize it looks messy. The only way to the garden is through my flat, and Jaz is knocking on my door. 'So, you're on holiday now,' she says, sitting in the chair while I put a cushion on the grass. 'Cheers,' she says, 'I should've been a teacher - writers don't get holidays. Still, they say, those who can, do, those who can't, teach.' And some can't do either. 'So, what plans for the holidays?' 

I feel anxious about the school year ending. Empty days. Hot pavements with melting gum. Walking to the shops and back. The park with its fountain, and loneliness beside me on the bench. 'Actually, I'm going to Stonebridge tomorrow. Can you feed the cats?' I ask, feeling nervous. 'Of course,' Jaz says, 'if I'm around,' knowing she will be. 'Where will you stay? A nice B and B?' 'No, I'll stay with my oldest friend, Ruby, at the Rising Sun. We've known each other since we were eight.' It's not true, but I often deal with fiction. 'Going back to your roots. So what do you think of my manuscript?' Jaz asks about her manuscript, The Cruelty of Red Vans, which is half-read on my desk. I like the title and tell her. I can see how red vans could be cruel, always bringing gifts to other houses and returning rejected manuscripts to hers. I decide to be honest. 'Let me give you a tip,' I say. 'What?' she asks, upset. 'Try writing about nice people for a change, people who try to be good: less about yourself, more fiction...' 'Teachers!' Jaz says, like a student unhappy with a grade. 'I keep a journal where I write something good about each day,' I say. 'Keep a journal! Nice people! Get a life, Ann.' Oh, I have a life. I have my work, and I go out sometimes and come home, reading on the tube. When we go inside, my calm kitchen reassures me, then I suddenly remember my school geography teacher, Miss Tarrantine, who was about my age now, winking as she said, 'I've had my moments.' We nearly died laughing."
CPE_6,"**Heritage**

Heritage is important because it connects people and communities to the past. We often feel connected to our personal heritage, knowing about our grandparents and their lives. Beyond personal stories, there is a need to learn about our past to understand our future. Heritage gives us a sense of continuity, helping us find our place in history. Just like we inherit genes, we also inherit culture passed down through generations. Even if there are parts of our national heritage we don't like, it is still ours, and it feels good to belong to something. Heritage teaches us a lot and is important for our well-being. It influences everything from customs to material culture. In the past, we connected with our heritage through stories from our ancestors. However, Western industrial society broke up communities, and much of that oral tradition is lost. Now, places and buildings help us learn about our past. It is important to preserve these links to honor our ancestors' identity.

**The Fens**

I started writing a novel called ""Waterland,"" where the landscape of the Fens in England became important. People often ask why I, a Londoner with no personal connection, chose to write about the Fens. The simple answer is that I chose them because they seemed plain and empty, a good setting for my story. But I learned that the Fens are not flat or empty. They are as English as any other place but also strange and mysterious. It's surprising that in the middle of England, the Fens feel foreign to many English people. They are both empty and full, cultivated and wild, open yet mysterious. While writing, I didn't visit many places in the Fens. As a fiction writer, I prefer imagining worlds rather than seeking proof. Imagining the Fens has its own logic because, as Edward Storey's book shows, the Fens are not just a landscape but a state of mind.

**Museums**

Museums should make their collections easy to access. In the past, this meant putting items in display cases with long labels. Now, accessibility means more. Displays can be lively and interesting, using techniques to capture visitors' attention and emotions. Museums should do more than just display items. They should make collections available to the community. For example, they can provide loan boxes for teachers or materials for elderly people with memory loss. Museums focus on real artefacts and specimens, not replicas. They offer encounters with authentic items that existed and had meaning in history. This is their strength and what sets them apart from heritage centers, theme parks, books, and digital media. Museums that embrace this challenge and offer exciting displays and programs will find that virtual history can actually help them by increasing interest in the real items they have.

**Architecture and Environment**

The desire to preserve things is not new, but changes in our towns happen quickly and affect us all. This makes some people want to preserve everything, while others think more about the nature and future of towns. It can be argued that people who lived through events like world wars are more interested in preservation. Stability becomes important to them. If there is a need for preservation, planners should consider it. Change is not bad if we learn to manage it. Physical changes in towns reflect social changes, like changes in population, welfare, and demands."
CPE_33,"**Einstein**  
If you ask someone on the street to name a scientist, they will probably say Albert Einstein. His face is often used to sell products related to intelligence, like computers and encyclopedias. Most people don't know much about what Einstein did, except that he created theories called 'relativity'. These theories are famous for being hard to understand and for making strange predictions that seem different from everyday life. Einstein was part of a big change in scientific thinking, which started modern science in the 20th century. Scientists were trying to describe the universe better by studying matter and natural forces. Einstein made important contributions by rethinking the basics: time, space, matter, and energy. Before him, people followed Isaac Newton's idea of a universe where stars and planets moved in a fixed space and time. Einstein changed this idea, saying that time and space are not fixed but relative.

**Young Readers**  
When we were children, Lydia and I didn't trust books that won prizes because we thought they would be 'worthy', which to us meant 'boring'. Our mother didn't like our attitude and often criticized us, but our father would happily give us small amounts of money to encourage us to read these books. He would also include a few good books among our Christmas and birthday gifts, marking them with 'This Book is NOT Literature'. Although we ignored most of his choices as 'boys' books', he did manage to introduce us to some good short stories and, once, a famous collection of poems.

**Language**  
In 1851, Jacob Grimm wrote that 'The origin of human language is truly secret and marvellous'. This mystery has led to many strange ideas. In 1928, Charles Caller claimed that early humans might have made sounds like ""meuh"" when they felt danger. ""Meuh"" sounds sad. Humans in dangerous lands with scary animals made desperate noises, and some languages kept these sounds, like 'malaria' meaning ""fever"" or the Latin 'mors' meaning ""death"". Because of such odd ideas, many people avoided the topic, thinking it was for eccentric thinkers. However, recently, the origin and evolution of language have become important research areas. Language likely developed in East Africa about 100,000 years ago. It was mainly used for friendly communication and was important in power struggles. Sharing information was probably not its original purpose, unlike what philosopher John Locke thought when he described language as a 'great conduit' for sharing knowledge."
CPE_20,"**Writing Reviews**

Frank Kermode looks at the skill of writing reviews from a writer's perspective. Most reviews are written and shared in ways that make them last only a short time. There are deadlines and strict limits on their length. Once published, they stay relevant only as long as the newspaper they are in—maybe a day, a week, or at most a month. The short life of reviews often affects their literary value. Many people, including the writers, think reviewing is a job done for reasons like needing money or because they can't spend all day working on a novel or a serious book. However, reviewing is a skilled and complex job. It's one thing to be quick and fair in a short newspaper review, and another to write a detailed piece for an international journal. The fifteen hundred words of a leading article in weekly magazines have challenges of both short and long reviews. 

Length isn't the only thing to consider. Reviewers need to think about their audience, from casual readers to those deeply interested in the subject. A reviewer must know a lot about many topics and write in a way that intelligent people can understand and enjoy. This means reviewers often write other things besides reviews. The American novelist John Updike, who doesn't think highly of criticism, still enjoys writing reviews between his novels. He collects all his reviews, even the short ones, into books with modest titles. Some might think lesser-known writers should accept that their reviews are temporary, but if they can, they should enjoy some permanence, especially if they believe their best writing is in reviews. I feel this way about my own work. My main job has been academic, and most of my serious books are academic, the kind professors like and are expected to write. 

In the English-speaking world, unlike other cultures, there isn't a strict separation between reviewing and literary study. It's common for the same people to do both. The days are gone when academics criticized professors for writing reviews, saying it was a waste of time or undignified. Complaints from non-professors that professors are taking their jobs are also less common now, partly because there is more reviewing work available. I believe this is good for readers, as they can trust the reviewer knows what they're talking about, and for professors, as it helps keep them balanced. It also reminds them to communicate clearly with non-professors. When talking among themselves, they might use complex language, but when addressing intelligent non-professors, they need to be clear. Finally, reviewing should be a secondary job. You can only do it well if you are also doing something else well."
CPE_40,"Ralph unlocked the door to his apartment and, as he entered the dark, still hallway, he felt a brief doubt about owning it. Even after three years, this feeling sometimes came when he returned home alone at the end of the day. When he first bought the flat, he would come home eagerly, often as early as possible, wondering what the flat had been like while he was away. It felt like a welcoming place to him, where he was in control. He thought he should worry about intruders or problems like burst pipes, but the flat always seemed to be waiting for him, either tidy or messy, depending on how he left it. Over time, he started to see it as just another part of himself, a space filled with his thoughts and feelings. He became frustrated that it couldn't change. Sometimes, there would be a small pile of letters by the door or the answering machine would be blinking with messages. He was thankful that the windows hadn't been broken or the flat damaged, but he wondered what it would look like if it were. From his dull office on the Holloway Road, Ralph often looked forward to his three or four quiet evenings at home each week. Once he left the busy office and started to feel like himself again on the bus ride home, he realized he didn't need to be alone, a fact he often forgot when planning his social life. At his desk, he would long for time alone with his things, but once he got home, he felt empty and waited for a sense of self to return. Instead, he felt a deep emptiness, making him think that doing work he didn't like had changed him, moving him away from who he thought he was. He would often read or listen to music as the night went on, but he started to question why he did these things. His sense of direction in life had become unclear, and his thoughts and feelings seemed lost, unable to connect. He remembered a time when he didn't feel so powerless, when he might have escaped if he had realized his own worth. But he had been eager to settle into something and followed the first opportunity that came, as if it was meant to be. After university, he tried to make a plan for his future, but he wasn't surprised to find that he just wanted to survive quietly. He applied for jobs he heard about from friends, following their paths without imagining he could find happiness in his work. He went to his only job interview gratefully and didn't think to question the job—a vague editorial role at a free local newspaper. He was relieved to have a pleasant conversation with Neil, his boss, and didn't think about the long meetings he would face daily. Neil offered him the job on the spot, saying Ralph was the only graduate who applied, which Ralph took as a compliment at the time."
CPE_45,"**Goat Racing**

I was about to see goat racing. It was Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. I moved through ice-cream vans, many people, food stalls, and loud music. Everyone was going to the racecourse, and I pushed through the crowds to find a good spot. An area was marked off for the race. It wasn't like big racecourses, but people stood on both sides of the track where the goats would run. It was hard to keep the goats in order because they are known to eat almost anything.

**Canoe Trip**

As the day ended, I started to worry about the night. The canoe was too wet to sleep in, and there was nowhere to stop. We hadn't seen any villages or huts since morning. In the dim moonlight, we used our torch to see the cliffs, but the torch batteries were dying. We put in new ones, but they didn't work. We couldn't find a place to camp. A few miles later, Lesley thought she saw a light, and we got hopeful, but it was just moonlight on the waves. Soon, we heard the loud noise of fast water, but we couldn't see what was happening. Time seemed to stop as we moved on.

**How to be Presentation Perfect - we answer your questions**

I am not good at making presentations, but as a managing director, I have to present to my colleagues and major shareholders. How can I improve my presentation skills and confidence? 

You are not alone. Presenting is a different skill from running a company, but many senior executives need to be good at it. If you want to convince your audience, you must believe in what you are saying. Show your belief with passion and enthusiasm. This means you must prepare well. Test your ideas in advance. Ask colleagues to think of the 'hard questions' your audience might ask. You also need to create a positive atmosphere from the start. Begin with something everyone agrees on and slowly build to your conclusion."
CPE_64,"Some activities cannot be rushed. They take the time they need. If you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you add oil too quickly to mayonnaise, it will curdle. If you pull too hard on a tangled fishing line, the knot will get tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some things it does very fast, while others take longer. We can get faster at solving puzzles or doing math in our heads. But some things cannot be rushed, or they will fail, like the mayonnaise or the fishing line. Telling someone to ""think fast"" can be as silly as trying to sleep in half the time. We learn and think in different ways, and these ways work at different speeds and are good for different tasks. ""He who hesitates is lost,"" says one saying. ""Look before you leap,"" says another. Both are true. The mind has three different speeds. The first is faster than thought. Some situations need an instant reaction. When my motorbike skidded on a wet road, my brain and body reacted quickly to keep me safe. A concert pianist or an Olympic fencer also reacts without thinking. This fast intelligence could be called our ""wits."" Then there is thought itself: the kind of intelligence that involves figuring things out, weighing options, and solving problems. A mechanic fixing an engine, a scientist interpreting results, or a student working on an assignment all use this kind of thinking. We call this intelligence ""intellect."" Someone good at this is called ""bright"" or ""clever."" But there is another, slower way of thinking. It is less clear and more relaxed. When we are lost in thought by the sea or just waking up, we are in this mode. This slow way of knowing is just as smart as the faster ones. Letting the mind wander is important, even when life gets busy. Thinking slowly is a key part of our mental skills. We need the slow mind as much as the fast one. Some problems are better solved with a slow mind. Some mysteries need a relaxed attitude. Recent studies show that slower thinking is good for understanding complex or unclear situations. Deliberate thinking works well when the problem is clear. But when we don't know what to consider or the issue is too subtle, we need the slow mind. If the problem is managing a difficult group at work or deciding to change careers, it might be better to think slowly. This type of intelligence is linked to creativity and wisdom. Poets have always known the limits of deliberate thinking and have used slower ways of knowing. Philosophers have written about the parts of the mind beyond conscious thought. Recently, scientists have started to study these slower ways of knowing. Cognitive science shows that the unconscious mind can do many important tasks if given time. It can learn patterns too subtle for normal thought, understand complex situations, and solve difficult issues better than fast thinking."
CPE_29,"**Surviving in a Foreign Land**

I have been welcomed warmly. It's a friendly and well-equipped base camp in a very isolated place. At any time, there are about forty people - scientists, students, weathermen, satellite trackers - in a close community where everyone helps each other. My basic French is just enough to communicate, but not to have casual conversations. I miss the small details, and my phrasebook is useless at breakfast. This isn't a practical problem for me, but at first, it affected my self-confidence. I was a bit nervous about mealtimes. I would hesitate, unsure which table to choose, worried about the silence when I spoke, anxious like I was in the first weeks of school. I still smile awkwardly or panic when people talk to me. I think the reason for this occasional sadness is not about missing company or communication, but because I've lost the social advantage that my ability to talk has always given me.

**Elliot**

When I first met Elliot, I was just a young author like any other, and he didn't pay much attention to me. He never forgot a face though, and when I saw him again, he shook hands with me warmly, but didn't try to become friends; and if I saw him at the opera, for example, he was with important people and didn't notice me. But then I had a big success as a playwright, and I noticed that Elliot was more interested in me. One day, he sent me a note inviting me to lunch, and I thought he was testing me. But after that, since my success brought me many new friends, I started to see him more often.

**Alfred Hitchcock**

The film director Alfred Hitchcock always said that he didn't care about the story of his films, or even the acting, but he did care about the photography, the soundtrack, and all the technical parts. For Hitchcock, it wasn't a message or a great performance that moved the audience; he believed that people are excited by pure film, no matter their cultural background. So, if a film is made correctly, in terms of its emotional impact, the Japanese audience should scream at the same moment as the Indian audience. Hitchcock's view of himself was always clear, logical, and hard to argue with. He was a man of reason and a talented craftsman who liked to hear an audience scream. He didn't deal with guesses, abstract ideas, or intellectual hints, and his view of his own film characters was not deep. He focused on film, pure film, and the most precise, calculated beauty of what a strip of film can do to an audience."
CPE_57,"**Amateur Astronomy**

Many things have changed in astronomy over the last 50 years. About 30 years ago, there were not many charts and catalogues. Telescopes were limited, and there were few books on practical astronomy. Today, you can find many telescopes and equipment for almost everything you need. Electronic calculators and computers have changed how we make almanacs and charts, and they help with analyzing observations and publishing results. This might be the best time for amateur astronomy. However, some things have been lost. Now, you might need to travel 80 km to find a sky as clear as it was in cities 50 years ago. During the day, airplane trails can last for hours and turn into clouds, making it hard to observe the sun and stars at night.

**Too Much Choice**

Society now has too many choices. There are too many things to do and too many options. In today's economy, people always want the newest product or service, and technology makes changes happen faster. New products come out quickly, and it can be overwhelming. More choices can mean more stress, less time, and more complexity. Because of this, people are looking for 'simplexity' - simple things that give meaning in a complex world. But simplifying life is hard when there are so many products and services. There are more types of detergent and breakfast cereals than we need, and more software updates and phone plans than we can follow.

**McAndrews Hotel**

Every summer, we spend two weeks at McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. It is a family tradition started by my grandmother, and now it is very important to us. Nothing can change this ritual. The people who stay at McAndrews are similar: old-fashioned, maybe a bit odd, and some might say snobbish. I do not like the bad manners and rudeness of shop assistants today, which some call equality. I dislike friendly behavior from waiters who seem like they might slap you on the back. I know most of the other guests' names because they have been coming here since they were children, like me. But I can be sure that when I meet them in the hotel, we will only exchange polite greetings. Such respect for dignity and personal privacy is rare in hotels these days."
CPE_9,"**Othello**

The move of a great production of Shakespeare's play ""Othello"" from Stratford to London gives me a chance to correct a harsh review I wrote when the show first opened last spring. At that time, I said Ray Fearon was too young for the main role and criticized his acting. I still believe that changing the age difference between Othello and Desdemona affects the story, but I take back my negative comments about Mr. Fearon's amazing performance. In fact, the entire cast is excellent. Unforgettable scenes include Cassio's risky games with other young officers and the moment when Iago starts to lose control and struggles to regain it. I dare anyone not to cry during the scene where Emilia helps Desdemona get ready for bed. The pace and tension are fantastic throughout. Don't miss this production.

**Lake Vostok**

In the center of Antarctica, nothing moves. On the edges of the continent, there are many penguins, seals, and birds. But on the large white plateau inside, there is no life. Except, there is a huge hidden area of freshwater called Lake Vostok, which is under almost 4 kilometers of ice, right below the coldest place on earth. The water has been cut off from air and sunlight for up to 25 million years. Biologists are eager to explore its mysterious depths and find out what strange creatures live there. Geologists and glaciologists are also very interested. For two years, researchers from around the world have been planning how to uncover the lake's secrets, and if they succeed, the next few years will be known as the decade of Lake Vostok.

**Scientists**

There was an interesting discussion on the radio last week. It seems that some scientists are very excited about what motivates them to be scientists; the phrase ""because it's there"" comes to mind. We all know it's the old search for knowledge, the wish to understand everything from atoms to black holes. But these scientists want to know why we want to know all of this in the first place and why science can't explain our curiosity. Surely, it's more important to know if what we scientists are doing is right, rather than getting stuck in debates about the purpose of it all. I think the key issue is not why we pursue science, but to understand that science is a tool, and we should decide how, where, when, and why to use it."
CPE_42,"**Food**

Our relationship with food is very basic and satisfying. Many people who love cooking buy cookbooks like this one. Often, we think that only special occasions or complex dishes are worth cooking. This is not true. You can make a delicious soup by simply putting some chopped carrots, a leek, celery, and herbs into water. This is more satisfying than buying a packet or opening a can. Instead of buying a chocolate mousse with preservatives and additives, you can make a delicious dessert in five minutes that both adults and children will love. Cooking is also a way to show care and love by bringing your own creation, no matter how simple, to the table. Sharing food is full of symbolism and meets our deep human needs. This is why all our celebrations, like birthdays, anniversaries, and engagements, happen around tables. No one would have a takeaway for a wedding or anniversary party! Few people would want to discuss a business deal over canned soup.

**In the Elevator**

This morning, Alistair tried to tidy up his office, but papers were still everywhere. Tax forms were overflowing from desk drawers and boxes, waiting for a day when he felt like filing them. He also had extra paperwork from owning an apartment building. Books and journals were near the new bookshelves but not organized. As the elevator took him to his floor, he knew Mallory would be on time for their meeting. She would knock on his office door exactly on the hour. She was very precise about time and neatness. How would she react to the mess? She might think his office had been vandalized. He could pretend to be shocked when he walked in behind her. Mrs. Wilson, his cleaning lady, arrived while he was trying to clear some space on the carpet. He smiled at her hopefully as she unlocked his apartment door. Her eyes showed she had no intention of cleaning his office. She believed he was from somewhere far away, not from her world in Brooklyn.

**Karen**

Karen wanted to be different from her mother, which led her to create her own story of strength. In her story, there were important moments, like when she was twelve and her brother accidentally hit her in the eye with a golf club. At first, she thought she was blind, but the doctor assured her that the bone had protected her eye. She only needed a few stitches. When she opened her eyes in the doctor's office and saw her mother talking about miracles and small mercies, she felt she was saved for a purpose.

**Miss Fogerty**

Miss Fogerty was walking across the wet grass of the village green, feeling both excited and sad about what she had just seen. It is exciting to be the first to know something important, especially in a small community, and Miss Fogerty's life was usually quiet. However, she was very sad about Dr. Bailey's condition. He had been her doctor for many years, and she appreciated his care for her yearly laryngitis, which was her only health issue. His best quality, she thought, was making patients feel he had plenty of time and truly wanted to hear their worries. This quality made him very popular in the village. He always gave his time, knowledge, and humor, and in return, he received loyalty and affection."
CPE_59,"Joanna's Lessons

Joanna MacGregor is a busy concert pianist. So why has she decided to write books for young children learning the piano? Even someone who doesn't know much about music would be impressed by a Joanna MacGregor performance. Watching her play difficult pieces is like seeing a pianist push their limits. But even her amazing skills didn't impress one small boy at a recent concert for kids. He listened to her play many different styles of music, like classical, jazz, and blues. He even watched her play the piano strings directly, which usually amazes kids. Then, when she asked for questions, he asked, ""Can you play Match of the Day?"" Many experienced pianists might be surprised by such a request, but Joanna found it funny. ""In his eyes, until I played that, I wasn't a proper pianist."" Of course, she played it and probably remembered the experience for her next children's concert.

Joanna MacGregor is unique among top pianists because she cares about how young children learn the piano. She has just published her own beginner piano book for children: Joanna MacGregor's Piano World. She did this even though she has a very busy schedule. She is performing at many festivals this summer. Tomorrow, she will work with nine young composers and artists. She also runs her own recording label, Sound Circus. She loves collaborating with other artists. So why did she decide to write a book? ""People who know me are surprised. But I think the first lessons are very important. We often focus on the idea of a child becoming a great musician. But most people are interested in music in a more everyday way. I find that more interesting!""

In writing her books, MacGregor uses her own experiences. Between the ages of 18 and 25, before she became a concert pianist, she taught beginners the piano. Her childhood was also filled with music, as her mother taught piano to many children. ""I was always playing around on the piano, and there were kids from all backgrounds wanting to play all kinds of music. I wasn't part of a system that forced talent. I grew up with the idea of making music available to everyone."" She believes everyone should have the chance to learn the piano, just like learning to swim or speak a little French. Some kids learn quickly, but she is interested in those who take their time and enjoy it, even if they eventually stop. Some kids find the beginning too hard, while others quit later when they feel pressured to be like talented kids on TV. ""I worry that some people use music, like sport, to make their children achieve things, instead of just enjoying it. Kids stop because they feel they can't meet their parents' expectations.""

Her book raises a question: does she think other piano books or teaching methods are not good? ""I'm reluctant to criticize other people's teaching or books,"" she says. She admits her books are not the only ones that make learning fun. Her special idea is to include a story in the books and CDs to make learning interesting. From the first lesson, there are different styles of music for the teacher or parent to play with the child. If parents can't play the piano, the music is on the CDs. Learning should be fun, MacGregor insists. ""You have to let them improvise and play all over the keyboard."" As children progress, they need to learn to read music, not just play by ear. MacGregor understands this because she relied on her ear as a child. But she believes practice is the most important thing. How can children be encouraged to practice? She admits she didn't practice seriously until she went to the Royal Academy of Music, where she had to practice difficult pieces. Now she loves it. She practices eight hours a day, which is the most important part of her musical life, even more than performing. ""I understand people who find it hard. I don't think people talk about it enough."" The secret, whether you practice for twenty minutes or five hours, is to know what you want to achieve, she says. Other tips: reward yourself by playing the whole piece, even with mistakes. And mix hard pieces with easy ones."
CPE_54,"**Writing by Hand and on Screen**

Dr. Johnson once said, ""What is written without effort is in general read without pleasure."" This means that good writing is often difficult to create. When I look back at my handwritten school essays, I notice there were very few mistakes. Today, I would rewrite them many times. I think this is because writing by hand is hard work. Writing slowly helps the brain to think carefully. When it is hard to change or erase something, we write with more care. On the other hand, using a computer can make us careless. Many writers find that they spend as much time fixing their computer drafts as they did writing by hand. Similarly, emails, unlike handwritten letters, can be emotionally heavy. Some say that emails have brought back the art of love letters. Many love emails are sent now, where before there was only small talk. This is good because at least these emails are written in some form of English and grammar. But words on a screen can feel dull. Writers who are not used to the power of words may exaggerate their meaning. Words typed quickly lack the care and personality of handwriting.

**The CD**

I put down my cup and looked at the CD. The case was not impressive, but the shiny disc inside was interesting. ""Wonderful little things, aren't they?"" Mr. Warriston said as he came back into the room. I agreed and carefully handed the disc to him. ""It's amazing they can hold seventy minutes of music,"" he said, bending to the hi-fi device. He turned it on, and lights came on. He pressed a button, and a small drawer opened. He put the disc in, pressed the button again, and the tray went back in. ""Some people say they sound sterile, but I think they..."" ""Do you have to turn them over, like records?"" I asked. ""What? No,"" Mr. Warriston said, standing up straight. ""No, you only play one side."" ""Why?"" I asked. He looked puzzled, then thoughtful. ""You know,"" he said, ""I have no idea. I don't see why you couldn't make both sides playable and double the capacity..."" He looked at the machine. ""You could have two lasers, or just turn it over by hand... hmm."" He smiled at me. ""Yes, good point."" He nodded at my wooden chair. ""Anyway. Come on, let's get you sitting in the best place for the stereo effect, eh?"" I smiled, happy to have asked a technical question Mr. Warriston couldn't answer.

**Books versus Electronic Text**

When comparing books and electronic text, author Malcolm Bradbury was right when he said that if matches had been invented after lighters, we would have been amazed by the improvement. Many people, excited by new technology, say that electronic text is as important as the invention of printing and that it is almost complete. They forget that changes in how we think take a long time. This kind of thinking is called chronocentricity, which means believing that your own time is the most important in history. For example, a book from 1979 said that books would start disappearing in the 1980s. This prediction was wrong. Reading long texts on a screen is not enjoyable, so most people don't do it. Also, the way information is organized on computers makes people read only small parts of text. Some people say this leads to new ways of storytelling, but there is nothing new about reading non-linearly. Many books, like religious texts, dictionaries, and poetry collections, are not read from start to finish. What is new is that computers do not encourage reading a whole text.

**The Office**

Charles walked into the office and saw a perfect world of order. The carpet was clear of the papers that had covered it since it was put down, and the desk was dark wood, just as he remembered from the auction five weeks ago. Neat file-holders were being put in their drawers. Twelve years of trade journals filled the shelves on one wall. Kathleen struggled to close the filing cabinet and then turned to him. ""You have to use computers, Charles. This is too much."" ""Hello, Kathleen. Oh, this is amazing."" He admired the room and its antique furniture. He was not thinking about a computer or any other machine in it, not even a pencil sharpener. ""Simply amazing,"" he said, avoiding the topic of computers. Over the two years he had known her, they had this conversation many times. She could not understand why he resisted technology when he was so good with computers and had even published an important paper on computer skills. She had inspired that paper. With a keyboard, she could change any software into something new and exciting."
CPE_32,"Text: ""You don't take sugar, do you?"" shouted his secretary. She wasn't really asking because she had been making Lancelot coffee for many months. Her excuse for forgetting was that he wasn't usually supposed to be there. But now he was there all the time because he found that staying away led to chaos. He thought about how he had gone from being a valued advisor, meeting authors and playwrights over lunch, to a stressed worker with nowhere to park in the mornings. ""This came,"" she yelled, waving a manila folder before putting it down in front of him. ""From that guy in Los Angeles. You said you wanted to see it."" A typed label said: ""A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert."" Below that, it said ""An Expanded Synopsis."" Lancelot did not want to see the word ""synopsis."" He wanted to see ""A First Draft."" He had already seen a synopsis of this book and didn't want to see another, even if it was revised. Ian Cuthbert had been given a large advance for this book when Lancelot bought the company. Ian was one of several old friends Lancelot had made the mistake of commissioning books from. Ian was proof that a person with a difficult personality would become even harder to deal with. Lancelot skipped the introduction, which he had read many times, and looked at the synopsis. He recognized almost every phrase. He closed the folder and put it aside. Clearly, Ian's manuscript would never be finished. The synopsis lacked the brilliance Ian was supposed to be famous for and had a tone of lost conviction. Lancelot remembered stories of a famous author whose last book was published incomplete after his death, with payments made chapter by chapter. But in that case, the payments were parts of an advance that had never been given. Ian's advance had been huge, a reversal of the business principle that authors must deliver a manuscript to be paid later. Lancelot, who studied modern languages at Oxford, remembered when Ian was the most promising talent in a Cambridge full of promise. Ian's peers had taken over British theatre quickly, but Ian's energy seemed like laziness compared to them. He wore his coat like a cape and talked about famous writers as if he had been there. Yet, Ian's creative talent remained hidden. While others succeeded, Ian withdrew further. At the height of his influence, he was difficult to work with. Appointed to edit an arts magazine, he was like a general stuck on the beach with too many options. The magazine used up its budget without publishing. His contract with a fashion magazine produced little except stories about his large salary, which increased to make him produce more, and then to make him produce anything. At editorial meetings, Ian was witty but harsh, criticizing others' ideas. Ten years later, he could hardly be expected to attend his own funeral. Lancelot was close to admitting that ""A World History of the Short"" had been a mistake from the start."
CPE_65,"Text: 'England's breakfast change The importance of a good breakfast is clear according to health experts. However, in history, breakfast is quite new in England. In medieval times, breakfast is rarely mentioned in literature. There are some mentions of travelers eating at dawn before long journeys, and sick people having breakfast for health reasons, but most people did not eat breakfast unless they were kings or nobles. In the sixteenth century, breakfast slowly became normal for everyone. Some say this was because there was more food available. But they may not have thought about other big social changes. For example, new work patterns might explain why breakfast became more important. People started working for set hours, often very early. So, having a meal in the morning became necessary and was not just for the rich.'"
CPE_61,"**Photography**

When a photographer takes a picture, they choose what to show based on their skills, personal views, and social and cultural norms. In this book, we will see how these factors affect the style, content, and expression of a photo, and how viewers see and react to these images. For example, a newspaper reader might think they understand the photos they see. But instead of just accepting the photo as it is, we might ask if it shows the scene accurately or if it shows the photographer's opinion. Is the exact moment captured important, or should the photo be seen as a symbol of something happening in the world?

**More than a Game**

For me, sport is more than just a game. The most successful athletes have complete self-belief. You need to focus completely if you want to succeed in sports. There's only one way to be the best, and you have to ignore everything else. Sport is tough, and no one will do it for you. It's either succeed or fail. Sport has taught me discipline and determination, but it also shows the benefits of working as part of a team. My sport lets you excel individually, but it's also a team game, and you have to balance these two parts. It's like life - you can succeed alone, but you must remember others around you. Sport has given me a lot - not just money. It has opened doors for me and shown me things around the world that others may never see. But you also have to give up a lot for these benefits.

**Tuning In**

Some experiences are so clear in our memory that they stand out. For me, one such moment happened one night in California many years ago. I was awake, listening to a mockingbird singing beautifully from a hidden spot in a tall tree in the neighborhood. I don't have trouble sleeping - it was the bird's amazing singing that kept me awake. As I listened to its complex melodies, I felt like I was in a new artistic world. To follow the bird's patterns, I used my knowledge of jazz and Indian classical music. The bird made me feel like I was hearing an amazing, improvised performance. I reacted with groans and cheers as each surprising musical change came through the open window where I lay listening, until I finally fell asleep."
CPE_52,"Text: People have always had strong feelings about birds. But what do these feelings say about us? Paul Evans explores this idea. In a greenhouse, a small brown bird, a wren, is hitting the glass. Some people see wrens as mysterious birds that bring messages. Is this wren trying to tell me something, or is it just trapped? Maybe both are true. Wrens have been part of British culture for a long time. In medieval times, people believed the direction a wren flew could bring good or bad luck. Today, wrens are still popular in British art and homes. Even if old beliefs are forgotten, wrens are still loved. A forest without wrens feels empty. This is because birds have always been important in our stories and beliefs. In the past, people depended on nature to survive and created stories about animals. These stories can change over time. For example, the red kite was once a common bird in London, seen as helpful. Later, it was seen as a pest and almost disappeared, except in Wales. Now, red kites are protected and have become symbols of conservation in Britain. Our connection with birds goes back to early humans. They watched birds to learn about danger, weather, and food. Birds also connected them to their dreams. When we think about why birds matter to us, we also think about what it means to be human. Birds represent flight, song, and freedom, which we admire and wish for. Some people think our feelings about birds are old and not useful now, but they are still part of us. Birds are now seen as indicators of environmental health. In Britain, 30 bird species are endangered, which is sad not only because we lose these birds but also because we lose part of our culture. Birds like the skylark, turtle dove, and lapwing have deep cultural meanings. Their loss is felt by those who know their stories. However, birds without cultural stories are often ignored. Folklore is important. Stories and legends about birds have a strong connection to them, more than scientific terms. These stories bring out feelings and memories buried by modern life. Whether we watch birds on TV or in our gardens, the joy we feel is hard to explain with science. Birds are fascinating in ways we don't fully understand, and the stories we tell help us interpret their messages. The wren in the greenhouse connects the present with the past and future, leaving us with a mystery to solve."
CPE_28,"**Maps**

A map shows how points and features on the earth's surface relate to each other. This is done using distance and direction. In the past, people often measured distance in time, like ""a day's journey by river."" This told more about how easy it was to travel through the area than the actual distance. Direction was also important, but for most travelers, the main questions were ""Where do I go from here?"" and ""How far is it?"" Because of this, written travel guides were popular for a long time, sometimes more than maps. Even today, some maps, like those of railway systems, might not show true directions. Early maps used signs to show landmarks, and these signs varied in size to show their importance. The style of these signs depended on the map's purpose and where it was made. So, when studying old maps, it's important to understand the style used.

The history of map-making, or cartography, is about improving how accurately distance and direction are shown and adding more details to maps. Cartography has used other sciences to help. For example, instead of using shadows or stars to find direction, people used the magnetic compass. New tools were created to measure angles accurately. As people explored more, they tried to map the world. Astronomers found that the earth is not a perfect sphere but is slightly flat at the poles, which changed how large areas were mapped.

Over time, different people needed maps for different reasons. Soldiers needed accurate maps for artillery, which led to the invention of contour lines. Archaeologists, historians, and geographers also had their own needs. Modern cartographers now map many things, like geological layers and land use. The value of maps in many sciences has led to a modern revival of cartography.

The development of maps has not always been smooth. There have been times of slow progress and times of rapid change. Sometimes, old ideas stayed around even when new ones were available. Cartographers often knew how to improve maps but had to wait for better tools. Since copying old maps was easy and printing them was expensive, publishers were often slow to adopt new ideas. Therefore, maps should not always be seen as accurate evidence of what people knew at the time.

The many maps we have today are the result of much human effort and thought. They are a valuable record for studying human history. This makes the study of historical cartography both fascinating and educational."
CPE_35,"**TIM RICE**

I was invited into a young man's drawing room, a calm and cultured space surrounded by a messy cluster of rooms where the less ambitious family members lived. Moving from the kitchen to his parlour felt like upgrading from economy to business class. This room had the largest collection of records I had ever seen, the first stereo record player and tuner I had come across, and surprising evidence that a teenager had spent money on Georgian wine glasses, pictures, and furniture. His name was Andrew Lloyd Webber. He had won a scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford, to study history, and he had nine months before starting. During this time, he wanted to become England's answer to the composer Richard Rodgers. My own dreams were just as crazy; I wanted to be a pop star for reasons like women, money, and fame. The difference between Andrew and me was that my dreams were not life or death to me, though it's easy to say that now. They might have become so if I had failed. So, when Andrew suggested a new crazy ambition for me, to become as famous a lyricist as Oscar Hammerstein, I had no problem giving it a try. This was partly because within ten minutes of meeting, he was at the piano playing three tunes he had composed—I could tell he was good. Very good. As he confidently played selections from some of the many shows he had written and produced at school, I was reminded of the best show albums from my parents' LP collection. He needed a new lyricist for the outside world. I had little to impress him with in return, other than instant praise for his music and a real, actually released, seven-inch single of a song I had written (both words and music) with which an unknown pop group had ended their failing career by recording three months earlier. We parted, promising to meet again and write something together. I was still more interested in the charts than in the West End theatre, but told myself on the bus back to my flat that I had just met someone of rare ability and determination, and I would be mad to miss out on being a partner to a guy who was clearly going to take the musical theatre by storm, probably by next week. And even if we failed to challenge the top musical composers, we could try to beat the Beatles and Rolling Stones later, in the summer. The Everly Brothers had just made a comeback and would clearly need some new material. The next day, back at my desk in the office where I was training to become a lawyer, the brief certainty I had enjoyed of a life in show business with Andrew Lloyd Webber had faded somewhat. I would, of course, continue to keep an eye on the small ads in Melody Maker for groups needing a vocalist and would write a few more three-chord songs tailored not to expose the limitations of my voice, but it was still likely that eventually, I would pass my exams and become a respectable lawyer by the time I was twenty-five. By then, I would have surely grown out of pop music as my father had confidently predicted I would by the time I was twenty-one. This was worrying—if he was right, I only had a few more months of enjoying it. But in the meantime, I felt I had nothing to lose by seeing Andrew again. It would be fun to go and see a musical with him, to write words that imitated musical lyricists rather than pop stars. And Andrew was a fascinating individual who talked about Good Food Guides and Victorian architecture, besides supporting Leyton Orient football team. I wasn't convinced by the idea for a musical that he had been working on for the past year, but in 1965 I was rarely convinced about anything. His talent was beyond question, and he claimed to have all the contacts. I was soon back in his drawing room. The idea was the life of Dr. Thomas Barnardo, the nineteenth-century philanthropist who founded the orphanages that bear his name. His story was a worthy one indeed, but not one that truly inspired me. The hero was too perfect, at least in Andrew's version of his life, and the project was unoriginal in both concept and execution, owing too much to Lionel Bart's hit show, Oliver. On the other hand, Andrew's belief in his score's brilliance was infectious and not totally unjustified. What did I know about musicals? As David Land, later to be my agent for over twenty-five years, memorably (and repeatedly) said, if there's a demand for one hamburger bar on the block, there is room for two. We could be the second hamburger joint. I set to work with great enthusiasm, especially for those songs that were meant to be funny. Andrew outlined the plot, played me the tunes, and in many cases gave me the title as well, most of which had presumably been thought up by his former school friend who had already tried. I skipped a day at the solicitor's office, pretending to be ill, to write my first batch of theatrical lyrics. I did not know it that day, but I had changed careers."
CPE_5,"**Language**

Humans have a special ability: we can communicate with each other using language. Language is so important in our lives that it's hard to imagine living without it. If you see two or more people together anywhere in the world, they will probably start talking. Even when alone, people often talk to themselves, their pets, or even their plants. I like to think of language as an 'instinct'. This means that people know how to speak naturally, just like spiders know how to spin webs. Spiders didn't learn web-spinning from a smart spider or need special training; it's something they just do.

**Climate and Weather**

Climate and weather, created by the air around us, have a big impact on where animals and plants live. Climate can change the look of landscapes. For example, warm and wet weather all year helps tropical jungles grow, which have many different species. On the other hand, cold and windy places have fewer living things. Daily weather patterns, which together make up the climate, happen because large masses of air rise and mix. The atmosphere is always moving. Some of this movement is because the earth spins, and the air doesn't move as fast as the earth. The sun is another important reason for air movement.

**Coffee**

As a bar-person, I had to serve drinks and, more importantly, make coffee. In Lygon Street, Melbourne, a restaurant's success can depend on its coffee. I spent several days learning how to make coffee, especially how to clean and maintain the espresso machine. I also learned how to make a perfect cappuccino. By the end of the first week, I realized making good coffee was harder than it seemed, and I thought I might be moved to simpler tasks. Fortunately, my boss was patient. ""Making coffee is both an art and a science,"" he said, ""and you need time to learn how to do it well."""
CPE_41,"**Art on TV**

Why does television often fail with programs about visual arts? Painting and sculpture should be perfect for TV because the camera can show a whole artwork and then zoom in on details. However, there are few TV series that show both the enjoyment and complexity of looking at art. A good example of this problem is Robert Hughes's series, ""American Visions."" Hughes is a trustworthy critic with a strong personality, and he had almost eight hours to introduce British viewers to American art, which is often ignored by British galleries. I expected the series to focus on great artworks, but instead, it was about how American history and culture are shown in its art and architecture.

**Dealing in Metals**

For 20 years, I worked as an international metals dealer and became known as a speculator. Metals markets are less regulated than others. With some luck, a willingness to take risks, and a good understanding of the market, you can make a lot of money. Risk-taking is a big part of the industry. This adventurous culture fits well with a free-market global economy. But now, the free-trade economists who said the market would keep the price of scarce metals stable have found the opposite is true. More minerals are being extracted, and the cost of raw materials is going down. Considering inflation, the prices of most metals are about half of what they were 20 years ago. Recently, I was asked to investigate claims against a multinational company that benefits from these cheap raw materials.

**Extract from a Holiday Brochure**

Abaco and its offshore cays are part of the 700 islands of the Bahamas, stretching from Florida past the Tropic of Cancer to Cuba. Each island has its own personality and offers something unique. To get around the islands and cays of Abaco, you need a boat. If your room doesn't include one, don't worry. There are many ferries and water-taxis. Or, you can rent a boat if you want to travel on your own. Sailing is the most popular way to get around here. Abaco is called 'The Sailing Capital of the World' for a good reason. The calm, naturally protected waters are also great for fishing, diving, snorkeling, and swimming. The cays and their beaches stretch for 200 miles like a string of pearls. It's not only at sea that you can find treasures. At night, the lights of the restaurants and cafes of Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay sparkle."
CPE_69,"**Build Your Own Bamboo Bike in the UK**

The Bamboo Bike Club, run by engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan, offers a unique experience: a weekend course where you can build your own custom bamboo bike frame. Located in Hackney Wick, east London, this is the UK's first bamboo bike workshop.

Bamboo is becoming popular in bike construction. Companies like Calfee Design in California and Bamboo Bikes in Yorkshire have brought back this method, first used in 1894. However, buying a ready-made bamboo frame can be expensive, costing around $2,995 or £1,868. James and Ian wanted to make bamboo bikes affordable for the average cyclist. After years of research, they decided to focus on teaching others to build their own bikes, rather than just selling frames.

The Bamboo Bike Club is more of a community project than a business. James and Ian still work full-time jobs—James in wind turbines and Ian as a civil engineer. Their monthly courses are popular because they offer a custom-designed bike frame and a fun weekend of building at a competitive price.

During the course, participants learn how to choose bamboo for strength and how to make strong joints. The process involves gluing bamboo tubes together to form the bike's frame. Metal parts are used for areas that need extra strength, like the handlebars and wheel forks. James and Ian guide participants through the process, ensuring quality and helping with any difficult tasks.

Most participants enjoy the hands-on experience of building their own bike. Even if mistakes happen, it's easy to fix them with another piece of bamboo. The second day of the course focuses on wrapping the joints with hemp and epoxy resin to make them strong and durable. After a final waterproof coating, the bike is ready for wheels, brakes, and other parts.

Bamboo bikes are strong and durable, comparable to metal bikes. Ian has used his bamboo bike for over a year on a 16-mile commute, and James has tested one off-road for three months without any issues. Although bamboo bikes may look a bit rough compared to professional frames, they are unique and have a smooth ride. The cost of building your own bamboo bike at the workshop is less than £500."
CPE_38,"**Self-help Books**

Dione Reverend was an editor at Random House in New York when she first saw a manuscript by an unknown psychologist, Dr. John Gray. ""I took one look at the title and knew it would be a bestseller,"" she says, laughing, and she was right. Dr. Gray is now a multimillionaire, and Dione Reverend has her own company. Dr. Gray's book on communication between men and women is a key part of the growing self-help industry. This industry claims to help Americans improve their lives, but it also creates more desires and supports the New York publishing world. In Britain, the genre is also popular, though many books are rejected for being too similar or too specific. Editors focus on marketability, asking questions like, ""How promotable is the author? What's the 'hook'? Is it universal enough?"" Dione Reverend says that a catchy title is crucial for success.

**Autobiographies**

There is an unspoken agreement between an autobiographer and the reader that the truth is being told. However, this is often not fully observed. Writers might leave out shameful actions or thoughts, or things they think are not important. Some writers might invent stories to better express the truth about themselves. Others might call their book an autobiography to make readers believe it is true, even if it is fiction. This can be done without any bad intentions.

**Dashiell Hammett's Detective Stories**

Detective stories have been explained as a reflection of the conflicts in late 19th and early 20th-century society. These stories are like allegories. The crime represents human desires like lust or greed, and solving it shows the return to social order. In Hammett's stories, society is restored but shown as corrupt. The detective and the criminal understand each other and are comfortable with each other. The detective is both a crook and a competitor. His mission is sometimes affected by his connection to the criminal world.

**Science Writing**

Stephen Jay Gould is considered today's greatest scientific essayist. To discuss his writing, I met him at the Grand Hotel, where he was promoting his new book. Gould said that understanding the culture is key to being a successful writer. Science is like its own civilization, and only scientists can effectively present it. Gould advises never to write down to the reader. ""You can simplify the language but must never simplify the argument. If readers feel patronized, your piece is dead."""
CPE_17,"**Air-conditioning**

At Cannons Gym, a popular spot for City of London workers, the air feels very cold. To handle this summer's high temperatures, the gym has used a lot of air-conditioning. At quiet times, it feels as cold as the Arctic. This is an example of how air-conditioning is often overused. It has become important in our lives, showing how we can control or change the climate. However, many buildings could use other ways to stay cool. They could use natural light and air, and have thicker walls that keep out heat during the day and release it at night. These simple ideas can work well and reduce the need for air-conditioning.

**Sundials**

It is interesting that as we start a new millennium, people are again interested in sundials. Sundials measure time by the sun's position. A hundred years ago, they were important for keeping time accurately. But as clocks and watches improved, sundials became just garden decorations. Now, they are becoming popular again. David Harber, who makes sundials, thinks people like them because they connect us to the planets. He says there is a magical moment when a sundial starts working. They are calm, romantic objects that remind us of our place in the universe.

**Paint Your Own China**

I used to think china-painting was only for very skilled people. I once saw older women at an arts and crafts show painting teacups with perfect flowers. Their hands were steady, and the paint never smudged. I wondered who would be brave enough to take a china-painting class. Would beginners also be talented? But the class was not scary at all. The students were there to have fun, and even the teacher did not want to paint flowers on teacups as quickly as I remembered."
CPE_47,"**The Wrong Country**

Uncle chose a package holiday for Keith and Dawne at a good price: a flight from Gatwick Airport and twelve nights in Venice at the Pensione Concordia. When they went to the travel agency to book, the clerk mentioned that the other people in their package were a school group learning Italian. But something went wrong. Either at the travel agency, the check-in desk, or in a computer, a mistake happened. Keith and Dawne ended up in a hotel called the Edelweiss, in Room 212, in Switzerland.

At Gatwick, they gave their tickets to a girl in a yellow-and-red Your-Kind-of-Holiday uniform. She checked their details and said everything was fine. On the plane, they were surprised to hear people speaking with North of England accents. Keith thought there might have been a cancellation or the Italian class was on another plane. They ordered drinks and relaxed.

When they landed, a woman with glasses told everyone to stay together. There was no mention of an overnight stop in the brochure, but Keith thought it was just a stopover. It was almost midnight when they arrived at the hotel, and they were too tired to question anything. The next morning, they realized they were staying there for the whole holiday. The receptionist told them about the lake and water birds and suggested a steamer trip to Interlaken.

Keith calmly explained there was a mistake; they were supposed to be in Venice. The receptionist didn't know about any mistake. Dawne described the travel agent who booked their trip. A woman named Mrs. Franks, who they saw at Gatwick, approached them. Dawne asked if she was in charge because they were in the wrong hotel. Mrs. Franks explained that Your-Kind-of-Holiday has many trips, and all tickets and labels look similar. She laughed and said they couldn't end up in a wildlife park by mistake.

Keith insisted they weren't meant to be in Switzerland. Mrs. Franks left them standing there. The receptionist was gone, and they heard typing. Dawne thought Mrs. Franks seemed kind, but Keith was lost in thought, remembering everything that happened at the airport and on the plane.

An elderly couple, Mr. and Mrs. Nottage, interrupted Keith's thoughts, saying they had the best night's sleep in years. Keith and Dawne left the reception area. Outside, they didn't mention the irony of their situation. On their first holiday since their honeymoon, they ended up on a tour with elderly people, when they wanted to escape the demands of the elderly. Uncle had even said so when they tried to convince him to join them."
CPE_48,"**He Was a People Person**

American business leaders are now looking at the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton as a model for good management. Eluned Price reports.

In Britain, many people know who Sir Ernest Shackleton was and have a general idea of his achievements. However, America has only recently discovered him. The Wall Street Journal called Shackleton ""an Antarctic explorer whose feats went unnoticed for most of the 20th century,"" which might be an exaggeration. But now, Americans are showing great interest in him. Biographies and stories about his ship, the Endurance, are being produced and are expected to sell quickly. The American Museum of Natural History is planning a big exhibition, and Columbia Tristar is making a film about Shackleton's life.

Some American managers have started to see Shackleton as a role model. They admire his actions and learn lessons in leadership and communication from his story. They even use the term ""speaking Shackleton"" among themselves. Shackleton, known for his determination and resourcefulness, has become an example for modern management consultants.

Jim MacGregor, a managing partner at Abernathy MacGregor Frank in New York, has considered Shackleton a role model for years. His company deals with communication during mergers, acquisitions, and corporate crises. For example, they handle situations like ""this firm's plant blew up"" or ""half the workforce has to go."" MacGregor believes Shackleton is a model for management because of his leadership and communication skills. Shackleton was at his best when he and his team had a lot to lose, like their lives. One of his most important decisions was to turn back when he was only 97 miles from the South Pole in 1908. This decision showed his credibility for future expeditions because he prioritized the lives of his men.

In a crisis, MacGregor says, people want to know someone is in charge. Unlike some managers today who avoid responsibility, Shackleton was ready to take charge. His 1914 expedition became legendary. His ship, the Endurance, was trapped in ice for nine months and eventually crushed. Shackleton told his men they would reach safety if they trusted him and did their best. From diaries and accounts, it's clear that Shackleton was always in control. He planned for every situation, kept his men informed, and valued their opinions. He was adaptable and willing to start fresh when needed.

Shackleton believed an explorer needs optimism, physical endurance, and patience. MacGregor notes that in desperate situations, doing nothing can be hard, especially in America, where people want quick solutions. For example, if you buy bonds and the interest rates change, waiting can help you recover your money. Similarly, if a new product isn't working, don't keep selling it.

Shackleton led by example. On the return journey from the Endurance, he noticed the expedition photographer, Hurley, without gloves. He gave Hurley his own gloves, insisting he wear them. Someone else remembered Shackleton offering a biscuit when they were starving during the 1905 expedition, showing his selflessness.

Caroline Alexander, author of ""Endurance,"" says the public's interest in heroic efforts is growing. Shackleton represents the ideals we long for today, standing as a true hero."
CAE_15,"**Tapping into a Food Supply**

In the forests of Madagascar, there is a primate called the aye-aye that lives like a woodpecker. Both the woodpecker and the aye-aye search for insect larvae by making holes in wood. The woodpecker uses its beak to chisel the wood and its long tongue to get the insects. The aye-aye uses its sharp teeth to gnaw into the wood and its long, thin third finger to scoop out the insects.

Although the aye-aye's feeding method was first described over a hundred years ago, scientists have only recently learned how it finds insects inside the wood. Dr. Carl Erickson from Duke University studied the hunting skills of two male aye-ayes, Nosferatu and Poe, a female named Samantha, and her baby, Annabelle. He wanted to see if they found insects by looking for signs on the wood's surface, like holes where insects might have entered to lay eggs.

Dr. Erickson gave the aye-ayes logs with several small holes. Some holes led to cavities with mealworms, while others were empty. The aye-ayes went directly to the cavities with food, showing they didn't need visual clues like surface holes. Dr. Erickson then tested if they used smell or sound to find the insects. The aye-ayes could still find mealworms even when the smell was blocked, and they also found dead, silent mealworms.

If the aye-ayes weren't using sight, smell, or sound, how did they find the insects? Dr. Erickson discovered that they could sense the cavities themselves. When looking for food, an aye-aye taps the wood with its middle finger and focuses its large ears forward. Dr. Erickson suggests that the aye-aye uses echo-location, listening for echoes from the taps that indicate a hollow space below. It might also hear insects moving when disturbed by the tapping.

The idea that the aye-aye takes the place of woodpeckers in Madagascar is interesting. However, there are birds like the Sickle-billed and Nuthatch Vangas that also search for insects in wood, so the woodpecker role might not be empty. The aye-aye can be seen as a mix of a woodpecker and an echo-locating bat. It also acts like a squirrel because its teeth grow continuously, and it has been seen in the wild gnawing through nut shells and using its long finger to get the nut meat."
CAE_19,"Text: 'Ordinary people, ordinary lives Most of us have photos of our grandparents, but how many of us know what their lives were like when they were young? Diaries give us small glimpses, and family stories are often forgotten. What will our grandchildren know about us? We often plan to write things down but never do it. We might leave videos instead of photos, but they are still two-dimensional. Hannah Renier has a solution: she writes autobiographies for other people, creating a hardback book of at least 20,000 words, with pictures if wanted. These books are not about famous people, but about ordinary ones. The idea came to her when she talked to her family and realized how much of the past was disappearing. ""When I started, I didn't take it as seriously as I do now,"" she says. ""People say they do it for their children or for the future, but they also enjoy it themselves."" The promise of privacy helps people to be honest. ""I had the confidence to be honest,"" says a 62-year-old man who made and lost a fortune before making another. ""I was surprised at what came out. There were painful things, like my divorce."" ""I did it for my family, so they could learn something, but I haven't let my children read it yet. They were hurt by things in my life, and there are details I don't want them to know now. If they insist, I'll let them. But I'd rather they read it after I'm gone."" He also saw patterns from his childhood that led to repeated mistakes. Ms. Renier has noticed this in others too. ""It's amazing how many people are influenced by their parents,"" she says. ""Things from childhood affect them for the rest of their lives. They marry people their parents would like or do the opposite to rebel."" ""Many disappointments come out. Even sixty years later, people regret or resent things with their parents. There is no age of reason. If people had issues in their youth, they still have them in middle age. They try to impress a parent who wasn't impressed, and some want to say 'I can't stand my mother.'"" Ms. Renier is more of a recorder than an investigator. ""It's not for the public, and I'm not there to be nosy. People sometimes tell me things and then say, 'I'm not sure if that should go in.' I include it anyway—they can remove it when they see the draft. But generally, people want to be honest."" ""It's not vanity publishing. It's not people saying, 'I've had such an interesting life the world needs to know about it.' Things are changing faster than ever, and we are losing touch with the past. It's a way to connect with our ancestors because families don't sit together as much anymore. People want a little immortality."" Each book involves up to 30 hours of recorded interviews, which Ms. Renier uses to write the life story, rearranging the order and interpreting. Modern technology allows her to produce everything except the binding with its gold lettering: you can choose your own color and title. Fascinating to the private audience for whom each book is made, the results are not about revealing secrets at any cost. Ms. Renier organizes her material logically and writes well, so the final content is as good as its subject. The book looks high-quality and costs nearly £3,000, with extra copies at £25 each. She gets about 10 inquiries a week, but the cost, due to the time involved, deters many people. ""I thought it would be a more affordable product,"" she says. ""But the people I've worked with are often from wealthy backgrounds, like readers of Harpers & Queen, where I advertise. They're the kind of people who would have had their portraits painted for their descendants.""'"

The Museum of Classical Archaeology has one of the few collections of Greek and Roman sculpture casts in the world, with over six hundred pieces. Remember, none of the sculptures here are original. They are all accurate copies made from the originals, mostly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Museum is in a special gallery with great natural light. Plaster casts have many benefits: sculptures that were originally together but are now in different museums across Europe can be seen together as they were meant to be. You can see almost all the famous Greek and Roman sculptures in one afternoon.

This collection has over 400,000 air photographs, taken by university staff over the past 45 years. The University has its own aircraft at Cambridge Airport and does photographic work across Great Britain. The photos are interesting as they show the landscape and human activity from prehistoric times to today. There is a small display in the entrance hall, and the library staff can help with questions. The photos cannot be borrowed, but copies can be bought. These are made to order and usually take about a month.

**E. Cambridge Medieval Brass Rubbing Centre**

The Cambridge Brass Rubbing Centre is the second oldest and longest-running center of its kind in the world and is a unique tourist attraction. Visitors can enjoy making wall hangings by rubbing one of over a hundred brass plates from the tombs of medieval knights and ladies. By creating resin copies, called facsimiles, the center preserves the originals while allowing people to enjoy brass rubbing. Brass plates, used as memorials instead of statues, spread from Germany across medieval Europe and Scandinavia. Many were destroyed in revolutions, but most of the remaining ones are in Britain, with a wide range at the Cambridge Centre."

**A. The Theatre Director**

I have had 35 years of small children because of my unusual personal life, and I have loved every minute. I fed the baby this morning, and for me, that is what being a father is all about. I'm very lucky with my children. We all love opera, theatre, books, and music. This creates a strong bond, especially now that they are mostly grown up, and I have become more of a friend than a father. I don't believe in physical violence. I have slapped my children in anger, but I don't support it. I may not have been a very attentive father, but I have always tried to be available. I'm here if they need me, but I let them contact me. If you start chasing them to ask why they haven't been in touch, you make them feel guilty. My parents did that to me, and I would never do it to my children.

**B. The Advertising Executive**

I was young when my children were born, only about 25, and I found the responsibilities difficult. It made me feel older quickly, but it also kept me young, which I value. As they became teenagers, they introduced me to music, youth culture, and clothes. This has been very helpful for running the agency. I have never felt out of touch. When they were young, I was busy with my business, so I missed some things like their first concerts and sports days. I'm sad about that, but now I can take them on holidays to the south of France. They get along well with our friends and come to parties and advertising awards with us without feeling shy. I think it's good that I do something they find glamorous and interesting.

**C. The Politician**

My first child was born just as I was about to be elected to the Greater London Council, and the others came soon after. My wife and I promised to make time for them, but as I became more politically active, time became a problem. I only accept weekend meetings and public events if there are facilities for the kids to come with me. This way, they know what I do when I'm not with them, and they don't feel like I'm disappearing. I've noticed more MPs bringing their kids to the House. Maybe we are all realizing the need to involve our children in our lives.

**D. The Writer**

My first marriage ended when Kate and Bonnie were young, so I had to think a lot about fatherhood. I made big efforts to stay in touch with them. My ex-wife and I even tried living next door to each other for a while, so the kids could come and go as they wanted, but I think they found that confusing. Kate has said in interviews that I was always there for her, but I'm not sure I was a very good father. I was around a lot, but like many parents in the Seventies, I think I treated the kids as adults too soon. Kate recently said we were too liberal. I think I could have been more organized. I regret that now. I still worry about my older daughters as much as my youngest. In that way, your kids never leave you.

**E. The TV Presenter**

I was ready for kids. I was 30, met my wife, and we had a lovely house, so we thought, ""Why keep spending money on new sofas when we could have a kid instead?"" Having my daughter Betty has made me understand who I am. You feel special when you have a child, and you are, but you also become just one more parent in a long line of parents. It's a great equalizer. Sometimes I feel annoyed, but one look at her makes it go away. A baby's smile is the best way to melt a grown man."

CAE_46,"**Science Defying Gravity**

Journalist Tom Mumford joins students testing their ideas in weightlessness. From the outside, it looked like a regular aircraft. The pilot informed the young passengers that it was a Boeing KC-135 refueling tanker, built in 1964, similar to the Boeing 707 passenger plane. However, the 13 students from Europe and America who boarded were in for an extraordinary experience. Inside, the plane was a long white tunnel with few windows, lit by lights along the padded walls. Most seats were removed, except for a few at the back, where the nervous students sat. For a year, they competed with other students to join this flight, a challenge by the European Space Agency to propose creative experiments in weightless conditions. The best ideas won a spot on this unique flight, described as an extraordinary roller-coaster ride.

For the next two hours, the Boeing's flight would mimic a giant bird's erratic path, soaring upwards and then diving towards Earth. The goal was to achieve weightlessness at the top of each curve. At 3,000 meters, the pilot cut the engines, and the plane continued to rise due to momentum before gravity pulled it back down. In those few silent seconds between rising and falling, the plane and everything inside became weightless, and the students felt closer to the moon than Earth.

The aircraft took off smoothly, but any illusion of a normal flight vanished when the pilot put the Boeing into a steep 45-degree climb for about 20 seconds. The engines roared, blood rushed from our heads, and bodies were scattered across the cabin floor. Then the engines cut out, and weightlessness was almost immediate. For 20 seconds, we floated in silence: the floor felt like a trampoline, and a single step sent us towards the ceiling. We floated aimlessly; directions like left or right, up or down, lost their meaning. Only gravity, by grounding us, allows us to understand movement.

After ten seconds of freefall, the pilot pulled the aircraft out of its dive. Gravity's return was less immediate but sudden enough to make some students land with a bump. With the first curve done, some turned green at the thought of 29 more. Thirty curves meant ten minutes of 'space time' for experiments. The Dutch students studied their robotic cat, Leonardo, to learn how cats always land on their feet. They released the device, and one student managed to turn it belly-down using radio controls. However, another student accidentally landed on it during a rough return to gravity.

Next to the robotic cat, a German team from the University of Aachen studied how metal joins are affected by the lack of gravity, important for future space stations. Another team from Utah State University explored creating solar sails from thin liquid films hardened by ultraviolet sunlight. They tried to produce these films in microgravity, believing that perfected solar sails could use the sun's radiation like a yacht uses the wind.

After two hours of swinging between heaven and Earth, breakfast felt unstable, but the main feeling was excitement, not nausea. This feeling would last a long time. ""It was an unforgettable experience,"" said one student. ""I already wanted to become an astronaut, but now I want to even more."""
CAE_3,"**With the Trees, I Planted My Stake in New Zealand**

**Jonathon Porritt Talks to Danny Danziger**

Jonathon Porritt is the author of *Seeing Green - The Politics of Ecology*.

I had a unique time in my life when I didn't experience any summers. I traveled to New Zealand every summer from here, which is winter in New Zealand, so I had nine winters in a row. I enjoyed it because I like winter. My parents had an idea to buy a small piece of land for my brother, sister, and me to take care of. My mother said, ""If you can take the time and effort to plant it with trees, then you can have it."" This way, we would always have a connection to New Zealand, which was nice since my father grew up there. They found a piece of land about 20 miles north of Auckland in a place called Rangitoupuni. The land wasn't very good, but it was suitable for planting trees.

I have always been interested in land. I spent a year in Australia working on sheep farms and doing different farming jobs, so the idea of planting trees sounded nice, and I was eager to start. The rest of the family became enthusiastic as we continued. I started planting in 1968, and by the end of 1972, the three of us had planted the entire 70 acres.

In New Zealand in 1968, it was one of those winters with a lot of rain. It rained almost every day we were planting, and I don't think I've ever been wetter or colder for such a long time. Every morning was a challenge: getting ready for the next planting session. Coming out of the Land Rover warm and dry, with the rain falling, and your jacket still damp from the day before, boots still wet, hands struggling with slippery laces.

In the first year, I had someone experienced in tree planting to help me, which was very useful since I had never planted trees seriously before. You have a planting bag around your neck filled with as many trees as possible. When the bag is full, it's difficult, but as it gets lighter, it becomes easier. The hardest part was getting the lines straight. You decide the spacing for the trees, line up three poles across a long distance, and those poles guide your lines. Once in line, you plant all the way down, turn around, and come back.

I enjoy hard physical work, and it made me fit. After a while, you can plant trees almost automatically, getting used to a rhythm and using the fewest spade strokes needed to dig the hole. The rhythm is something everyone talks about, and it's true for many farming jobs. You train your body to do a series of standard moves, and it becomes easy: taking the tree out of the bag, digging a hole, putting it in the ground, stamping it in, and moving on.

Mentally, it's interesting. The brain starts to think about different ideas and reflections about life. Many of my thoughts about the natural world and our place in it began during those days. I've returned to New Zealand four times since then and watched the trees grow, which is satisfying when you planted them and have a stake in their success. I always worry when I read about strong winds or droughts in New Zealand. Such news makes me anxious. However, it turned out well, and those trees are now 20 years old and healthy.

I took a term off from teaching and went back in 1984 for three months alone. I wrote my first book, *Seeing Green*, there. There's a small cabin on the tree farm with just a bed, a table, and a chair. In the mornings, I wrote; in the afternoons, I pruned the trees, and in the evenings, I did research. The connection between me and that area is still very strong. In many ways, it's the place I feel most connected to in terms of the bond between people and the earth."
CAE_10,"**BRINGING UP BADGERS**

""What now?"" I thought when one of my helpers handed me a cardboard box. My husband Derek and I turned our dairy farm in Somerset into an ""open farm"" six years ago, and we are known for caring for orphaned animals. The noise from the box—a mix between a cackle and a bark—was unfamiliar. I looked inside and saw three small grey badger cubs, each about eight inches long. Their coats were like velvet, and their milky eyes looked up at me from their tiny black-and-white striped heads. I had never seen badger cubs before. Most are born between mid-January and mid-March and spend their early life underground. If orphaned, they usually die of starvation and are never found. These three were brought in by builders who accidentally dug into their sett while laying drain pipes. The mother was found dead with her babies still suckling her. The cubs were healthy but cold and whimpering. After removing their fleas, I took them into the farmhouse kitchen and placed them by the stove for warmth. There were two females, Primrose and Bluebell, and a male, Willow. At first, I fed them with a syringe, but I had to wipe each cub with a warm cloth to mimic the mother licking them. This helped them empty their bowels and bladder. For the first few days, they were fed every four hours. Within a week, the cubs were drinking from a bottle and moving around, though shakily. With each other for company and a heated pad as a substitute ""mum,"" they seemed content. 

Three weeks later, I noticed Willow seemed lethargic, though he was still eating normally. It was a warning sign. I should have acted immediately; the next morning, I found him dead. The vet's post-mortem showed Willow died from a lung infection. When bottle-feeding, it's important not to let the animal drink too fast, as liquid can enter the lungs. In Willow's case, this caused an infection that was hard to treat, even with antibiotics, in such a small animal. Disheartened by my failure, I continued caring for the others. Six days later, a local farmer who heard about our cubs brought me another male cub, abandoned by its mother. The area had been disturbed too much, and the cub was cold and hungry. Willow II joined us. At six weeks, he was about two weeks younger than the females. Over the next few days, I discovered why his mother left him. He was very difficult to feed. To get him to drink, I had to keep moving the bottle's teat around and squeezing it. After 10 minutes, he would finally latch on as if he hadn't drunk all day. By the end of April, the females were eating creamed rice and then anything. Willow was happy to give up the bottle but struggled to eat without walking through his food or sitting in it. Eventually, I offered him a sausage, which he slowly chewed, played with, and finally ate. After a week of sausages, he was ready to try other foods. 

At nearly five months old, they were all eating cereals for breakfast, a meat and vegetable meal for lunch, and fruit, nuts, cheese, hard-boiled eggs, and sunflower seeds in the evening. Badgers usually eat 60% earthworms, plus beetles, bugs, baby rabbits, mice, voles, and even plant shoots or roots. My badgers were better off than others that year; the summer was very hot, making it hard to dig for earthworms. By August, my badgers started to become nocturnal and would only go for walks at dusk or late at night. We often walked through the cider orchard; in its long grass, everyone was playful. The cubs would get excited, fluff up their fur like snowballs, and chase each other's tails. As ""human badgers,"" we joined in. I learned to avoid their playful nips, but Derek, who joined us less often, never did and sometimes reacted colorfully to being caught. During these late-night walks in the dry period, I saw other badgers in our field. They were likely extending their territories to find food, as badgers are territorial and will kill others that enter their area. We were warned they might climb into our badger pen and harm the cubs, so we covered the gate with sheet metal to keep it secure. The local press took pictures of me walking the badgers, and the response was so great that we started an appeal to build a sett on the farm for them. With advice, we designed a new home for the badgers. Our son Daniel drew up the plans, and we built a sett with tunnels, an enclosure, and a badger gate facing their usual walking direction. It had three chambers, one larger than the others, with a glass side for people to see inside from a darkened area. As the sett took shape, the badgers explored it before their walks. Eventually, they forgot about the walks, excited by climbing through the tunnels and arranging bedding. The building cost more than expected, but a local bus company, Badgerline, sponsored part of the appeal, and local firms donated materials. Everyone wanted to see the badgers with a home of their own. One evening, they finally moved in. After watching them for a while, we left them to settle. Half an hour later, I returned to find three badgers curled up asleep in their chambers. These days, I don't walk with them as often, especially since they wake up at midnight. We see Primrose occasionally (she joined a neighboring sett), but Bluebell and Willow II still rush to say hello before dashing off into the night. This is their territory now, a place they know well and a home they have accepted."
CAE_67,"**In search of true north - and the man behind Halley's comet**

Dr. Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, wants to follow the path of Sir Edmund Halley, who studied compass variations. Anjana Ahuja reports.

Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) is famous for the comet named after him. However, one of his important achievements was mapping the 'variations of the compass' during his sea voyages on the warship Paramore. These variations, now called 'declination', are the angle between magnetic north and true north. Without knowing this, sailors couldn't accurately use their compasses to find their way across the oceans. Halley, one of the few people paid to do scientific research at that time, sailed to the Cape Verde Islands to map declination in the North and South Atlantic. The first trip was stopped due to problems with the crew, but Halley tried again. This time, he traveled to Rio de Janeiro, South Georgia, Newfoundland, and back to England. From these journeys, Halley published a map in 1701 showing compass variations in the Western and Southern Oceans. This map was very useful to sailors for over a century until changes in Earth's magnetic field made it outdated.

Dr. Clark, who also loves sailing, plans to celebrate the 300th anniversary of Halley's trip by following the same route. He needs to raise £70,000 for the journey, and Sir Vivian Fuchs, known for leading the first expedition across Antarctica, is supporting him. Dr. Clark became interested in Halley while working at Halley Station in Antarctica, where he read about Halley's life. 'Halley led a remarkable life,' says Dr. Clark. 'He was a respected scientist and explorer. He worked in astronomy and geophysics. As Astronomer Royal, he mapped stars and helped Sir Isaac Newton with his famous book, Principia Mathematica.'

Dr. Clark believes recreating the voyage will honor Halley's achievements. The new expedition, called 'In the Wake of the Paramore', will also have scientific value. It will involve taking measurements similar to Halley's, but with more accurate tools. These measurements are important because Earth's magnetic field is always changing. The data will help improve the international geomagnetic reference field, a model of Earth's magnetic field. 'We usually measure the size but not the direction of the magnetic field because you need to know true north for that,' says Dr. Clark. 'We can use global positioning satellites to find true north on our expedition.' The British Geological Survey and the United States Navy will provide instruments. A Danish satellite will also be taking similar measurements, and Dr. Clark hopes his data will fill any gaps in the satellite's coverage of the Atlantic Ocean. Ground-based measurements are also useful for comparison.

Halley's Atlantic journey was very important. It was the first scientific sea expedition, and Halley was the first civilian made a naval captain to study declination. Is Dr. Clark ready to make his journey a success? He has spent two years in Antarctica, worked in the geomagnetic group at the British Geological Survey, and sailed 13,000 kilometers from Rio de Janeiro to England. He plans to complete the expedition in four stages with different crews. Does he share Halley's passion? 'I'm willing to dedicate eight months of my life to this, so some might say I'm obsessed. But I wouldn't cross the Atlantic again without a good reason. Halley and his amazing life have given me a real sense of purpose.'"
CAE_27,"**POWER DRESSING**

Every summer, the peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire show off their beautiful tails to the female peahens. This display raises a question that puzzled Charles Darwin: in a world where survival is tough, why do peacocks have such extravagant tails? How do they manage to survive with them?

Zoologist Marion Petrie and her team from the Open University are studying these peacocks to find answers, a century after Darwin's death. Darwin believed that animals evolved through natural selection, meaning the fittest survive and reproduce. However, he thought the peacock's tail was a problem because it seemed useless and even a burden. To explain this, he suggested a different idea called 'sexual selection,' where females choose mates based on beauty.

Darwin's friend, Alfred Russel Wallace, disagreed. He believed that if peahens chose the most beautiful males, there must be a good reason. The tails might signal some hidden quality that helps survival. Wallace thought the tail was an advertisement for this quality.

Today, the debate continues because studying peafowl behavior is challenging. At Whipsnade, 200 peacocks live like wild birds but are used to humans, providing a unique chance to study them. Petrie and her team have two main questions: Do peahens really prefer males with the showiest tails? And do these males have other advantages, as Wallace suggested?

Observations show that peahens do prefer males with more eye-spots on their tails, which attract more mates. However, it's still unclear if these males are better in other ways. William Hamilton from Oxford University suggested that showy males might be healthier and free of parasites, but this hasn't been tested at Whipsnade yet.

This year, Petrie is comparing the offspring of attractive and unattractive males to see if the former grow faster or are healthier. If they are, it would support Wallace's idea that female choice is practical.

There's another theory by R.A. Fisher called 'Fisher's Runaway.' It suggests that if a female chooses a male with a slightly better tail, their sons will inherit the tail, and daughters will inherit the preference for long tails. Over generations, this could lead to the extravagant tails we see today, supporting Darwin's idea of 'beauty for beauty's sake.'"
CAE_66,"**THE BOAT OF MY DREAMS**

Tom Cunliffe believes the best boat design should mix old and new ideas. He did this with his own boat, 'The Westerman'. This week, the Summer Boat Show in London is full of modern yachts with the latest technology. Most of these yachts are based on a design change from 25 years ago. In contrast, my boat is on a quiet creek on the south coast. It was designed last year, but it looks like it could be 100 years old. Some might think I'm a romantic dreamer, but I don't think so. My boat uses old boat design magic, but modern technology made it easier to build. However, modern technology often protects sailors from the tough parts of sea life, which they might want to experience. I'm not saying sailors should suffer, but I like my boats to have a coal stove for warmth and comfortable beds. Why go sailing if everything is done for you? Sometimes, dealing with the sails is part of the adventure. Also, why move the steering from the safe back of the boat to a risky spot in the middle? This change is often made to create more space inside, like a big cabin. For me, a boat should be a boat, not a house on water.

When I bought my previous boat, Hirta, for a TV race around Britain, the former owner said it had comfort but no luxury. During my time with Hirta, I learned he was right. Hirta had heavy sails, no pumped water, no electricity, no fridge, no central heating, no winches, and no electronics, especially for navigation. Yet, she was the nicest and easiest boat I've ever sailed. However, old boats need a lot of care. After a back injury, I knew I had to sell Hirta. I couldn't find a good new boat, so I decided to build one. The Westerman has been great. Designer Nigel Irens and his assistant Ed Burnett used computers to help design it, but Irens first drew it on a napkin. He then made a model, like in the old days. We looked at the model and made changes on the computer. The final design was perfect. The Westerman has crossed the North Atlantic and won four out of six races. She looks timeless, sails smoothly, and her inside, made from old pitch pine, feels peaceful. This is because she was designed as a sailing boat first, not based on furniture. This traditional method works well. She shows that you don't need to follow trends to be happy and that history can teach us valuable lessons. Made from wood treated with a special glue, she is completely waterproof. She has all the benefits of a modern boat but looks, feels, and sails like a classic one."
CAE_44,"**RETREAT, RELAX, RECHARGE**

Health farms and country house hotels with spa facilities are doing very well. We asked five journalists to visit some of these places.

**A. HENLOW GRANGE**

I was happy to visit Henlow Grange for six days because I was tired and needed to relax. My room in the large 18th-century house was very comfortable, and I felt calm right away. On the first day, I did nothing and slept a lot. From the second day, I joined body conditioning classes like stretch and tone, yoga, and body alignment. The instructors are very skilled. I felt more flexible as the week went on. They offer many treatments, such as aromatherapy, seaweed baths, manicures, and pedicures. The one-hour facial made me feel like a new person. The staff in the treatment rooms were friendly and professional. The atmosphere is full of energy and enthusiasm. Henlow plans to renovate this year, adding a half-size Olympic swimming pool and a Light Diet Room. You can also ride bicycles around the grounds. If you prefer to relax, you can read a magazine or walk in the garden. During my stay, my mood and appetite improved. I left feeling wonderful and full of energy. I definitely want to visit again. This is the perfect break for a stressed working woman. Save Room 5 for me! - Marcella D'Argy Smith

**B. SHRUBLAND HALL**

The calm and relaxing atmosphere of this stately home was clear from the moment I climbed the large staircase to the reception area. The Hall has a beautifully decorated library, a charming conservatory, and lots of space, so you don't have to talk to anyone if you don't want to. On arrival, everyone gets a medical check, including weight and blood pressure. We were all called patients, which felt strange since I'm healthy. However, I was impressed when a shoulder problem found during the check was immediately shared with the fitness instructor. We worked on it in group workshops and an extra individual session. Each patient gets a specific diet. I lost weight without fasting, but I was hungry enough to get a headache on the second day. My typical daily menu was grapefruit and honey for breakfast, salads for lunch, and exotic fruit, yogurt, and hot broth for supper. If you're not fasting or on a light diet, you eat in the main dining hall, where the food is tasty and nicely presented. You have a massage or water therapy on alternate days. All extra treatments are reasonably priced. - Liz Gregory

**C. CAREYS MANOR**

Careys is not a health farm and doesn't claim to be. It's a fine old manor with inviting log fires and a spacious lounge. If you're counting calories, you'll have to skip the gourmet food. The French chef makes rich sauces and delightful creamy desserts. Luckily, the hotel has a fully-equipped gym and a soft-water pool to work off some of the indulgences. (You can choose a 'health-conscious' diet if you want to lose weight.) There is a spa bath, steam room, Swiss shower, sauna, and treatment rooms. A big attraction is the sports injury clinic. I got expert advice on an old shoulder injury. The physiotherapist recommended good posture, exercises, and massage. Careys is comfortable and luxurious, relaxed and calm. If you want to explore, there is beautiful countryside around. - Beverly D'Silva

**D. CLIVEDEN**

Cliveden is a grand country home and a five-star hotel that treats guests like royalty. It offers health and beauty treatments, a well-equipped gym, saunas, swimming pool, tennis, horse riding, and more. There are beautiful woodland walks and gardens on the 376-acre National Trust estate. Waldo's, a highly-acclaimed restaurant, offers dishes that are hard to resist. It took me half an hour to read the dinner menu; the choice was amazing. The meal was wonderful, especially the sticky-toffee pudding with banana ice-cream. I went to bed happy! The next morning, I spent a few hours in the gym to burn off some calories before my next meal. In the Pavilion, I enjoyed a facial with gentle heat and essential oils, followed by an aromatherapy massage. Cliveden offers fitness assessments, workouts, and beauty treatments to tone and firm the body if you want to use them before enjoying a meal at Waldo's. - Kay Letch

**E. SPRINGS HYDRO**

The best and worst thing about Springs Hydro is the carrot cake. It's the best because it's the most delicious I've ever tasted. It's the worst because it's a large piece with 360 calories, which is not good if you want to lose weight. You have been warned! The second best thing is the fabulous aromatherapy massage. I chose relaxing oils, fell asleep twice during the massage, and had my most refreshing night's sleep in years. The premises are modern and purpose-built, efficiently run, with up-to-date facilities and luxurious bedrooms. There are plenty of therapists and beauty rooms, so it's easy to schedule appointments. A variety of treatments are available, from manicures and pedicures to deep-cleansing facials and body treatments. The guests are a mix of people, from football teams to mothers and daughters, best friends, and singles. Ideally, I would have a break here about once a month. - Eve Cameron"
CAE_22,"**NATURAL TALENTS**

In the seven million years since humans separated from chimpanzees, we haven't changed much genetically. We are still more than 98% identical to chimps. This means that the things that make us different from animals are very recent developments. Our ability to make art and do other uniquely human things must come from a small part of our genes. This is why studies of animal behavior show that many things we thought were unique to humans are not. For example, chimpanzees use sticks as tools, and sea otters use rocks to open clams. Monkeys have simple languages with different sounds for 'leopard', 'eagle', and 'snake'. 

These findings leave us with few absolute differences between humans and animals, except for art. But if art is a unique human trait, it's strange that our ancestors didn't make art for most of the time since they split from chimps. The earliest art might have been wood carvings or body painting, but these don't last over time. Clear evidence of human art, like cave paintings and statues, only appears around 35,000 years ago with the Cro-Magnons.

If we say that our recent creativity sets us apart, how is our art different from animal creations? Three main differences are often suggested: human art is not useful, it's made for beauty, and it's learned, not instinctive.

First, as Oscar Wilde said, ""All art is quite useless."" Human art doesn't help us survive or reproduce, unlike most animal behaviors. For example, birdsong helps birds defend territory or attract mates. By this measure, human art is different.

Second, human art is said to be motivated by aesthetic pleasure. We can't ask birds if they enjoy their songs, but they mostly sing during breeding season, suggesting they sing for reasons other than pleasure. Again, this makes human art unique.

Third, human art is learned, not instinctive. Different human groups have distinct art styles that are learned, not inherited. For example, songs in Tokyo and Paris are different, but people can learn each other's songs. In contrast, some birds are born knowing their species' song. It's like a French baby raised in Japan suddenly singing the French national anthem without learning it.

The role of learning in human art is also seen in how quickly art styles change. Geese honk the same way they did 2,000 years ago, but human art changes rapidly. Even a casual museum visitor can tell a 20th-century painting from the Mona Lisa. Experts can often identify when and who painted a work. However, they might mistake the works of two mid-20th-century artists, Congo and Betsy, who were actually chimpanzees. Congo made up to 33 paintings in one day and got upset when his pencil was taken away. Their paintings were shown in a 1957 exhibition in London, and most were sold, which many human artists can't claim.

These ape paintings blur the lines between human art and animal activities. Like human art, they had no practical purpose and were made for the painter's satisfaction. You might argue that human art is different because it's meant to communicate. However, some famous human art was also created for the artist's personal satisfaction."
CAE_39,"**An Exciting Adventure**

The Taklamakan Desert in western China is one of the last unexplored places on earth. It is also one of the most dangerous. Charles Blackmore crossed it and lived to tell the story. There are very few big adventures left and very few heroes. Children's stories used to be about brave explorers with sunburnt skin and eyes narrowed from looking into the distance on their journeys into the unknown. These days, you don't find such people in stories, let alone in real life. Or so I thought until I met Charles Blackmore.

Blackmore's great adventure was leading an expedition across the Taklamakan Desert in western China. Its name means 'once entered you never come out', but local people call it the Desert of Death. He remembered the dangers and excitement of that amazing journey, in the calm atmosphere of his family home. The team he led included four Britons (one of them the group's medical officer), an American photographer, four Chinese (all experts on the area), 30 camels, and six camel handlers. It later turned out that the camel handlers had never worked with camels before, but were long-distance truck drivers: a misunderstanding that could have cost everyone their lives and certainly put the expedition's success at risk.

This mixed group set out to cross 1,200 kilometers of the world's least hospitable desert, and Charles Blackmore has written a fascinating account of their journey. At the time, he was about to leave the Army after 14 happy years. He started the expedition for fun, to fill a gap in his life, to prove something. 'I had always thought I'd spend my whole life in the Army. I had been offered promotion, but suddenly I felt I wanted to see who Charles Blackmore really was, outside all that. It was a big risk. Tina, my wife, was very worried that I wouldn't come back as nobody had ever done that route; we went into it blind. In the end, it took 59 days to cross from west to east, and the desert was very kind to us.'

Anyone reading his extraordinary account of that crossing will wonder at the use of the word 'kind'. The team suffered terrible hardships: dysentery; extremes of temperature; severe thirst and dehydration; the loss of part of their precious water supply. 'But', Blackmore explains, 'when we were at the limits of our own endurance and the camels had gone without water for seven days, we managed to find some. We didn't experience the Taklamakan's legendary sandstorms. And we never hit the raw, biting desert cold that would have totally stopped us. That's not to say that we weren't fighting against challenges the whole time. The fine sand got into everything, especially blisters and wounds. The high dunes were torture to climb, for us and for the heavily loaded camels, which often rolled over onto us.

'What drove me on more than anything else was the need to survive. We had no backup plan. Neither our budget nor time allowed one. No aircraft ever flew over us. Once we got into the sandhills, we were completely on our own. 'I knew I had the mental strength for the trip, but I was very scared of my physical ability to do it. I remember day one -- we sat at the edge of the desert, and it was so hot that you couldn't breathe. I thought, ""We've got to do it now!"" At that moment, I was a very scared man.'

If it was like that at the beginning, how did they feel towards the end? 'When you've walked for 1,000 kilometers, you're not going to give up. You've endured so much; you've got so much behind you. We were very thin, but very muscular and strong despite our physical exhaustion. My body was well-toned, and my legs were like pistons. I could walk over anything.'

Midway through the book, Blackmore described lying in the desert, looking up at a full moon, thinking of his family. How aware was he of the ordeal it must have been for them? 'Inside me, there's someone trying to find peace with himself. When I have doubts about myself now, I go back to the image of the desert and think, well, we managed to pull that together. As a personal achievement, I feel prouder of that expedition than of anything else I've done. Yet in terms of a lifetime's achievement, I think of my family and the happiness we share -- against that measure, the desert does not compare.'

Has Charles Blackmore found peace? 'I yearn for the challenge -- for the open spaces -- the resolve of it all. We were lifted by the sense of purpose. I find it difficult now to be part of the sameness of modern life.'"
CAE_18,"Susan Harr felt overwhelmed by technology, so she decided to unplug her gadgets and enjoy doing things by hand. Many people love technology because it gives us gadgets that make life easier and save time. However, Susan realized that technology can be expensive and not always worth the trouble. She started to let her household gadgets go as they stopped working. This made her question if technology really gives us more time or just makes us buy more gadgets.

When her word processor broke, she left it in the backyard. She found freedom in not being tied to noisy machines and enjoyed taking her time with tasks like sewing. She discovered that some gadgets, like the washing machine, are very useful, but others, like the television, can be replaced with simpler alternatives. By returning to a small black-and-white TV, her family spent more time walking the dog, reading, and talking.

Susan also started sewing by hand after her sewing machine broke. She found it relaxing and satisfying, and it allowed her to listen to the radio or talk with family. She realized that doing things by hand slowed down her life and freed her from the rush of modern life. She even enjoyed washing dishes by hand, which gave her time to daydream.

Now, Susan looks around her house and wonders if she really needs gadgets like the freezer, microwave, or lawnmower. She thinks they could save money by using fewer electric devices."
CAE_62,"Charles Hurst is a cabinet-maker who creates beautifully crafted furniture. Joanna Watt visits him at his workshop in East London. When she arrives, Hurst greets her quickly, showing he is a busy man. His workshop is full of half-made furniture and various planks of wood. Hurst has been making furniture for ten years and has a great reputation. He is always busy with orders, even though he doesn't advertise. People know that if they want quality furniture, Hurst is the person to go to.

Finding a furniture-maker is not difficult, but finding one who makes simple, well-crafted pieces is rare. Hurst believes there are few true cabinet-makers left. He is disappointed by some modern furniture and criticizes mass-produced, low-quality pieces. His quest for perfection and his talent are keys to his success. Hurst is confident in his abilities, saying he has a natural talent for making things. He learned his craft by asking questions and learning on his own.

Most of Hurst's work comes from private clients, and some return for more pieces. He finds it satisfying to furnish entire homes. However, he admits that not all client relationships are smooth. He prefers clients who know what they want. Hurst also praises others when deserved, acknowledging that some are better than him. He criticizes craftsmen who take too long to make one piece and students who try to make fashion statements with their work. For Hurst, furniture should be practical and useful.

Despite his confidence, Hurst is humble about his work. As Joanna leaves, he says, ""After all, I am only making furniture."""
CAE_49,"Text: 'Three theories about sleep People spend about one-third of their lives sleeping. It seems clear that sleep has an important role. However, what that role is, is still being discussed. Scientists do not fully agree on why we spend so much time sleeping. There are three main theories. The most popular theory says that sleep is mainly for our body's health. It suggests that we sleep to repair any damage done during the day and to restore our body to full strength. Another theory focuses on the learning benefits of sleep. It suggests that sleep helps us process the information we learn during the day, and without sleep, learning would not happen. A third theory is about energy, saying that we need sleep to recharge our energy for the next day.'"
CAE_31,"**ECCENTRICS**

An eccentric is someone whose behavior is unusual and who does not follow the usual rules of society. This makes us ask, ""What is normal?"" Most people have their own little habits or interests. It could be a love for entering newspaper competitions, collecting beer mats, or writing letters to the press about many topics. Eccentricity is about showing our uniqueness. Inside us, there is often a struggle between wanting to be unique and wanting to fit in. It's like having two trains on the same track, one called individualism and the other conformity. For most people, conformity is stronger. We want to be accepted, loved, and feel like we belong, more than we want to stand out and be different.

People with unusual hobbies or strong opinions often gather together. They form clubs, hold meetings, and organize events to share their interests, which others might see as odd. Being part of a group, even a small one, is comforting. We all feel a tension between being unique and fitting in. While most of us follow the crowd, we don't like to admit it. We want to show our individuality, like when someone at a bar says, ""I say what I think,"" or when a new acquaintance says, ""You must take me as you find me.""

At any time, we can choose to be more individualistic and show our personality. Many successful people have done this. For example, Bob Dylan, the American singer, said, ""When you feel in your gut what you are doing and then pursue it - don't back down and don't give up - then you're going to mystify a lot of folk."" But this self-conscious individuality is not eccentricity, at least not at first. When a pop singer wears strange clothes for attention, or a society hostess makes shocking comments to be noticed, that is not eccentricity. However, if they continue these actions until they become a natural part of them, then they might be considered eccentric.

The key to eccentricity is its naturalness. Eccentrics do not try to be odd; they simply are. True eccentrics are not concerned with public opinion; they are barely aware of it. They do what they do because of who they are. This makes them different from enthusiasts, practical jokers, brilliant criminals, exhibitionists, and recluses. These people are aware of the world around them and often act in response to it. Some want to make an impression on society, while others want to escape from it, but all are aware of society. The eccentric, however, continues on their own path, regardless."
CAE_58,"**Natural Books**

We asked four well-known naturalists to share the wildlife book that has influenced them the most.

**A Geoffrey Lean**

Choosing the author was easy for me. As an environmental journalist, I've been lucky to meet some of the great thinkers in this field. None impressed me more than Barbara Ward, a small, frail woman who was central to environmental issues in post-war Europe. She turned her experiences into a powerful philosophy. As a young journalist, she helped me understand the field better than anyone else. Choosing the book was harder. It could have been ""Only One Earth"" or ""Progress for a Small Planet."" But ""The Home of Man,"" despite its old-fashioned title even in 1976, is her most important book to me. It focuses on the rapid growth of cities and the big themes she cared about. It's a passionate call for what we now call 'sustainable human development.' I've read many books since, but none match it.

**B Linda Bennett**

When I read ""Signals for Survival"" by Niko Tinbergen, I can almost hear the calls of herring gulls and remember the smell of the colony. This book explains animal communication wonderfully with words and pictures. After reading it, watching a gull colony changes from chaos to a well-organized social structure. You can see which birds are partners and recognize families later in the season. Niko Tinbergen was a great behaviorist who wanted to share his findings with everyone. His work with wildlife artist Eric Ennion was inspiring and created a book for anyone who loves wildlife. Ennion's painting style came from years of watching birds. With just a few lines and colors, he shows how one gull is aggressive and another is peaceful. This is the work of a true field naturalist.

**C Lee Durrell**

""My Family and Other Animals"" by Gerald Durrell is the book that has influenced me the most. Besides leading me to a wonderful husband and a career in conservation, it defined my love for the natural world. I was researching animal sounds in Madagascar when I first read it. I was discouraged by setbacks, but reading this book made my world brighter. It shows animals, people, joy, and beauty all connected—a world worth saving. Many say humans are the worst species because of the harm we've done. But I think of Gerald as a boy in the book, seeing the world as a family, all connected. This is a concept we all need to understand.

**D Bruce Pearson**

I found ""The Shell Bird Book"" by James Fisher in my school library soon after it was published in 1966. I was drawn to the 48 color plates of birds by Eric Ennion. I already had other bird books and had learned to identify birds during holidays. They encouraged me to start sketching birds to help with identification. But ""The Shell Bird Book"" offered much more. It had beautiful paintings, chapters on bird migration, the history of birds in Britain, and even birds in music, literature, and art. This wide range of information and exciting images made me appreciate birds and nature more broadly. The book showed me that my emotional and creative response to nature was as valid as a scientific one. Since art was a stronger subject for me than math or physics, I saw new opportunities opening up."
CAE_37,"**DO REVIEWS SELL BOOKS?**

We asked five top British publishers about how book reviews affect a book's success. Here is what they said:

**Publisher A**

Reviews are very important for publishers. The Book Marketing Council found that more people buy books because of reviews than for any other reason, like advertisements or word of mouth. Authors and publishers both dislike getting no reviews, but publishers are usually less upset by bad reviews. They believe that any mention, whether good or bad, can help sell books because readers want to decide for themselves. Publishers enjoy reviews that match their own opinion of the book.

**Publisher B**

Publishers and the press both care about book reviews, but they have different needs. Newspapers want to entertain their readers, while publishers want their books to be reviewed positively. Book reviews are better now than 40 years ago, but paperbacks are often ignored. Publishers need reviews because they help make a book and its author known. A good review by a trusted person can increase sales, especially if there are several reviews. Fame helps sell books.

**Publisher C**

Reviews are essential for literary publishing. We publish books by authors who are not famous, so we rely on reviews because we don't advertise much. Good reviews are more valuable than ads because they are seen as honest opinions. Reviews can help sell books, but they need to be combined with other things like word-of-mouth, support from bookshops, and smart marketing.

**Publisher D**

In the US, a review in the New York Times can make or break a book. In Britain, bookshops don't always pay attention to reviews. Sometimes it takes many years of good reviews for people to start reading a writer's work. Some poorly reviewed books sell very well, so it's unpredictable. Non-fiction reviews often focus more on the reviewer's knowledge than the book itself.

**Publisher E**

Publishers and writers want long, positive reviews, but do they sell books? I once published a biography that got great reviews, but it didn't sell because people felt they didn't need to buy the book after reading the reviews. The reviewer's name used to matter more, but now it's the surprise choice of reviewer or the quality of the review that can make people want to buy the book."
CAE_2,"Text: 'WEATHERVANE MAKER The making of weathervanes is a very old skill, starting in early Egyptian times. Today, this craft is still alive in the workshop of Graham Smith. He is one of the few people in the country who make weathervanes by hand. Graham's designs are made to fit the specific wishes of his customers. 'This way, I can make a unique, personal item,' he explains. 'Many of my customers are women buying gifts for their husbands. They want a special gift that shows the man's job or hobbies.' This is very different from the traditional cockerel, which is the most common weathervane design. Graham's first weathervane was not a cockerel but a witch on a broomstick. Friends liked his surprise gift for his wife and started asking him to make weathervanes for them. 'I realized that there are endless ideas for weathervanes,' he says. Graham decided to focus on a weathervane business. He had trained as a precision engineer and worked in that field for 15 years. Then he and his wife, Liz, decided to switch roles - she went to work as an architectural assistant, and he stayed home to care for the children and grow the business. That was five years ago, and he has no regrets about his new path. 'My previous work didn't have an artistic side, but this is exciting and creative,' he says. 'I really enjoy the design part.' Graham has now created over 100 original designs. He works with great detail, always getting the customer's approval for the design before cutting it by hand. Graham also keeps many traditional designs in stock, as they are as popular as the custom ones. 'It seems people like hand-crafted items,' Graham says. 'They like the chance to get something a little different.' Graham has no plans to expand, as he wants to keep the business a rural craft. 'I have found my place in the market. People love the uniqueness, and I get a lot of satisfaction from turning a simple shape into something almost lifelike,' he says. 'For centuries, weathervanes have helped communities understand the weather by showing changes in wind direction,' he explains. 'Now, with more people moving to the countryside, they want to add a special touch to their homes. This has helped crafts like mine.' Graham is getting busier, sending flat-packed weathervanes to clients worldwide. American and Danish buyers are especially interested. 'Pricing,' he explains, 'depends on how detailed the design is.' His most recent request was for a curly-coated dog. Whatever the occasion, Graham can create a unique gift.'"
CAE_68,"**Beginner Takes All**

Before it was even published, *The Horse Whisperer* was the most talked-about book of the year. This first novel by British screenwriter Nicholas Evans earned him record-breaking amounts of money. Here, he talks about his inspiration and success.

The start of the year was tough for Nicholas Evans, who was a screenwriter, producer, and wanted to be a director. Things went wrong when *Life and Limb*, a film he had been working on for months, suddenly failed. He was worried because it had been two years since he last earned money, and this film was his only hope to avoid trouble with his bank manager.

A sensible person in Evans' situation might have looked for a job. He could have returned to being a television executive or started a TV project he had paused. Instead, he made a decision that seemed crazy, even to him. He bought a ticket to America and spent three months researching his first novel.

The idea for the story came from a farrier he met on Dartmoor. The farrier told him about a calm horse that suddenly became wild. Its owners were desperate until they found a gypsy who calmed the horse just by talking to it. Such people were called 'horse whisperers'. Evans was fascinated. He started researching the topic to write a screenplay, but after *Life and Limb* failed, he decided to write a book instead.

In the spring, he traveled across the US, visiting ranches and learning about horses and the people who work with them. ""It was a strange time,"" he says. ""I was watching people, but I felt alone and like my life was falling apart. I had tried for ten years to succeed as a filmmaker, and now I was in debt, worried about feeding my children, and wondering if it was all a mistake.""

By August, he had returned home and written half of the book. The bank manager was pressuring him, and he needed to know if it was worth continuing. He showed it to a friend who was a literary agent. The friend said it was ""fine"" and suggested Evans might get $30,000 as an advance. Evans needed more than that to pay off some debt and keep going. He had spent seven months on *The Horse Whisperer* and needed at least two more. $30,000 was not enough. He was also advised to write a 12-page summary of the rest of the book.

In October, the first 200 pages and the summary were sent to seven UK publishers just before the Frankfurt Book Fair. Within days, his agent called to say he had turned down an offer of $75,000. ""I said, 'You what?' And he said, 'It's OK, I just sense something is happening.'""

What happened next was historic. Within a week, the novel was sold to Transworld Publications in the UK for $550,000 and to Delacorte in the US for $3.15 million, both record-breaking advances for a first novel. ""We couldn't believe it; we were shocked. We never sent the manuscript to New York, and we still don't know how it got there,"" Evans says. They also didn't send it to Hollywood, but soon major studios were competing for it. ""My UK agent wisely involved an agent there, and when he called to say, 'I think we can get $3 million outright,' we laughed in disbelief.""

The studios agreed to pay this amount, and they each presented their offers to Evans. One night in October, he sat in his study while four major filmmakers called, one after the other, to offer $3 million for an unfinished novel.

Evans shared this story while we drank coffee on the verandah of his home. He said he had turned down an offer to write the screenplay for *The Horse Whisperer*. ""It's been such a fairy tale so far. I don't want to ruin it. Writing at that level is tough, and I don't want to become an employee of people I like and who have paid me so much. I'd hate to write a draft or two and then have them say, 'Thanks, Nick, but now we'll bring in someone else.'""

He would be involved, but from a distance. The success of his novel led to new offers to back *Life and Limb*, but he wasn't sure he wanted to make it anymore. ""I think I would be foolish not to write another novel,"" he said."
CAE_23,"Text: 'Young Masters Age is a challenge for Bobby Fischer as he tries to make a comeback. Chess is now more than ever a game for young people. After 20 years away from the game, Bobby Fischer has returned to chess to play against his old rival, Boris Spassky. Fischer's win in the first game was impressive, but as the games continue, it is clear he is not the same player he was in 1972. He is now 49 years old, out of practice, and not in the best shape. Spassky is even older. Chess has changed a lot in the last 20 years. Fischer himself helped make chess more popular, leading to a new era of professional chess. Now, winning is the main goal for modern players. In international chess, a player's nerves and stamina are as important as their intelligence. The pressure of the game is intense: players must make a certain number of moves in a set time, or they lose the game. Now, games are longer and often played without breaks, which benefits younger players. In the last 30 years, each new world champion has been younger than the one before. Of the world's top ten players, eight are under 30. The way chess is played has also changed. Much of the game happens off the board, with players preparing before matches. Computers have had a big impact on chess. A small computer can store one million chess games and quickly show games of a future opponent. In a recent match, both players had teams working nonstop to find weaknesses in each other's strategies. The opening moves of a game are now studied in great detail. Being well-prepared in the opening can decide the game. Today, there are more top-level players than ever before. Hundreds of grandmasters compete for modest prize money worldwide. Success requires both physical and mental effort. A single game can last up to eight hours, and players must stay focused. Losing concentration can lead to disaster. The chess clock adds to the tension. The end of a game often involves a 'time scramble', where players have only seconds to make moves or lose. In these moments, players must act quickly, like athletes. The game becomes a battle of nerves and determination. At the highest level, losing is very painful, while winning brings great satisfaction and a chance to recover. But one win is not enough to win a tournament. Players must be ready to compete the next day. Most chess tournaments last 9-11 days, with games every day, and there is a year-round tournament circuit. World championship matches are even tougher. The 1984 match between Anatoli Karpov and Gary Kasparov in Moscow was stopped after several months because both players were exhausted. Karpov lost about 10kg in weight. Can Fischer overcome these challenges? He once said, ""All I want to do, ever, is play chess."" This made his sudden departure from chess in 1972 surprising. But it also made him a legend. If Fischer has returned for money, he will earn a lot. Whatever happens in his match with Spassky, both will become much richer. But if Fischer truly believes he can prove he is still the best, the result could be disappointing.'"

Nick Grosso, in his early 30s, is a playwright with three successful plays. He is now turning his first play, ""Peaches,"" into a film script. ""It's low budget, but we don't know how low,"" he says. ""It won't be over £30 million, but it could be as low as £30."" Before writing ""Peaches,"" Nick had never seen or read a play. ""I never thought it would be performed,"" he admits. ""It's set in a car, which I wouldn't do now because of the challenges. I knew nothing back then."" He left school at 16 but returned a year later. After A-levels, he joined the Young People's Theatre. ""I wanted to write for actors. I wanted my writing to be heard, not just read, because of the rhythm and rhyme,"" he explains. ""It was the first time I enjoyed being in an educational environment. It was very stimulating.""

Comedian Simon Pegg, 28, has progressed a lot since studying drama at Bristol University. He is writing a TV comedy series and recently finished a tour with comedy star Steve Coogan. Simon has always worked hard. Even at Bristol, he was performing in comedy clubs. ""University was very theoretical,"" Simon recalls. ""It made me realize I didn't want to be a serious actor. I was more interested in comedy. People think comedy is the hardest job, but it isn't. If you have courage and good material, making people laugh is wonderful."" He performed with the comic group Funny Business, but his work with Steve Coogan has been the most successful. ""He saw my show, and as I was a big fan of his, he probably saw me imitating him,"" Simon admits.

Ciaran McMenamin, 24, became famous as the lead in ""The Young Person's Guide To Becoming A Rock Star."" The show was well-received, and his career has taken off quickly. ""It's been a great opportunity for me,"" he says. ""I can now choose what I do, which is what I've always wanted."" This is a rare position, especially since he just graduated. Looking at Ciaran's early career, his success seems likely. Encouraged by his mother, he went from school plays to the Ulster Youth Theatre for four years. ""I used acting as an excuse not to do homework,"" Ciaran laughs. ""But I decided to pursue it because I was good at it and loved it."" Now, he waits for recognition but is thoughtful about fame. ""At 18, you think you'll love the photos and interviews, but you realize it's not why you act. It's about respect for good work.""

Neil Taylor, 25, is the lead singer of the pop band Matrix, which signed a three-album deal with Domino Records. Neil and his bandmate Rick Brown are expected to be big stars when their single ""Chimera"" is released. ""The record company talks about a hit, but I have no idea. If two people buy it, I'll be happy,"" he says. Unlike many new pop stars, Neil has worked hard for his success. He left school at 16 and tried to enter the music business ever since. ""It's funny how things happen,"" he says. ""I was doing student gigs for eight years and was about to give up when I met Rick Brown, who had contacts at Domino, and we formed Matrix."" It was perfect timing. ""I was often depressed and in bad bands, but hopefully, it will all be worth it.""

Stephen Richards, 27, is a poet and author who has won many prizes and awards. He is well-known on the poetry circuit, giving readings for six years. His first novel, ""Hidden,"" will be published in March. ""It's about obsessive love. It was a strong idea that couldn't be a poem."" Stephen loved creative writing at school but became disillusioned with education. ""I decided not to go to university, but when I got bored stuffing envelopes at a theatre, I decided to go."" After university, he published a children's book in 1992. ""My parents didn't expect me to be a writer. They thought I'd be a reader because I read a lot as a child."" With his poetry praised, moving to novels is brave. ""Poetry has a framework, so there's less chance of mistakes,"" he explains. ""A novel can be any length, so there are more chances for bad words. My goal is not to produce work without caring about quality."""
CAE_1,"Text: A. Isabel, the main character in this funny novel, thinks she looks good in jeans but rarely wears them because she doesn't want to be seen with the wrong people. She is a 31-year-old art student who loves historical romance books and is looking for Mr. Right. She worries that her knobbly knees might ruin her chances. However, she remains hopeful, which helps her and others in the story. The author writes with great energy, using a fast-paced style like an old silent film, with chapter titles like 'Our Hero Feels Inspired'. B. This story is about the start and near-end of a local radio station in America. It is told from the perspective of Francis With, a smart but weak child. Francis works for WLT (With Lettuce and Tomato) Radio, a station created by Roy and Ray Soderbjerg to promote their sandwich shop. The station soon broadcasts a mix of singers, preachers, soap-opera stars, and announcers. The small-town American setting allows the author to use dry humor and simple writing. He takes the reader back to the 1940s and 1950s, a time of dime stores, old cars, and the radio. C. In the author's world, it's normal for a second husband to talk with his wife's first husband. So, when professor Richard Vaisey falls for a Russian poetess, he talks to his wife's ex. The poetess writes bad poetry, which bothers Richard, and she wants his help for her brother, who is in prison. The author skillfully untangles these issues with humor and insight into relationships, making it a fun and smart read. D. Two pairs of best friends - two women and two men - meet in London in the sixties and stay connected for 25 years. At the start of this long novel, one of them, James Hudson, an American businessman, is starting a newspaper, which his friend Richard Blake is editing. The newspaper launch is important, but so is the fact that the woman they both loved (and one married) was killed years ago. The story includes murder, ambition, love, and jealousy, with good writing. It's a book where you can really get to know the characters. E. Written by a top American fiction writer, this funny and caring story is about Ian Bedloe, who feels guilty for a mistake and becomes a 'father' to his brother's three orphaned children. At 40, he is becoming an odd bachelor surrounded by household mess. The story explores many emotions and focuses on Ian's touching relationship with the youngest child, Daphne. It's a warm book with a perfect mix of sadness and laughter."
CAE_53,"**Volunteer Tourism: A Discussion**

**A.** Volunteer tourism often doesn't contribute much directly to development. Volunteers might help build homes or schools, but they usually pay a lot to do this work. If this money were given directly to local communities, it could hire more workers than a single volunteer could replace. This is especially true for gap year volunteers, who often don't have the necessary skills or experience. Many studies question if gap year volunteering is truly about helping others or if it's more about gaining experiences that help in future careers. However, these projects might help volunteers become more ethical and caring in their future lives and careers.

**B.** Volunteering can lead to better international understanding, improved conflict resolution, and more participation in global issues. It can also create international social networks among regular people. In this way, the benefits for both volunteers and host communities can contribute to the global good. However, if only people from wealthier areas can volunteer, it might only benefit them and not the communities that need help. These volunteers might use the experience to advance their careers, while the host communities gain little.

**C.** At its worst, international volunteering can be seen as a form of charity that benefits the volunteer more than the community. It can also be a way for volunteers to gain skills and experience. At its best, it benefits both the volunteers and the communities, allowing for an exchange of skills and knowledge. Importantly, volunteering can increase awareness and commitment to fighting poverty and injustice.

**D.** Volunteer tourism fits with the idea of helping others in small ways. This approach can seem positive, as it avoids big government and business. However, it also avoids the need for democratic government and reduces development to individual acts of charity. Criticism of volunteering is often unfair, as it can be simple and commendable charity. But when volunteer tourism is promoted as sustainable development, it can weaken the discussion about real development needs. It can also distract from understanding global inequalities and poverty."
CAE_55,"**Sound the Alarm: Stuart Harris Reports**

Many of us listen to the radio in the morning and need something to wake us up. That's why we have clock radios. But how do you choose a good one? Our panel, including me, inventor Tom Granger, and broadcaster Paul Bridges, tested five models.

The first model has a 'dual alarm function', but it doesn't work as expected. You can't snooze with the buzzer and then wake up later. The instructions suggest setting two different wake-up times, one for weekdays and one for weekends, but not everyone needs this. This model is priced similarly to the second one we tested, but it includes a cassette player, which is a good deal. You can fall asleep to your own tapes and wake up without news. We liked the radio quality, but it's quite large, about the size of a rugby ball. Paul Bridges said, 'I need space on my bedside table for my keys, wallet, glasses, and phone. I also book a wake-up call just in case.'

This model was the best-looking and overall winner. Paul Bridges loved it, although the clock on his test model got stuck at 16:00. I liked the digital display with grey numbers on a green background. The snooze bar is wide, so you can tap it with your eyes closed. However, the smooth buttons made me want to touch them like piano keys, which was confusing when I read the 50-page instruction booklet. The clock has a self-power backup, so you don't have to reset it if the plug is pulled out. We all liked this feature, but setting it up was difficult, though we felt 'cool' once we learned how.

Tom Granger called the model with a built-in lamp 'tacky'. You have to pull the light out of its socket to use it, which made him question its quality. He had to read the instructions twice to make it work; the clock kept jumping from 12:00 to 02:00. The light is hard to position and only shines on the clock, which is already lit. Paul Bridges liked the lamp idea but agreed the radio was hard to tune. The buzzer sounds like a submarine alarm and made me want to throw it across the room. Surprisingly, this model is the third most popular on the market.

Aimed at young people, with bright colors and a bootlace strap, this model appealed to Tom Granger and me. 'I like it because it stands out,' he said. The traditional controls made it easy to set up without the instructions. Unfortunately, the alarm can be off by 20 minutes, either early or late. Paul Bridges found this unacceptable and called it 'fiddly' and 'useless'.

The simplest and cheapest model scored points with Tom Granger because it was 'standard and took up little space'. It has old-fashioned dial tuning, which he found intuitive. With modern push-button tuning, you're never sure if you've pressed the buttons correctly. He admitted that manufacturers had to improve radio quality because of button-tuning. I found the tuning crude, as did Paul Bridges, but we agreed the radio quality was fine. The buzzer worked well, getting me out of bed in just two beeps!"
CAE_50,"Text: 'Hedgehogs A hedgehog is a small animal known for the sharp spines that cover its body. Hedgehogs live in many parts of the world, but none are native to America or Australia. All hedgehogs can roll into a tight ball when they are attacked, making their spines point outwards. This defense works well if the hedgehog has many spines. Some desert hedgehogs have fewer spines because they have evolved to be lighter. These hedgehogs might try to run away from danger and only roll into a ball if they have no other choice. Hedgehogs are mostly active at night and sleep during the day, either under bushes or in a hole in the ground. Although all hedgehogs can hibernate, not all of them do; if the weather is good, some stay awake all year.'"
CAE_25,"**Great Sportswomen on a Winning Streak**

Excelling in sports is challenging for everyone, but women often face extra difficulties. Training and competitions take up a lot of time, leaving little room for a normal life, so sacrifices are necessary. Despite these challenges, women are overcoming prejudice and setting new records. Here, we talk to some talented British sportswomen who are achieving their goals.

**A. Jill, 27, Skier**

""It's an amazing feeling to fly through the air and land smoothly, but it can be scary. Sometimes you don't feel well, or it's windy and hard to see, but you just keep going. It's difficult to have a career outside skiing because we train for ten months a year. You give up a lot of your social life and friends. But it was my choice. There are six men and three women in the British team. We all compete on the same courses and get treated the same - it's a young sport.""

**B. Caroline, 22, Cyclist**

""Two years ago, I borrowed a bike to join a charity race. I won because I cycled faster than everyone else, which was surprising because I'd never cycled before! I'm well paid as a professional, and cycling has many opportunities for endorsements. However, I know I'm not unattractive, and it worries me that people might think I've succeeded because of my looks, not because I'm the best cyclist. So I focus on cycling right now, rather than earning money. I train at least four hours every day on the bike, plus some stretching exercises, swimming, and running. My boyfriend is a cyclist too, so he understands the time commitment -- it would be impossible otherwise.""

**C. Annabel, 26, Rower**

""Rowing is hard for girls to get into because very few girls' schools offer it. So most don't start until they're 19 or 20, which makes it harder to succeed internationally. Also, coaches usually stay for only a year or so. There's no continuity, so the women's squad is basically disorganized. But it's great fun, and I love being fit, plus there's a good social life.""

**D. Ffyona, 24, Long Distance Walker**

""At 13, I dreamed of walking around the world -- I didn't know how big it was then! But Britain felt too small, too safe. I was very determined; I hated anyone having control over me. Now I am more tactful. Each walk has been different. The walk across Australia was the worst experience I've ever had in terms of pain. I was doing 50 miles and 21 hours each day with three hours of sleep in high temperatures and walking with 15 blisters on each foot. But I got the record! I had to because my sponsorship money was going to run out after 95 days. Men think that women are more likely to fail, so sponsoring them is always seen as a higher risk.""

**E. Lisa, 26, Saloon Car Racer**

""Some men have huge egos when they're driving - you see it on motorways. When I'm doing well, they don't talk to me. Being a woman has its disadvantages. When I get to a corner, the men think 'I've got to beat her', so I've had a lot of knocks! You have to be naturally competitive and aggressive. It's very difficult to earn any money, and what I do make goes back into the sport. Women have been racing since the twenties and have always been seen as unusual. It's great that more and more women are taking up racing every year. For me, the appeal of saloon car racing is aiming for perfection, always trying to complete a perfect lap.""

**F. Alison, 28, Triathlete**

""I get up at 5.30 three mornings a week to swim. I need Tuesday and Thursday mornings to catch up on my sleep. In the evening, I just cycle or run. Yes, I do fall asleep at my desk sometimes! There is a lot of nervous build-up beforehand, and when you're racing, you really push yourself - you don't feel good if you don't. Several times I've asked myself why I do it. The answer is a) I'm happier when I keep fit, b) I'm lazy at heart, and if I didn't make myself do this, I'd really be lazy, c) racing is very social. Men and women usually compete together, but when an event is covered in the press, 90 percent of the article will explain the men's event, and 10 percent will say, 'Oh, by the way, so-and-so won the women's event'. The prize money isn't as good either, of course. But now we've formed an International Triathlon Women's Commission, so we're working on it."""
CAE_34,"**The Day I Drew Picasso**

Richard Cork remembers the day he met Picasso, one of the most famous artists of the century. At 18 years old, Richard was traveling around Europe and Morocco before starting university. He was low on money and found a job painting boats in Cannes. One day, while eating at a restaurant in Cannes harbor, he saw Picasso, who was 78 years old at the time, having lunch with his wife, Jacqueline, and three friends. Picasso was known to be a private person, so Richard was surprised to see him there.

Encouraged by a friend, Richard approached Picasso to ask for his autograph. To his surprise, Picasso agreed and signed Richard's sketchbook. He even added a playful drawing on the page. Richard was thrilled and started a conversation with Picasso, with the help of an American woman who translated for them.

After showing his friend the autograph, Richard was encouraged to go back and draw Picasso's portrait. Without asking for permission, Richard started sketching Picasso, who made funny faces to make the task difficult. Eventually, Picasso relaxed and allowed Richard to draw him properly. Richard noticed how youthful and intense Picasso's eyes were, despite his age.

When Richard finished, Picasso wanted to see the portrait. Although Richard was embarrassed, Picasso looked at it and then decided to draw Richard in return. In a few quick strokes, Picasso created a playful version of Richard's face. Richard asked Picasso to sign the drawing, but Picasso declined, saying Richard already had his signature.

Looking back, Richard feels very lucky to have met Picasso and received his attention. It was a memorable experience for him."
CAE_12,"**Talking Shop: How Stores Make You Spend More**

Have you ever gone into a store and bought more than you planned? We explain the tricks shops use to make you spend more money.

**A. The Image of Freshness**

Supermarkets know that customers value fresh produce. They often place fruits and vegetables at the store entrance or have displays of house plants to create a fresh image. An in-store bakery might spread the smell of fresh bread throughout the store. The store's colors, like green, can also make things seem fresher. However, most of what supermarkets sell, like frozen foods and cleaning products, doesn't match this fresh image.

**B. Displaying to Advantage**

Where products are placed in a store is very important for sales, especially in supermarkets. With computerized systems, supermarkets know which areas are most popular with shoppers. They place high-profit items or fast-selling products in these spots. Shelves at eye level are prime locations for products because they sell better. Special offer bins attract bargain hunters. Stores also use 'complementation' by placing related items, like salad dressings near salads, together.

**C. Spreading Staples Around the Store**

Supermarkets often place basic items like bread and sugar far from the entrance. This way, shoppers pass by more expensive items on their way. Similarly, chain stores put popular products far from the entrance, trusting that loyal customers will search for them and see other tempting products along the way.

**D. Less Sells More**

Chain stores have changed how they display products. The Next chain, for example, moved away from stacking items high and selling them cheap. Instead, they display fewer items to make them seem exclusive. This strategy is more about good store design than the uniqueness of the clothes.

**E. Tempting Totals**

Food shoppers often focus on the total cost of their shopping rather than individual prices. Supermarkets use this by mixing low-profit staples with high-profit items. They might sell some items at a loss to attract customers, known as 'loss leaders.' More often, they buy in bulk to get discounts from manufacturers.

**F. The All-Important Price Tag**

In chain stores, customers buy fewer items and notice individual prices more. Pricing a blouse at $14.99 instead of $15 can make a difference. This pricing also helps reduce theft, as staff must record the sale to give change.

**G. Lighting to Effect**

Both supermarkets and chain stores carefully plan their lighting. Chain stores aim for natural lighting so clothes look the same as they would in daylight. Supermarkets use special lighting and mirrors to make fresh produce look more appealing.

**H. Walk This Way**

Some chain stores use different carpets to guide shoppers through the store. These paths, called the 'Yellow Brick Road,' lead customers through the store. However, not all shoppers follow these paths. Marks and Spencer, for example, use wood or marble for paths and carpet for sales areas to encourage shoppers to explore.

**I. In-Store Promotion**

When you enter a supermarket, you might see large photos of delicious food. In the U.S., some supermarkets use 'video trolleys' with screens that show ads as you shop. Sensors trigger ads for products near you, like ready-made meals. These trolleys target impulse buyers and can increase sales by about 30%."
CAE_26,"Chris Bonnington, a 58-year-old mountaineer, is famous for climbing Everest in 1985. He has also created new climbing routes in Britain and the Alps and has written books like ""Quest for Adventure"" and ""Everest the Hard Way."" Robin Knox-Johnston, aged 53, started his sea career in the Merchant Navy. In 1968-9, he was the first person to sail around the world alone in his yacht, Sunhaili. He also set a record for crossing the Atlantic, taking 10 days from New York to the Lizard. Chris and Robin teamed up to sail and climb in Greenland, and they wrote about their journey in their book ""Sea, Ice and Rock.""

In 1979, while working on ""Quest for Adventure,"" Chris contacted Robin for an interview. Robin invited Chris to join him for a sail, where Chris could teach him climbing, and Robin could teach Chris sailing. It was Chris's first time on a yacht. After sailing, they anchored, and Robin's wife and daughter stayed on the boat while Chris and Robin went ashore to climb. Chris was impressed by Robin's calmness in difficult climbing conditions. When they reached a big drop, Chris showed Robin how to climb down, but Robin preferred to use his own method, which he did safely.

During their trip to Skye, Chris and Robin became good friends. Robin suggested they combine their skills for a trip to Greenland, which was a bigger version of their Skye adventure. Chris admired Robin's leadership. Although the skipper usually makes all decisions, Robin asked for everyone's opinion. Chris found the sailing part boring and challenging, as he preferred land and wasn't handy with repairs. Robin, however, enjoyed fixing things on the boat. Chris sometimes felt useless, as Robin didn't really need his help.

The yacht was crowded with six people on a 32ft boat meant for four. In Greenland, when it was Chris's turn to lead, he found it hard to be responsible for Robin's safety while climbing. If Robin had fallen, he could have pulled Chris down too. Climbing Greenland's highest mountain, the Cathedral, was tougher than Chris expected. Robin, not a natural climber, impressed Chris with his determination. They tried to reach the top for 24 hours but had to turn back. Despite worries about the boat, Robin was eager to try climbing again.

The only tension between them happened on the way home. Chris was supposed to take a watch shift at 4 am, but Robin didn't wake him, thinking he could manage alone. Chris felt Robin didn't trust him, but Robin reassured him it was a misunderstanding. By the end of the Greenland expedition, Chris realized that beneath Robin's tough exterior, he was a kind and sensitive person."
CAE_8,"**A History of the Apple**

Apples have been with us for a very long time, in many different colors, shapes, and sizes. However, in the late 20th century, we risk losing this heritage.

**Prehistoric Wild Apples (8,000 BC)**

Humans have been eating apples since prehistoric times. In ancient Britain, people spat out apple seeds. Around 10,000 years ago, they left apple remains near their homes in Switzerland and Italy. In Switzerland and near the Caucasus mountains, ancient people stored apple halves for winter. These were wild crab apples, small and wrinkled, known in Ancient Britain as 'windings'. They were very different from the apples we know today.

**Norman Knowledge (1000 AD)**

The French learned fruit-growing skills from the Romans, which they developed in monasteries. This knowledge, including cider-making, was brought to Britain. The dessert apple, Decio, was introduced by the Roman general, Etio. However, most Roman apple varieties did not suit the British climate, so Norman varieties became more popular. British monks continued to experiment and develop new apples, and many Western apples come from these varieties.

**Medieval Favorites (1200)**

In the 13th century, several apple types became popular in Britain. The Old English Pearmain, recorded in 1204, was the main dessert apple until the 18th century. Its cooking partner was the Costard, sold in Oxford markets from 1296 to the 17th century, giving us the word 'costermonger' for a fruit and vegetable seller. However, apple production declined due to droughts, the Black Death, and the Wars of the Roses. More apples were imported until the 16th century when Henry VIII sent Richard Harris to France to learn about apple cultivation. Harris returned with many grafts, including the famous Pippins, and created the first modern-style orchard in Kent.

**Settler Treasure (1750)**

By the 17th century, apples were so popular in Britain that settlers took them to Canada, Australia, the US, South Africa, and New Zealand. Captain Bligh took apples to Australia, Jan van Riebeeck to South Africa, and the Pilgrim Fathers to America. In North America, John Chapman, known as 'Johnny Appleseed', was a famous apple planter. Born in 1774, he planted apple nurseries from Pennsylvania to Indiana. He was seen as a medicine man by the Indians and became a folk hero.

**Modern Delicious (1850)**

Around this time in Iowa, a Quaker farmer named Jesse Hiatt found a new apple tree growing from a dead tree's roots. He named the apple 'Hawkey'. At a fruit show, a judge tasted it and exclaimed 'Delicious, delicious!'. In 1895, it was introduced to the market as 'Delicious' and became one of the most widely grown apples in the world.

**Granny Smith (1850)**

Another famous apple was discovered in Australia by Maria Anne Smith. Known as 'Granny Smith', she found a small tree growing from discarded fruit in 1868. She transplanted it and soon harvested the first major crop of green apples, which became famous worldwide. She said, 'Well, it's just like God to make something useful out of what we think is rubbish', referring to both the fruit and her convict origins.

**Uniformity (1950)**

Today, apples are grown worldwide, from India to Africa. Most are grown commercially and come from just a few varieties, chosen for their red skin or ability to travel well, not for taste. This uniformity is reducing the variety and gene pool of apples. While UK gardeners have kept many old varieties alive, the US has lost most of its apples from 100 years ago. Consumers are now demanding more variety. We must value and protect natural diversity in apples and other foods for everyone's benefit."

CAE_30,"Richard Nerurkar, a top British 10,000-metre runner, visited a high-altitude training camp in Kenya. This camp is located in Nanyuki, near Mount Kenya, and has been his base for winter training for three years. However, he had never trained with Kenyan runners on their home ground until his fourth trip. During this visit, he competed in his first race in Kenya and stayed at the national team training camp. He was invited by Kenya's national team coach after finishing fifth in a World Championship race. Training at high altitude helps produce more red blood cells, improving oxygen capacity, which has benefited many Kenyan runners.

His first race in Africa was an international cross-country race in Nairobi. Out of the 41 runners who finished ahead of him, almost all were Kenyan. Despite this, he felt he had a good race. He believes Kenyan success is not just due to altitude. Kenyan runners have a simple approach to running, with an effortless style, simple diet, and a love for competition. The key to their success might be their training methods.

At the national team training camp, located at St Mark's College, 6,200 feet up Mt Kenya, the facilities are basic. Athletes live with college students in simple dormitories. Their day includes three workouts: an easy morning run, interval training mid-morning, and a steady run in the afternoon, covering about 40 kilometers daily. Sundays are easier, with only one 20-kilometer run. Meals are simple, with tea, bread, and boiled eggs for breakfast, and ugali, stew, and vegetables for lunch and dinner. After running, they bathe in streams from Mt Kenya's glaciers.

By the end of his stay, Richard appreciated Kenyan success even more. He realized it is not just about genetics, upbringing, or altitude. The simple lifestyle, tough training, and passion for success might be the real reasons behind Kenya's dominance in distance running."
CAE_7,"**Hit and Miss of Mass Marketing**

Advertising is struggling. This isn't just because of the recession. Advertising started to decline in early 1989, before the recession hit hard. The problems with advertising are deeper and affect the whole world. Advertising hasn't kept up with economic changes. Advertisers think about mass markets and mass media, but as more brands and media have appeared, target markets have become smaller. Even big brand campaigns should focus on smaller audiences, but they often don't. This is where advertising has gone wrong.

Think about your shopping habits. When you go to a supermarket, you might buy 30 to 50 items. Many of these won't be advertised brands. You might buy a few advertised brands from the 15,000 products in the store. Over a year, you probably buy only a few hundred brands. For things like cars, you might buy one every three years, and it might be provided by your employer. You don't buy many clothes either, and most aren't advertised brands. Even with all the services and products you buy, you probably don't buy more than 400 different brands a year.

Compare this to the 32,500 branded goods and services advertised. Let's focus on the 9,500 brands that spend more on advertising. The average person buys 400 of these 9,500 brands, and not all because of advertising. That's about 4 percent. So, you could say 96 percent of advertising is wasted, but nobody knows which part.

When you watch TV, count how many commercials are for brands you buy or might buy. For most people, it's about one in 16 (6 percent), so the other 15 (94 percent) seem wasted. You might think you're not affected by advertising, but almost everyone thinks that. The truth is, nobody buys most of the brands they see advertised. Waste is part of using media for advertising. People notice only a few ads and ignore the rest, so waste can't be avoided.

That doesn't mean advertising isn't effective. Many ads have shown it is. Advertising needs to reach many people to find the right audience, because advertisers can't know in advance who will respond. Media advertising works because it's a cheap way to communicate with many people. However, all waste is unpleasant. With smart targeting, advertisers can reduce waste by reaching more people who will respond, but they can never know exactly who will respond. Even the best direct mail never gets a 100 percent response.

This is different from face-to-face selling, where a salesperson might succeed with every client. This can't happen with media. If advertisers knew exactly who would respond, they wouldn't need media. They could contact people directly. This is true for all types of ads, from personal notices to soft drink commercials. An advertiser who gains one million new customers (2 percent of the adult population) is doing well. For soap powder, the top brands would be happy with a million extra customers. Any campaign that wins over 2 percent of the population is very successful, and that's a small part of the population. To succeed, advertising needs to target its message more precisely than ever before."
CAE_43,"Text: 'Charles Clover explores Britain's most environmentally-friendly home. Southwell in Nottinghamshire has some surprises. One is Southwell Minster, an ancient cathedral with 'green' men figures carved by medieval craftsmen. Another is the 'autonomous house', Britain's greenest home, designed by Robert and Brenda Vale. The Vales use rainwater for washing and drinking, recycle sewage into garden compost, and heat their house with waste heat from appliances and body heat from their family and two cats, Edison and Faraday. The house looks traditional, with a clay tile roof, and blends with the town's old buildings. It is in a conservation area and has a solar-powered doorbell. Inside, the house is very quiet due to its super-insulated walls and triple-glazed windows. Visitors must remove their shoes, and the house feels peaceful. On a sunny day, the conservatory warms the air before it enters the house. Robert opens ventilation shafts and windows to create airflow because the house is very draught-proof. Even the cats have their own air-locked door. The Vales, who teach architecture at Nottingham University, have been interested in the environment for a long time. They wrote a book on green architecture in the 1970s. They designed a house that emits no carbon dioxide and does not use mains water. They use composting toilets, rainwater tanks, and copper gutters to protect drinking water. Water from washing goes into the garden, and they avoid using strong detergents. The Vales wanted to show that it is possible to design a house that is less harmful to the environment without living in darkness. The house's only medieval feature is its aesthetic: the hall rises the full height of the building. The Vales pay no water bills, and last winter, the house used only nine units of electricity a day, costing about 70p. Soon, they will install solar panels to generate more electricity, enough to charge an electric car. The only heating is a small wood-burning stove, rarely used. In winter, the house stays warm because there are no draughts and no heat loss. Robert says that perceived temperature depends on these factors. The house is low-tech, with materials from a builder's merchant and built by local craftsmen, making it cheap to build. Commercial building companies are not interested in this idea.'"
CAE_51,"Text: 'The camera never lies Arthur Conan Doyle, who created the Sherlock Holmes stories, thought of himself as a rational man, even a scientist. But in 1920, when he saw photos of fairies taken in a garden, he believed they were scientific proof that these tiny creatures really existed. He published the photos with an article he wrote, saying fairies were supernatural wonders. It was not until 1939 that the two women who took the photos admitted they were fake. They had simply cut out pictures of fairies from a book and placed them among flowers. The results are undeniably beautiful. But the simplicity of the trick challenges a basic idea of photography, that the camera cannot lie. But it can, and always could. Today, we are used to computer software allowing us to change our digital images, and it is a myth that photography ever had a true age of innocence. From the moment cameras started capturing reality, that reality was being changed.'"
CAE_11,"**Blacksmiths**

Iron has always fascinated people, and those who work with it, blacksmiths, have been seen as more than just skilled workers. Before the Industrial Revolution, blacksmiths were as respected as doctors and astrologers because they made weapons, armor, and farming tools. They were also celebrated as artists. In the 18th century, blacksmiths created the beautiful ironwork for St Paul's Cathedral. The flowing metal designs of French and Belgian Art Nouveau buildings were also made by talented blacksmiths.

However, by the late 1960s, blacksmiths were almost gone in Britain. Heavy industry no longer needed them, and modern architects rarely used elegant wrought-iron designs. But in the past 10 years, there has been a revival due to more interest in decorative architecture and creative interior design. Still, much of the work seems old-fashioned, with many products labeled as 'classical' or 'Victorian-style'. Trendy stores often sell rusty candlesticks with decorations.

Fortunately, there are new options, and upcoming events aim to promote blacksmithing. The first event is an exhibition by the British Artist Blacksmiths Association (BABA) at the Fire & Iron gallery in Leatherhead, Surrey. Alan Dawson, BABA's secretary, says we might be entering a new Iron Age because both the public and blacksmiths are seeing things differently. Power tools have made it easier for blacksmiths to work with metal, allowing them to bend, split, twist, and weld it easily. Dawson says, 'These artists now have a material that lets them express themselves.'

About 250 pieces are in the show, from bookends to a spiral staircase. Prices start at £90 and go much higher. Most of the money will go to the makers, but some will support the promotion of good ironwork, says Dawson. His own works include an eight-foot gate and a lamp with a glass shade. He describes his style as letting steel bend and flow when hot, like drawing with metal in space.

Many artists are fascinated by iron. Unlike most metals, which are easy to shape when cold, iron and steel are tougher. Susan May, a jeweler, says, 'It's magical because it's soft when hot but becomes rigid when it cools.' Ann Catrin Evans creates door-knockers and handles inspired by horror film castles. One design looks like a ball and chain, another like a Celtic cross. She loves that steel feels permanent. Iron has given people visual pleasure and a sense of security. It will likely continue to be used decoratively for many years, as long as we avoid more rusty candlesticks."
CAE_14,"**THE DAY I STOPPED SMOKING**

I thought everyone would be happy, but one of my colleagues was very angry. ""What do you mean?"" she shouted. ""If it was that easy, why didn't you stop years ago?"" I couldn't really explain how one afternoon I was a heavy smoker, and four hours later I wasn't. It even surprises me. The stop-smoking session was a mix of group therapy and hypnotherapy, and it happened exactly two months and three weeks ago. I hadn't planned to stop and didn't really want to. I didn't like the constant pressure from anti-smoking groups, and I still don't. Also, I had low blood pressure and a healthy family. I didn't cough or feel sick and seemed to recover from colds faster than my friends who had healthier lifestyles.

On that ordinary Thursday afternoon, I went to the Birmingham session of The Easy Way to Stop Smoking to write an article about others trying to quit. ""I won't be trying to stop myself, it wouldn't be fair,"" I said. ""Since I'm here to write, not to stop, it wouldn't be right to expect your method to work on me."" I thought I was being reasonable. After all, I really enjoyed smoking. It gave me real pleasure. I thought the counselor looked at me knowingly. We were encouraged to smoke as much as we wanted, and most of the afternoon was in a room so full of smoke that we had to open the windows. I noticed that when I was told to smoke, I didn't want to, and neither did the others.

I guess the stop-smoking messages made sense. Just as smoking had become a challenge against opposition, the idea of stopping started to feel appealing. The thought of not being a smoker made me feel strong. It was a private feeling, just for me. Could I also conquer the world? In many ways, it was easy. The physical craving for nicotine, like hunger, faded after a minute or two, and I only felt it for four or five days. The one thing I thought would be hardest without cigarettes—my work—wasn't a problem at all. I believed I couldn't meet deadlines without nicotine and would fail to write a story. Surprisingly, spending weekend mornings at home was the hardest part, and it still is. I think smoking was a way to avoid boredom; having a cigarette was an activity. Yes, I miss my cigarettes, but not too much. Each new experience as a non-smoker is a challenge—eating out, waiting for a plane, checking into a hotel, a theater break. All are key moments when I used to smoke."
CAE_63,"Dorothy who? Dorothy Hodgkin is the only British woman scientist to win a Nobel Prize, but she is not well-known in her own country, says Georgina Ferry. For the past four years, I have been asking friends if they know who Dorothy Hodgkin is. When I tell them I am writing her biography, only a few recognize her name. Why should people in Britain know about Dorothy Hodgkin? She is the only British woman scientist to have won a Nobel Prize, which should make her famous. If someone had the same achievement in literature, they would be a household name. Hodgkin, who died in 1994, was an extraordinary person. Her life shows some of the biggest changes of the 20th century, like the progress of women's education and the global spread of science.

When I started my research, I read some scientific biographies. A friend of Hodgkin's suggested a biography of Linus Pauling, a close friend and fellow scientist who also opposed nuclear weapons. I went to a bookshop in my town but found no biography of Pauling. I was surprised that Pauling, a very influential chemist and Nobel Prize winner, was not interesting enough for British readers. Even scientists have doubted the value of scientific biographies. Peter Medawar, another Nobel laureate, once said that scientists' lives are often dull to read about. If scientists think this way, it's no wonder publishers and booksellers do too. This is part of the 'two cultures' idea, which says there is a big gap between the arts and sciences. Only the most famous scientists get biographies in bookshops.

It's not true that scientists have less interesting lives than artists, writers, or politicians. Some scientists avoid media attention to maintain their credibility. A geneticist once told me he didn't want to be quoted or photographed because he didn't want to seem 'self-promoting'. This avoidance gives a wrong impression of science and discourages young people from joining in. Luckily, this is changing. Scientists now appear in public in different ways. For example, Professor Richard Dawkins gives prizes on a TV quiz, and geneticist Steve Jones advertises cars on TV. These activities help people see scientists as real people.

The publishing world is also changing. Scientific biographies used to be scholarly but dull. They often ignored the scientist's personal life. This changed with Richard Feynman's book, ""Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman?"", which was funny and touching. Now, even famous scientists like Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin, Albert Einstein, and Marie Curie are shown with their flaws. Readers are interested in how creative geniuses deal with life's challenges.

Dorothy Hodgkin was dedicated to her scientific work. Her major achievements were solving the structures of penicillin and vitamin B12, which won her the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1964, and insulin, which her team solved in 1969. She pushed scientific techniques to new limits. She also had three children and was married to a historian who was often away. Her personal life may not be directly related to her work, but we can learn from how she balanced different parts of her life. Her life is interesting to everyone, and her science is important too. Scientific inquiry was her passion, as it is for any successful scientist. Explaining this passion is the hardest part for a scientific biographer. Most readers don't have enough scientific knowledge to understand complex ideas without explanation. Understanding science is not harder than reading Shakespeare or learning a language—it just takes effort. It's sad that educated people, who would be embarrassed not to know a famous literary or artistic figure, often don't know about scientists like Dorothy Hodgkin."
CAE_56,"Margaret and her special skill

Margaret Wilkins is known for having a 'sixth sense'. She can use a forked hazel rod to find water underground. Many farmers ask for her help when their wells dry up. Margaret and her husband run a well-drilling business. They use machines like drilling rigs and air-compressed hammers. But to find water, Margaret only needs a forked hazel stick. They are successful more than 90% of the time.

Dowsing is the ability to find water, minerals, and lost objects underground. It is called a 'sixth sense'. There are many ideas about how it works, from physical reasons like magnetism to spiritual ones. One idea is that everything on Earth vibrates, and water vibrates more than other things. Dowsers might be able to sense these vibrations. Some say they can 'sense' water, while others say they can smell it, as smell is a very strong sense.

The Wilkins have been very busy during recent droughts, with a waiting list of almost six weeks. Most of Margaret's customers are farmers with dry wells. She says, 'We usually see customers only once because wells last a long time.' Other customers have remote cottages or barns, now used as holiday homes, where it is too expensive to run water pipes over long distances. Some customers are golf-course developers who need water for their clubhouses.

Margaret tries to find water 50 to 70 meters deep. 'You can't drill a well where farm or other waste might get into the water. The water we find is in cracks of hard rock, and if we bring it straight up, it should be clean. But in Cornwall, you have to watch out for iron.' Electricity is also needed to run the pump, so the well should be near power supplies.

Margaret starts looking for water by using a map and a pendulum on large areas like golf courses. 'I hold the pendulum still and move it over the map. It swings when there is water below.' After finding likely areas on the map, she walks over the fields with a hazel stick. 'When I'm above water, I feel strange and reel slightly. Then I use the stick to find the exact spot to drill.' She holds the stick with both hands and pulls it slightly to create tension. 'When water is below, the stick rises. It's important to drill exactly where the stick shows. If you drill even a little off, you can miss the water. My husband checks the same area, and we usually agree on where to drill. If we don't agree, we keep looking until we do.'

Margaret Wilkins is not alone in this practice. Many people are interested in this mysterious skill. Margaret calls it an 'intuitive perception of the environment'. This might explain why she is so good at finding water. Without this 'sixth sense', how could her family continue their well-drilling business successfully year after year?"
CAE_36,"**We changed lives for a day!**

Have you ever thought about swapping lives with someone else for a day? Maybe you think it would be fun to try something different? We arranged this for four people - read about their experiences.

**Amanda's Story**

Amanda, a 23-year-old mother with two daughters, swapped lives with her friend Cindy, 30, who works as a waitress in a busy London restaurant.

I had never been in a place like it before. It was so dark and noisy, with many people and a great atmosphere. It was very different from my hometown, and I wasn't sure I would manage! Being a mother is busy, but this was something else! I had just fifteen minutes to learn how to carry a tray of drinks with one hand. The other waitresses made it look easy, but as I was getting used to it, the drinks fell off the tray and spilled everywhere. I was so embarrassed, but the other waitresses laughed. Everyone makes mistakes at first!

By opening time at 11:30 am, a queue had already formed outside, and I felt nervous. I was worried about remembering all the orders, but everything was automated. After a few hours, my feet hurt, and I couldn't get used to the loud music. Every time a customer spoke to me, I had to say 'Pardon?', which was embarrassing! By the end of my shift at 5 pm, I was exhausted and wanted to soak my feet in hot water. I couldn't believe it when one waitress said it had been a 'quiet' day!

I never realized how tiring waitressing would be. I thought it was a job for shy people, but you need to be friendly and able to handle lots of customers. I'm quite shy, and I don't think I could manage on a busy Saturday night. I wasn't impressed with the pay either. I must have been a bad waitress because even the rich Americans didn't tip me! I was glad to return to my children. It seems easy after waitressing!

**Cindy's Story**

I was nervous about being a 'mum' for the day, but I was looking forward to it too. I was told the girls were cheeky, but I thought I could handle it. Little did I know! As Amanda left for the restaurant, I had to get the two girls dressed and fed. After dropping off Sophie at school and Katie at nursery, I thought I'd have three hours of peace. Wrong! A note from Amanda reminded me to make the beds, clean the house, and do the washing.

At 1 pm, I picked up Katie, went to the supermarket, and then took her home for lunch. But when I brought Sophie home from school, the real trouble started. They turned the sofa into a trampoline and played a game that involved screaming loudly! I decided to be relaxed, thinking they'd get tired. Wrong again. I thought I had stamina, but they beat me! After much persuasion, I got them into bed by 8 pm, but then the fun started! How many glasses of water can a child drink? I knew it was just a trick to come downstairs and watch TV, but it was exhausting to negotiate with them all evening.

I never realized how tiring it could be to look after two small children. You don't get a second to think about yourself, and the responsibility is overwhelming. Even so, I really enjoyed the day.

**Rosemary's Story**

Rosemary, 42, runs a dairy farm. She swapped with Hilary, 30, a teacher at a primary school.

On the farm, I get up at 5:30 am, so sleeping until 7 was a luxury! But I took a long time deciding what to wear. I couldn't turn up in overalls and boots, could I? Looking at about 400 pupils at assembly, I hoped I blended in and didn't stand out as being from the farm.

After that, it was time for a maths class. The children worked in small groups, using workcards graded by difficulty - very different from when I was at school! Then I helped with a nature project - identifying and feeding snails. By lunchtime, I was exhausted and looked forward to a break, but teachers only have about five minutes to eat. There's so much to do before classes start again.

I attended a staff meeting about reports and helped with athletics trials. After lunch, there was a silent reading lesson (bliss!) and then a French lesson in the video room. This was fun because all the children wanted to practice on me, which showed my rusty French. Finally, we moved to the school hall for Physical Education. I was drained, but the children seemed to have endless energy.

The hardest part was standing in front of the class and speaking - even for just two minutes, it's daunting. Teachers may get more holidays, but I think I'll stick to farming!

**Hilary's Story**

I arrived at White House Farm at 8:30 am, bright and early, only to find Rosemary had been up for three hours! Rosemary's 280-acre farm has 100 Jersey cows, 15 calves, and about 800 ewes! She also makes ice-cream, yoghurt, and cream, which is sold in shops and restaurants.

I spent most of the morning in the ice-cream parlour, bottling milk, squeezing ice-cream into cartons, and sticking on labels. It was hard not to taste the goodies! At lunchtime, it was time to check the sheep. I drove to a field and picked up a ewe that had fallen over. If sheep are left for more than 12 hours once they fall, they could die, so they have to be checked every day. What a nightmare it must be in winter!

After feeding the calves, I started the milking. The process took two-and-a-half hours. And Rosemary does this twice a day, starting at 6 am, seven days a week, 365 days a year! I found it quite a lonely day. I missed the children - animals don't talk back! The worst part is not being able to get away from work. The cows always have to be milked twice a day, so it's hard to plan any time off. Rosemary will only get about three days' holiday this year. Farming seems romantic, but the reality is very different. The income is irregular, and I'd hate to depend on the weather."
CAE_6,"Text: 'A trumpet isn't just for Christmas... It's interesting how many musicians, even famous ones, come from homes without music. Hakan Hardenberger, the only son of parents who didn't play music, grew up in a rural area of southern Sweden. At 30, he is now a unique trumpet player in the world. His records introduce new music, including concertos by forgotten composers from the baroque and classical periods, as well as new works. When you meet him, he looks young and is friendly, much like the sound of the trumpet. Recently, he played the Hummel Trumpet Concerto in one of London's top concert halls, and a TV feature was made about his work and development, filmed in both the UK and Sweden. Born near Malmo, his career began with a Christmas gift when he was eight. His father, who liked Louis Armstrong's music, decided to give him a real trumpet, not a toy. The gift was a success, and Hakan never stopped playing. His mother found a teacher for him, the second trumpet player in the Malmo Symphony Orchestra, Bo Nilsson. Nilsson saw Hakan's natural talent and was passionate about the trumpet. Hardenberger is grateful for having such a teacher from the start. Nilsson was a 'trumpet fanatic' who was always looking for new mouthpieces. Hardenberger explains that the trumpet is a simple instrument with imperfections, and you have to learn to work with them. From the beginning, he had the talent to find the right balance with the trumpet. Even as a child, his unique sound was noticeable. Unlike John Wallace, a great British trumpet player who started in brass bands and orchestras, Hardenberger always saw himself as a solo artist. He admired the French trumpeter Maurice Andre, who also focused on solo performances. Hakan's parents supported his dream to become a professional trumpet player. At 15, he needed to decide where to study. America was considered too far and dangerous, so at 16, he went to Paris to study with Pierre Thibaud. Thibaud advised against joining an orchestra, comparing it to gardening. Hardenberger knew he played better than others his age, but it was during his first competition at 17 in Paris that he realized he had a special gift for connecting with audiences. Thibaud suggested he enter the competition for experience. Hakan learned the pieces for the first round and advanced to the second. He knew most of the pieces in that round too, but in the final, he faced a difficult concerto. He didn't win first prize, but he enjoyed performing and realized that even if he didn't play perfectly, people listened to him. Hardenberger's honesty about his work might seem arrogant, but that's not true. He thoughtfully avoids analyzing his gift for communication, believing that trying to explain it might ruin it. The power of music is in its ability to move people.'"

Rebecca Cripps talks to five women about their different jobs: the good parts, the challenges, and their usual workday.

**A. THE BRAIN SURGEON**

**Name:** Anne  
**Age:** 34  

**ANNE'S DAY**  
""I wake up at 6:30 am, go to the gym at 7 am, and start work by 8 am. I begin operating at 8:30 am. I operate all day on Monday and Wednesday, and sometimes on Friday afternoons. Most head operations take three hours, but some can last all day. I've worked ten hours straight without eating or using the bathroom. Deciding when and how to operate can be stressful. I don't feel stressed while operating, but I do worry about the next day's plans. Brain surgery is often a last option for patients, but when it succeeds, it's amazing and makes up for the times it doesn't. From 10 am to 1 pm, I have an out-patients' clinic where I explain the operations. I enjoy talking to patients, but time pressure can make it hard to comfort them if they get upset. I leave work between 6 pm and 8 pm. Some nights and weekends, I'm on call and always carry my pager. On holidays, I worry for the first three days about the patients I've left behind, and I dream about operating at night. I'm not good at relaxing.""

**B. THE SENIOR DESIGNER**

**Name:** Marita  
**Age:** 31  

**MARITA'S DAY**  
""I get up at 7:45 am, leave home by 8:20 am, take the train, and arrive at work by 9:15 am. On Monday at 10:30 am, we have a meeting to discuss our work, any problems, or if anyone needs help. We work in teams; my team has three senior designers, a company partner, and a junior designer. The work is about 10-15% design; the rest is production. I get a brief from the client, and if we're lucky, they have clear ideas about their goals, target market, and project form. I spend three to four weeks designing, researching, and developing the project. After presenting my ideas to the client and getting their approval, we work out estimates and budgets, and I start hiring photographers and illustrators. I coordinate with printers to ensure the job's needs are met on time. I spend a lot of time managing people and need to communicate well with a wide range of people. When their work comes in, I assemble everything and send it to the printers. Managing several jobs at once can be very stressful. Deadlines are always near, and no day is the same. Lunch is at 1 pm for an hour, and we try to go to the pub. Otherwise, I have sandwiches and work through. It's great when the client likes the designs and the project works; it's disappointing when a job gets rejected after hard work. I get home at 7:30 pm at the earliest, often at 8:30 pm, and sometimes much later. I find it hard to relax when I get back, especially if I'm very busy.""

**C. THE CHAUFFEUR**

**Name:** Linda  
**Age:** 42  

**LINDA'S DAY**  
""I get up at about 7 am most days, but two or three mornings a week, I meet a long-haul flight from Heathrow or Gatwick and get up between 4:30 am and 5 am. At 10:30 or 11 am, I might go for a bike ride or swim. Because chauffeuring is a sitting job, I have to watch my diet and exercise carefully. I usually have a big breakfast and just have snacks during the day. People often ask me to recommend restaurants, nightclubs, or shops, so I need to know my way around. Luckily, many jobs are pre-booked, so I can check routes beforehand. Not everyone is polite. Some passengers are unfriendly, some arrogant, some very rude. But most people behave well, and I've built a good relationship with my regular clients. Sometimes I hear conversations in the car and have to focus on the road and ignore them. The press has tried to make me talk about clients, but I won't. I work seven days a week, up to fifteen hours a day. I have to be careful not to get too tired. I try to go to bed by 11 pm.""

**D. THE LANDSCAPE GARDENER**

**Name:** Tracy  
**Age:** 27  

**TRACY'S DAY**  
""I get up at about 7 am, leave the house at 7:30 am, and get to my first job. My assistant and I spend most of our time maintaining gardens we originally designed and landscaped. We do a few commercial jobs, but most of our work is in private gardens. We spend about an hour and a half at each house. At about 11 am, we get hungry and go to a local cafe for a big breakfast. I often look at my watch and wish it was earlier and that time didn't pass so quickly. In summer, I may work until 10 pm; in winter, until 4:30 pm. The business office is at home, so when I get back, I listen to messages and respond to calls. If someone wants their garden landscaped, I'll usually arrange a consultation with them in the evening, around 7 pm or 8 pm. We specialize in using old materials, like old bricks and unusual plants, to make gardens look as if they were built a long time ago. But sometimes people have a set idea of what they want, and it can be pretty horrible. Still, it's very satisfying when we do a complete landscape from start to finish and then see all the blooms come out. It's hard to relax in the evenings because I can always hear the business line when it rings. I never have trouble sleeping because the work is so physical that I'm always exhausted at the end of the day. I wouldn't say I'm very strong, but I'm fit. Physically, it's a very tough job, but it lets your imagination run wild.""

**E. THE CIVIL ENGINEER**

**Name:** Zena  
**Age:** 27  

**ZENA'S DAY**  
""I arrive at the site by 8:30 am. I'm the assistant resident engineer at the site, so I look after building a couple of bridges and a retaining wall, which stops people from driving off the road into a quarry. I check that the contractors are working to the schedule and specifications, with correct safety systems and minimum environmental impact. I help coordinate the site professionals and find solutions to any problems. The contractors start work at 6 am, so my first task is to find out from the clerk of works what's been going on since I left the night before. The rest of the day is a reaction to whatever he tells me. Usually, there's some paperwork from the contractors to look at, or there might be design questions to answer. Lunch is usually for half an hour between 2 pm and 2:30 pm, but I tend to grab things to eat as I go along. The contractors have set mealtimes, and when they're off eating, it's easier to check things on site. Because we're checking their work, it can cause conflict, so our relationship has to be as open as possible. I see the duty resident engineer once a day. However, if something really important comes up, I don't wait to tell them before I act. I usually leave the site at about 6 pm, and I'm on call all the time."""
CAE_40,"**Careers: Six People Talk About Their Typical Working Day**

**A. Credit Card Executive**

I wake up at 6 am and get to the office by 7.30 am. I manage customer programs for our regular credit card users. My job includes launching and managing the Membership Rewards scheme in major European markets. I keep in touch with current card users, find new ones, and build relationships with partner companies. I spend the first 45 minutes organizing my day and then answer emails. I handle all advertising for the membership program across Europe, so I meet with our marketing team and advertising agencies to plan strategies and future developments. I have meetings most of the day, but I keep my door open for questions. There are nine customer service units in Europe, and I travel to different markets once or twice a week to discuss issues. When I'm in London, I leave work between 6.30 pm and 7.00 pm.

**B. Record Company Executive**

I start work at 10.00 am and go through the mail, which includes 10-20 demo tapes, letters from producers, concert information, and invoices. The phone starts ringing at 10.30 am with calls from producers and publishers. I have meetings throughout the day about campaigns or projects for artists, involving the press, marketing, and the managing director. When I listen to demo tapes, I try to be constructive because it's important to the artists. I know if the sound fits our label. After signing a band, we work on the first album, choosing songs, producers, and musicians. I share my vision of the album with the company for marketing and sales. I also manage budgets and spending. I leave work at 7.00 pm at the earliest and often go to gigs, sometimes seeing up to five new groups a night. After gigs, I might visit an artist in the studio. My social life is mostly work-related, and I often get home at 1.00 am, when I listen to a record to relax.

**C. Sales Director**

I get up at 8.00 am and drive to work, arriving at 9.30 am. I open the mail, check the diary for client visits, and wait to see who comes in. I enjoy showing people around the showrooms and making sales, knowing the furniture is going to a good home. We sell antiques from £1,000 to £6,000 and buy from London salerooms, country house sales, private clients, and overseas. Many items need restoration. We have a full-time restorer, and I work with gilders, picture framers, and paper repairers. I read the Antiques Trade Gazette while having coffee to stay updated on the business, and I often visit the Victoria and Albert Museum to compare furniture. I do the accounts monthly and tax returns every three months. I go home at 5.30 pm and it takes about an hour to unwind.

**D. Air Traffic Controller**

I work a set shift pattern, leaving home at 6.00 am for an early shift. At 7.00 am, I take over one of the four control positions in the tower. We rotate stations, working for about an hour and a half, then taking a half-hour break before returning to a different station. The air traffic controllers, supervisor, and watch manager work as a team to control aircraft movements. In winter, we handle about 1,000 movements a day, and even more in summer. Night shifts are quieter, allowing time to read up on new air traffic requirements between 12 and 4.00 am. It's important to be alert in this job, so I don't hesitate to call in sick if I'm unwell. The work is stressful, and it takes time to relax after a shift. I hope to become a watch manager and eventually a general manager of the airport.

**E. Shop Manager**

If I have an early shift, I leave home by 8.00 am. I start by setting up the electronic point-of-sale system. I ensure someone is at the till and coordinate staff lunches and breaks. I spend the morning helping customers and ordering books for them. I enjoy serving customers, though it can be annoying when they expect you to gather a pile of books based on reviews. Between 2.00 pm and 4.00 pm, publishers' reps visit the shop, and I discuss new titles for the coming months. I decide how many copies of a title the shop might sell. When featuring a new title, I ensure it's delivered on time. The early shift ends at 5.45 pm. I work late shifts twice a week, closing the computer system, locking up, and going home.

**F. Financial Analyst**

I listen to the news at 7.00 am, then get up and take a taxi to work, arriving at 8.45 am. I contact our freelance reporters to learn about events in my region. I assess financial risks for multinational companies abroad, warning clients of potential issues. I provide three services: an online executive preview, a security forecast, and a travel information security guide. From 9.15 am to 9.30 am, I meet with editors to discuss stories. My first executive preview is due online by 10.00 am, and the second by 11.00 am, so I quickly follow up on stories. I type them, send them to my editor for approval, then make any changes before they go through the system. I travel to Africa about three times a year to report on events or stay updated. I leave work around 6.00 pm. It's hard to switch off, and I'm often awake until 1.00 am."
CAE_45,"**Career Power: Take Control at Work**

A. **What Makes a Good Leader?**  
A good leader inspires and guides others. Leadership is not about being tall or very smart. Pat Dixon, author of ""Making the Difference: Women and Men in the Workplace,"" says leadership is about ""making things happen through people who are as enthusiastic and interested as you are."" Enthusiasm is important, and a good leader should speak clearly and confidently. Dixon says, ""It's having the confidence to say 'I believe' instead of 'I think.'""

B. **Recognizing Leadership Potential**  
John van Maurik, director of a Leadership in Management course, believes many people have more leadership potential than they realize. Becoming a leader means recognizing and developing these hidden talents. We are all born with leadership abilities; we just need the right situations to grow. While it's easy to see leadership in famous people like Emmeline Pankhurst or Mahatma Gandhi, it can be harder to see it in our own workplace. Yet, leadership is essential for effective management.

C. **The Best and Worst Bosses**  
Think about the best and worst bosses you've had. They might have been good at setting goals and meeting deadlines. But how did they achieve these? The best leader motivated and supported you. The worst made you feel unimportant and blamed you when things went wrong. The first led well; the second managed poorly.

D. **Leaders vs. Managers**  
Leaders and managers are different. Managers like working within set rules. Leaders create new paths. Michael Shea, author of ""Leadership Rules,"" writes, ""A good manager can keep a company running smoothly, but a good leader can transform a struggling organization.""

E. **Improving Your Leadership Skills**  
Whether you're a boss or a middle manager, you can improve your leadership skills. Here are some lessons:  
- Leadership is best when you choose to do it. Find what you are passionate about and act on it.  
- Think of yourself as a leader. Recognize your ability to lead.  
- Sometimes firm leadership is needed. Try different styles. If you usually ask for others' opinions, try taking the lead. Notice how this changes the outcome.  
- Set goals and exceed them. Identify areas in your job where leadership can improve your effectiveness and career.

F. **Developing Leadership**  
- Leadership develops by taking the lead, taking risks, and learning from mistakes. Learn to delegate, motivate, organize, and praise.  
- Your way of leading might not win over everyone. Keep improving your communication skills. You don't have to be liked, but your ideas and achievements should be.  
- Be visible and accessible to important people. Remember, you don't have to lead all the time. Know where your contribution is vital and help others become leaders too."
CAE_64,"**Films on Video: Reviews by Nick James**

**A. Abyss**  
Before Titanic, director James Cameron made this intense Cold War thriller. It’s about oil rig workers and navy experts trying to save a nuclear submarine deep underwater. The characters, especially foreman Bud, remind us of heroes in Howard Hawks' movies. The production design and special effects are very impressive, but the dialogue and characters are not as strong. Despite the skilled filmmaking, the story feels like a B-movie.

**B. The Thin Red Line**  
This video release of the James Jones novel about the battle for Guadalcanal, directed by Andrew Marton, is interesting compared to Terrence Malick's new film. While Malick's version is mystical and poetic, Marton's is a more traditional war movie, often closer to the book. It focuses on one soldier and his tough sergeant. Although Malick's film is richer, Marton's has its moments, like the flashback of the soldier dreaming of his wife, which is more intense than Malick's softer imagery.

**C. On Guard**  
Loosely based on Paul Feval's 1875 novel, this entertaining swashbuckler is better than most musketeer adventures. Fabrice Luchini plays a great villain, a sneaky politician causing chaos. Vincent Perez is a lively hero, though his role is short. Daniel Auteuil, as an acrobat-turned-swordsman, is perhaps too serious for this fun film, but he has his moments. The filmmakers use costume-drama clichés with such wit and energy that it works well.

**D. Character**  
This is a serious story set in early 1900s Rotterdam. The detailed production and costumes make the film look like a museum piece. Jan Decleir plays the harsh bailiff Dreverhaven, who is ruthless when evicting tenants. The main story is about his difficult relationship with his son, but the filmmakers focus too much on the period details, missing the dark and intense story.

**E. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly**  
This digitally re-mastered video shows director Leone's skills at their best. The sound editing is excellent, with every sound clear and loud. The story is harsh, and whenever it slows down, Morricone's great music makes it exciting again. Morally, there is little difference between the good (Clint Eastwood), the bad (Lee van Cleef), and the ugly (Eli Wallach), as they all act without scruples in the post-Civil War West.

**F. The Longest Day**  
This three-hour war epic by Darryl Zanuck features 'forty-eight international stars.' With four directors and 23,000 extras, it feels overdone. The early scenes, where soldiers wait for the invasion, are slow for both the audience and the characters. Logistically, it’s impressive, but it needs a big screen to be fully appreciated. On video, it loses some of its impact."
CAE_29,"**BOOK A**  
Steve Martin's *Compelling Evidence* is truly engaging. The story follows a lawyer who is trying to start a new practice after leaving a big law firm. He ends up defending his boss's wife, who is accused of murdering her husband. The trial scenes are exciting, with the result uncertain until the end, and there is a surprising twist in the final pages. This is a great first book in a popular genre.

**BOOK B**  
*Curtains for the Cardinal* starts with excitement and throws Sigismondo, a problem-solver for the Italian Renaissance aristocracy, into a mix of politics, church intrigue, and murder. We are sure he will solve the mystery and find the guilty. The plot is complex and the book is a bit long, but it is still very enjoyable.

**BOOK C**  
*File Under: Deceased* introduces a new detective, Leah Hunter, created by first-time author Sarah Lacey. Leah is a tax inspector who starts investigating when a strange man dies at her feet. Despite facing challenges and the disapproval of a local detective sergeant, Leah is strong and successful in every way.

**BOOK D**  
*Double Deuce* by Robert B. Parker features Spenser, a smart private investigator, helping his friend Hawk to remove drug dealers from a poor area in Boston. The dialogue is quick and clever, and there is more philosophy than usual. As always, Parker provides high-quality entertainment.

**BOOK E**  
*False Prophet* by Faye Kellermann features detectives Pete Decker and Marge Dunn. They investigate an attack and robbery at the home of a famous film star's daughter. The author's easy writing style and understanding of human behavior make this an entertaining mystery.

**BOOK F**  
Diane Henry and Nicholas Horrock, a husband and wife team, wrote *Blood Red, Snow White*. It features another lawyer and a female client, but the action happens outside the courtroom. The lawyer becomes a victim as the story unfolds. The book mixes romance, money, and violence to create an exciting suspense novel.

**BOOK G**  
*Dead for a Ducat* by Simon Shaw features actor Philip Fletcher, who becomes a target. A funny group of characters gathers to film a Robin Hood story, but Philip feels this is not the right direction for his career. While Shaw usually entertains, this book is not as strong as his others.

**BOOK H**  
*Fall Down Easy* is Lawrence Gough's best book in a while. Canadian police are after a clever bank robber who targets female bank tellers. The slow, well-paced build-up of tension and the portrayal of the smart, troubled robber make this a standout detective novel."
CAE_57,"Text: 'I might be too old for this adventure, but here I go! At 34, Tim Pozzi has left a good job to go backpacking. He thinks about why he and others his age decide to take this big step. This summer, I quit my job, decided to rent out my apartment, and travel in Southeast Asia for a year. You might think I'm lucky, but I'm 34 years old, and I'm nervous. It's not like I haven't traveled before. After university, I spent two years backpacking around North and South America, and when I came back, I was determined to do it again someday. But you know how it is... I fell in love, started a career, bought an apartment, and got used to earning a salary. But I slowly realized I was giving up my own happiness for my salary. When I handed in my resignation letter, it felt like I was taking control of my life again. I now have no ties. Many of my friends are married with children, and while they wouldn't trade places with me, they envy my lack of responsibilities. I'm no longer in a relationship, and I have no strong career ambitions. I feel almost obliged to make the most of this freedom - if only for my friends' sake! Why am I so nervous? First, it's about making the necessary arrangements. How could I let someone else live in my home? And how would I organize the rental? And besides, I had to decide where to go. I'm a terrible procrastinator and am already several weeks behind my planned schedule. 'Might as well enjoy the summer in England,' I told myself. Then, 'Why not stay for the start of the football season?' Cutting emotional ties makes it even harder. I'm delaying because, deep down, I wonder if I can still handle backpacking. Will I be able to adjust to a simpler way of life? Will I feel out of place among young backpackers just out of school and university? Maybe not. I've found it's more common for Britons in their late twenties and thirties to want to leave their lives behind and travel to foreign places. Jennifer Cox, from Lonely Planet guidebook publishers, says more people realize that adventure is possible: 'People who always say ""I wish I'd had that opportunity"" are realizing they can have it anytime they want. They just need to be brave, organized, and confident enough to do it.' For Danny, a 30-year-old accountant, and his girlfriend Tammy, a 28-year-old teacher, it's a chance to have one last adventure before settling down. They have bought a round-the-world ticket for a year. 'I'm ready to give up job security for the trip,' says Danny. 'There's always a small worry that, ""OK, I'm not moving up the career ladder, I'll be in the same position when I come back,"" but I think it's a risk you have to take. When I left the office, I threw my calculator into the river as a symbolic act of defiance!' For Matt, who just left the Army, the year he spent traveling was a time of change. 'In the military, there's a set way of doing things, a pattern to how you solve problems. I went away because I needed to change this, and get rid of this approach in some cases, to have a reasonable life as a civilian.' While there are many reasons to travel at my age, there seem to be common factors. 'We have a more flexible workforce today,' says Angela Baron of the Institute of Personnel Development. 'More people work on short-term contracts, so if your contract ends, you've got nothing to lose.' Larger companies are even adopting career-break policies. 'If you've spent a lot of time and money training someone, it's nice to know they're coming back at some point rather than going to work for a competitor.' For Dan Hiscocks, managing director of Travellerseye, a publishing company that focuses on the stories of 'ordinary' travelers, more thirty-somethings are rethinking their lives. 'If you're not happy with what you're doing - and many people aren't - it's no longer about just sticking with it. Now people know that opportunities exist and that a job isn't ""for life"" anymore. Travel offers a chance to reassess, to step back and think about your life.' Is giving in to wanderlust just another example of my generation's struggle with adulthood? Jennifer Cox thinks not. 'It's a sign of a better-educated, more stable society when we're less worried about paying the bills and more about living a balanced life. We're actually taking the time to ask ""Is this what I want?"" Ben, a 32-year-old picture researcher going to Central America for a year, doesn't believe he's running away. 'It's more about running towards something. It's trying to get some things that I want for myself.' But he does feel some fear. 'It's the thought of what I'm leaving behind, that comfortable routine - just going into the office every day, saying ""hi"" to everyone, and sitting down with a cup of coffee.' I share Ben's worries about leaving behind an ordered life with few challenges, and I'm not sure I'd be making this journey if I hadn't found my boss so unbearable. As Jennifer Cox points out: 'This is fairly typical. There's often a catalyst, like the end of a relationship or the loss of a job. Such an event can push people to go and do it.' It may have taken a helpful push to get me moving, but I'm now looking forward to the next 12 months with growing excitement. Whatever happens, I'll be able to take satisfaction in having taken control of my life. And in that, I'm sure I speak for all of us older backpackers.'"

Georgina McGuiness took a long break from journalism and felt out of touch with new technology. She shares how she turned her family home into an efficient workplace.

The Christmas before last, I turned 37 and realized I needed to restart my journalism career, which I thought was lost due to technology. My resume showed I was stuck in the 1980s, when typewriters were the latest technology. It seemed unlikely anyone would hire me to work on a computer in a newsroom. Many job ads asked for desktop publishing experience, which I didn't have. I felt I had a better chance of teaching nuclear physics than using a computer to design a page. I was the family technophobe; even pocket calculators confused me, and I couldn't use the video timer. Clearly, I needed to act quickly to save my career.

I thought leaving home before the children did would be difficult until I entered a competition in a local newspaper. Like a story you hear about but never expect to happen to you, my family and I won a computer package. We got a laptop for my husband and a personal computer for the family. We entered a new world where terms like cyberspace, Internet, and surfing became common in our vocabulary. We started chatting with strangers around the world via the Internet. The children stopped watching TV, and I set up a mini-office in the kitchen with a phone-answering machine, a fax, a CD-ROM, and a modem to connect to the Internet. I had everything I needed to work from home and still take the children to school.

The children were confident with computers from the start, as they learned about them at school. I was more hesitant, worried that I would lose all my work if I pressed the wrong button. I was wrong. Although not an expert, I learned the basic skills I needed. It was logical, easy, and foolproof. With perseverance, you learn a little more each day. I recently started freelancing for a magazine, writing about two articles a month, and I feel proud to have the best of both worlds.

How has the computer helped me? Since school, I have always worked at a messy desk, often losing important notes. The computer has made me an organized worker, especially with office tasks. Spreadsheets help me track income and expenses, and pre-formatted invoices and letterheads save me time and effort. For a journalist, being online means I can research stories, ask for more information in journalism forums, and discuss working from home with people worldwide.

If this sounds too good to be true, there is a downside to working from home. You can feel isolated from people. There are distractions, like doing urgent housework first, and when the children are home, we argue over who gets to use the computer. However, more people are buying multimedia PCs, not just for education, leisure, and entertainment. In my street, a new type of home business is growing because people don't have to commute to the city every day.

So, what characterizes home workers as we move into the next century? A report called ""PC Usage in UK Homes"" describes the typical computer user as 38 years old and well-educated; 93% own a personal computer, and 32% have a CD-ROM device; 38% have a laser printer, and 50% have a modem. Considering this, I seem to be ahead of schedule. Who knows, one day I might email a column to a newspaper in Melbourne or, better yet, publish my own magazine from home. It seems the sky, or should I say cyberspace, is the limit."
CAE_59,"**The Tartan Museum**

The new Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh has a modern design that stands out in its historic location. Sally Varlow visited the museum just before it opened to see if its contents were as impressive as its exterior. The museum is hard to miss with its large, yellow sandstone tower and unique building shape. Last winter, the building received mixed reviews, from praise to criticism. Now, as the museum prepares to open, the exhibitions are expected to receive similar reactions.

The museum tells Scotland's story through various historic objects, like Mary Queen of Scots' jewels. It provides a timeline to help visitors understand the displays without overwhelming them with national pride. The main question is whether people will find the museum interesting enough to return. Dr. David Clarke, head of exhibitions, wants the museum to be enjoyable for everyone, not just experts. He avoids using too much imagination in displays, preferring to show what experts know to be true.

The museum uses explanation panels, captions, and some multimedia to tell the stories of the objects. With less than three days before opening, it's still uncertain how effective this will be. However, the museum's design is impressive, with galleries that flow into each other and plenty of natural light.

The museum also has a Discovery Centre for children, thanks to a Junior Board of 9- to 12-year-olds from across Scotland. Although the children wanted to ride through the displays, they got a hands-on center instead. The Twentieth Century gallery on the top floor is the only temporary exhibition, featuring objects chosen by Scottish people and others that impacted life in Scotland. While the idea is fun, it might seem less serious until the computerised personal stories are added next week.

Overall, Dr. Clarke believes that objects can vividly show the past. The modern architecture works well inside, but whether it fits the location is still debated."

Peter Preston

Transition is a nice word. It means moving smoothly from the present to the future. But when it comes to newspapers moving online, the process is not smooth or certain. Many people think it will happen because print newspaper sales are going down while visits to their websites are going up. For example, The Daily Telegraph and The Guardian have seen their print sales drop by 8% to 10% in a year, but their website visits are increasing. This seems true, but it depends on many factors like timing and location.

The World Association of Newspapers says global newspaper circulation went up by 1.1% last year, mostly because of growth in Asia, even though sales in the West went down. News magazines also saw a 5.4% increase. Books show a similar trend. E-readers like Kindle are selling well, but the value of physical books sold only dropped by 0.4%. So, both digital and print are important.

The idea that young people are not reading newspapers is not entirely true. Nearly 5 million people aged 15 to 35 read the main national newspapers. Different countries have different trends. In Britain, print sales dropped by 10.8%, but in Germany, the drop was only 7%, and in France, it was 3.1%.

In the past, people thought online ads would make online newspapers successful. But now, digital ad revenue is falling, and many US newspapers have started charging for online content. The best way to get people to pay is to offer both print and digital access together. Print is still important for selling online subscriptions, and print ads make much more money than online ads.

This situation is not easy for newspaper companies because running both print and online editions is costly. However, newspapers still have a strong presence in print, and being noticed online is harder."
CAE_32,"**Photographing People**

People are very interesting subjects for photos. A picture with a person in it is usually more engaging than one without. However, taking good photos of people can be challenging. Besides technical and artistic aspects, photographers need to pay attention to actions, gestures, and expressions. Sometimes, the camera can make people act unnaturally.

**A. GROUPING PEOPLE**

Avoid straight lines in group photos. Ask people to stand at different angles and distances, or on different levels. You can also have some people sitting or kneeling in front so that all faces are visible, or take the photo from a higher position.

**B. POSING FOR PICTURES**

People often act unnaturally in front of a camera. They might become stiff. Help them relax by suggesting comfortable positions, like folding their hands or putting them in their pockets.

**C. THE RIGHT APPROACH**

Don't pretend you are not taking a picture when you clearly are, as this can create tension. Most people will agree to be photographed, even if they protest at first. They might become self-conscious, so you may need to guide them. A photo can be ruined if the person is looking away aimlessly.

**D. EYE CONTACT**

A photo has more impact if the person is looking at the viewer. Ask them to look into the lens, but they don't have to smile. They might not be able to do this for long, so remind them just before you take the picture. You can also say something funny to get a natural reaction.

**E. CANDID CONCENTRATION**

Instead of direct eye contact, the person can focus on something in the picture. This might be easier for them, and the viewer can follow their gaze. Candid shots are interesting, and the person's expression is important.

**F. EXPRESSIONS AND GESTURES**

Expressions and gestures tell us a lot about the person in a photo. A laughing child makes the viewer smile, while a sad expression can make the viewer feel sympathy. Look for familiar expressions like shrugs, winks, or thumbs-up. They are a universal visual language.

**G. SITUATION INTEREST**

Photos that show a person with their background can be more interesting. The background can add information about the person. Try to exclude irrelevant details or blur them. Make sure the background doesn't overpower the subject. A wide-angle lens can help make the person stand out.

**H. INTERACTION**

When two or more people are interacting, there are chances for good photos. Couples, mothers and babies, or teams working together make appealing shots. Look for eye contact or physical contact, like a handshake. Capture how one person reacts to another with expressions or gestures.

**I. PEOPLE AND PLACES**

Many photos of people are taken on holidays to show the places they visit. To improve these photos, use a standard or wide-angle lens and step back to include the whole scene. Ask people to stand close to the camera, so they are in the foreground without blocking the background. An elevated camera position can help balance the people and the place in the photo.

**J. TO POSE OR NOT TO POSE?**

Decide why you want to take the picture. If it's to remember someone you met briefly, ask them to pose against a nice background. Family photos can be boring if they are all formal poses. Candid photos of events are more lively, and you can get natural shots when you know the person well. A spontaneous picture can bring back memories better than a posed one."
CAE_65,"**Under Sarah's Spell**

Sarah Janson is a trompe-l'oeil artist. Her paintings trick the eye by creating the illusion of reality. In this interview with Joanna Watt, we learn more about her.

Sarah Janson is an artist who doesn't sign her work unless asked. She believes the work is more important than the artist. Janson is very modest and almost makes it seem like her paintings create themselves. This attitude makes her a bit shy in interviews. She doesn't like talking about herself and feels uncomfortable being photographed.

However, once she relaxes, the interview becomes interesting and funny. Janson has been a trompe-l'oeil artist for sixteen years. She studied drawing at art school, got a degree in graphic illustration, and worked at a publishing house. But illustration didn't satisfy her, so she joined a decorator named Jim Smart. He asked her to do a trompe-l'oeil, and she found her passion. She then started her own business, feeling she was on the right path.

Janson's skills in observation and detail, learned from illustrating, are important for trompe-l'oeil. She believes no one can teach you trompe-l'oeil; it's about observing life. She says she is still learning and is honest about her weaknesses, like not being able to paint bread well.

Janson sometimes doubts herself, especially with big projects like the chapel ceiling at Lulworth Castle. She often talks about herself in the third person, as if her talent is separate from her.

Her work is unique and stands out from others who try trompe-l'oeil. She has many important projects, often inspired by architecture. For example, she painted a dining room to look like a Venetian palace and a corridor that seems to lead to more rooms.

Trompe-l'oeil must first trick you and then keep your interest. Janson believes it should also be personal to the client. She enjoys working with clients and getting ideas from them. Many clients become her friends because she spends a lot of time with them during projects.

Janson appreciates her clients and is thankful for those who trust her with their walls. Despite her modesty, she is always busy. She repeats that she doesn't like to boast about herself or her work. But her work is impressive and deserves more recognition."
CAE_61,"**Emotional Intelligence - The Key to Success**

Daniel Goleman talks about the 'people skills' needed to succeed in your career.

**A** The way we are judged at work is changing. It's not just about how smart we are or our training, but also how we handle ourselves and others. This new way of judging is important for deciding who gets hired or promoted. It can show who might become a top performer and who might not. These skills are important for future jobs, no matter what field we work in. They are different from what we learned in school. Doing well in exams doesn't matter much here. This new measure assumes we all have enough intelligence and technical skills. It focuses on social skills and personal qualities like initiative, empathy, adaptability, and persuasiveness. These are called emotional intelligence.

**B** In a time when job security is uncertain, personal qualities are important at work. These have been called 'character', 'personality', or 'soft skills'. Now, they are known as 'emotional intelligence'. This means being able to understand and manage your own and others' feelings, and using them to guide actions. At work, it includes self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills. Some think it means just 'being nice', but sometimes it means being honest, even if it's uncomfortable. It doesn't mean expressing all feelings freely, but managing them well to help people work together towards a common goal.

**C** More businesses see emotional intelligence as important for management. The more complex the job, the more these skills matter. Lack of emotional intelligence can make it hard to use technical skills or intelligence. Some people succeed without it, but as work becomes more complex and team-based, companies where people work well together have an advantage. In today's workplace, with a focus on teamwork and customer service, emotional intelligence is essential for success everywhere.

**D** Unlike IQ, which changes little, emotional intelligence can grow as we learn from life. Studies show people get better at handling emotions, motivating themselves, and improving social skills over time. This growth is often called maturity. Emotional intelligence can be learned, and we can add these skills to help us survive in uncertain job markets. It's not a magic solution for struggling companies, but ignoring the human aspect can make everything else less effective."
CAE_52,"Text: 'Should the media make money from content they don't own? Digital cameras and camera phones have made it easier to capture important events, but social media has changed citizen photography even more. News often first appears on social networks, so some journalists use them to find images when events happen quickly. Unfortunately, some reporters have used user-generated content (UGC) without asking for permission. There is official advice that images on social media can be used without permission if there are special circumstances or strong public interest, but people still argue about whether this is right. Research shows that about one in ten people would film or photograph a news event, so UGC is important for the future of the media. However, to keep a good relationship with the public, the media must make sure people are properly rewarded for their work and always ask for permission.'"
CAE_28,"**Ancient Chinese Medicine in the West: Acupuncture**

Acupuncture is a practice that is 2,000 years old. It is part of traditional Chinese medicine, which also includes herbal remedies, massage, diet, and exercise. Acupuncture is used to treat many conditions, but it is most known in the West for helping with pain. Some general practitioners, midwives, and physiotherapists use it regularly for pain relief.

**A. What is Acupuncture?**

Traditional Chinese medicine believes that health is when the energy of the mind, body, and spirit are balanced. This energy, called Qi (pronounced ""chee""), flows through the body along paths called meridians. There are twelve main meridians, each connected to an internal organ. If the flow of Qi is blocked or weak, the body can become unbalanced, leading to illness. A traditional acupuncturist will try to find where the Qi is imbalanced by checking your pulse, looking at your tongue, and asking about your health, mood, and habits. They use fine needles inserted into the skin and may also use heat or pressure to help the flow of Qi.

**B. Over Three Hundred Points**

The points used in acupuncture are related to meridians and may not be near the area of pain. People often feel a dull ache or tingling when the needle is used. This can be done by hand or with an electro-acupuncture machine. Acupuncturists say this feeling shows the needle has reached the Qi. There are over 300 points on the main meridians, with many more used less often.

**C. Scientific Explanations**

Even without accepting traditional Chinese medicine, some doctors believe acupuncture can help with pain. They have scientific ideas about how it might work, such as: 
- Stimulating certain nerves to block pain signals from reaching the brain.
- Releasing natural pain-relieving substances called endorphins.

**D. Types of Pain Treated**

Many people with long-term pain try acupuncture as a last option. It is commonly used for back pain, sports injuries, arthritis, headaches, migraines, and pain after surgery. Acupuncturists also claim to treat menstrual pain, facial nerve pain, and pain in terminally ill patients.

**E. Modern Use for an Ancient Treatment**

Although acupuncture has been used in China for over 2,000 years, using it instead of anesthesia during surgery began in the 1950s. This helped convince some doctors outside China of its effectiveness. In China, acupuncture is used in many surgeries, including heart surgery. It can be used alone, with electrical stimulation, or with drugs. It is said to reduce pain, but results vary. Acupuncture anesthesia has fewer side effects than traditional anesthesia, like nausea, and recovery is quicker.

**F. Effectiveness**

Clinical trials for acupuncture are hard to conduct, but some show that 50 to 80 percent of people find it effective for chronic pain. Acupuncturists agree with this success rate but acknowledge it doesn't work for everyone. For chronic pain, relief usually takes six to seven visits, but some improvement should be felt after two or three visits.

**G. A Different Approach to Pain**

Western and Chinese medicine view pain differently. Acupuncturists look at the whole person, not just symptoms. They spend time diagnosing and finding weaknesses in the Qi. They also consider external factors like weather and the type of pain. This approach is different from that of most medical doctors.

**H. Traditional or Not?**

Some medical professionals have traditional acupuncture training, while others, including many general practitioners, prefer scientific explanations. Traditional acupuncturists believe that only by using traditional Chinese medicine can deep changes and long-term cures be achieved. It is important to choose an acupuncturist carefully, and they should refer you to a doctor if needed."
CAE_35,"**P.D. James: A Master of Crime Writing**

P.D. James, whose full name is Phyllis Dorothy James, is a famous crime writer. She seems calm and confident, and one might imagine her as a headmistress of a girls' school if she hadn't become a writer. However, her confidence hides her shyness. She admits that her detective character, Adam Dalgliesh, is somewhat based on herself, or how she might have been if she were a man. Like Dalgliesh, she prefers to work alone, especially when writing. She needs privacy to write and can do so almost anywhere as long as she is alone.

Despite her success, P.D. James is humble and does not agree with the idea that she is Britain's most famous crime writer, even though her 12 detective novels are loved by millions worldwide. She enjoys the works of her friend Ruth Rendell, especially those written under the name Barbara Vine. She also reads books by women writers like Iris Murdoch and Anita Brookner, but she appreciates male authors like Graham Greene and Evelyn Waugh as well.

P.D. James found success later in life. Now in her seventies, she published her first crime novel, ""Cover Her Face,"" at the age of 42. She was born in Oxford and grew up in Cambridge, where she met her husband, Connor Bantry White, a student at the university. She chose Cambridge as the setting for her book ""An Unsuitable Job For A Woman.""

Her life has had its challenges. Her husband returned from World War II very ill, and she had to work long hours to support him and their two daughters, Clare and Jane. Her husband's parents helped by taking care of the children during those tough times. While working full-time for the National Health Service, she managed five psychiatric clinics. Later, she worked for 11 years at the Home Office, first in the Police Department and then in the Criminal Law section.

Her work in forensic science made her familiar with the sight of corpses, but it was the structure of crime novels that interested her, not death itself. She always wanted to be a writer and saw writing detective stories as a way to learn how to be a serious novelist. She believes that even within the classic detective story format, one can write meaningful novels about people. Writing detective stories, she says, is a way to bring order to chaos. Solving a crime shows the value of life, even if that life is not lovable. She believes that nobody truly likes violence."
CAE_5,"**The Pen is Mightier than the Psychoanalyst**

The study of handwriting to understand a person's character is becoming more popular. In some countries, if you apply for a job, you might be asked for a sample of your handwriting. Your handwriting could help decide if you are suitable for the job. Handwriting analysis, or graphology, is seen as a real science in many places. Researchers say it can help identify certain illnesses, like heart disease and cancer, and can show psychological states and emotional issues. Handwriting analysis is being used more for career guidance and during job interviews. Many big companies hire graphologists to study the handwriting of candidates for important jobs. However, most doctors and psychiatrists are doubtful about the value of graphology.

Patricia Marne, a professional graphologist for over 20 years, believes doctors should take it more seriously. She thinks handwriting can show psychological traits and some medical conditions. She says, ""Handwriting is a strong indicator of social class and intelligence. It can also assess mental ability and potential, whether a person should focus on arts or sciences, and if they have a devious or open character."" According to Ms. Marne, graphology can be useful in assessing possible criminal tendencies: ""Criminals often have disturbed handwriting, mostly poorly-shaped. Many criminals come from deprived backgrounds and have stopped emotional development. This often appears in childish handwriting and in going over letters several times.""

Ms. Marne can tell if people are honest, manipulative, or reliable employees. ""Young male offenders often have very high ascenders, showing they live in a world of fantasy and dream of success. Graphologists can tell if violence is about to happen, if the writer is under too much pressure, and if there are psychopathic tendencies. Handwriting can be used to predict potential suicides."" Heart and lung problems can also appear, she says. ""You can't diagnose from one sample unless the writing is clearly shaky or disturbed. But if it changes over time or becomes disjointed, or if there's a break in the signature that wasn't there before, it could mean something serious has happened."" A severe emotional upset can also show in a temporarily changed signature, she says.

Ms. Marne says handwriting can reveal other psychological traits. People whose letters form 'threads' instead of being individually formed are, apparently, devious and clever. Those who write mainly in capitals are trying to hide their true selves. Very light pressure indicates sensitivity and lack of energy. Originality in handwriting—how much the writer has changed from standard script—shows confidence and artistic ability. Disconnected writing is a sign of a loner. Very small signatures indicate inhibition and an inferiority complex; circles over the 'i' are a bid for attention, and crossing the 't' heavily over the whole word is a sign of intolerance and a patronizing attitude.

Ms. Marne says it takes six years of study and experience to analyze handwriting accurately, and this must be combined with empathy and intuition. She believes more research is needed to make graphology a proper science. She thinks this will happen soon. ""It's actually more accurate than psychoanalysis, as you can tell the whole history of the person, including all their emotional crises, without asking them questions they might answer incorrectly.""

Although this sounds interesting, there is little solid evidence to support these claims. Some psychiatrists are very critical. They say handwriting is a result of education, artistic ability, and the type of writing taught—and has no other significance."
CAE_41,"Text: 'Is your office working well? Fresh air and the right chairs are important for a happy, healthy workforce, according to a new survey. We visited four different offices to see how healthy and happy they were as working environments. Our expert panel included a building health consultant, an ergonomist (who studies people's working conditions), and an occupational psychologist. Here are their opinions.

Office A: Advertising Agency
Building Health Consultant: This office is very simple; no central heating, no mechanical ventilation, and windows open directly to the street. It is hard to see why this space works, but the team, who are part of a small, dynamic group, seem to have few complaints. They adapt to the seasons by opening doors and roof panels or using electric heaters, much like they do at home. This might be the key: a team of seven people have created a happy, homely working environment without any outside rules.

Ergonomist: The furniture here is mismatched and often creates bad working postures. Chairs are old, most aren't adjustable, and many are broken. Although this is not ideal, the staff have a varied work schedule, which they control—office work, meeting clients, making presentations, etc. This variety reduces the risk of fatigue, boredom, and muscle problems.

Occupational Psychologist: Staff enjoy the variety of work and the flexible office space. They said their office was 'just the right size'—small enough to know what colleagues are doing, large enough to focus on personal work. I found the office attractive and fun, showing both efficiency and creativity.

Office B: News Service
Building Health Consultant: The office may not be exciting, but it is comfortable and the staff do not dislike it. The air quality and maintenance are good, helped by a No Smoking policy.

Ergonomist: The company has already used an ergonomist. Chairs are excellent, lighting and computer equipment are good. Space is good, but the layout could be better. The environment is impersonal and dull, with grey, bare walls.

Occupational Psychologist: Walls are bare except for year planners and a poster about maternity rights. Most staff have been there for at least five years and relationships are okay. The office could be better if desks were arranged to share information more easily. Success stories or project information could be displayed on the walls.

Office C: Bank
Building Health Consultant: This office gets mixed reactions. It feels like being in a glass case, viewing and being viewed by many similar setups. Despite smokers and non-smokers in a small space, the air did not seem stale. Even standing 1.5 meters from a smoker, you couldn't smell the cigarette.

Ergonomist: The office is very standard and uninspiring. Desks are just adequate. Not all chairs meet requirements, but this is user choice. Computer screens are often on small desks with lowered keyboard shelves, which is outdated.

Occupational Psychologist: Staff support each other and are well-served by technology. Many communication awards are displayed. The wood-colored panels and brown carpet give a slightly serious effect. The office is busy.

Office D: Newspaper
Building Health Consultant: It is hard to say anything good about this building. The air-conditioning control is basic, causing big temperature changes. The space is cluttered, and most people have inadequate desk space. The office is very dusty, with many places for dust to settle. The roof also collects dust, which can fall on people below.

Ergonomist: The furniture looks more suitable for a carpentry workshop than a high-tech industry. Most chairs are not good for keyboard users, especially those shorter than 1.75 m. Many chairs are old, lack adjustment, and have armrests that prevent getting close to the desk.

Occupational Psychologist: Old brown chairs, dirty carpets, dust, and dirt everywhere. There is a lot of room for improvement—the place needs a good clean-up, individual success could be more recognized, and air conditioning needs immediate improvement—there are many smokers. Few conversations were happening when we visited; everyone seemed stressed and driven by deadlines. The company needs to adopt team-working.'"
CAE_38,"**Chewing Gum Culture**

Chewing gum is popular and classless, with Americans chewing 12 million sticks every day. Learn how this ancient habit became a big business. Each stick of gum has fewer than ten calories, but it is considered a food and must meet the American Food and Drug Administration's standards. Modern gum is mostly synthetic, with added pine resins and softeners to keep the flavor and improve texture. 

In the past, the ancient Greeks chewed a resin from the mastic tree, found mainly in Greece and Turkey. Greek women used mastic gum to clean their teeth and freshen their breath. American colonists learned from the Amero-Indians in New England to chew resin from spruce trees. In the early 1800s, spruce gum was sold in the eastern United States, making it the first commercial chewing gum there.

Modern chewing gum started in the late 1860s with chicle, a milky substance from the sapodilla tree in Central America. This gum was smoother and more elastic, leading to a new industry. However, attempts to grow sapodilla commercially have failed, so synthetic alternatives were developed as the market grew.

Today, the few remaining chicle gatherers, called chicleros, have a tough and dangerous job. They travel long distances in high humidity to collect sapodilla sap. They face dangers like poisonous snakes and insects, including the chicle fly, which lays eggs in their ears and nose. Using only a rope and an axe, a skilled chiclero climbs a tree to cut the bark and collect the sap. The sap is then carried to a camp, boiled until sticky, and made into bricks. Life at the camp is hard, with a simple maize-based diet and local alcohol.

Despite the harsh conditions, chicleros worry about their jobs. The U.S. once imported 7,000 tonnes of chicle a year from Central America, but last year only 200 tonnes were collected in Mexico's Yucatan peninsula. As gum sales have increased, manufacturers use synthetics to cut costs and meet demand.

Gum producers are finding new ways to market their products. Gum is said to help you relax, boost energy, and reduce tension. Soldiers in both world wars were given gum. Its biggest claim is that it reduces tooth decay. Plaque acid from eating causes decay, but saliva neutralizes the acid and provides minerals like calcium, phosphate, and fluoride. Chewing gum for 20 minutes can increase saliva flow.

Research continues on new textures and flavors. Glycerine and vegetable oil products are used to blend the gum base. Most new flavors are artificial, but some still need natural help. Also, 137 square kilometers of America are used to grow mint for the two most popular chewing gums in the world."

**A. INDIA - GHANERAO HOTEL, RAJASTHAN**  
Ghanerao Hotel is located at the edge of the Aravalli Hills in a small village known for its craftsmen. It combines the calm of an English country house with Indian symbolism. The Ghanerao family has lived here for 400 years, and now Sajjan Singh and his wife welcome guests. The facilities are simple, with hot water provided in buckets, but this simplicity adds to its charm.

**B. NEW ZEALAND - HERMITAGE HOTEL, MOUNT COOK**  
The Hermitage Hotel is on New Zealand's South Island. I discovered it by accident while climbing. After reaching the top of a glacier and walking down, I was surprised to find this hotel. It is in a beautiful, wild area, high up in the mountains. After a tiring climb, finding such luxury, with someone playing Cole Porter on the piano, was amazing.

**C. MAURITIUS - BEACHCOMBER PARADIS HOTEL**  
Located on the south-west of Mauritius, the Paradis Hotel is on its own peninsula in a quiet part of the island. The road to the hotel winds along the coast past empty beaches. The hotel is not small, and many people enjoy the free watersports, but you can find solitude along nine kilometers of private beach. In the evening, when everyone leaves, you can sit on the beach and feel far away from everything.

**D. ST LUCIA - LADERA HOTEL**  
The Ladera Hotel in St Lucia is in a dramatic Caribbean setting. It is quiet and remote, standing 1,000 feet high, with open rooms that look out between the Pitons to the Caribbean Sea. The style is colonial, with furniture made of mahogany and greenheart wood, and beds with muslin netting.

**E. TURKEY - THE SPLENDID HOTEL, ISTANBUL**  
This hotel is on Buyukada in the Princes Islands, a perfect escape from Istanbul's noise. The islands are an hour away by boat and are idyllic. There are no cars, only horse-drawn carriages and beautiful wooden architecture from the 1920s. The Splendid Hotel is a landmark, painted white with red domes, resembling a hotel from the French Riviera. It is a bit worn now but still charming.

**F. FRANCE - CHATEAU D'ETOGES, EPERNAY**  
In the small village of Etoges, in the heart of Champagne, is a beautiful 17th-century chateau. Surrounded by a moat with swans, the chateau was a family home until recently. It has 20 unique rooms, some with four-poster beds, and one even has a billiard table. There are special weekend rates that include breakfast, dinner, and complimentary champagne.

**G. KENYA - THE FAIRVIEW HOTEL, NAIROBI**  
The Fairview is a comfortable hotel in Africa that avoids flashy luxury. It is a popular stop for travelers resting from one safari and planning the next. Some guests decide to stay longer after seeing the gardens, rooms, and dining menu. The hotel is on Nairobi Hill, away from the busy city center. It's a great place to watch the African sunset while enjoying a drink and a hearty dinner.

**H. ITALY - HOTEL SPLENDIDO, PORTOFINO**  
The Duke of Windsor was the first to sign the guest book at Hotel Splendido. Since then, many famous people have visited, like Lauren Bacall and Humphrey Bogart. Today, you might meet a wealthy businessperson. This former monastery-turned-hotel is still splendid, with simple yet delicious food and beautiful Persian rugs."

Sue Brown is a hotel inspector. She checks hotels to see if they are good. Christopher Middleton watched her work. 

At the Globe Hotel, things start badly. The receptionist is talking on the phone and does not notice Sue. Sue whispers, ""Very poor."" This is a common mistake she has seen many times in her 11 years as an inspector. The Globe Hotel has three red stars, which means it is one of the top 130 hotels out of 4,000 in the guide Sue works for. 

The entrance to the hotel is not welcoming. Sue had to enter through an unmanned door and walk down a long, empty corridor. ""Not what I expected,"" she says. 

Things get worse when the receptionist says they have no record of Sue's booking. Most of the hotel's rooms are empty that night. Sue is given a room on the top floor, but she does not like it. It is stuffy, and there is a large hole in the wall behind the wardrobe.

Sue was known for being tough when she started her job. ""The Woman in Black,"" she recalls, though she never wore black. The next morning, after paying her bill, she tells the hotel manager, Robin Greaves, who she is. He looks worried. He apologizes for a bad smell in the lounge, saying there might be a blocked drain. Sue suggests not taking guests to that lounge until it is fixed. Greaves agrees and takes notes. He has been at the hotel for only five months and hopes Sue's feedback will help improve the hotel.

Not everything is bad. Sue praises Emma, the assistant manager, and Trudy, a waitress, for their good work. Dinner was good enough to keep the hotel's two-rosette food rating. Greaves asks how to get three rosettes. Sue suggests not serving a pudding that collapses. 

Sue's job is to say what other guests might be too afraid to say. Sometimes people complain about her, but she has to tell the truth. She also writes a full report for the hotel. Hotels pay to be in the guide, so they want to know how to improve. 

Greaves is relieved to hear that Sue will not recommend taking away the Globe's red stars. However, another inspector will visit in the next two months to check if improvements have been made. ""Good,"" says Greaves, trying to sound positive."
CAE_48,"**Seven Up Mountaineer Doug Scott shares his experiences of climbing the highest peak on each continent: the Seven Summits.**

**A. Mt. Everest, Asia (8,848m)**  
My journey to climb the Seven Summits started later in life. I will describe them in the order I climbed them. On Mt. Everest, my partner Dougal Haston and I were in a snow cave 91 meters below the summit. Dougal started talking to our Equipment Officer, Dave Clark, about sleeping bags, even though only Dougal and I were there. I thought it was due to lack of oxygen. I also found myself talking to my feet, which were getting cold. I remembered other climbers who had lost fingers and toes to frostbite. We were more concerned about how we would survive rather than if we would survive. Over the next two days, I thought about our time on the summit ridge. I realized Dougal was the best partner I could have had. He gave me confidence, and I felt calm, believing everything would work out. I knew I needed a better rhythm to reach the summit, and I did.

**B. Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)**  
This mountain is considered one of the most dangerous in the world. In April 1976, Dougal and I arrived at the Kahiltna Glacier and spent four days carrying equipment and food to the base. After the first day of climbing, we realized how big our task was. We followed a route from 1967 on the lower face, but halfway up, we took a new route to the upper snow basin and summit. We climbed 'alpine style,' carrying our equipment and food. It was the first time a major new route was climbed this way. We camped under a rocky cliff, and by the third day, my sleeping bag was wet. We spent the third night on a windy ridge, and we were both suffering. The air pressure in polar regions is lower, making it feel like we were at 7,000m instead of 6,100m. We packed our bags and finally reached the summit and descended, feeling triumphant.

**C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,895m)**  
In September 1976, Paul Braithwaite and I flew to Nairobi to climb Mt. Kenya. However, we got a free ride to the Tanzanian side of Kilimanjaro and decided to climb Africa's highest mountain. We got lost in the dense jungles of the lower slopes, and water was scarce. On the second day, we found arrows painted on trees and a trail of rubbish leading to a rock pool. I was never so happy to find rubbish on a mountain. We tried a direct start to the breach wall, a 305m-high icicle, but after falling rock and ice, we chose the Umbwe route to reach the summit.

**D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)**  
The standard route up Aconcagua is mostly a walk. In January 1992, I arrived with my wife, Sharu, at Punta del Inca and met fellow mountaineer Phil Erscheler. He was guiding a group up the mountain via the Polish Glacier and invited us to join. After three days of bad weather, we left base camp. The Polish Glacier was icy and windy. With a time limit to return to Buenos Aires, we skipped the glacier and took the north ridges to the standard route, joining many others. The wind was strong as we reached the summit, and we camped outside the refuge before dark. Back at base camp, we met members of the Jakarta Mountaineering Club, who were planning to climb the Seven Summits. They encouraged me to do the same, which I hadn't seriously considered before.

**E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)**  
I learned that climbing Vinson Massif was possible by guiding enough people to cover the costs. Attempting all Seven Summits became a reality. Our team left Britain in November 1992 and traveled to the South Pole. At this time of year, the sun is always above the horizon, and when the wind stops, it's very quiet. On December 7, we left camp for the summit. Despite winds of 80 km/h and temperatures below minus 50°C, we reached the top in 8 hours. Our joy was lessened by the storm, which reduced visibility to a few meters.

**F. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)**  
Our team gathered in St Petersburg in early summer 1994. At Terskol, near Elbrus, a commission was requested from our guide for bringing foreigners, but it was later waived. After a few days of acclimatizing, we took a cableway to 3,900m and walked to a refuge at 4,200m. Two days later, we crossed icy slopes in strong winds. By mid-afternoon, we thought we reached the summit, but there was another ridge to the actual summit. As night fell, we returned to the refuge and descended the next day.

**G. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)**  
On our expedition to Carstensz, we aimed to establish a new route and spend time with the aboriginal Dani people. The largest gold mine in the world is cutting into the mountain, sacred to the local tribes. We were warned about bandits but continued our journey. On May 12, we started climbing. The weather improved, and two team members went ahead. We were slower because Sham was filming. We reached the summit by 11 am, and I received a standing ovation for completing my seventh summit. Mission accomplished!"
FCE_15,"Text: 'Style Merchants Style is important in our lives today, from clothes to home decoration and accessories. Jo Foley shares the trends for this year's fashion followers. Ned Ingham: Dress Designer Ned Ingham creates dreamy, romantic wedding dresses. 'People should avoid traditional, stiff dresses and the 'frilly' look and choose simpler styles,' he says. Ingham has been drawing and designing wedding dresses since he was a schoolboy. At 16, he went to fashion school, where he learned how to cut and make clothes. But you don't have to be a bride to wear an Ingham dress: he also designs long, classic evening dresses with modern colors and fabrics. For those who prefer classic styles, Ingham offers a summer navy-blue suit, a staple in the Englishwoman's wardrobe for most of the 20th century. In his hands, it looks as new as tomorrow. Sally Quail: Jeweller Sally Quail once worked for an art dealer but has no formal training in jewellery. When she couldn't find an engagement ring she liked, she decided to design her own. This led her to become a designer in 1990. Now, many stars look for her pieces. Her style features large semi-precious stones set in gold, inspired by 18th-century jewellery. Recently, she started using diamonds. 'It must reflect my age,' says 36-year-old Quail. 'I reached that moment in every woman's life when she wants a diamond, so I began working with them.' Lily Grimson: Handbag Designer Just four years after starting in the competitive fashion business, Lily Grimson, with only a basic course in art and design, has had two of her creations chosen for a major design exhibition. Her designs are always noticed. All of Grimson's fashion bags are handmade in the UK. A Grimson handbag is not just a container - they are full of glamour, made from the finest calfskin or heavy silk. A mix of style and care makes a Grimson bag special. Peter Little: Hairdresser For over 20 years, Peter Little has styled the hair of some of the world's top people. 'Most women want natural-looking hair and a style they can manage at home,' he says. His approach is unique - to make sure his clients never look like they just left a salon. But this relaxed look is not cheap - £250 for the first appointment, and there's a three-month waiting list. Using his fame, Peter has created his own line of hairdryers and styling tools. Now, those who can't visit his salon can style their hair at home. Penny Pratt: Florist Besides running her small shop, Penny Pratt is a flower consultant for a large supermarket chain and gives floral ideas to top restaurants. This is impressive for someone with no formal training in floristry who left her teaching job 10 years ago to do 'something different'. Her simple, yet modern, creations have won many design prizes in the flower business, helping her start her own London Flower School. She has also given successful lectures in Japan and the USA. She says, 'Flower arrangements are simpler these days. Keep them simple but strong and don't use too many leaves - they are too large and architectural. For wedding bouquets, the rule is: the flowers must be of the same type.' '"
FCE_19,"**Five-star luxury with modern technology**

The five-star Merrion Hotel has just opened in Dublin. It took nearly two years to convert four large eighteenth-century houses into this hotel. This project allowed the hotel to install the latest technology for both staff and guests. General Manager Peter MacCann wants his staff to know guests by name, but he uses the hotel's computer system to remember guests' preferences. This system, which cost £250,000, helps treat returning guests in a special way. For example, if a guest requests certain music CDs during their first stay, those CDs will be ready for them on their next visit. 

Room temperature is a common complaint among hotel guests worldwide. At the Merrion, a high-tech system allows guests to adjust the temperature within three degrees of the normal 18°C. Additionally, the front desk can adjust each room's temperature between 14°C and 25°C. 

Business travelers will appreciate the technology in their rooms. MacCann expects that up to 65% of the hotel's business will come from this market. Each room has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that also works as a photocopier and printer, and a video-conferencing facility. The hotel has prepared for future technology changes by installing extra cables and renting televisions, so they can be easily updated. DVD recorders can also be upgraded when needed.

Despite all this technology, the hotel aims to make guests feel comfortable and not overwhelmed. The 145 bedrooms are large, well-furnished, and welcoming. The hotel also offers a swimming pool, gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a beautiful garden.

The food at the Merrion must be excellent, as expected in luxury hotels. Chef Patrick Guilbaud, whose Dublin restaurant already had two Michelin stars, moved his restaurant to the Merrion. This move benefits both him and the hotel. He has a new, modern kitchen and better parking facilities. The hotel gains a popular and successful restaurant without financial risks. With advanced technology and a skilled staff, the Merrion is set to succeed."
FCE_24,"Artist Susan Shepherd is famous for her flower paintings. Her large garden, full of her favorite flowers like tulips and poppies, provides many of her painting subjects. Some plants grow wildly and spread throughout the garden. The garden has a beautiful mix of colors and shapes, especially in the two long flower borders along the path. This is partly thanks to the previous owners, who loved gardening and left plants that Susan liked. She also kept their gardener, Danny. Susan says, 'It was really his garden.' They got along well, and he understood her ideas when she explained she wanted to paint certain plants.

Susan likes to paint detailed pictures of single plants rather than the whole garden. Sometimes she paints groups of plants where they are, but usually, she picks them and takes them to her studio. She explains, 'I don't set everything up at once. I paint one flower, which might take a few days, then add another one.' Sometimes, it takes her a couple of years to finish a painting. Her busiest time is spring and early summer when tulips and poppies bloom. She finds the way flowers change as they age fascinating. For example, tulips change shape and open up after being put in water.

Susan has always loved plants. She studied botany in school and collected wildflowers. She wasn't interested in gardening back then and thought garden flowers looked fake. She admired how wildflowers could grow in difficult places like rocks or cliffs. Now, her garden has many plants from faraway places, but they fit in well. She has a relaxed attitude towards her garden, like a kind aunt who lets children play freely as long as they don't cause harm.

With two upcoming exhibitions, Susan has less time to work in the garden, so she hired another gardener. However, she believes that to stay connected to her work, 'you have to get your hands dirty.'"
FCE_13,"Many trees in the Brackham area fell during the terrible storms in March. The town lost two big lime trees from the old market square. The town center looked very different without these trees, which upset some of the older residents. Normally, Chief Inspector Douglas Pelham, head of the local police, would have been upset too. But during the storm, when the wind knocked down the walnut tree in his garden, Pelham was too sick to notice. He was a strong and healthy man, but he got very ill with bronchitis for the first time in his life. When he first felt a headache and tightness in his chest, his wife, Molly, tried to get him to see a doctor. Pelham thought the police needed him, so he ignored her and kept working. This made him forgetful and short-tempered. Finally, his colleague, Sergeant Lloyd, took him to the doctor. By then, he was too weak to argue. Soon, he was getting antibiotics from the pharmacy and going home to his wife, who sent him straight to bed. On Thursday morning, when Molly told him the walnut tree had fallen, Pelham couldn't understand it. On Thursday evening, he asked if the house was damaged, was relieved to hear it wasn't, and went back to sleep. On Saturday, when the antibiotics started working and his fever went down, he got up and was shocked to see how different the living room looked without the walnut tree. The Pelhams' large house was in a big garden. It was expensive, but Pelham didn't regret buying it. The garden made it feel private. But now, the storm had changed things. Before, the view from the living room included the beautiful walnut tree. It didn't make the room dark because there was another window on the opposite wall, but it created nice patterns of light and shade that hid the old furniture they brought from their previous house. Without the tree, the room was very bright, and the old furniture looked shabby. The view from the window was also bad. The tall house next door, which the tree had hidden, was now visible with its ugly purple bricks and pipes. It seemed to have many windows looking into the Pelhams' home. ""Doesn't it look terrible?"" Pelham said to his wife. But Molly, standing in the doorway, sounded happy. ""That's what I've been telling you since we moved here. We need to buy a new sofa, no matter the cost."""
FCE_16,"**Living in the Valley**

We had been living in our valley for sixteen months when we first understood the dangers in the surrounding hills that could threaten our survival. It was the year when the storms came early, even before November ended. Until then, we felt safe in our valley, protected by the hills. Soon, snow began to fall. In one day, it was about 15 centimetres deep. It almost blocked our road and made the path by the stream slippery and dangerous. But on the nearby hills, the snow was much deeper and stayed longer. Up there, the wind blew fiercely. In our valley, we only felt sudden strong winds; trees moved, but the branches stayed firm. Yet, we knew we had a reason to worry. The snow and wind were inconvenient, but they did not trouble us much. It was the river, the Ryburn, which usually flowed gently, that threatened us the most. It reminded us of what could have happened if the water from the hills had not been controlled by a series of dams many years ago.

Soon, the snow started to melt. Day after day, we watched dark clouds gather over the hills to the west. Grey clouds spread over the valleys, warning of what was to come. We had seen enough of the sky; now we began to watch the river, which was becoming fuller and wilder every day. The snow was gradually washed away as more rain fell from the clouds, but high up in the hills, the reservoir was filling and was close to danger level. Then it happened - for the first time in years, the reservoir overflowed. Up in the hills, it was like Niagara Falls, as water surged over the dam and poured into the stream below. The river seemed wild as the waters rushed down to its lower parts. Just a couple of metres from our cottage, the stream was wild under the bridge. It was deeper than we had ever seen it near our home, hitting its banks furiously. For three days, we hoped it would stay below its wall. Fortunately, our hopes were answered as the dam held and the waters began to go down.

In the past, before the dam was built, the river had flooded the nearby villages many times. Now, the dam controls the river's flow, and usually, everything is fine; the large amount of water from the hills, from snow and heavy rain, stays behind the dam with just the occasional overflow. We can now enjoy, rather than fear, the big clouds over the valley and be amazed by the river's power. Thanks to this protection, we feel our home in the valley is still safe and secure."
FCE_21,"Film Critic Mark Adams reflects on his last ten years working as a film critic for a newspaper called The Front Page. Writing about films for The Front Page was his first real job. Before that, he had done some reviewing—novels for other newspapers, films for a magazine, and anything he was asked to do for the radio. This is how he met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page, who also wrote for radio and TV. Tom hired him, but Tom was not mainly a journalist, or he might have been more careful in choosing his staff. 

At first, Tom's idea was to have a team of critics handle art forms that didn't need specialized knowledge: books, TV, theatre, film, and radio. They would have a weekly lunch to choose from the artistic material Tom decided they should cover, with guests to make it sociable. It all felt like a dream then: a new newspaper, and Mark was part of the team. It seemed unlikely that a new paper could succeed in a crowded market. It seemed just as likely that a millionaire wanted to help him personally and was pretending to employ him. Such was his lack of self-confidence. The first time he saw someone reading the newspaper on the London Underground and turning to a page with one of his reviews, he didn't know where to look.

Tom's original plan for a team of critics never happened. It was a good idea, but they didn't meet as planned, so everything was done by phone. It turned out that the public preferred to link a reviewer with one subject area, so Mark chose film. Without Tom's initial push, they wouldn't have the current setup, where Mark writes a long weekly piece, usually on one film. This way of working suits him well. He wouldn't have been interested in the usual film critic's role, which involves reviewing every film that comes out. That routine would make him tired quickly. He would soon be sinking into his seat on a Monday morning with the sigh, 'What boring rubbish must I sit through now?'—a sigh often heard in screening rooms worldwide.

The space he is given allows him to expand his argument—or forces him, in a dull week, to make something out of nothing. But what is his role in the public arena? He assumes people choose films based on the stars, publicity, or director. There is also loyalty to 'type' or its opposite. It rarely happens that someone who hates westerns buys a ticket for one after reading a review, or a love story fan avoids a romantic film because of what the papers say. So if a film review isn't really a consumer guide, what is it? He doesn't feel he has to be 'right' about a movie. Nor does he think there should be a certain number of 'great' and 'bad' films each year. All he has to do is present an argument. He's not a judge, and he doesn't want to be."
FCE_46,"Text: Why would a schoolgirl want to swim 1500m, cycle 40km, and then run 10km? Because ""it's fun."" Teenager with a love for endurance WANTED: Sports-loving training partner for a triathlete, preferably female. Chance to work with a potential Olympic champion. Must enjoy distance running (regular 15km sessions), distance swimming (training in cold rivers is helpful), and distance cycling (enjoying 100km rides is a plus). Ability to do all three without resting is essential. The triathlon is becoming one of the most popular Olympic sports. Recently, it has attracted large crowds who are fascinated (and shocked) by athletes swimming 1500m, cycling 40km, then running 10km without stopping. It's exciting for those watching, but why do triathletes want to push their bodies so hard? And why would a 17-year-old with excellent academic results give up everything for this challenging sport? Melanie Sears hasn't yet learned the usual phrases about personal satisfaction and mental challenge that most athletes use. ""You swim for 1500m, then run out of the water and jump on your bike, still wet. Of course, then you freeze. When the 40km cycle ride is over, you have to run 10km, which is a long way when you're exhausted. But it's great fun, and all worth it in the end,"" she says. Melanie entered her first triathlon at 14. ""I won the junior section - but I was the only junior taking part. It seemed so easy that I was waving at my teammates as I went around."" Full of confidence, she entered the National Championships, and although she had the second fastest swim and the fastest run, she didn't place. ""I was following this man and suddenly we came to the sea. We realized then that we had gone wrong. I ended up cycling 20 kilometers too far. I cried all the way through the running."" But she did not give up and is determined that she never will. ""Sometimes I wish I could stop, because then the pain would be over, but I am afraid that if I let myself stop just once, I would be tempted to do it again."" Such determination draws admiration from Steve Trew, the sport's director of coaching. ""I've just been testing her fitness,"" he says, ""and she worked so hard on the running machine that it finally threw her off and into a wall. She had given it everything, but whereas most people step off when they realize they can't go any further, she just kept on."" Melanie was the top junior in this year's European Triathlon Championships, finishing 13th. ""I was almost as good as the top three in swimming and running, but much slower at cycling. That's why I'm working very hard at it."" She is trying to convince her parents, who will pay the £1,300 cost of her trip to New Zealand for this year's World Championships, to buy a £2,000 bike (""It's a special deal, with £1,000 off) so she can try national 25 km and 100 km races later this year. But there is another price to pay. Her tough training sessions have made her a bit of a recluse. ""I don't have a social life,"" she says. ""I'm not a party animal anyway. After two hours of hard swimming on Friday nights, I just want to go to sleep. But I phone and write to the other girls in the team."" What does she talk about? Boys? Clothes? ""No, what sort of times they are achieving."" Where will all this focus end? Melanie has tried other events. She has tried the triathlon ""sprint,"" for example, where you only have to swim 750m, cycle 20km, and run 5km. She wants to enter even tougher events than the triathlon. ""The big trouble is, I have no one of my age to train with,"" she says. Funny, that."
FCE_70,"**The Collectors**

Amanda Roy writes about her collections and why many people enjoy this hobby. I have always loved collecting, and one in three adults shares this interest. It is a world full of passion, envy, enthusiasm, and delight. However, if you enter this world, remember: if you do not love an object, do not collect it.

Since ancient times, people have wanted to collect things. Primitive man collected pebbles and wore them as necklaces. Attracted by their shapes and colors, these pebbles were man's first attempt to gather objects for intellectual and spiritual reasons. Over the centuries, not much has changed. Children still collect stones and seashells for their beauty.

I have been collecting all my life, from flowers like tulips to pottery and paintings. My first collection was stones from my parents' garden. At six, I went to a school in a remote part of England, a cold and windy place surrounded by hills. When my parents visited, they took me to the local museum, full of objects collected by people in the past. I was fascinated by these objects.

Surprisingly, I am not alone in my interest in collecting. One in three adults shares this passion. The reasons why people collect are interesting. Some think it is the only part of their lives where they have complete control. For me, it's just something I enjoy.

One famous collector was the Duc de Berry in France. He had a 'room of wonders' with natural and artificial curiosities, like cups made from coconut shells and pieces of Oriental china. Another collector, Catherine the Great of Russia, had more than 4,000 paintings. However, you do not have to be rich to start a collection. I have collected tulip bulbs and china cups, searching for each type with determination. I remember convincing a fellow tulip collector to give me one I wanted. I planted and watered it until it was stolen by another collector.

I also collected 350 American rag dolls, searching all over the USA for different designs. This collection was destroyed when my house caught fire. The next morning, I saw the remains of my furniture and collection. I am not sure which saddened me more!

I am interested in how collections change hands. A silver spoon that once belonged to a king or a poet gives value to items traded in markets. As small objects become popular collector's items, their prices rise. Toys from the 1950s are now investments, provided you kept the original boxes. (I not only threw away the boxes, but also the contents.)"
FCE_3,"**My Job**

Four people talk about their jobs.

**Lisa - Exhibition Programmes Organiser, Science Museum**

I organize temporary exhibitions. This means planning and designing the exhibition and promoting it. I need to learn about the exhibition topic first and then talk to experts to decide the main themes and goals. I plan what objects and pictures to show. I make sure visitors understand the exhibition by planning interactive displays, workshops, and theatre. I also work with engineers and electricians to ensure the display is safe. Before the exhibition opens, I help design and write brochures and leaflets to inform people about it.

**Janet - Teacher of London Taxi Drivers**

I start my day at 7.30 a.m. by checking the accounts. Then I see what new maps and documents are needed for learning the routes for the London taxi-driver test. By midday, about 50 students are in school, figuring out the best routes using the correct streets and turns. I help when there's a disagreement, like if a right turn is possible at a junction. When students are close to the test, I challenge them by changing their planned routes to make them think.

**Sarah - Marine Conservationist**

I live by the coast and work from home. My job includes answering phone calls, creating educational materials, and setting up training courses. Sometimes, I go to our main office, but mostly I am by the coast. I work with schools and study centers and run courses for coastal managers. I take them out to sea to help them understand marine life better. This often changes their views. I love my job because conservation is my hobby. However, working for a charity means we always need more money, so I am always looking for more resources.

**Chris - Map and Atlas Publisher**

My job is varied. I ensure our publishing program meets market needs and keep stocks of about 300 books we publish. We have high standards for information and content. We get many letters from readers about issues like international boundaries, which need careful replies. I discuss future projects and current sales with co-publishers. I work with an enthusiastic team, which makes the job enjoyable. The downside is there is too much administration, leaving less time for interesting tasks like product development and design."
FCE_10,"Text: 'No Title We always went to Ireland in June. Since the four of us started going on holidays together, we spent the first two weeks of the month at Glencorn Lodge in County Antrim. It's a big house by the sea, near the village of Ardbeag. The English couple who bought the house, the Malseeds, have added to the building, but they did it very carefully. It was Strafe who found Glencorn for us. He saw an advertisement when the Malseeds still needed to advertise. 'How about this?' he said one evening and read out the details. We had gone away together the summer before, to a hotel recommended by friends, but it wasn't a success because the food was terrible. The four of us have been playing cards together for a long time, Dekko, Strafe, Cynthia, and myself. They call me Milly, though my real name is Dorothy Milson. Dekko got his nickname at school, Dekko Deacon sounding quite good, I suppose. He and Strafe were at school together, which is why we call Strafe by his surname as the teachers used to. We're all about the same age and live close to the town where the Malseeds were before they moved from England to Ireland. Quite a coincidence, we always think. 'How very nice,' Mrs. Malseed said, smiling her welcome again this year. She seems to know when guests are about to arrive, as she's rarely not waiting in the large, low-ceilinged hall that always smells of flowers. 'Arthur, take the luggage up,' she told the old porter. 'Rose, Tulip, Lily, and Geranium.' She referred to the names of the rooms reserved for us. Mrs. Malseed painted flowers on the doors of the hotel instead of putting numbers. In winter, when not many people come to Glencorn Lodge, she takes care of little details like that; her husband takes care of redecoration and repairs. 'Well, well, well,' Mr. Malseed said, now entering the hall through the door that leads to the kitchen. 'A hundred thousand welcomes,' he greeted us in the Irish way. He was smiling broadly with his dark brown eyes twinkling, making us feel we were more than just another group of hotel guests. Everyone smiled, and I could feel the others thinking that our holiday had truly begun. Nothing had changed at Glencorn, all was well. Kitty from the dining room came out to greet us. 'You look younger every year, all four of you,' she said, making everyone in the hall laugh again. Arthur led the way to the rooms, carrying as much of our luggage as he could manage and returning for the rest. After dinner, we played cards for a while but didn't play for long because we were still quite tired after the journey. In the lounge, there was a man on his own and a French couple. There were other people at dinner, of course, because in June Glencorn Lodge is always full: from where we sat in the window, we could see some of them walking on the lawns, others taking the cliff path down to the seashore. In the morning we'd do the same: we'd walk along the sands to Ardbeag and have coffee in the hotel there, back in time for lunch. In the afternoon we'd drive somewhere. I knew all that because over the years this kind of pattern had developed. Since we first came here, we'd all fallen in love with every part of its beautiful landscape.'"
FCE_67,"Title: Keeping the Holiday-Makers Happy

A chalet girl's work is never done, as Sarah Sutherland-Pilch explains to Veronica Lee, while she takes a break from making beds and cooking dinners. This is Sarah's second year working as a chalet girl. She is 24 years old and comes from West Sussex. People call her Pilch. She works for a company in Val d'Isere, France, where she cooks and cleans for visitors who come to ski and stay in chalets, which are wooden houses typical of the area. Sarah graduated in French and History of Art from Oxford Brookes University last summer. She says being a chalet girl isn't a career, but it's a fun way to spend a year or two before settling down. 'It's a good way to make contacts. I meet successful people every week.'

Sarah does not live in the chalet. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks about a mile to the chalet, which can host up to 18 guests each week. She has her own breakfast before preparing breakfast for the guests. 'They get everything - porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants.' After the guests finish breakfast, around 9:30 a.m., Sarah cleans up and either prepares afternoon tea, which the guests can help themselves to, or cleans the rooms, which she says is 'the worst part of the job.' By about 11 a.m., she is ready to go skiing. She skis as much as she can. 'On a good day, we can be up there until 4:30 p.m.'

Sarah returns to the chalet to prepare dinner and takes a shower before starting, but she does not sleep. 'It's fatal if you do,' she says. Dinner, which has three courses, is served at 8 p.m., and coffee is usually on the table by 10 p.m. Sarah cleans up after dinner and loads the dishwasher. 'There's nothing worse than coming into a messy kitchen the next morning.' Sometimes she stays and talks with the guests, other times they prefer to be left alone. 'Good guests can make a week brilliant - breakfast this morning was great fun - but some weeks, for whatever reason, don't go quite so well.'

Sarah meets her friends in the chalet where she lives, and they go out around 11 p.m. 'We usually start off in Bananas, might go to G Jay's, and perhaps Dick's T-Bar at the end of the evening,' she says. But Sarah never stays out too late on Saturday night because Sunday is her busiest day of the week. 'A frightful day,' she says, 'when you certainly don't want to be cooking breakfast with a terrible headache.' Work starts earlier than usual on Sunday, as breakfast for guests who are leaving has to be ready by 7 a.m. Once the guests leave, Sarah starts cleaning quickly. 'We just blitz the place - clear the breakfast, strip the beds, get everything ready.' If she hasn't done the week's shopping on Saturday, Sarah does it now. Around 3 p.m., after cleaning, Sarah prepares tea for the new guests. 'They arrive around 4:30 p.m.' Sometimes they are confused and have many questions. 'I'm sure it's the mountain air that does something to them.'

Between tea and dinner, Sarah takes any guests who need boots or skis to the ski shop and then gets a lift back to the chalet from one of the ski shop staff. Soon, it's time for dinner duty again and maybe a drink later, but not always. 'Sometimes I'm so tired I just have an early night,' she says."
FCE_27,"Miss Rita Cohen, a small, pale-skinned girl, visited Seymour's factory one day. She looked much younger than Seymour's daughter, Marie, but said she was six years older. Rita wore overalls and big shoes, and her pretty face was surrounded by curly hair. Seymour found it hard to believe she was studying at the University of Pennsylvania, researching the leather industry in New Jersey for her Master's degree. 

A few times a year, someone would contact Seymour to ask if they could see his factory. Sometimes, he would help a student by answering questions over the phone or giving a short tour if they seemed serious. Rita was almost as small as the children from Marie's third-year class, who had visited the factory years ago. Marie's class came to see how gloves were made, especially Marie's favorite part, the laying-off table. Here, men shaped and pressed each glove by pulling it over steam-heated brass hands. These hands were very hot, shiny, and stood straight up from the table, looking flat. As a child, Marie was fascinated by them and called them 'pancake hands'.

Rita asked, 'How many pieces come in a shipment?' Seymour replied, 'Between twenty and twenty-five thousand.' She took notes and asked, 'Do they come directly to your shipping department?' Seymour liked that she was interested in every detail. He explained, 'They come to the tannery. The tannery is a contractor. We buy the material, and they make it ready for us to work with. My grandfather and father worked in the tannery here in town. So did I, for six months, when I started in the business. Have you ever been inside a tannery?' Rita said, 'Not yet.' Seymour offered, 'I'll arrange a visit for you if you'd like. Tannery work is old and hasn't changed much over the years. It's said to be the oldest industry, with 6,000-year-old relics found in Turkey. The first clothing was just skins tanned by smoking them. My father is the leather expert; you should talk to him. He can talk about gloves for days. Glovemen love their trade. Have you ever seen anything being made, Miss Cohen?' Rita replied, 'I can't say I have. I saw my mother make a cake when I was a child.' Seymour laughed. Rita made him laugh. She was eager to learn, like his daughter Marie, who was taller and fairer than Rita but had a similar intelligence. 

Seymour decided, 'I'll show you the whole process. We'll make you a pair of gloves, and you'll watch them being made from start to finish. What size do you wear?'"
FCE_71,"Text: 'Is it a tough job? Chris Arnot asks four people with dream jobs if they are as wonderful as they seem. A. Raquel Graham Raquel Graham calls from the taxi taking her to the airport. She can't meet tomorrow because her boss wants her in Los Angeles instead. When you're a personal assistant to a pop star, you have to travel around the world quickly. Raquel loves her job and gets along well with her boss. There's just one small problem - she doesn't like flying. 'On a nine-hour trip to California, I usually take sleeping pills to help calm me down,' she admits. Her worst experience was flying on Concorde. 'It felt so closed in with those tiny windows.' When she's not traveling, she works in offices in Manchester and London. She has to do some boring paperwork - organizing the diary, attending meetings with lawyers and accountants, planning schedules, and making more travel arrangements. She didn't apply for the job. A chance meeting with the manager of a pop group led to the offer of work behind the scenes, and she took a secretarial course at night school at the same time. Five years later, she was in the right place at the right time when her boss needed a PA. B. David Brown David Brown has been an accountant and a golf caddy, a person who carries a golfer's bags. Overall, he preferred the golf. Well, so would you if golf was your passion. There were some downsides, though. A small flat fee is offered, plus a percentage of the winnings. The average earnings are between £25,000 and £35,000, and much of that goes on travel and hotels. He was 31 when he first caddied for the golfer, Greg Norman. 'You're not just carrying bags. You're giving advice, using your knowledge against the weather, and trying to understand the course.' His accountancy skills were recently recognized by European Tour Productions when they made him a statistical data administrator. From cards brought in by the caddies, he compiles and analyzes the statistics of each day's play. The results are wanted by television commentators, golfing magazines, and the golfers themselves. C. Martin Fern Martin Fern is the editor of the 'Food and Drink' pages of a daily newspaper, and one of his easier tasks is to try what's on offer in the best restaurants. What does he think about restaurants that charge very high prices? 'For those who can afford it, it's up to them,' he says. 'I'd rather spend £120 on a meal I'll remember for the rest of my life than buy a microwave.' It was his talent as a cook that led to the offer of a food column from a friend who edited a Saturday Review. For Martin, at the time creative director of an advertising agency, it was a useful extra income. He was 42 when another newspaper called to offer a full-time job. 'It meant a 50 percent cut in guaranteed income,' he says. 'But it was a chance to turn my passion into a profession.' He still does all the cooking at home and tries to keep his waistline under control by cycling a couple of miles to the nearest tube station. D. Dick Prince 'I started writing children's stories about 20 years ago,' says Dick Prince, one of Britain's most popular children's writers. 'Before that, I had always loved words and enjoyed using them, but my writing had mainly been poetry. Then I had this idea for a story. I had been a farmer and knew the problem of chickens being killed by a fox. So I wrote a kind of role reversal story called The Fox Busters, which became my first published children's story.' Where do his ideas come from? 'Well, it's not easy, I have to work at them,' he says. 'That is what I usually do in the mornings. I'm not up with the dawn, I'm afraid. After lunch, I spend another couple of hours typing out the morning's scribbling - all of which I do with one finger on an old portable typewriter rather than on one of those awful laptops. I get between 50 and a hundred letters a week, and that is the part about being a writer that I enjoy the most. I do try to answer them all, but nowadays I have some secretarial help.'"
FCE_66,"In the lumberyard by the lake, where trees were turned into boards for building, there was an old two-story brick building. Around it were big piles of soft sawdust. These golden piles covered the yard all the way to the blue lake. That afternoon, with nothing else to do, all the boys followed Michael up a ladder to the roof of the old building. They sat with their legs hanging over the edge, looking at the lake. Suddenly, Michael said, ""I dare you to jump down,"" and without thinking, he jumped off the roof and landed on the sawdust, laughing. ""I dare you all!"" he shouted. ""You're all cowards,"" he said, trying to get them to follow him. Still laughing, he watched them look down from the roof, scared, but then one by one they jumped and got up smiling with relief. In the hot afternoon sun, they lay on the sawdust pile telling jokes until one of the boys said, ""Let's go up on the roof again and jump down."" They weren't very excited, but they all went up to the roof again and started jumping off until only Michael was left. The others were down below, smiling up at him and calling, ""Come on, Mike. What's wrong with you?"" Michael wanted to jump and be with them, but he stayed on the edge of the roof, licking his lips, with a silly smile, wondering why it didn't seem so far the first time. At first, they thought he was joking, but then they saw him clenching his fists. He tried to count to ten and jump, and when that didn't work, he tried to take a deep breath and close his eyes. After a while, the boys began to laugh at him; they were tired of waiting, and it was almost dinnertime. ""Come on, you're a coward, do you think we're going to sit here all night?"" they shouted, and when he didn't move, they started to leave, still shouting. ""Who started this? What's wrong with you all?"" he called. But he stayed on the edge of the roof, looking sadly at the ground. He was alone for nearly an hour while the sun, like a big orange ball, slowly set beyond the lake. His clothes were wet from nervous sweating. Finally, he closed his eyes, slipped off the roof, fell heavily on the sawdust, and lay there for a long time. There were no sounds in the yard; the workers had gone home. As he lay there, he wondered why he couldn't jump, then he got up slowly and walked home, feeling very ashamed and wanting to avoid everyone. He was so late for dinner that his stepmother said coldly, ""You're old enough to get home in time for dinner. But if you won't come home, you'd better stay in tonight."" She was a strong woman with fair skin, a little grey in her hair, and a patient smile. She spoke with controlled seriousness, but Michael, with his dark face looking sad and miserable, hardly heard her; he was still thinking about the boys' smiling faces and their laughter."
FCE_44,"**Careers Advice**

Are you unhappy in your job but unsure how to change it? Kitty Doherty offers some helpful advice. Many people who want to change their job are turning to careers advisers. You will need to write a brief history of yourself and take several tests called 'psychometrics'. After the tests, you receive a summary with career suggestions and possible retraining options.

I decided to try Career Analysts, a large organization that provides career advice. Taking the careers test felt like being back in my science exams. I was in a group of about ten people, answering questions quickly. It was important to remember that it wasn't about passing or failing. The psychometrics involved tasks like finding mistakes in lists of names and numbers and matching similar shapes. After the tests, I had a long chat with an adviser who gave me a report with his observations and recommendations. I agreed with most of the conclusions, although I was a bit disappointed to learn I did poorly in scientific, technical, and practical tests. However, it was reassuring to hear that I made the right choice in journalism.

Rethinking your career doesn't always mean a big change. Last March, after working as a marketing manager for a large insurance company for five years, 25-year-old Donna Laney lost her job. Her friends suggested she visit Career Analysts. ""Losing my job was the perfect chance to step back and review my career,"" says Donna. Some results surprised her. ""I didn't realize I had a talent for design. But I had to consider the cost of retraining against my financial commitments,"" she says. Other suggestions included taking a year off to work in the Far East. ""I decided to use my existing skills and move into something more suitable than insurance. Now, I work as a Public Relations officer. I might have reached this point without Career Analysts, but they helped me see clearly what I wanted to do. I've recommended them to several friends who are all happy with the service.""

Some people feel they wouldn't have reached their goals without help. A visit to Career Counselling Services led 26-year-old Juliet Greene to make life-changing decisions. ""After working for a major bank for six years, I found my job dull and needed a new challenge. I had no idea what I wanted, so I went to Career Counselling Services with an open mind. The tests showed I was interested in sciences,"" she says. ""I had four sessions with an adviser. The third session was recorded, which was helpful because you forget many things you say. After the fourth meeting, I decided to study geology and plan to start a degree course later this year. The advice from Career Counselling Services was worth the fee. I'm much happier and more positive now.""

However, careers advice doesn't work for everyone. Amanda Margetts, a 24-year-old sales representative, says: ""I reached a point in my career where I didn't know what to do next. I thought a careers adviser might suggest something new. Although I got many new ideas, I rejected them because they required a big salary drop or a lot of retraining. I wasn't told anything about myself that I didn't already know,"" she says. ""You have to give the adviser a lot of personal information, and I felt that if I had told a friend the same things, they would have given me similar advice."""
FCE_22,"**Fun at the Dentist's?**

If you visit W. Lloyd Jerome's dental office in the center of Glasgow, you'll notice bright modern paintings on the walls and a stylish blue couch where patients sit during their check-ups. Jerome says, ""Half of the people only go to the dentist when they're in pain instead of going for regular check-ups. That's because they're scared."" To change this, he has tried to make a place where people are not afraid. That's why he decided not to wear a white coat, as he believes people link it with pain. Jerome's idea is that dental treatment should happen in a relaxed, interesting, and enjoyable setting.

This is surprising for many of us who think of dental visits as painful or at least formal and clinical. Jerome says, ""If people are relaxed, entertained, and treated well, they will forget their past bad experiences."" One of his new relaxation methods is virtual-reality headsets. ""We were the first practice in Britain to use them, and they're very popular. The headsets are used for the first check-up, where the patient sits comfortably on the blue couch and watches a film about underwater wildlife while I check their teeth. Then the headset shows a special camera view, giving the patient a tour of their mouth."" Surprisingly, most patients enjoy this part of their dental visit.

Another important point is that the office smells more like a perfume shop than a dentist's. Today, it smells like orange. Jerome explains, ""When people walk in, I want them to feel with all their senses that it's not like a typical dentist's visit. Smell is very important. The usual dental smell can make people nervous if they're scared of dentists."" I found the gentle smell in the office very nice.

Although he is known as Glasgow's most fashionable dentist, Jerome wants to emphasize that he takes his work very seriously. The relaxation techniques are important, but the quality of the treatment is the most important thing. For example, Jerome uses a special tool that sprays warm water on the teeth to clean them, instead of scraping them. It feels a bit strange at first, but as long as people are relaxed, it's not painful at all.

Five years ago, Jerome went to the United States to learn about dental techniques. ""One thing I learned there was that when you make it easier for the patient, you make it easier for yourself,"" he explains. He sees his patient-focused approach as the beginning of a slow change towards less formality in the traditional British dentistry field.

At that moment, a patient arrives. Jerome quickly goes over, offers him a cup of tea (herbal or regular), asks him what video he'd like to watch, and gently leads him to the chair. The patient seems to enjoy this five-star treatment, and it's no surprise. The office feels more like an elegant beauty salon than a regular dental practice."
FCE_39,"**Bitter Water Hits the Big Time**

Chocolate, which started in South America, is now a big global business. At Easter, people in Britain spend over £230 million on chocolate. Eight percent of all chocolate is bought during this time. Only at Christmas do people eat more chocolate. Although large-scale chocolate production began in the last century, the cacao plant was first grown by the Aztec, Toltec, and Mayan civilizations in Central America over three thousand years ago.

The cacao tree is an evergreen, tropical plant found in Africa, South and Central America, the West Indies, and South-East Asia. The fruit of this tree is the size of a melon and contains 20-40 seeds. When dried, they become cacao beans, which are used to make chocolate. In English-speaking countries, they are often called cocoa beans, a misspelling from the 17th century.

The Aztecs used cocoa beans as money and to make a drink called xocoatl, meaning 'bitter water' in their language, Nahuatl. This chocolate drink was flavored with spices and used in ceremonies and to welcome visitors. The Spanish liked it better with cinnamon and sugar, but it took another century for the recipe to spread in Europe. In the late 17th century, chocolate houses opened in Europe's capital cities, where people gathered to drink chocolate.

Until the last century, chocolate drinks were made from solid blocks of chocolate melted in hot water. But in 1826, CJ van Houten from the Netherlands invented chocolate powder by removing most of the cocoa butter from the beans. The chocolate bar as we know it began in 1847 when Fry and Sons, a company in Bristol, combined cocoa butter with chocolate liquor and sugar to make a solid block you could eat. A Swiss company later added milk solids, creating milk chocolate.

At the start of the 20th century, French companies dominated the British chocolate market. In 1879, the English company Cadbury named their Birmingham factory Bournville, hoping to add some French style. But Cadbury's Dairy Milk bar, which started as Dairymaid in 1905, became popular with advertising that linked it to the healthy qualities of English milk. Now, chocolate consumption in Britain is about four bars each week. This has led manufacturers to find new ways to attract customers, like turning chocolate bars into ice cream, soft drinks, or desserts.

Meanwhile, cacao farmers are still affected by a drop in cocoa bean prices at the end of the 1980s. Many small-scale farmers went out of business. Perhaps you could think of them as you enjoy your next chocolate bar."
FCE_18,"**THE SHELL ARTIST**

At 83 years old, Peter Cooke has become an expert in his art. He still wants to try new things like paper-making and feather-work, but for now, he focuses on making unique objects from shells, a skill he has perfected over the last ten years. ""Tell me if I am boring you,"" he says as he shows me his work in his apartment. Peter is not boring; he is enthusiastic, charming, and his creations are beautiful.

He points to shell-covered ornaments above a fireplace. ""I won't mind if people don't buy them because I love them,"" he says. He never planned to sell his work, but friends encouraged him to have an exhibition. Five years ago, he had his first exhibition in London, where 70% of his pieces sold. His second exhibition opened yesterday. The pieces are expensive, with some ornaments costing around £2,000, but Peter doesn't set the prices. He believes no one else makes work like his, and the gallery owner told him, ""One day you'll stop, and everyone will want your pieces because there won't be any more.""

Peter wishes he had started this art earlier in life, as he feels he could have created even more wonderful things. Although he still has ideas, he finds himself more physically limited now. However, his work is far from the typical shell crafts found in seaside shops. He creates intricate boxes, pictures, and realistic flower baskets using tiny shells.

Peter has developed his own method, using materials he finds. He uses cardboard from laundered shirts for flower bases, a special glue from a sail-maker, and washing-up liquid to clean the shells. ""I have an idea of what I want to do, and it just does itself,"" he says, but his attention to detail and color shows careful planning.

His search for beautiful, tiny shells has taken him beyond his local Norfolk shore to places like France, Thailand, Mexico, South Africa, and the Philippines. He only collects dead shells and defends himself against accusations of harming beaches. ""When I collect shells, I hear people crushing them with their feet faster than I can collect them. I would never take shells with living creatures or dive for them, but once they are empty, why shouldn't I collect them?"" His argument is convincing, especially when you see the beauty of his work."
FCE_62,"**The Schoolgirl Model**

When 15-year-old Kira Langer is not traveling to amazing places and appearing on magazine covers, you will probably find her studying for her school exams. Jane Laidlaw finds out more.

""I'm afraid Kira will be a little late,"" the receptionist at the agency told me. ""Oh, fine,"" I said, ""no problem."" I had been trying to convince myself that all the bad things I had read about models were not true, but words like difficult, vain, and unintelligent kept coming into my head. And now she was going to be late. How late? An hour? Three hours? Maybe she wouldn't come at all. What if she decided a visit to the hairdresser's would be more fun than talking to me? If she was late, she would be rushing. She could be in a bad mood and refuse to answer my questions.

But when the winner of the Looks magazine supermodel competition walked in, she was smiling, relaxed, and apologetic, and she was with her mother. Kira was not dressed in expensive designer clothes but in a simple black dress and trainers. There was no sign of a selfish attitude; she was just a very friendly, very tall, very pretty girl. All models under the age of 16 must take an adult with them whenever they work, she explained, and apart from looking very young, her mother was a normal mum - visibly proud of her successful daughter.

Kira seems a bit surprised by her new fame, which is understandable since it was not planned. It was her older sister who decided that she should enter the model competition. ""She saw the competition and said I should go in for it,"" Kira remembers. ""I said no, but she sent some photos in anyway."" When the call came to tell her that she was a finalist, she was at school. Being selected for the final gave Kira the confidence to go through with it, and she performed perfectly. She won easily, and the Select model agency in London immediately offered her work.

Kira now finds that one of the hardest things she has to do is manage her two separate lives. But her friends and teachers have become used to having a star among them. ""They're really proud of me,"" she says. However, a few unkind people at her school are rude about her success. ""They say I have too high an opinion of myself."" This kind of remark must be hard for Kira to deal with, since there can't be many people as successful as her who are less self-important. But she says, ""They assume that because I've suddenly become a model, I can't stay the same. But the only thing that's changed is I've become more confident - not in a horrible way, but I'm able to stand up for myself more.""

As a busy model, though, her social life is obviously affected. The Select agency can call at any time and tell her that she is wanted for a job the next day. ""If my friends are going out together, I can't say I'll come, because I don't know what I'm doing the next day. I can't really make plans, and if I do, they sometimes get broken, but my friends are good about it. They don't say, 'Oh, you're always going off modeling now, you never have time for us.'""

Kira has the looks, ability, and support to have a great career ahead of her. And not many people can say that before they even take their school-leaving exams. I am about to finish the interview with the girl who has it all, and I ask what she would like to do as a career if she didn't have the outstanding beauty that seems certain to take her to the top of the profession. She pauses and replies, ""I'd like to do what you're doing."""
FCE_49,"**Father and Son Search for Gold**

Terence and Chris Madden have traveled from Canada's cold north to Africa's heat to find valuable metals. Terence, an explorer, and his son Chris, a mineral expert, think their mine on a Welsh mountain might have up to 10,000 ounces of gold. After ten years of digging in the Welsh hills, they believe they are very close to finding a gold vein worth five million dollars. Terence, 68, from Liverpool, said, ""As we dig, we are finding high levels of gold; now we just need to dig a few more meters to where it is concentrated.""

The Maddens have dedicated their lives to finding gold. Their search started when Terence read about gold worth millions in the ""Dolgellau gold belt,"" an area near the Welsh town of Dolgellau. They studied 19th-century mining journals and newspapers at the Welsh National Library in Aberystwyth to choose the best area to explore. After clearing the land and finding small pieces of gold in the rocks, they spent ten years getting permission from landowners, taking earth samples, and removing old cars and rubbish. They dug out 150 tonnes of greenstone rock to make a tunnel and a 10-meter shaft. Now, they are running out of money. They need to find someone to invest £50,000 to dig a few more meters to reach the gold. Chris Madden says, ""At the moment, this looks doubtful, although we've got quite a few people we can contact.""

As news spread about their dig, the idea of finding gold excited both locals and gold diggers. Dolgellau depends on tourists, and residents are hopeful. Peter Woolven, manager of the Royal Ship Hotel, said, ""It would bring more people here if they are right, but if they find gold, I hope millions of people don't come and dig up the hillside.""

The Welsh gold industry has declined since the late 1880s when many people worked in hundreds of mines. One of the last mines, Clogau-St David's, which made wedding rings for the Queen and the Princess of Wales, closed a month ago. However, individual gold diggers are returning. George Hall, another prospector, plans to dig a tunnel on the other side of the ridge from the Maddens. Hall, 70, said, ""Searching for gold is very emotional. It's adventurous and exciting, the wonder of uncovering hidden treasure. Maybe I'll be lucky this time."""
FCE_31,"**IN HOT WATER**

Rachel Mills is a scientist who loves exploring the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She works at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University, where she teaches and researches marine geochemistry. This means she studies the chemical processes in the sea. When she is not teaching, she goes on dives to study underwater volcanoes. She uses a small steel vehicle, about the size of a small car, to dive three kilometers down into the ocean. Inside the vehicle, space is very tight, and she can easily touch the two pilots. They are used to these cramped conditions, where they cannot stand or move, and must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can last 16 hours: three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours collecting rock and water samples, and three hours to return to the surface. If there is an emergency, they can press a panic button. This releases a small escape vessel that quickly rises to the surface, like a ping-pong ball in water. However, no one has tested it yet, and Rachel thinks it might not be a pleasant experience.

Rachel remembers her first time in the vehicle. It was on a ship's deck, and she got in with an instructor who explained the emergency procedures, including what to do if the pilot had a heart attack. They wanted to see how she would react in such a small space. Now, Rachel has made six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian crew. They went to a site five days' sail west of the Canary Islands in the Atlantic. There, on the ocean floor, is a large area of underwater volcanoes with chimneys blowing out black smoke. The Russian team was placing scientific equipment to study the effects of a program that would drill a 150-meter hole through a volcano.

When Rachel is not at sea, she is in her office at the Oceanography Centre. She says two-thirds of her salary comes from teaching, which she enjoys, but she does it to support her research on ""black smokers."" This is another name for underwater volcanoes, where water comes out of the rock and looks like black smoke. This water flows at one meter per second and is 350 degrees hot. Rachel recalls being scared once when she first went down with an American team. They were towing equipment on a 50-meter rope when there was a sudden explosion. The shock waves hit their vehicle, and she thought she was going to die. They waited in silence, and when nothing happened, they were incredibly relieved to be alive.

Rachel finds diving to the deepest parts of the ocean an adventure. Every time she looks out of the porthole and sees the chimneys, she feels a sense of wonder. She is at the bottom of the sea, seeing something no one else has seen before. After studying the black smokers for three years for her PhD, seeing them in real life was an amazing experience."
FCE_58,"I was dirty, smelly, hungry, and somewhere beneath all that, suntanned. It was the end of my Inter-Rail holiday. My body couldn't take any more. My mind couldn't handle any more foreign timetables, currencies, or languages. ""Never again,"" I said, as I stepped onto home ground. I said the same thing the next year. And the year after that. All I had to do was buy one train ticket, and because I was under twenty-five years old, I could spend a whole month going anywhere I wanted in Europe. Ordinary beds are never the same once you've learned to sleep in the corridor of a train, the rhythm rocking you into a deep sleep. Carrying all your things in a backpack makes you have a very simple approach to travel, and encourages incredible wastefulness that can lead to burning socks that have become too smelly, and getting rid of books when finished. On the other hand, this way of looking at life is entirely in the spirit of Inter-Rail, for common sense and reasoning can be thrown out of the window along with the paperback book and the socks. All it takes to achieve this carefree attitude is one of those tickets in your hand. Any system that lets young people travel through countries at a rate of more than one a day must be pretty special. On that first trip, my friends and I were at first unaware of the possibilities of this type of train ticket, thinking it was just a cheap way of getting to and from our chosen campsite in southern France. But the idea of non-stop travel proved too tempting, for there was always just one more country over the border, always that little bit further to go. And what did the extra miles cost us? Nothing. We were not completely uninterested in culture. But this was a first holiday without parents, as it was for most other Inter-Railers, and in organizing our own timetable we left out everything except the most immediately available sights. This was the chance to escape the guided tour, an opportunity to do something different. I took great pride in the fact that, in many places, all I could be bothered to see was the view from the station. We were just there to get by, and to have a good time doing so. In this, we were no different from most of the other Inter-Railers with whom we shared corridor floors, food and water, money, and music. The excitement of travel comes from the sudden reality of somewhere that was previously just a name. It is as if the city in which you arrive never actually existed until the train pulls in at the station and you are able to see it with your own tired eyes for the first time. Only by actually seeing Europe, by watching the changing landscapes and seeing the differences in attitudes and lifestyles, can you really have an accurate picture of the continent in your mind. Everybody knows what is there, but it is meaningless until you view it yourself. This is what makes other people's holiday photos so boring. While the train trip won't allow you to discover anything new in the world sense, it is a valuable personal experience. Europe is a big place, and Inter-Rail gives people the best opportunity to recognize this ... though in our case it didn't happen immediately."
FCE_37,"Text: 'It is very disappointing to arrive at an airport in another country and find out that your baggage is missing. At best, you will have to wear the same clothes for hours or days until the airline finds your luggage. At worst, you might be in a different climate and have to wear clothes that are not suitable. Airlines do not often say how many bags they lose, but it is common for frequent travelers to lose their luggage at some point. Even the best airlines make mistakes, and no airline can promise that your checked luggage will be on the same flight, especially if you have to change planes. 

Airlines ask passengers to check in early to give enough time for baggage to be loaded onto the plane. Minimum connecting times (MCTs) are the shortest times needed to transfer between flights, and these are also set to allow for baggage transfers. Usually, the system works well. However, extra security checks and air traffic problems can delay flights and cause the baggage system to fail. Human error or accidents, like a torn-off destination label, can also cause problems. These issues are more common at large transfer airports, called 'hubs', because they handle many bags. For example, last year, London's Heathrow airport had over 41 million passengers, with nine million changing planes. British Airways alone had two million transfer passengers at Heathrow, mostly moving between Terminal 1 and Terminal 4. Even efficient airports like Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Singapore, and Zurich have bad days. The risk of losing baggage is higher at some airports. In the United States, Miami airport is known for losing luggage when passengers connect to flights to Latin America.

To avoid losing your luggage, choose direct flights when possible and check in early. If you must change planes or if it makes your flight cheaper, try to fly with the same airline. Allow more time for connections by taking an earlier flight to the transfer airport, and label your luggage inside and out with your home and holiday addresses. Include the flight numbers. If your luggage still goes missing, contact the airline official in the baggage hall and fill out a property irregularity report (PIR) before leaving the airport.'"
FCE_2,"Text: 'The Kingfisher Wildlife photographer Charlie James is an expert on the kingfisher: a beautiful blue-green bird that lives near streams and rivers, feeding on fish. Old trees hang over the stream, partly shading the shallow water. Soft greens, mud browns, and the different yellows of sunlight are the main colors, as gentle as the sounds of water in the breeze. The bird moves quickly through the scene, like a flash of light and motion that you almost feel. It disappears in a second, but the image stays in your mind, its impact bigger than its size. Charlie James loved kingfishers from a young age. He can't quite explain what attracts him to this little bird. After all, it is legendary. In Greek myth, the kingfisher is a moon goddess who became a bird. Another story says the kingfisher flew so high that its top became the blue of the sky, while its underside was burned by the sun. There is some scientific truth in that story. Even though their feathers look blue, kingfishers have no blue pigment. Instead, the structure of their feathers scatters light and reflects blue. This is why a kingfisher can look bright blue or rich green depending on the light. It's no surprise that some wildlife photographers are so enthusiastic about them. The colors, along with the fact that kingfishers, though shy, can be watched from a hideout, make them a lifelong passion. Charlie James's first hideout was an old blanket he put over his head while he waited near a kingfisher's favorite spot. The bird returned within minutes and sat just a meter away. But it took him four more years to get his first good picture. Meanwhile, the European kingfisher became a big part of his life. He spent as much time as he could by a stream full of kingfishers. The problem was, school took away time from the birds. So he skipped classes, becoming what he calls an 'academic failure'. But his interest in this bird, the only kingfisher to breed in Europe, was noticed. At 16, he was hired as an advisor for a nature magazine. He then worked as an assistant to the editor and gradually became a freelance wildlife film cameraman. Now, he wants to make the ultimate kingfisher film. 'No speech, just beautiful images that say it all,' he says. 'I'm drawn to the simple approach. I like to photograph parts of kingfisher wings ...' His voice trails off. He's thinking of the bird's colors that still excite him after so many years. His photographs show some of his feelings. But, as Charlie knows, there's much more to his relationship with the kingfisher than his work can show.'"
FCE_68,"**Conducting an Orchestra: Insights from Five New Conductors**

**A. ANNE MANSON**  
Anne Manson, 30, had an unexpected start in conducting when she asked to watch Claudio Abbado's rehearsals in Vienna. She ended up replacing an absent assistant and was later invited to help with another opera. ""I wasn't nervous,"" she says. ""I've always been comfortable leading an orchestra."" Manson, originally from the USA, works with a London opera company that focuses on modern music. She is also gaining recognition in Europe, supported by the British Arts Council, and has worked with Abbado on several occasions since.

**B. ANDREW CONSTANTINE**  
Andrew Constantine, 31, says the hardest part of conducting is convincing people to give you opportunities. He won a big competition in 1991 after failing in two others. ""If I had won earlier, I might not have succeeded,"" he reflects. The competition opened doors for him, including working as an assistant to a famous conductor. However, he worries about being known only for the competition. ""If in three years I'm still just the 'competition winner,' I'll be concerned,"" he says. ""But orchestras like the English Chamber Orchestra are inviting me back, which is a good sign.""

**C. WASFI KANI**  
Wasfi Kani, who founded Pimlico Opera, enjoys the long rehearsal periods of opera. ""The music deserves four weeks of focus,"" she says. Kani began conducting seriously in her late twenties. After university, she worked in London's business district until Pimlico Opera became fully professional. Learning from Sian Edwards was crucial for her. ""Seeing someone my size conduct was inspiring,"" she explains. She appreciates the complexity of opera, including managing singers' personalities.

**D. ROGER VIGNOLES**  
Roger Vignoles, 48, found conducting unexpectedly fascinating. He started as a musician in an opera house and worked with skilled conductors. Last year, he directed Handel's Agrippina from the piano at a festival, a new experience for him. ""It was easier than I thought,"" he says. ""I knew the music and what I wanted it to sound like."" Vignoles values all his past experiences in music and performance. ""I'll try anything people ask me to do to discover what I enjoy,"" he adds.

**E. WAYNE MARSHALL**  
In 1986, conductor Simon Rattle noticed Wayne Marshall, now 32, and recommended him to his agent. Marshall soon found himself conducting a musical in London on short notice, which was challenging. He even dealt with musicians reading newspapers during the show. ""I was firm with them,"" he says. ""I always gave a clear beat and got the best results I could."" Marshall believes many musicians don't need much guidance from a conductor, but he's not afraid to express his needs. ""I've never formally studied conducting, but people have been supportive. I'm determined and know what I like."""
FCE_23,"**Variations on a Theme**

If you want to take children to a theme park, there are many options in Britain. We asked five families to try the best ones.

**Fun Island - The Burns family**

Last year, we visited a big theme park in the US, so we thought Fun Island might not be as exciting. However, we were pleasantly surprised. The park is great for younger children, so our three-year-old had fun too. The kids loved the Crocodile Ride and the Giant Wheel. There is a special dodgems ride for very young kids, which was a big hit. For older children, there are more thrilling rides like Splash Out, where you end up in a pool! After five hours, Steve and I were ready to leave, but the children wanted to stay because they were having so much fun. Our only complaint is that the park could have a better atmosphere and scenery. But the staff are very helpful, and the park is clean, well-organized, and safe.

**Wonderland - The McMillan family**

None of us had been to a theme park before, so we didn't know what to expect. We thought Oscar might be too young, but he loved it. He enjoyed the Mountain Train and Little Land, which has small models of famous buildings at his height! The older children liked the ferris wheel and driving toy cars on a real road layout. We spent six hours there and appreciated the places to rest. The landscaping is perfect, and the staff are friendly and helpful. There is something for everyone, including adults.

**Adventure World - The Jeffree family**

After seven hours, we still had more to see. The children loved the Big Top Circus, which had an amazing trapeze act. We went on the Terror Line, and although the girls were scared and kept their eyes shut, they said they enjoyed it. Their favorite ride was Running River, where you think you'll get wet, but you don't. For younger children, Toy Land is great fun. The children looked at the new ride, Fear Factor, but we were relieved they were too small for it! The park is well designed, so even waiting in line isn't too boring. It's very clean, and the staff are great. On one ride, I couldn't sit with both girls, so a staff member offered to go with one of them.

**The Great Park - The Langridge family**

We arrived at one o'clock and were disappointed that the park was only open until 5 p.m. This is a great theme park for younger children because the rides aren't too scary. I'm usually scared, but I enjoyed myself. We all loved Exotic Travels, a boat ride that starts calmly and then becomes very fun. We waited for half an hour for Lightning River, and then it was over quickly! I didn't go on the Big Leap, but it looked exciting if you are brave. If the children were older, they might have found it a bit boring, but they were the right age and loved it.

**Fantasy World - The Break-all family**

The park's advertising says there is 'No Limit to the Fun,' and we agree. Europe's tallest roller-coaster, the Rocket, is very noticeable, and Ben thought it was the scariest ride, although Jennie said the Hanger, where you hang upside-down 30 meters above the ground, was even scarier! There are about a dozen main rides, which the older children went on several times. Sarah was too small for a few of them but enjoyed the Long Slide. We found the staff attitudes varied. Some were great with younger children, but not all were welcoming. You need a full day to enjoy Fantasy World. We wouldn't have dared tell the kids we were leaving early."
FCE_60,"**Running a Business in the Countryside: Five Women's Stories**

**A. Christine Hogan**  
Christine Hogan runs a computer-aided design business with a yearly income of over £200,000 and employs four full-time workers. She says, ""My customers are friends."" Christine and her husband moved from London to the countryside when their children were young. She wanted a job she could do from home. Having worked with computers before marriage, her husband suggested starting a computer-aided design business. It required a lot of money, and the beginning was tough. Christine was careful with finances, always informing the bank manager if she might overspend. Working from home saves money, and she can work in the evenings if needed. The business remains small, and local customers usually pick up their work.

**B. Maggy Sasanow**  
Maggy Sasanow designs greeting cards from home. She says, ""I enjoy being independent."" Maggy studied art at university and wanted to work in a museum, but after marrying and moving to the countryside, she couldn't find such work. She started her own business, creating 50 different greeting cards sold to museums. She works in a large room upstairs. A downside of working from home is the constant household tasks, like mowing the lawn. Her business grows through word of mouth, without advertising. People send work from London because she is cheaper than other artists. Although she misses exchanging ideas with others, she finds more advantages than disadvantages.

**C. Delia Turner**  
Delia Turner runs a curtain-making business that has faced ups and downs. She started eight years ago when the business was growing, and her income rose from £24,000 to £80,000 in two years. She managed six full-time workers but had to let them go due to economic decline, which was hard because jobs are scarce in the area. Now, she makes curtains at home with her husband's help and hires women who work from their homes. Delia is ready to lower prices when needed and explore new opportunities.

**D. Tessa Strickland**  
Tessa Strickland manages the editorial and production side of her children's book publishing business from her farmhouse. She moved to the countryside three years ago for financial reasons and because she loves the country. Tessa enjoys working when she wants. Most of her income comes from deals with Australia, the Far East, and North America, so she takes calls at odd hours. The challenge is having the discipline to stop working. She publishes children's books from different cultures, collaborating with authors and artists. Initially, she felt lonely because all her professional experience was in London.

**E. Meg Rivers**  
Meg Rivers runs a cakes-by-post business and a shop with a yearly income of £250,000, employing six people, some part-time. She started ten years ago at home, interested in health, making fruit cakes with quality ingredients. Friends and relatives began requesting cakes, and soon she was sending them nationwide. Seven years ago, she rented a small building where everything is made, with a baker, assistant, and professional cake-icer. Meg no longer cooks but manages the business side. Her biggest challenge has been the financial aspect, as they didn't have much money to start with."
FCE_1,"**Meet the Amazing Watkins Family**

The Watkins family is special because the sons are talented musicians and composers, and their father makes musical instruments. John and Hetty Watkins, who are schoolteachers in South Wales, needed a cello for their ten-year-old son, Paul, because he was becoming very good at playing. However, buying a cello was too expensive. John decided to try making one himself. He found the Welsh School of Instrument Making nearby and attended evening classes for about three years.

After practicing with violins and violas, John made his first cello. Paul, now 28, says it turned out really well. John made another cello for Paul later, which he used until recently. John has now retired from teaching to become a full-time craftsman, making up to twelve violins a year. He even sold one to the famous American musician Jaime Laredo.

Both Paul and his younger brother, Huw, started playing music when they were young. Paul first played the piano and then became interested in the cello. His parents wanted him to play the violin, but he preferred the cello after meeting a cool cellist in his dad's music group. Huw was also encouraged to play music but chose the piano and composing instead.

Huw, now 22, is making a name for himself as a pianist and composer. Paul, with his father's cello, won the string final of the BBC Young Musician of the Year competition. At 20, he became the principal cellist of the BBC Symphony Orchestra, using his father's cello until last year. Now, he plays a Francesco Rugeri cello, which is 304 years old, on loan from the Royal Academy of Music. Paul says his father's cello will improve with age, but the Rugeri already has a powerful sound.

Paul will soon be on television playing the Rugeri in Elgar's Cello Concerto for a new series called Masterworks. However, he won't be able to watch it because he will be performing at the Cheltenham Festival that night. Huw will also be busy, as his String Quartet will premiere in London at the Wigmore Hall on the same evening. John and Hetty will have to work hard to keep up with their sons' busy musical schedules."
FCE_53,"**Looking after the countryside: THE NATIONAL TRUST**

The National Trust is an organization that aims to protect the British countryside. Gill Page visits the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales and talks to Gareth Roberts, a warden working for the Trust. According to Gareth, a National Trust Warden needs common sense and must be good at dealing with people, such as farmers, visitors, conservationists, and building firms.

Gareth grew up on the Lleyn Peninsula and worked on his parents' farm until he got married. About 80 people applied for the job of National Trust Warden for the Lleyn Peninsula. Gareth got the job because of his local knowledge and farming experience, even though he didn't have formal training. He finds it helpful that he still farms with his parents, which allows him to understand farmers' problems and communicate with them effectively.

His farming background also helps him handle the physical tasks of the job, like building fences, planting trees, and constructing walls. Since joining the Trust, Gareth has learned more about nature conservation. He remembers collecting flowers and bird nests as a child and realizes now that farming has changed the countryside. He believes it's not the farmers' fault, as they were following government advice.

When Gareth started his job, farmers and conservationists often disagreed. Now, they are talking and understanding each other's views. Gareth believes they are close to working together. Conservation is a key part of Gareth's work, along with allowing public access to Trust land, planting trees, and meeting with tenant farmers. He ensures that tasks are completed efficiently and economically. Gareth enjoys seeing projects finished, although he spends a lot of time on paperwork.

Gareth loves his job, even though he is always on duty. He especially enjoys talking to the public, though he dislikes the attitude of some people who act as if they own the place. Despite this, Gareth believes common sense is crucial for the job. If you have plenty of it and like working outdoors, you might consider becoming a warden like Gareth. However, don't expect a job to open up on the Lleyn Peninsula anytime soon!"
FCE_55,"**The Netball Captain**

In our series on women in sport, Suzie Ellis met England's netball captain. Kendra Slowinski is the captain of England's netball team. When I met her, she was having a typical day before next month's World Championships: teaching at a local school and then training in the local supermarket car park. I asked her, ""Don't you get strange looks?"" She replied, ""I'm too focused on my movements and my feet to notice anything else. I might see cars slow down from the corner of my eye, but that's all.""

""My whole life now is about being at my best for the Championships,"" says Kendra. ""I'm on a strict schedule to get as fit as possible."" These are her fourth World Championships, and they will be the biggest ever, with 27 countries participating. ""We'll have home support, which is very special,"" she says. ""It's important to improve netball's reputation in this country. Playing here means more pressure than usual. A home crowd will have expectations and give more support. People will expect us to start the tournament well.""

Their first game is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. ""As far as I know, we have always beaten them, but they'll be exciting to play. They have lots of talent."" The England team is currently ranked fourth in the world. But, as Kendra points out, the World Championships will be tough. ""You have to push yourself to play each day, there's no rest between games like in a series. You can still win an international series if you lose the first game. But the Championships are different because there's only one chance, and you have to be ready to make the most of it.""

In the fifteen years since she started playing at the top level, the sport has become harder and faster. On the court, players are more aggressive. ""You don't do all that training not to come out a winner,"" says Kendra. ""But once the final whistle blows, you become a different person. We're all friendlier after the game.""

Netball is also using a more scientific approach to fitness testing. ""It is essential that we all think and train like world-class players,"" says Kendra. ""As captain, I think it's important to have a strong mental attitude and lead by example. I see my role as supporting and encouraging the rest of the team.""

""From the very beginning, my netball career has always been carefully planned,"" she says. ""So I decided some time ago that this competition would be the end of it as far as playing is concerned."" She will probably coach young players in the future, but right now she is focused on her last big event. As she leads her team in the opening candlelight ceremony, she is likely to have a tear in her eye."
FCE_50,"**SPECIALIST MUSIC SCHOOLS**

How can parents help a child with exceptional musical talent? It can be hard to know the best way to support and develop their gift. Some parents might not notice their child's needs until the child becomes frustrated and difficult. While most schools can help children who are very good at academic subjects, musically talented children need special support that regular schools might not offer, especially if music is not a main focus there. These children, along with those encouraged by parents or teachers, might benefit from attending a specialist music school.

There are five specialist music schools in Britain, which are quite new. They provide a supportive environment for gifted children aged seven to eighteen to develop their skills with the help of professional musicians. At these schools, children spend one third to half of their day on music activities, such as individual lessons (up to three hours a week on their main and second instruments), playing in orchestras, chamber groups, voice training, conducting, and learning music theory. They also practice for several hours a day in private rooms, sometimes with a teacher. The rest of their time is spent on a limited academic program focusing on essential subjects like English, maths, basic sciences, and languages. Students can study more subjects if they want.

All five British specialist schools are independent, with small classes and a high number of teachers compared to students. Most children at these schools are boarders, meaning they live at the school full-time. This allows them to spend their important growing years with others who have similar goals and interests.

What are the downsides? One clear issue is the cost; boarding fees are high (£12,000-£17,000 a year). However, schools try to help parents of very talented children with scholarships and financial aid. Another concern is that not all parents want to send their children to boarding school, especially at a young age. Many school directors question if it's wise to admit children as young as seven into such a focused environment. They emphasize that their main goal is to develop 'well-rounded and balanced individuals'.

There is a risk that separating musically talented children from an early age can cause stress. Musical talent might fade during teenage years, and the pressure to succeed can lead to a strong sense of failure. However, specialist schools closely monitor each student's progress and offer help if needed. While many former students feel they gained a lot from the excellent music teaching, some worry about the limited academic program, which is less important than music activities. Many musically talented young people are also very intelligent and can handle academic challenges, feeling frustrated if their intellectual needs are not met.

For these reasons, it might be better to wait until the child is old enough to decide for themselves before choosing a specialist education. Those who are also academically gifted might do well in a less specialized school, such as one with a strong music department, or by combining regular school with music training at a junior department of a music college. These colleges offer Saturday morning lessons with excellent teachers and opportunities for orchestral and chamber music experience. However, this option may not be possible for families living far from London or other major cities."
FCE_25,"Artist Susan Shepherd is famous for her flower paintings. Her large garden, full of her favorite flowers like tulips and poppies, provides many of her painting subjects. Some plants grow wildly and spread throughout the garden. The garden has a beautiful mix of colors and shapes, especially in the two long flower borders along the path. This is partly thanks to the previous owners, who loved gardening and left plants that Susan liked. She also kept their gardener, Danny. Susan says, 'It was really his garden.' They got along well, and he understood her vision when she explained she wanted to paint certain plants.

Susan likes to paint detailed pictures of individual plants rather than the whole garden. Sometimes she paints groups of plants where they grow, but usually, she picks them and takes them to her studio. She explains, 'I don't set everything up at once. I paint one flower, which might take a few days, then add another one.' Sometimes, it takes her a couple of years to finish a painting. Her busiest time is spring and early summer when tulips and poppies bloom. She finds the way flowers change as they decay fascinating. For example, tulips change shape and open up when left in water.

Susan has always loved plants. She studied botany in school and collected wildflowers. She wasn't interested in gardening back then and thought garden flowers looked fake. She admired how wildflowers could grow in difficult places like rock cracks or cliff tops. Now, her garden has many plants from faraway places, but they fit in well. She has a relaxed attitude towards her garden, like a kind aunt who lets children play freely as long as they don't cause harm.

With two upcoming exhibitions, Susan has less time to work in the garden. She hired another gardener but knows that to stay connected to her work, 'you have to get your hands dirty.'"
FCE_34,"Title: Keeping the Holiday-Makers Happy

Sarah Sutherland-Pilch, a 24-year-old from West Sussex, shares her experience as a chalet girl in Val d'Isère, France. This is her second year working there. Known as Pilch, she works for a company that provides cooking and cleaning services for visitors who come to ski and stay in chalets, which are wooden houses typical of the area.

Sarah graduated in French and History of Art from Oxford Brookes University last summer. She says being a chalet girl is not a career but a fun way to spend a year or two before settling down. ""It's a good way to make contacts. I meet successful people every week,"" she says.

Sarah does not live in the chalet. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks about a mile to the chalet, which can host up to 18 guests each week. She has her own breakfast before preparing breakfast for the guests, which includes porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants. After breakfast, around 9:30 a.m., she cleans up and either prepares afternoon tea or cleans the rooms, which she finds the hardest part of the job. By 11 a.m., she is ready to ski and enjoys skiing as much as possible. ""On a good day, we can be up there until 4:30 p.m.,"" she says.

Sarah returns to the chalet to prepare dinner and takes a shower before starting, but she does not nap. ""It's fatal if you do,"" she says. Dinner is a three-course meal served at 8 p.m., and coffee is usually on the table by 10 p.m. After dinner, she cleans up and loads the dishwasher. ""There's nothing worse than coming into a messy kitchen the next morning,"" she says. Sometimes she chats with the guests, while other times they prefer to be left alone. ""Good guests can make a week brilliant, but some weeks don't go quite so well,"" she says.

Sarah meets her friends at the chalet where she lives and they go out around 11 p.m. ""We usually start off in Bananas, might go to G Jay's, and perhaps Dick's T-Bar at the end of the evening,"" she says. However, she never stays out too late on Saturday night because Sunday is her busiest day. ""A frightful day,"" she says, ""when you certainly don't want to be cooking breakfast feeling exhausted.""

On Sunday, work starts earlier because breakfast for departing guests must be ready by 7 a.m. Once the guests leave, Sarah cleans the chalet thoroughly. ""We just blitz the place - clear the breakfast, strip the beds, get everything ready,"" she says. If she hasn't done the week's shopping on Saturday, she does it now. Around 3 p.m., after cleaning, Sarah prepares tea for the new guests, who arrive around 4:30 p.m. ""Sometimes they are disoriented and full of questions. I'm sure it's the mountain air that does something to them,"" she says.

Between tea and dinner, Sarah helps guests who need boots or skis by taking them to the ski shop and then gets a lift back to the chalet. Soon, it's time for dinner duty again and perhaps a chat with friends, but not always. ""Sometimes I'm so tired I just have an early night,"" she says."

Mandie Currie, a zoo-keeper, spent a day at the offices of the magazine Marie Claire. ""Choosing what to wear was difficult because I usually wear a uniform at work. First, I went to a photo studio, then to press previews, all before lunch. The zoo is a calm place, and here I was rushing around. Some of the fashion team seemed stressed, but my job isn't usually stressful. At a fashion shoot in the afternoon, I laughed thinking I'd usually be cleaning cages or handling rats. I'm interested in how magazines work, but I love my job at the zoo, so I'll stay there.""

Alice Cutler, a fashion assistant at Marie Claire, spent a day at London Zoo. ""I arrived in leather boots and dark blue trousers. The zoo gave me a green polo shirt to work in, which was good because I got very dirty. As I stroked an elephant, I thought Mandie was probably packing clothes. By five o'clock, I smelled bad, but I had a great day. When I retire from fashion, I might work with elephants, but maybe in Africa.""

Karen Hodson, a nurse at Hammersmith Hospital, went on location with the TV gardening programme Ground Force. ""I was very excited to meet the team, and Alan Titchmarsh, the presenter, was really nice. I liked being in the fresh air. Sometimes, because of my shifts, I never see daylight. Even though it was hard work, it was fun. I thought I was strong, but I felt weak compared to the team. My idea of landscape gardening didn't include hard work or careful planning. I was more enthusiastic than effective, so I won't leave my job.""

Charlie Dimmock, a landscape gardener with Ground Force, worked a shift at Hammersmith Hospital. ""I made beds and gave out tablets. I thought I might faint doing some jobs, but I was surprised that it didn't bother me. The friendship among the nurses is great, and it felt very 'girlie' compared to my usual male environment. I feel my job is a waste of time compared to nursing. My day at the hospital wasn't exactly pleasant, but it gave me a great sense of satisfaction.""

Lucy Harvey, a personal trainer, spent a day with the airline Ryanair as cabin crew. ""I changed into the uniform, and I felt different—people suddenly respected me. Before the flight, our supervisor talked about safety and what to do if someone had a heart attack, which I knew from my fitness training. When passengers boarded the flight to Paris, I gave out magazines. Everyone stared at me, and I felt self-conscious. On the return journey, we had 80 schoolchildren who wouldn't sit still. I wished I was back in the gym with one sensible adult.""

Sonia McDermott, an air hostess with Ryanair, spent a day as a personal trainer in a gym. ""I was worried about this swap because I don't exercise. I was amazed at how much attention you give to one person. In my job, you meet 130 passengers four times a day. I was surprised at lunch to see some trainers didn't eat very healthily, but they all drink lots of water. I wouldn't swap my job for this. However, it has inspired me to join a gym and try to be healthier."""

**Andrea Thompson - Newsreader**  
I fell in love with the south of France a long time ago and try to visit as often as I can. There's a local train from Cannes along the coast that crosses into Italy. It takes you past amazing sea views. No matter the weather or time of year, it's always beautiful. Out of the other window, you can see some of the best gardens and homes in France. It feels like you're peeking into the lives of the rich and famous. The travelers are always lively, with a mix of tourists and locals, all enjoying the breathtaking journey.

**Raj Patel - Explorer**  
I've enjoyed many train journeys, but my favorite is the Nile Valley Express in northern Sudan. Growing up in South Africa, I missed a family train trip from Cape Town to Kruger National Park because I was considered too young. When I moved to England as a teenager, I still hadn't traveled by train. London Waterloo was the first real station I saw, and its great glass dome amazed me.

**Betty Cooper - Novelist**  
I owe a lot to one train: the Blue Train, which took my husband and me on our honeymoon across France to catch a boat to Egypt. On the train, my husband gave me a pink dress, which I loved. Someone said pink is good for the brain, and I've worn it ever since. What I remember most is how lovely it was to travel through France and then by boat up the Nile to Luxor. It was the perfect way to relax after the wedding.

**Martin Brown - Journalist**  
We were working on a series of articles about a round-the-world trip and had to cross a desert in Africa. There was no road, so we took the Desert Express. The timetable was unreliable—we were just given a day. We heard the driver would wait for days if people were still coming. When it arrived, hundreds of people climbed into and onto the carriages—some even traveled on the roof for free. At night, the train crossed beautiful landscapes. It felt like a dream, like traveling across the moon.

**Arisu Mezuki - Actress**  
Most people form their favorite train memories as children, but not me. I grew up in Singapore and Cyprus, where I saw few trains. As a teenager, I made a film featuring a railway in Yorkshire. Most filming was on an old, unused line maintained by volunteers. That's where my love for steam trains began. When we weren't filming, we rode the train whenever we could. When I returned last year, it was like time had stood still. Everything was still there, even the gas lights on the station platform!"
FCE_8,"Text: 'Trying to get published? If you are wondering where to send your story, our expert Margaret Stubbs is here with the advice you need. Readers of this magazine often ask, 'I have written this story or book. Can you please tell me who to send it to?' One of the first things they need to know is that they should research their markets and learn about publishers while also improving their writing skills. Turning words into something that can be sold requires a lot of knowledge about the 'writing game'. Whatever kind of writing you do, you need to understand the markets you are aiming for. There are several ways to do this, but the best one is by reading everything relevant you can find. Use your local library and visit local bookshops and newsagents. Reading widely will always give you the best idea of what kinds of writing publishers are accepting at any given time. As time goes on, this knowledge must be updated because new publications are constantly appearing, editors change jobs, and magazines change direction. New titles are coming and going all the time. Publishers are always looking for new writers; as writers, we have to make sure we give them what they want. To begin with, you may be looking around, not quite sure what you want to write. Let's say you feel that you might like to write short love stories. The first thing you must do is find out which magazines use love stories, a rather limited market these days, and get as many recent copies as you can. Then, familiarize yourself with the kind of stories they are buying, paying special attention to who the readers are. These readers will expect different things from their magazine, and the editor is only interested in meeting their needs. Writers often send me their stories saying, 'This has been rejected three times - please tell me if I am wasting my time ... do I stand a chance at all?' As a former teacher, I would never discourage anyone. But it is unlikely that the work is of publishable standard, so I have to try to give an honest opinion, but always with a positive viewpoint. The problem is that most new writers are too eager to send their work out, usually long before they are ready to enter the market. If you have only written one story or one article, it is not likely to be published. That almost never happens. When you read about 'success', you usually find that the person has been in the publishing trade or journalism for some years before their current success. When you finally send off some of your work for the first time, immediately get on with more work while you wait for a reply; write ten more stories, twenty even. Each one will be better than the last, and you will begin to think of yourself as a writer, and both your fluency and your confidence will grow. Don't throw any of them away—improve them instead. Also, I would advise not showing your work to anyone else, especially in the early stages. Don't forget that every successful writer will have had many rejections before succeeding. Do everything you can to advance your career as a writer. See if there's a creative writing course near you. If not, try joining a local writers' group, which will help you gain ideas and confidence from mixing with other aspiring writers. Think of yourself as a writer and practice writing every day if possible.'"
FCE_4,"Text: 'No Title On the last day of a bad year, I was leaning against a pillar in the Baltimore railway station, waiting for the 10.10 train to Philadelphia. There were more people than I expected. The station didn't feel as airy and clean as usual. Elderly couples with matching luggage filled the benches, and groups of college students sat on the floor with their bags. A grey-haired man was walking around, talking to different strangers. He looked well-off: tanned skin, nice sweater, soft beige coat. He asked a woman sitting alone a question, then approached a girl near me. She had long blond hair, and I thought I wouldn't mind talking to her. The man asked, 'Are you travelling to Philadelphia?' 'Well, northbound, yes,' she said. 'But to Philadelphia?' 'No, New York, but I'll be ...' 'Thanks, anyway,' he said, moving to the next bench. Now he had my full attention. 'Ma'am,' I heard him ask an old lady, 'are you travelling to Philadelphia?' When she said, 'Wilmington,' he just moved on to a couple with matching luggage. I straightened up and moved closer, pretending to look at the platform. I was going to Philadelphia. He could have asked me. I understood why he didn't. I probably seemed unreliable. He glanced at me quickly and then went to the bench at the other end. He looked stressed. 'Please!' he said to a woman reading a book. 'Tell me you're going to Philadelphia!' She lowered her book. She was around thirty-five, older than me. A school-teacher type. 'Philadelphia?' she said. 'Yes, I am.' 'Could I ask you a favour?' I stopped a few feet away and looked at my left wrist. (I don't own a watch.) Even without looking, I could tell she was cautious. The man must have noticed too, because he said, 'Nothing too difficult, I promise!' They announced my train. People started moving to Gate E, the older couples pulling their wheeled bags like pets on leashes. I heard the man talking. 'My daughter's flying out this afternoon for a study year abroad, leaving from Philadelphia. I put her on a train this morning, stopped for groceries, and came home to find my wife upset. My daughter forgot her passport. She called from the station in Philadelphia; didn't know what to do.' The woman clucked sympathetically. I would have stayed quiet, waiting to see where this was going. 'I told her to stay put. Stay in the station, I said, and I would get someone here to bring her passport.' A likely story! Why didn't he go himself if it was so urgent? 'Why don't you go yourself?' the woman asked. 'I can't leave my wife alone for that long. She's in a wheelchair.' This seemed like a poor excuse, in my opinion. Also, it was too much bad luck for one family. I looked at them. The man was holding a packet, not a plain envelope, which would have made more sense, but a padded envelope the size of a paperback book. Aha! Padded! So you couldn't feel the contents! And from where I stood, it looked stapled shut. Watch yourself, lady, I thought.'"
FCE_30,"**Gary and Me**

The restaurant owner, John Moore, writes about his relationship with his son Gary, who is a famous TV chef. John believes everyone gets a chance in life. Gary's chance was with cooking, and John's chance was to run a restaurant. When John found out about the opportunity to own a restaurant, he quickly went to see the place. It was in very bad condition, but it was perfect for his plans. Starting this business reminded John of his childhood. He remembers his mother working in a factory and feeling upset because he was left alone. Because of this, he wanted to make time for family life. His wife took care of the children and managed the accounts, while John ran the restaurant. They lived above the restaurant and always made sure to have meals together. This was very beneficial for their children, Gary and Joe, who became very confident. From a young age, they would talk to the regular customers, which gave them a great start in life.

Gary was a lively child. When he was about seven, he tried to jump into a corner bath like it was a swimming pool and knocked himself out. As he grew older, he had to work for pocket money. He started with small jobs and by the age of ten, he was in the kitchen every weekend, so he always had money at school. He was disciplined and would wake up even before his father. In a family business, everyone helps out, and it was nice to see Gary doing his part. Gary wasn't very good at school, but he was excellent in the kitchen. By 15, he was as skilled as the adults working there and sometimes was even in charge. He could make over a hundred meals, and John knew Gary would go into catering because he had a natural talent. When Gary needed to do work experience for school, John sent him to a friend's restaurant.

Gary recently started playing the drums and now has his own band. John wonders what will happen to Gary's cooking if the music becomes successful. John's advice to Gary is: if you try to do two things at once, you might not succeed in either, so focus on what you know you can achieve. John told Gary, ""If you want to succeed in life, you need to do it by the age of 30. If not, it might be too late."" Gary went to catering college at 17. On his first day, he and the other new students, who were usually beginners, were given a morning's work. But Gary finished everything in an hour and helped others. John is very proud of Gary's successful TV cookery series. He always told Gary that if you want something, you have to work very hard for it because no one will give it to you. Gary saw his opportunity and took it. John says that if children remember even a little of what their parents tell them, it's good. The things Gary says and does show that he listened sometimes."
FCE_7,"Finding a good flat in Dublin at an affordable price was very difficult, like finding gold during a gold rush. The best way was through personal contacts: if you knew someone who knew someone leaving a place, that often worked. But if, like Jo, you had just arrived in Dublin, you had no personal contacts, no one to tell you about a vacant bedsit. So, it was a matter of staying in a hostel and searching. For Jo, Dublin was a big unknown. She felt she was stepping into the unknown when she got on the train to work there. She didn't question why she was going. Everyone at her school assumed she would go. Who would stay in a small, remote town? That's all she heard for years. They all wanted to leave, see some life, and have a real existence. Some of her classmates went to towns like Ennis or Limerick, where family would help them settle. But none from Jo's year were going to Dublin. She was going alone. Jo's mother thought it would be great if she stayed permanently in the hostel, run by nuns, where she would be safe. Her father hoped they kept the place warm, as hostels were known for being cold. Jo's sisters, who worked as waitresses, thought she was crazy to stay a whole week in a hostel. But Jo didn't know they were all still thinking about her as she answered an ad for a flat in Ringsend. It said, 'Own room, own television, share kitchen, bathroom.' It was near the post office where she worked and seemed too good to be true. Please, let it be nice, let them like me, let it not be too expensive! There wasn't a queue for this one because it was more 'Third Girl Wanted' than 'Flat to Let'. The 'own television' part made Jo wonder if it was too fancy for her, but the house looked ordinary. It was a red-brick terraced house with a basement, but the flat was upstairs. A cheerful girl with a college scarf, obviously a failed applicant, was coming down the stairs. 'Desperate place,' she said to Jo. 'They're both awful. Common as dirt.' 'Oh,' said Jo and continued climbing. 'Hello,' said the girl with 'Nessa' on her T-shirt. 'Did you see that snobby girl leaving? I can't stand that type.' 'What did she do?' asked Jo. 'Do? She didn't have to do anything. She just looked around, made a face, and giggled, saying, ""Is this all there is? Oh dear, oh dear,"" in a posh accent. We wouldn't have her here, would we, Pauline?' Pauline wore a very colorful shirt, almost as bright as her hair. Pauline was a punk, Jo noted with surprise. She had seen punks on O'Connell Street but hadn't talked to one. 'I'm Jo, I work in the post office and I called.' Nessa said they were about to have tea. She brought out three mugs; one said 'Nessa', one said 'Pauline', and the other said 'Other'. 'We'll put your name on it if you stay,' she said kindly."
FCE_43,"**Behind the Dolphin's Smile**

People love dolphins. We enjoy watching them in marinas, movies, and TV shows. However, the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society says dolphins are in trouble. Mark Simmonds talks about how dolphins are decreasing in number.

Dolphins are special to us. They are very smart, understand human feelings, and make us dream of freedom in the ocean. TV shows like ""Flipper"" and ""Seaquest"" have made us love them more. But these shows do not show the real problems dolphins face in polluted and overfished seas today. For example, the number of North Sea harbour porpoises (a type of dolphin) has dropped by up to 89,000.

You might think dolphins are protected by law and live in safe areas. But this is not true, and not having plans to protect them could become a big wildlife problem. There are 40 different kinds of dolphins worldwide. In northern Europe, the most common are striped, common, bottlenose dolphins, and the smaller harbour porpoise. The first two live far out at sea and are seen only in small groups. We know little about them. The large grey bottlenoses and harbour porpoises used to be common near European coasts. Bottlenoses are very social and were found on the Channel coast and in British rivers like the Thames. Now, they are only found in Scotland's Moray Firth and Wales' Cardigan Bay. The few that remain show signs of stress.

Dolphins' complex habits make it hard to know why their numbers are falling. Overfishing, which reduces fish stocks and threatens local fishing, also threatens dolphins. Porpoises need to find food quickly. If fish are overfished in one area, they may not survive long enough to find food elsewhere. They can also get caught in fishing nets, which they cannot see. Modern fishing uses large nets that float or are pulled quickly through the sea. Recently, many dead dolphins have been found on French and Cornish beaches. Marks on their bodies show they died from getting caught in nets.

Waste and chemicals in the sea can build up in dolphins' bodies. For example, pesticides dissolve in fat, so dolphins can absorb them, and they accumulate in their bodies. Female dolphins then produce milk with high pesticide levels, passing the poison to their young. There is a case of a young dolphin dying from its mother's milk.

Perhaps the most debated threat to dolphins is human disturbance. Dolphins live in groups and use sound to understand their world. In the sea, noise pollution from ships and oil wells travels four times better than in the air. This may disturb dolphins in ways we do not yet understand."
FCE_51,"**GETTING FIT**

Exercise is very important for your mind, body, and spirit. It helps you stay balanced when life feels chaotic. You might think, ""Not another article about fitness!"" But there are many articles because exercise is really good for you. There are many reasons to exercise and very few reasons not to.

Exercise makes your muscles stronger and changes your body shape quickly. It helps your muscles work better and improves your posture, which is how you hold your body when sitting or standing. Good posture prevents muscle problems that can cause injuries. Exercise also helps specific areas like thighs, stomach, and upper arms. It makes your heart and lungs healthier and improves blood circulation.

You might have heard these reasons many times and feel bored. But did you know exercise can help with depression, tiredness, and sleep problems? It also helps control stress and can improve some medical conditions. These reasons should convince you that exercise is good for you. If not, just think about it: common sense says exercise is beneficial.

There are many types of exercise you can try, like aerobics, jogging, or weight training. Remember, training too hard or with too much weight can cause injuries, so start slowly. If you're unsure, ask your doctor what is best for you.

Good posture is important for improving your body shape. A stiff or sagging body looks unattractive and lacks energy. If you slouch, imagine a helium balloon pulling your head up. This helps lift your chest for better breathing and makes your body look slimmer. When standing, if your chest is balanced, you should see your ankles.

Stretching your muscles improves flexibility and helps prevent injuries. Stretching should be part of your exercise routine and should be done slowly and carefully. The best exercise routine includes a good warm-up, stretching, an energetic workout, and a cool-down period. Doing this four or five times a week will make your body more flexible and fit."
FCE_11,"**IN THEIR NATURAL HABITAT**

What makes film-makers Amanda Barrett and Owen Newman leave their home comforts for months? It's their search for the perfect shot. In the jungles and plains of East Africa, two of the hardest people to find are producer Amanda Barrett and cameraman Owen Newman. They are currently in the Ngorongoro Crater, which has had six months of almost nonstop rain, causing many unexpected problems. Newman explained that they had to buy an expensive tool so that whenever one of their vehicles gets stuck in the mud, Amanda can pull him back to safety. His partnership with the talented producer has created some of TV's best wildlife films, like their amazing film on leopards. Even while this film about Africa's shyest cats was being shown, they were already back in the wild, this time following the equally shy jackal. But this is common in television partnerships. Travelling film-makers have been going around the world to film exotic wildlife since television began.

I spoke to Newman about their partnership while he was briefly meeting other people at a safari lodge. 'We do have occasional arguments but we get over them quickly,' he says about his colleague. Neither of them sees themselves as the leader, and he says they get along well because they both see the animals in a similar way. 'When we are moving, we have to set up our tents each night. But this time we have a more fixed camp, and since we start at 5 a.m. each morning, we make the tea the night before and keep it warm in a vacuum flask.' The rest of their daily diet is pre-packed meals heated and served by whoever is available. 'It's not unusual for us to be out for up to eight weeks at a time, so food can be a bit of a worry,' says Newman. It can be a tough life, but being alone in such remote areas allows them to get close to the animals and become part of their lives. Newman remembers filming a family of lions where one lioness would regularly go off on her own. When she returned, she would greet all the other lions, and after a while, she even greeted their car as part of her routine.

Newman first worked with Barrett in 1988 on a film called 'The Great Rift', and two years later, they went as a team to film Arctic foxes. Since then, they have learned to spend four months on location to gather enough material for each half-hour film. Before they start, they have to submit a script for approval. 'Amanda and I developed a good working relationship from the start,' says Newman, 'because we shared the same ideas and vision. We always aim to create a film that is rich in atmosphere, brings to life the true spirit of the place and animals, and touches people's hearts. I believe if you can make people feel something, that is better than just appealing to their minds.'"
FCE_14,"**The Netball Captain**

In our series on women in sport, Suzie Ellis met England's netball captain, Kendra Slawinski. Kendra is preparing for next month's World Championships. Her typical day includes teaching at a local school and then training in a supermarket car park. I was surprised about her training place. 'Don't people look at you strangely?' I asked. 'I'm too focused on my movements and my feet to notice,' she said. 'I might see cars slow down, but that's all.'

'My whole life is about being my best for the Championships,' says Kendra. She follows a strict schedule to be very fit. This will be her fourth World Championships, and they will be the biggest ever, with 27 countries participating. 'We'll have home support, which is special,' she says. 'It's important to improve netball's reputation in our country. Playing here means more pressure. A home crowd will expect us to start well.'

Their first game is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. 'As far as I know, we have always beaten them, but they are exciting to play. They have lots of talent.' The England team is currently ranked fourth in the world. But the World Championships will be tough. 'You have to play every day, with no rest between games. In a series, you can lose the first game and still win. But in the Championships, there's only one chance.'

In her 15 years of playing at the top level, the sport has become harder and faster. Players are more aggressive. 'You don't train so hard not to win,' says Kendra. 'But after the game, we're all friendlier.' Netball now uses a more scientific approach to fitness. 'We must think and train like world-class players,' says Kendra. As captain, she believes in having a strong mental attitude and leading by example. She supports and encourages her team.

'From the start, my netball career was carefully planned,' she says. She decided that this competition would be her last as a player. She might coach young players in the future, but now she is focused on her last big event. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she might have a tear in her eye. Her loyal supporters will be with her every step of the way."
FCE_63,"Rachel Mills is a scientist who spends a lot of time at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She teaches and researches marine geochemistry, which means she studies the chemical processes in the sea. She works at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she isn't teaching, she goes into a small steel vehicle, about the size of a small car, and dives three kilometers down into the Atlantic Ocean to study underwater volcanoes. Inside the vehicle, space is very limited. Rachel can touch the two pilots, and they can't stand up or move much. They have to stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can last for 16 hours: three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours collecting rock and water samples, and three hours to return to the surface.

If there is a problem and they need to get to the top quickly, they can press a panic button. This releases a small escape vessel that goes quickly to the surface, like a ping-pong ball in water. No one has tested it yet, but Rachel thinks it wouldn't be a pleasant journey.

Rachel didn't know how she would feel the first time she got into the vehicle. It was on a ship's deck, and she got in with an instructor who explained the emergency procedures, including what to do if the pilot had a heart attack. They wanted to see how she would react in such a small space. Now, Rachel has made six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian crew. They went to a site five days' sail west of the Canary Islands in the Atlantic. On the ocean floor, there is a large area of underwater volcanoes with chimneys blowing out black smoke. The Russian team was placing scientific equipment there to study the effect of a program that would make a hole 150 meters through a volcano.

When Rachel isn't at sea, she is in her office at the Oceanography Centre, Southampton. She spends two-thirds of her time teaching, which she loves, but she does it so she can continue her research into the ""black smokers."" This is another name for underwater volcanoes, where water comes out of the rock and looks like black smoke. It comes out at a speed of one meter per second and at a temperature of 350 degrees.

The only time Rachel was scared was when she first went down with the Americans. They were towing equipment on a 50-meter rope when there was an explosion. The shock waves hit their vehicle, and Rachel thought she was going to die. They waited in silence, and when nothing happened, they were incredibly relieved to be alive.

Diving to the deepest part of the ocean is an adventure for Rachel. Every time she looks out of the porthole and sees the chimneys, she feels a sense of wonder. She is at the bottom of the sea, seeing something no one else has seen before. She studied the black smokers for three years for her Ph.D., and seeing them in real life was an amazing experience."
FCE_56,"**Interview Tips**

First impressions are very important. Studies show that people form opinions about us in the first few minutes of meeting. They notice how we dress, our eye contact, our body movements, how fast or slow we talk, and our tone of voice, as well as the words we use.

Mary Pearce studied to be a teacher. She says, ""I worked hard to earn my degree. When I finally graduated, I was very confident."" She applied for a job at a nearby primary school and got an interview with the Head Teacher. ""I noticed a small hole in my jacket that morning,"" she recalls. ""I would have changed, but I knew it would make me late, and I always think it's important to be on time."" Mary didn't get the job. One of her friends, who also teaches at the school, told her the Head Teacher's only comment was, ""If someone doesn't take the time to present her best image at an interview, what kind of teacher is she going to be?""

Simon Grant, a hotel manager, says: ""Interviewees who look as if they care about themselves are more likely to care about their jobs. People think it's what's inside that counts, but in an interview, you should aim to come across in the best possible way."" Yet many people ignore the importance of having a professional image. For example, Janet Goodwood worked for ten years as an administrative assistant in a large accounting firm. When the office manager retired, she applied for the position but wasn't even given an interview. ""I thought it was a mistake, so I asked the Director of Personnel what had happened,"" she says. ""He told me I didn't fit the image of an office manager. He suggested I improve my wardrobe before I applied again for promotion. I was shocked. I do a very good job, and the way I dress shouldn't make any difference.""

Movement and gestures also influence an interviewer's first impression of a candidate. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian discovered that 7% of any message about our feelings and attitudes comes from the words we use, 38% from voice, and a surprising 55% from our facial expressions. When our facial expressions and our words send different messages, the listener will believe the non-verbal message more. So make sure your words agree with your body language. Mixed messages will only confuse the interviewer.

It is also important not to appear too desperate for the job or too eager to please. When Sheila Rice, a marketing specialist, applied for a promotion, her interview went so well she was offered the job on the spot. ""I was delighted,"" she recalls. ""But I reacted to the offer with too much enthusiasm. Once the boss sensed how excited I was, he knew I wasn't going to turn him down. Consequently, he offered me a lower salary than I'd hoped for. I'm sure I could have got more had I managed to control my excitement.""

Finally, what we say and how we say it will contribute to the success of an interview. David Artesio, the manager of an employment agency, suggests that it's a good idea to learn about the company before you go for an interview. ""The annual report, for example, will tell you about areas of company involvement. Mention an area that interests you during the interview. This will give a positive note and convince others of your interest in the company."" Business consultant Marian Woodall suggests you have a few questions ready and avoid speaking in long, confused sentences. As she puts it, ""Poor communicators talk in paragraphs. Successful communicators talk in short sentences and even in highlighted points."""

**The Farmer**

Matt Froggatt used to work as an insurance agent in London, but now he runs a sheep farm. ""After 14 years in business, the City became less exciting and more of a grind. I hadn't planned to leave for another five or ten years, but I was suddenly made redundant. The pay-off wasn't great, but it was enough to start the farm. My big break came when I met the head chef of a local hotel with a top restaurant. By supplying them, my reputation grew, and now I also sell meat by mail order. I'm glad I'm not in an office anymore, but I still work 80- to 90-hour weeks and sell a product.""

**The Painter**

Ron Ablewhite was a manager in advertising but now works as an artist. ""Painting started as a hobby, but I found it more exciting than my job. Taking redundancy to become an artist seemed logical. A career counsellor helped me, and I was the first to tell him, 'I don't want to go back to my old job.' Most people in their mid-forties need to work for money, but our children didn't need our support. We moved to the north of England, leaving friends behind, but our friendships have survived, and many visit us.""

**The Hatmaker**

Katherine Goodison worked as a company lawyer for five years before starting her own hat-making business in her London flat. ""Being a lawyer was fun and well-paid, but the hours were terrible. I didn't want to become a senior partner, so I left. People said I'd get bored, but that never happened. The secret is having deadlines. In fashion, there's always something to do, so I keep a strict schedule. I'm happier and less stressed now. I miss socializing with colleagues, but I love being responsible for my product. If I do a bad job, it's on me. You care more when your name is on the product.""

**The Masseur**

Paul Drinkwater worked in finance for 16 years before becoming a masseur at the Life Centre in London. ""I started in financial markets at 22, setting up deals. I liked the adrenaline but didn't find the work rewarding. I almost got made redundant in 1989, but I resigned and traveled for a year to figure out what I wanted. I was interested in health, so I visited top gymnasiums and talked to owners. To change careers, I needed qualifications, so I took massage courses. Then I got part-time work at the Life Centre. I have no regrets. I feel in control and have peace of mind now."""
FCE_6,"**Dedicated to Their Sports: Four Young Sports Stars Talk About Their Lives**

**A. Darius (Runner)**  
I've always loved sports. I tried many, but I was best at football and athletics. At 14, I had a chance to join a professional football club, but I chose athletics. My proudest moment was competing for my country and winning a medal. Unfortunately, it didn't get much media attention, which was disappointing because I hoped for sponsorship to help with training costs. I train at home in winter and then go to Florida for three weeks before the season starts. It's fun because of the great facilities and nightlife, but I have to be disciplined. If friends invite me out before training, I have to say no. My main goal is to compete in the next Olympics.

**B. Gabriel (Surfer)**  
The surfing community is small, so you often meet the same people at competitions. Serious surfers know the best waves are at dawn, so you can't party late at night. I miss sleeping in, but it's worth it because I won the National Championships last year. After a win, I celebrate with a big night out, especially if there's prize money. Winning the championship also got me a TV show about surfing, so I guess I'm a bit of a celebrity now.

**C. Dieter (Yacht Racer)**  
With five guys on a boat, we have a lot of fun. We celebrate wins in style, but we don't seek media attention. Reporters sometimes care more about our celebrations than our race results. I'm away for eight months a year, so it's nice to come home and hang out with friends who aren't in sailing. You can't focus on the sport all the time. I'm known in sailing, but I'm rarely recognized on the street, which I prefer. I get letters asking for signed pictures, and I reply to all of them, even if it takes time.

**D. Tomas (Tennis Player)**  
It's amazing to feel the crowd's support when I walk on court. At the last tournament, it got a bit crazy with fans. I enjoy being recognized when I'm out, but it can be difficult. My last girlfriend didn't like the attention I got from female fans, and we broke up because of my travel schedule. It was tough, but you have to make sacrifices in sports. I'm focused on my game now and will enjoy other things after I retire, which happens early in tennis."
FCE_33,"**Young Shoppers**

Shopping in a supermarket with children can be very difficult for parents. One mother says, ""They want everything they see. If it's not the latest sugary breakfast cereal, it's a Disney video or a comic. Usually all three. I can't afford all this, and if I give in, I feel guilty for buying unhealthy things. But I also feel bad for saying no all the time, and I get stressed before we even leave home. I try not to take them shopping, but then I worry they won't learn how to make their own choices. I can't win.""

Research shows that children ask for something every two minutes during a supermarket trip. More than £150 million a year is spent on advertising to children, mostly on TV. This amount is likely to grow, and supermarkets are where this advertising works best. Children often don't understand why their parents say no to buying things, and arguments about health don't seem convincing compared to the attractive ads.

Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says, ""Most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, though these ideas aren't always right. It's good for parents and children to talk about food because if children only learn from TV ads, they get a one-sided view. Parents don't like competing with advertisers and having to disappoint their children.""

The Independent Television Commission, which controls TV ads, doesn't allow advertisers to tell children to ask their parents to buy things. But as Dibb points out, ""The goal of advertising is to make people want to buy something. So even if they can't say, 'Tell your mum to buy this,' that's still the effect they want.""

A big stress for parents shopping with children is deciding which requests to agree to and which to refuse. One mother says she talks a lot with her children about food and ads, so they don't ask for things she won't buy. Parents also admit they are not always consistent. Mike, a father of two, says, ""We say no to sweets because they're bad for him, but we buy chocolate for ourselves. It's nice to buy treats, and it's normal for children to want them too. But I still get annoyed by their demands. It depends on my mood. If I'm feeling good, I'm more likely to say yes. It's hard to be consistent.""

Supermarkets could help reduce conflicts by removing sweets from checkout areas or offering play areas for children. Even if parents spend less because their children aren't with them, the idea of shopping without a child's demands might attract more customers."
FCE_20,"**Five-star luxury with modern technology**

The five-star Merrion Hotel has just opened in Dublin. It took nearly two years to convert four large eighteenth-century houses into this hotel. This allowed the hotel to install the latest technology for both staff and guests. General Manager Peter MacCann wants his staff to know guests by name, but he uses the hotel's computer system to remember guests' preferences. This system, which cost £250,000, helps treat returning guests in a special way. For example, if a guest requests certain music CDs during their first stay, those CDs will be ready for them on their next visit. The system records guest preferences, making their stay more comfortable.

Room temperature is a common complaint among hotel guests. At the Merrion, a high-tech system lets guests adjust the temperature within three degrees of the normal 18°C. Additionally, the front desk can adjust each room's temperature between 14°C and 25°C.

Business travelers will appreciate the technology in their rooms. MacCann expects 65% of the hotel's business to come from this market. Each room has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that also works as a photocopier and printer, and a video-conferencing facility. The hotel has prepared for future technology changes by installing extra cables and renting TVs, so they can be easily updated. DVD recorders can also be upgraded when needed.

Despite all this technology, the hotel aims to make guests feel comfortable and not overwhelmed. The 145 large and well-furnished bedrooms are welcoming. The hotel also offers a swimming pool, gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a beautiful garden.

The food at the Merrion must be excellent, as expected in luxury hotels. Chef Patrick Guilbaud, whose Dublin restaurant already had two Michelin stars, moved his restaurant to the Merrion. This move benefits both him and the hotel. He designed a modern kitchen and enjoys better parking facilities. The hotel gains a popular restaurant without financial risks.

With advanced technology and a skilled staff, the Merrion Hotel is set to succeed."

FCE_45,"**ICE SKATING**

Ice skating has been around for thousands of years. Archaeologists have found skates made from animal bones. These bone skates were used until iron was introduced in Scandinavia around 200 AD. In Scandinavia, the upper classes thought skating was an important skill. In the early 1900s, skating was stylish and reserved. However, at the 1924 Winter Olympics, 11-year-old Sonja Henie brought a more athletic style, making skating more popular. Today, skating combines art and athletics, making it both graceful and physically demanding.

For beginners, balance and control are very important, and you can only go faster as you get better. Your body position is crucial for balance. Keep your legs slightly bent and knees bent to center your body weight; this means leaning slightly forward. Relaxation is very important in skating. To start, your heels should almost touch, and your feet should point outwards. Push forward with your back foot and make a small movement with the other foot. It's fairly easy, isn't it? As you practice, you can slowly make your movements longer.

Learning how to fall is one of the first skills for a skater. Even the best professionals fall. To avoid injury, try to be as relaxed as possible when you fall. This reduces the shock of hitting the ice. To get up, use your hands to kneel, then stand. Once you can move on the ice confidently, you can try different styles like figure skating, freestyle, distance, speed, and pair skating. The best way to start is by learning figure skating and then basic freestyle. Most ice rinks offer guidance, so you can quickly learn the basic moves and then the turns, jumps, and spins of elementary freestyle.

If you watch any good or professional skater, you will see how relaxed they are and how easily they move. To achieve this, you should regularly practice an exercise program. Skating with a stiff body can be dangerous, so warm-up exercises should include those for the legs, back, and shoulders, with special focus on the ankles and knees. After a long or intense session, do the same exercises to avoid stiffness.

Skating improves balance, coordination, relaxation, and movement. It also benefits heart and lung activity and strengthens the body. Combined with swimming or jogging, it offers a great program for overall health and fitness."

Seeing a talented child win a medal can bring tears to your eyes. Julia Gregson talked to three young stars and their mothers about the joys and challenges in their lives.

A. **Annika Reeder, 15**, won a gold medal in gymnastics at the Commonwealth Games. She wants to be a physiotherapist and compete in the next Olympics. ""The work is very hard now. There's no time for TV, going out with friends, or doing much besides gym and school. I try to take training one day at a time. When I'm very tired, my coach sometimes gives me a day off, but usually, I keep going. You can't take too many days off, or you get stiff.""

B. **Annika's mother** says, ""Annika showed great potential from a young age. Some parents push their kids, but it doesn't work. To perform like Annika, you have to want it yourself. People say we've given up a lot, but they don't see what the sport has given us. We love it and what it's done for Annika. Before gymnastics, she was shy and hid behind me, but now she's met people worldwide and gained confidence.""

C. **Sarah Stokes** started show-jumping at ten and has won the British National Championship. ""It's good my parents like show-jumping because they train me and take me everywhere. Shows last from one to five days. I never get tired of it—I love the excitement and fun. Even without my parents, I'd do it because I'm determined. I'm glad they are happy when I win, but I do it for myself. My goal this year is to join the British young riders (under-18) team. My big dream is to win an Olympic gold medal.""

D. **Sarah's mother** says, ""Sarah's passion for horses started at age 1. At 5, she got up early to exercise her pony. To qualify for big shows, you have to jump all over England. We save money by sleeping in our horse box. Sarah is well-organized and happy on a horse. Watching your child succeed at something they love is unbeatable.""

E. **Jane McShane, 10**, is Britain's Under-14 Chess Champion. ""Tournaments are friendly. I know everyone, and it's fun. When playing, I don't concentrate much. I should, but I just look around and don't think too hard. I'm not worried about getting a big head. I don't talk about my success at school because I don't like embarrassment.""

F. **Jane's mother** says, ""Jane played her first game at 5. My father suggested it. He tried to teach me when I was young, but I was bored. Jane loved it from the start. By the end of that day, she knew all the moves, and by 6, she was beating adults. I'm happy when she wins, but if she wanted to quit, I wouldn't stop her. I don't want to put her down for being exceptional. If she has this gift, let her reach her potential."""
FCE_29,"Text: 'It's true - we're all getting taller Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy after school. 'What do you want to be?' asked the teacher. 'The flagpole on a ship?' The teacher had a point because Chris, even at fourteen, was almost two metres tall. Today, at 228 cm, he is Britain's tallest man. Every decade, the average height of people in Europe grows by another centimetre. Every year, more very tall people are born. Interestingly, this does not mean we are creating a new super race. In fact, we are returning to what we were like as cavemen. We are losing the effects of generations of poor diet, with dramatic results. 'We are only now beginning to reach our true potential,' says palaeontologist Professor Chris Stringer. 'We are becoming like Cro-Magnons again - the people who lived on this planet 40,000 years ago.' For most of human history, our ancestors got their food from many sources: women gathered herbs, fruits, and berries, while men hunted animals (a lifestyle still followed by some hunter-gatherer tribes today). One study found that they based their diet on 85 different wild plants. Then about 9,000 years ago, farming was invented, with serious consequences. Most of the planet's green areas have been taken over by farmers, so just three carbohydrate-rich plants - wheat, rice, and maize - provide more than half of the calories consumed by humans today. This poor diet has badly affected human health and body size. Over the centuries, we have lived on soups, porridges, and breads that have left us underfed and underdeveloped. In one study in Ohio, scientists found that when people started growing corn, healthy hunter-gatherers became sickly, underweight farmers. Tooth decay increased, as did diseases. Far from being a blessing, corn was a public health disaster, according to some anthropologists. However, farming spread because a piece of farmed land could support ten times the number of people who had lived off it as hunter-gatherers. The fact that most people relying on this system are poorly nourished and stunted has only recently been addressed, even by the world's wealthier nations. Only in Europe, the US, and Japan are diets again reflecting the richness of our ancestors' diets. As a result, the average man in the US is now 179 cm, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm. It is a welcome trend, though not without its own problems. Heights may have risen, but the world has not changed much. A standard bed-length has remained at 190 cm since 1860. Even worse, leg-room in planes and trains seems to have shrunk rather than grown, while clothes manufacturers are constantly having to update their range of products. The question is: where will it all end? We cannot grow forever. We must have some programmed upper limit. But what is it? According to Robert Fogel, of University, it could be as much as 193 cm - and we are likely to reach it sometime this century. However, scientists add one note of caution. Individuals may be growing taller because of better nutrition, but as a species, we are actually shrinking. During the last ice age, 10,000 years ago, humans were slightly rounder and taller - an evolutionary response to the cold. (Large, round bodies are best at keeping in heat.) Since the climate warmed, we appear to have become slightly thinner and smaller, even when properly fed. And as the planet continues to heat up, we may shrink even further. In other words, the growth of human beings could be offset by global warming.'"
FCE_57,"**Studio Audiences: What is it like to be in the audience when a TV show is made?**

Cosmo Landesman found out. Studio audiences are a common part of TV life, but they are still a mystery to many of us. When we see them excited on game shows, we wonder - who are these people? Among all live entertainment audiences, studio audiences are often seen as the least important. Some people in TV even treat them poorly, like one cameraman who said they are treated 'like cattle'. I thought studio audiences were just people wanting a bit of fame. But there is no typical studio audience. They come from all backgrounds, jobs, and income levels. TV tries to get different people for different shows.

Those of us who like watching TV at home don't understand why anyone would go to a studio. Why get tickets, travel far, and sit for hours in an uncomfortable studio to watch something you can see at home? One idea is that people hope to be seen on TV for a moment. I didn't believe this until I talked to Angela. Why did she come? It was a chance to be on TV. Another idea is that people are curious to see behind the scenes. But the most common reason I heard was 'a friend gave me a ticket'.

Few of us have been in a studio audience, but we think we know what it's like. You sit with strangers, and someone shows cards that say APPLAUD or LAUGH, and you clap or laugh. This might be true for some shows, but not all. A studio manager said, 'We always hope a show is good enough not to need these signs.'

Is there a real difference between being in a studio and watching at home? For Claire, sitting in a studio is 'more exciting', and Charlotte liked being part of live TV. 'Last year I saw my favorite comedian. At home, you miss a lot.' What I missed was seeing live actors - from my seat, I only saw the back of someone's head. The opening scenes were so far away that I watched on a studio monitor. Going to a studio might be a bad way to watch TV, but that's not the point. For most of the audience, it was just fun and a free night of entertainment."
FCE_9,"**Favourite Places**

**Bruce**  
I prefer places where people have left their mark. When I travel, I like visiting charming villages with old temples, not empty deserts. When I was eight, I went to school in England. On Saturdays, I would cycle to the village of Lastingham in its beautiful valley. Cycling was my escape from school. I enjoyed exploring the hilltops, valleys, and old villages. Being from Scotland, the landscape felt both familiar and different to me, and I still visit today. I used to write about my adventures in a private diary, which was my first try at travel writing, a field in which I later became known.

**Sophia**  
There is a small railway from Hythe to Dungeness, run by volunteers. I always travel first class because it doesn't cost much more. The scenery isn't spectacular. The train goes across Romney Marsh with its sheep and along a canal. But I always look forward to when the train passes through back gardens. For a few moments, we can see people doing everyday things like making tea or doing the dishes. I see myself as a woman in a tiny train, looking into other people's homes. It's the ordinary landscape that attracts me. Just fields, sheep, and a distant grey sea. It makes me look closer to find something that opens my eyes.

**Matthew**  
The Hartland Peninsula is a remote and beautiful coast. The beaches are hard to reach and full of rocks, so there are not many people. Some brave surfers come, but most visitors enjoy the sea's majesty. The coast faces the Atlantic and is known for shipwrecks. There are coastal walks you can combine with trips inland through beautiful valleys with oak trees, ferns, and wildflowers. We stay in simple self-catering accommodation with a family in the village of Southole.

**Annette**  
My favourite place in England is the Trough of Bowland, a wide-open moorland perfect for hiking. There are few residents and visitors. It's an unknown, empty, and remote area, and I like the feeling of space. I found the area by chance as a student, and since then, I visit every year, either alone, with my boyfriend, or now with my son. It hasn't changed much since my first visit. Having a child makes these visits more special. It makes me sad that he's growing up in a city.

**James**  
I bought Glenthorne, my favourite house in Britain. It was about finding peace and reconnecting with my English roots. I grew up in what is now Sri Lanka, but at twelve, I went to school in Devon, in the west of England. I used to cycle around the moors and village backstreets. We had a story about a place we would never cycle past: if you went down the driveway, you'd never return. That place was Glenthorne. It's the place of my dreams. It's a magical, secluded, romantic house. You can't hear anything except the sea, wind, and birds."
FCE_42,"**HAPPY HUNTING GROUND**

We are a family that loves animals and enjoys being around them. One afternoon, my daughter called me at work to tell me she had found a wonderful pine snake. ""Can we keep him?"" she asked. I said, ""Yes, but only for one night."" We had a special tank for animals we found, and one night was enough to admire them and check our natural history book.

I got home late and started cooking when I heard screams from my sons' bedroom: ""Oh, Mother! Help! Do something!"" I rushed in to find Domino the cat with Bianca, a white mouse I got as a Mother's Day gift, in his mouth. Domino ran around the room, avoiding the kids who were trying to stop him. I tripped and fell, and as I thought about how to stop Domino, I saw the snake escaping from its tank.

The room was chaotic with the cat, mouse, kids, and the snake all moving around. The dog was barking, and the pot boiled over in the kitchen. I turned off the gas and returned to the room. I managed to grab Domino by the tail and saved the mouse, which was unharmed. Interestingly, this mouse was caught by Domino three more times but lived to old age.

Feeling confident, I tried to catch the snake. It was difficult, but I sat on the floor and waited for it to calm down. Slowly, I lifted the snake and took it to the garden. I hoped it would go to the shed, but when I let go, it wrapped around my shoulders like a shawl. We stood there, my four children, me, and the snake. My eldest, DJ, said, ""You know what it is, Mum? You're nice and warm, and the shed isn't.""

We gently encouraged the snake to move on. It slowly climbed up the wall and disappeared over the roof. As the last bit of its tail vanished, my three-year-old, Clay, said, ""Boy, that was one big snake!"""
FCE_59,"Text: 'Write me a letter! In our fast world of phones, fax machines, and computers, the old art of letter writing might disappear. Yet, for me, getting a letter is special and different from any other way of communicating. There is the excitement when it arrives, the pleasure of seeing who it is from, and the enjoyment of reading it. Letter writing has been part of my life for as long as I can remember. It probably started with the little notes I wrote to my mother. My mother also made sure I wrote my own thank-you letters for Christmas and birthday presents. It didn't matter how short or messy they were, as long as they were letters. When I left home at 18 to study medicine in London, I would write once a week, and so would my mother. Sometimes my father would write, and it was always a joy to get his long, funny letters. Most letters from home were about everyday events with my parents and their friends. Of course, we also made phone calls, but I remember the letters most. There were also letters from my boyfriends. When I was young, I often had boyfriends who had to work or study far away, and we could only stay in touch by writing letters. But instead of hurting the relationships, letter writing seemed to make them better. I found that I could often express myself more easily in writing than by talking. I love the letters that come with birthday or Christmas cards. Notes are nice, but it's much better to have a year's worth of news! And it's even better when it's an airmail envelope with beautiful stamps. My overseas letters come from Mangala in Sri Lanka, from someone I trained with over 20 years ago, and I have a penfriend in Australia and another in Vancouver. Then there's the lady who writes to me from France. If we hadn't started talking in a restaurant on the way home from holiday, if my husband hadn't taken her photo, and if I hadn't asked her for her address, I would never have been able to write to her. More importantly, if she hadn't replied, we would have missed out. As it is, we now write to each other regularly. I can improve my French (she speaks no English); we have stayed at her home twice, and she has stayed with us. My biggest letter-writing success, however, came this summer when my family and I stayed with my American penfriend in Texas. We had been writing to each other for 29 years but had never met. Everyone was amazed that a correspondence could last so long. The local newspaper even thought it was worth reporting on the front page. I am happy that my children are continuing the tradition. Like my mother before me, I make sure they write their own thank-you letters. My daughter writes me little letters, just as I did to my mother. She and my son have penfriends of their own in Texas, organized by my penfriend. I strongly encourage readers not to let letter writing become another 'lost art'. '"
FCE_54,"**Careless Tourists Damage Ancient Alpine Rock Art**

Tens of thousands of ancient pictures carved into rocks at one of France's most important tourist sites are being slowly destroyed. Scientists and researchers are worried that the 36,000 drawings on rocks in Mont Bego in the French Alps are being damaged so quickly that they might not last for future generations. The mountain, once a place for prayer and worship, has 4,000-year-old drawings on bare rock. These include pictures of cows with horns, fields, and various gods and goddesses. But as more people visit the site, the pictures are being ruined by careless graffiti.

Jean Clottes, the chairman of the International Committee on Rock Art, says, ""People think that because the pictures have been there so long, they will always be there. But if the damage continues like this, there will be nothing left in 50 years."" He has seen tourists stepping on the drawings, wearing away the rock and the artwork. Some visitors even break off parts to take home as souvenirs. ""When people can't take a good photo, they rub the drawings to see them better,"" he said. ""The drawings are polished by the weather, and if the sun is shining and visitors can't see them well, they rub and scrape them to make them look clearer.""

Other researchers say people come with long sticks with sharp ends to scratch their own drawings or names into the rocks. But experts disagree on the best way to protect the drawings. Henry de Lumley, director of the Museum of Natural History in Paris, thinks the only way to save the site is to make the whole mountain a 'no-go' area, allowing the public only on guided tours. Otherwise, he says, the site will be completely destroyed, and important research will be lost.

Clottes disagrees. ""Henry de Lumley's idea is the most severe, and while it is the most effective, it will also cause protests from local people,"" he said. ""The site was classified as a historic monument years ago by the Ministry of Culture, and we must do as much as possible to save what is there.""

David Lavergne, the regional architect, also wants to avoid closing the site. ""Henry de Lumley's idea isn't ideal,"" he said. ""Our department thinks the best solution is to let people see the site, but because the area is very big, it is hard to stop visitors from damaging it. I would prefer that everyone could see it, but the main problem is money. We do not have enough funds to hire the necessary number of guards. We may have to consider charging a fee. There seems to be no chance of government funding.""

In Nice, Annie Echassoux, who also worked on researching the site, is worried that as the mountain becomes easier to reach—tourists can now avoid the three-and-a-half-hour walk by hiring vehicles—the damage will increase quickly. She thinks the only solution is to rope off the area and provide guides. ""You can't say the plan can't go ahead because there is no money,"" she said. ""That is not good enough. Money must be provided because the Ministry of Culture has classified this area as a historic site. If we don't take steps, we will be responsible for losing the drawings for the next generation."""
FCE_32,"**Young Shoppers**

Shopping in a supermarket with children can be very difficult for parents. One mother says, ""They want everything they see. If it's not the latest sugary breakfast cereal, it's a Disney video or a comic. Usually all three. I can't afford all this stuff, and if I agree to their demands, I feel guilty about buying and feeding them unhealthy things. But I also feel bad for saying no all the time, and I get upset even before we leave home. I try not to take them shopping, but then I worry they won't learn how to make their own choices. I can't win.""

Research shows that children ask to buy something every two minutes during a supermarket trip. More than £150 million a year is spent on advertising directly to children, mostly on TV. This amount is likely to grow, and supermarkets are where this advertising works best. Children often don't understand why their parents say no to buying things, and arguments about how bad sugar is for teeth are not convincing compared to the attractive ads.

Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says, ""Most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, though these ideas aren't always right. It's good for parents and children to talk about food because if children only learn from TV ads, they get a one-sided view.

But as Dibb points out, ""The purpose of advertising is to persuade people to buy something. So even if they can't say, 'Tell your mum to buy this,' the goal is still the same.""

A big stress for parents shopping with children is deciding which requests to agree to and which to refuse. One mother says she talks a lot with her children about food and advertisements, so they don't ask for things she doesn't want to buy. Parents also admit they are not always consistent in their responses.

FCE_65,"**Going up the wall**

In the past, climbers went to mountains. Now, you can have a challenging climb anywhere, indoors or outdoors. The crowd is silent. High above them on the climbing wall, hanging upside down by two fingers, is the French climber Francois Lombard. He is competing in the World Cup Climbing Championships at Birmingham's National Indoor Arena. This arena is more famous for the TV show Gladiators, but both the show and the climbing championships have one thing in common - The Wall. This is possible because of new and fast-developing technology.

Before the mid-1960s, climbers practiced on cliffs where there were many good climbing spots. In winter, they either braved the cold, went walking, or climbed on snow and ice in Scotland. As the sport grew, it became important for top climbers to stay fit. Since cliffs were unusable for much of the year, they used brick edges or stone buildings to train. This helped them keep their fingers strong and avoid boredom.

Soon, many sports centers started building walls for climbing, using bricks with special edges to hold onto. Many of these early walls were inspired by Don Robinson, a physical education teacher. In the mid-1960s, he built a climbing wall in a corridor at Leeds University. Robinson had the idea of setting natural rock in concrete blocks, which could be part of a wall. Many climbing walls like this were built in sports halls across the country in the 1970s, but they had design problems. Walls could only be vertical, while real cliffs have features like overhangs and angled slabs. Another problem was that once the walls were built, they couldn't be changed, and climbers would get bored with the same holds.

In 1985, a Frenchman named Francois Savigny developed a material that he shaped into forms like those on cliffs. These could be attached to any wall and removed when climbers wanted a new challenge. French manufacturers also started using panels on a steel framework. Concrete was too heavy for overhanging walls without major construction, but steel frames could be set up anywhere as free-standing structures. A system of interchangeable fixtures gave climbers endless new holds."
FCE_61,"Text: 'So you want to be an actor? If you tell someone that you want to be an actor, they will probably say it is 'risky' very quickly. Acting is indeed a risky career. There are more actors than there are jobs for them. When you decide to become an actor, some friends might say you're crazy, but others might react differently. Everyone will give you different advice. But it is your personal choice, and only you can be responsible for achieving your dream. There are no easy ways to become an actor - no exams to pass, and no guarantee that after training you will succeed. It's about luck and talent. However, there is a need for new faces and talent, and there is always the chance of excitement, glamour, and sometimes big rewards. People often ask what talent is. I think it is natural skill plus imagination, which is hard to measure. It also involves courage and belief in what you are doing. Why do people want to act? It is hard to explain why you want to act. In the theatre, the important thing is the moment of connection between the actor and the audience. This connection is central to all acting and motivates actors. If you ask actors how they succeed, they might just shrug. They know some things about themselves and their techniques, but they take nothing for granted. They know they are only as good as their current job, and their fame might not last. Disappointment is the biggest enemy of an actor. Last month you might have been out of work, selling clothes or waitressing. Suddenly you get an audition, but even if you want the job, you might not get it. So actors often don't talk about their chances. They find ways to handle the stress of competing for a role and the possibility of rejection. Nobody likes being rejected. Remember, the chance of rejection is there from the first moment you start auditioning. You are saying you are available, willing, and hopefully talented enough for the job. In many ways, it's up to you, because if you don't care enough, no one else will care for you.'"

FCE_28,"Text: 'It's true - we're all getting taller Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy after school. 'What do you want to be?' asked the teacher. 'The flagpole on a ship?' The teacher had a point because Chris, even at fourteen, was almost two metres tall. Today, at 228 cm, he is Britain's tallest man. Every decade, the average height of people in Europe grows by another centimetre. Every year, more very tall people are born. Interestingly, this does not mean we are creating a new super race. Instead, we are returning to what we were like as cavemen. We are losing the effects of generations of poor diet, with big changes. 'We are only now beginning to reach our true potential,' says palaeontologist Professor Chris Stringer. 'We are becoming like Cro-Magnons again - the people who lived on this planet 40,000 years ago.' For most of human history, our ancestors got their food from many sources: women gathered herbs, fruits, and berries, while men added meat from hunting animals (a lifestyle still used by some hunter-gatherer tribes today). One study found that they based their diet on 85 different wild plants. Then about 9,000 years ago, farming was invented, with serious consequences. Most of the planet's green areas have been taken over by farmers, so just three carbohydrate-rich plants - wheat, rice, and maize - provide more than half of the calories consumed by humans today. This poor diet has badly affected human health and body size. Over the centuries, we have lived on soups, porridges, and breads that have left us underfed and underdeveloped. In one study in Ohio, scientists found that when people started growing corn, healthy hunter-gatherers became sickly, underweight farmers. Tooth decay increased, as did diseases. Far from being a blessing of the New World, corn was a public health disaster, according to some anthropologists. However, farming spread because a piece of farmed land could support ten times the number of people who had previously lived off it as hunter-gatherers. The fact that most people relying on this system are poorly nourished and stunted has only recently been addressed, even by the world's wealthier nations. Only in Europe, the US, and Japan are diets again reflecting the richness of our ancestors' diets. As a result, the average man in the US is now 179 cm, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm. It is a welcome trend, though not without its own problems. Heights may have risen, but the world has not changed much. A standard bed-length has remained at 190 cm since 1860. Even worse, leg-room in planes and trains seems to have shrunk rather than grown, while clothes manufacturers are constantly having to update their range of products. The question is: where will it all end? We cannot grow forever. We must have some programmed upper limit. But what is it? According to Robert Fogel, of University, it could be as much as 193 cm - and we are likely to reach it sometime this century. However, scientists add one note of caution. Individuals may be growing taller because of better nutrition, but as a species, we are actually shrinking. During the last ice age, 10,000 years ago, humans were slightly rounder and taller - an evolutionary response to the cold. (Large, round bodies are best at keeping in heat.) Since the climate warmed, we seem to have become slightly thinner and smaller, even when properly fed. And as the planet continues to heat up, we may shrink even further. In other words, the growth of human beings could be offset by global warming.'"

**The Farmer**

Matt Froggatt used to work as an insurance agent in London, but now he runs a sheep farm. ""After 14 years in business, the City became less exciting and more of a grind. I hadn't planned to leave for another five or ten years, but I was suddenly made redundant. The pay-off wasn't great, but it was enough to start the farm. My big break came when I met the head chef of a local hotel with one of the top 20 hotel restaurants in the country. By supplying them, my reputation grew, and now I also sell meat by mail order. I'm glad I'm not in an office anymore, but it's surprising how little has changed: I still work 80- to 90-hour weeks and sell a product.""

**The Painter**

Ron Ablewhite was a manager in advertising but now works as an artist. ""Painting started as a hobby, but I found it more exciting than my job. Taking redundancy to become an artist seemed logical. The career counsellor I spoke to was surprised because most people in their mid-forties need to work immediately for money. But we married young, and our children didn't need our support. Moving to the north of England was a leap into the unknown. We left our friends, but our friendships have survived, and many visit us now.""

**The Hatmaker**

Katherine Goodison worked as a company lawyer for five years before starting her own business making hats in her London flat. ""Being a lawyer was fun and well-paid, but the hours were terrible. I didn't want to become a senior partner and work even more hours, so I left. Some people thought I'd get bored, but that hasn't happened. The secret is having deadlines. In fashion, there are always collections and seasons, so you need a strict schedule. I'm happier and less stressed now. I miss social interactions with colleagues, but I love being responsible for my product. If I do a bad job, it's my fault. You care more when your name is on the promotional material.""

**The Masseur**

Paul Drinkwater worked in finance for 16 years before becoming a masseur at the Life Centre in London. ""I started in financial markets at 22, setting up deals. I liked the adrenaline but didn't find the work rewarding. I almost got made redundant in 1989, but I resigned and traveled for a year to figure out what I wanted to do. I was interested in health, so I visited top gymnasiums and talked to the owners. I knew I needed qualifications to change careers, so I took massage courses. Then I got part-time work at the Life Centre. I have no regrets. I used to feel out of control, but now I have peace of mind and control over my future. That's the best part."""
FCE_5,"**Onto a Winner**

Two brothers are finding that their childhood game is very good for business. Dave and Norm Lagasse, two brothers in their forties with bushy beards, are sitting in their simple home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA, and remembering their childhood. In front of them is a wooden board with round plastic pieces. They are playing the old game of pichenotte, which they say is unique. Their grandfather, Lucien Rajotte, a grocer from Quebec, Canada, brought the game to the USA and taught it to his family. Soon, the family played the game almost every weekend and holiday, and as Dave says, they were 'having the best time ever'. Eventually, the family moved to New Mexico. But they did not forget Grandpa's pichenotte board, which he made from old wooden food crates, and they continued to play often. Visitors were often interested because the game was unknown in southern USA. 

Three years ago, Dave set up the old pichenotte board and saw it was cracked and worn out, so he decided to make a new one. It turned out beautifully. A relative saw it and wanted one. Then a friend wanted another. Curious about the interest, one night the brothers took one of Dave's new boards to a sports bar in Santa Fe. 'People there started to watch,' says Dave, 'and say, ""No way I'm playing that silly game."" Then they'd sit down, and soon you couldn't get them up from the table!' When people asked about the game's origins, Dave did some research. He found out that the game probably started in India, where a similar game called 'carroms' exists. It was adapted into a game called 'squails' played in British pubs, and a century ago, British people moving to Canada brought the game with them. Pichenotte is the name of the French-Canadian version that developed in Quebec.

Pichenotte, which can be played by two to four people, is a game of skill. Each player gets 12 pieces or 'pucks'. These are 'flicked' across a wheel-like board using the middle or index finger of one hand. Flicking a puck into a small hole is worth 20 points. Three rings around the hole are worth 15, 10, and 5 points. Eight tiny posts are obstacles. The game usually lasts just two minutes. When they saw how popular the game was at the Santa Fe bar, the Lagasses made more boards and took them to markets and craft fairs. Crowds gathered, money was exchanged, and the game's popularity grew. Championships began, and a trophy called the 'Lord Pichenotte Cup' was created. As word spread, the boards sold quickly. The brothers decided to go into the pichenotte business full-time. They set up a workshop in their garage and started making boards. They have made more than 450 so far. Made of birchwood and mahogany, each board weighs 12kg and is 1cm thick. As Norm explains, 'They're very durable, as they have to stand up to lots of use.' They sell for $595 each on the brothers' website. There are no professional pichenotte players or TV coverage yet, but the brothers hope their garage will one day hold a luxury car instead of tools and wood. Until then, they enjoy playing the game they hope will make them rich."
FCE_41,"**WELCOME TO THE MODEL VILLAGE**

When you first enter the Model Village, it's hard to believe that a few years ago, this was just a piece of waste ground, flat and covered with brambles. For years, people thought it was useless land. But with careful planning and hard work, one man, helped by his wife, turned this land into the beautiful place you see today. Many tons of soil and clay were moved to change the flat land into the landscape you see now. Bulldozers and digging machines helped, but it also needed a lot of hard work. After shaping the land, about 1,000 tonnes of topsoil were added to create the lawns, flower-beds, and rockeries.

Hundreds of trees and shrubs were planted in the Model Village. These plants had to be chosen carefully because they needed to survive the salty air near the sea and the strong winter winds. Most plants came from local garden centers, but some were brought from as far as Canada and New Zealand.

The whole village was designed by Colin Sims, and he made over 100 models over nine years since the village first opened in 1972. The models are made from different materials like stone, concrete, treated wood, and plastics to handle all kinds of weather. At first, Colin needed help from experts to understand how materials would last in changing weather, but he soon became an expert himself.

You will notice that a constant scale is used, and even the smallest details are carefully made. This was done with patience and special construction techniques. The Model Village is a popular attraction known for its high-quality work and maintenance. The techniques used here have been used in other model villages in England and are even taught in some college courses.

All the model buildings show traditional British architecture and are not based on one specific place. One of the most impressive buildings is the Manor House, a typical 13th-century stone structure with a brick tower and stone walls, like those found in the West Country. As you walk around, you will also see the Castle, St Mary's Church, a zoo, and a mini golf course, which is the newest addition.

Please stay on the paths during your visit and do not touch the models; a small mistake can mean hours of repair work for us. You can take photos from the paths. Dogs are welcome if they are on a short lead. To make your visit more enjoyable, you will find buttons in front of some working models. Press these to make the models move.

At the end of your visit, we would love to hear your comments. New models are always being planned, and your ideas can help us create a more interesting display. We also want to know if any models are not as good as the others. We are always updating the models and need to know which ones need attention. We hope you enjoy your visit and look forward to seeing you again. Don't forget to tell your friends about it."
FCE_69,"Text: 'Every week, British tabloid newspapers publish pictures that invade people's privacy and break the newspaper editors' rules. Although pop stars sometimes pose for paparazzi, this is not common. Usually, people in the public eye are harmed when their private moments appear on the front page. However, very few people use the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), an organization set up to handle such issues. These pictures are rarely in the public interest. Do private photos of pop stars help solve a crime? How did a picture of a famous actress on a hotel balcony protect public health and safety? The actress has complained about long-lens photos before, and since she was in a hotel, where there is 'a reasonable expectation of privacy', she had a good reason to complain, but she didn't. It is shocking that the PCC did not investigate on its own. It should also look into the recent story about a pop star's love life. The pop star, like the actress, has not made a formal complaint. Shouldn't the PCC take action on these and other unfair attacks? At first, this seems like a good idea. It would lead to many decisions against newspapers. These would be reported by other newspapers and shown on TV and radio. The public would not support the newspapers, and editors would have to stop publishing such material. Even photographers would be affected, as it would no longer be profitable to hide and take pictures of celebrities. If the PCC decided to act like a 'police officer', which it could, there would be problems. How would it decide to start an investigation? Should it ask the victim to complain? And if the person still refused, should it continue anyway? Also, celebrities and royalty might expect every story about them to be investigated and be upset if it wasn't. Above all, the task is too big. How could the PCC realistically watch over all British press: national, regional, and magazines? Then there is the embarrassment to consider. No matter how seriously someone's privacy is invaded, would they want the extra embarrassment of an investigation? Most people probably just want to move on with their lives. Of course, some may have other reasons for staying quiet. A worse story might exist that they have kept from the press, and they know it might come out if they complain. In other words, even the PCC might become the enemy. One British comedian also suffered from the press when he and his wife were secretly photographed on their honeymoon in the Caribbean. He didn't complain then, nor more recently, when he and his family were photographed during a holiday. He feared that the newspaper, News of the World, would publish the pictures again with a new story about his 'anger', saying it was just a joke, and that, as a comedian, he should have a sense of humor. This fear is understandable. People believe they will become targets again if they challenge the tabloids. It is hard to find an easy solution to this serious problem.'"
FCE_38,"Many people give advice to college graduates looking for their first job. In this article, we will talk about moving to a second job. We are not talking about those who are looking for a second temporary job while searching for a permanent one. We are also not talking about those who leave an unsatisfactory job within the first few weeks. Instead, we will focus on those who are taking a real step in their career, choosing a job that matches their goals now that they have some experience, skills, and an idea of where they want to go. What kind of job should you look for? It depends on your long-term goals. You need to ask yourself if you want to specialize in a certain area, move up to higher levels of responsibility, or change to a different field. Whatever you decide, you should choose your second job carefully. You should plan to stay in it for two to three years. This job will be important when you apply for your next job. It should show that you are serious about your career. Most importantly, it should help you grow and give you more responsibility. By the way, if you want to travel, now is a good time to do it. You can do temporary work when you return and then find your second job. Future employers will be glad to see that you have traveled and are not likely to leave again. Juliette Davidson spent her first year after leaving St. Aldate's College working for three lawyers. It was a great first job because 'they were very supportive. I learned about office work and improved my computer skills. However, there was no chance to advance. One day I quit, bought a plane ticket, and traveled for a year.' Juliette now works as a Personal Assistant to Brenda Cleverdon, the Chief Executive of Business in the Community. 'In two and a half years I have become more skilled and my job has grown,' she says. 'From the start, my boss wanted to help me develop. My job title is the same, but my duties have changed. I have moved from mainly typing and phone work to handling most of the correspondence and budgets. I also deal with various questions, from company chairmen to people wanting to start their own business. Brenda involves me in all her work and gives me specific projects and events to organize.'"
FCE_17,"**Confident People: What's Their Secret?**

Confident people might seem like they were always confident, but most say it's a skill they learned. Nina Hathway talks to five people about how they became confident.

**A. Jenny**

When I left school, I was very shy and thought I would always be that way. At 25, I was asked to help at my daughter's school. I didn't think I could do it, but I did well. Someone suggested I take a university course. I was very nervous on my first day, but my confidence grew, and I became more outgoing. Working at the school changed my life and helped everything else fall into place.

**B. Michaela**

Four years ago, my father got sick, and I had to run the family business. I was scared and became too aggressive. I thought confident people acted like that, but I learned that confidence means believing in yourself. If work gets too hard, I don't feel bad about leaving some tasks for the next day. When faced with something difficult, I remind myself I have nothing to lose. Fear makes you less confident, so I talk to myself to overcome those fears.

**C. Lisa**

People think I'm confident, but the calmer I look, the more scared I am. In TV, looking confident is very important. Interviewing people taught me that everyone gets nervous in important situations, and we feel better when we talk to someone friendly. My mother once told me, 'Who's looking at you? Everyone's worried about themselves.' That's good advice. You gain confidence by facing your fears. I was very nervous during my driving test, but I passed. After that, I felt I wouldn't be that scared again.

**D. Barbara**

My confidence comes from enjoying my work, but I've built it over the years. If you keep going and learn from mistakes, you're more confident next time. I work hard and am liked at the restaurant, but not everyone likes me. I don't let that bother me. You have to like yourself for who you are. My company offers training courses, which have boosted my self-esteem. They also encourage setting small goals. It's better to achieve something small than aim too high and get nothing.

**E. Kim**

After college, I worked as a secretary and was too scared to speak up in meetings. Eventually, I found the confidence to share my thoughts. When I started in politics, I had never spoken in public and was very nervous. I told myself, 'People do this every day, so you can too.' Writing down a few notes helped me feel more secure. Everyone gets a bit nervous speaking in public. The secret to confidence is telling yourself, 'Nothing is impossible.'"
FCE_47,"Text: 'Visit to Malaysia Paul Forster goes to a kite-flying festival and spends a nervous night in the forest. Adnan Ali smiled widely as I gave him his torn kite. 'You have to keep it,' he said, 'it's traditional - if the line breaks, finders are keepers ... and anyway, I have plenty more.' He pointed to a pile of beautifully decorated kites at his feet. All were exactly 120cm wide and long, made of tissue paper and split bamboo. We sat next to them in the shade of the whispering trees behind the Beach of the Seven Lagoons in the state of Kelantan, and looked at Malaysia's biggest and most serious kite festival. In the center of the beach were 10 platforms, where helpers held up the kites, and a row of tense competitors holding the lines of their kites waited for the countdown. When the whistle blew, the crowd cheered and the kites flew into the air like rockets. More than 500 men and boys had registered for the competition, which happens for five days every year. Each had entered four different designs which were judged on decoration, stability in the air, and flying efficiency. 'Flying kites isn't so difficult,' said Adnan, 'but making them takes real skill. Visit me at home and I'll show you how it's done.' I received five invitations that day, and I decided to accept his. Back at his house, I drank cold milky tea and ate fish crackers in a large polished room. As it got dark, he told me to come again the next day to start rebuilding his kite, but my plans didn't allow it. Instead, I explored the southern half of the state, driving my car inland on the road to Kuala Lumpur, into granite mountains covered with lush rainforest. I took a wrong turn and the smooth road ended suddenly at a river. A long, narrow boat was waiting to take people across. Near it, a small sign caught my eye. It pointed up a footpath into the forest and read: 'Jelawang Jungle 3 km.' Before starting, it would have been useful to know that almost all of this distance was uphill, steep, and slippery. When I got to the track, I found a man waiting with a flask of tea. This was Baba, who looked after a tented kitchen and a dozen or so bamboo huts. I decided to stay there, trying not to think about insects crawling under my thin foam mattress. Night was completely dark, full of different sounds. A waterfall roared nearby and thousands of living things moved and squeaked. In the morning, there was a great view over five ranges of green mountains. In the afternoon, it rained. First wind, then lightning hit the treetops. Seconds later, I was soaked. Sliding downhill, I wondered how the many giant butterflies avoided the huge raindrops. I also thought about the possibility of my car being swept away (it sometimes happens) and the chance of drowning if I opened my mouth. Fortunately, the car was still there, covered in mud, at the bottom of the track. No one is a stranger for long here. Back in Kota Bahru, Kelantan's capital, everyone asked me questions: 'Where are you from?' 'How old are you?' But they were very friendly. Kelantan might be best known for its kites, but I remember it more for its human kindness.'"

Children will be guided to 14 surprising paintings and asked questions about them. The quiz is available during normal gallery hours from 25 March to 9 April.

**New Picture**

The Gallery now has a beautiful still life by the Dutch 18th-century painter Jan van Os. This large painting (89.1 cm x 71 cm) of flowers and fruit is painted in bright colors on wood. It is one of the first of its kind in the Gallery. The painting is signed and dated 1777 and 1778. It is common for such paintings to have two dates because the artist waited for different flowers to bloom in their seasons. This picture was kindly donated to the Gallery by Miss Violet Churchman in memory of her sister Ida Nancy. It is now on display in Room 25.

**Special Exhibition**

The exhibition ""Painting in Spain during the late 18th century"" opened in the Sunley Room on 15 March. The Gallery recently bought works by three Spanish painters from this time: Paret, Melendez, and Francisco Bayeu, who are the main focus of the exhibition. These artists are joined by Francisco's brother Ramon, Antonio Gonzalez, and two Italians who worked in Spain during these years - Corrado Giaquinto and Giovanni Battista Tiepolo. The exhibition runs until 31 May.

PET_21,"Text: 'MONEY What is money? The pound, the dollar, or the franc are like a gram or a kilometre. The difference is that you can use money to buy things. A five-pound note can buy a book, a big bag of sweets, or a couple of cinema tickets. But the note itself is just a piece of paper that costs very little to make. Thousands of years ago, people didn't have money like we do now. There were no banks or shops. Back then, Mr. Green the farmer traded the corn he grew for Mr. Hive's honey. This was a trade between two people, each having something the other wanted. Over time, most societies created their own 'currencies' so people could trade more easily. Different currencies started to connect, which is why today everyone uses a national currency.'"

Last year, detective fiction was very popular, but the winner wrote a love story. You can write about anything you like, but here is some advice to help you: Write about what you know This is important advice for every writer. Last year, most people who wrote for us did this. Love, family, and problems with friends were the main topics. However, you need to make ordinary situations interesting so people want to read them. Make the reader want to keep reading by writing about ordinary things in a new and surprising way. Get your facts right Don't describe a town or explain how something works if you are not sure about it. Avoid writing about things unless you are certain. Hold the reader's attention Make the beginning interesting and the ending a surprise. A poor ending is disappointing. Develop the story carefully and try to think of something unusual for the end. Think about the characters Make the people in your story come alive for the reader by using well-chosen words to make them seem real.

Hypatia's father was the director of Alexandria University, and he ensured his daughter received the best education possible. This was unusual because most women at that time had few chances to study. After studying in Athens and Rome, Hypatia returned to Alexandria and started teaching mathematics. She quickly became famous for her knowledge of new ideas. We do not have copies of her books, but we know she wrote several important mathematical works. Hypatia was also interested in technology and invented several scientific tools to help with her work. At that time, many rulers were afraid of science, and anyone connected with it was in danger. One day in March 415, Hypatia was attacked in the street and killed.'"

PET_27,"Grass

Grass is one of the most successful plants in the world. There are over 9,000 different types of grasses, and they are found everywhere on Earth. They are the only flowering plants that can live in the cold environments of the Arctic and Antarctic. Grasslands support many kinds of animals, from small insects and birds to large animals like cows and lions. All of these animals depend on grass in some way. Grass grows back quickly after it is cut or damaged. Unlike other plants, new leaves grow from below the soil, not from the top. This is why large groups of animals can live in one area. When they eat all the grass, new grass starts to grow again, providing a fresh meal."
PET_44,"Kal Kaur Rai, the Young Achiever of the Year, has always loved fashion. She recently won the Young Achiever of the Year award at the Asian Business Awards. Since she was a child, she has been drawing clothes and designing patterns. She never told her parents, who own a supermarket, that she wanted to make fashion her career. She thought they wanted her to choose a more traditional job, so she studied management at university. After university, she moved to London and worked at an advertising agency. She had to go to industry events but couldn't afford the designer clothes she liked, so she started making her own skirts and tops. Her friends loved her clothes and asked her to make some for them too. A small shop in London agreed to sell her designs on a sale-or-return basis. Her clothes were very popular, and nothing was returned. This success encouraged her to leave her advertising job, take a £20,000 loan, and start her own womenswear label. Kal's parents were not upset about her career change and promised to support her, which made her very happy. Now, her clothes are sold in over 70 stores, and her business earns over £500,000. Her designs are featured in fashion magazines, she creates clothes for pop stars, and she has gained public recognition by winning this award. Her business has grown a lot, and she feels very lucky.

The Sunningdale Hotel was built in 1913 and opened by Princess Louise. It has offered excellent service to people from all over the world. Over the past 80 years, more than 50,000 guests from 174 different countries have stayed here. The hotel is located on a main road leading to the town center. It is about 20 minutes by bus from the town center, and buses to many other parts of the town stop outside the hotel. Guests should avoid buses with the blue sign ""Express"" on the front because they do not stop near the hotel. An underground station is less than 100 meters away.

The main building has 200 well-furnished, centrally-heated single rooms, each with hot and cold water basins. Showers, baths, and toilets are at the end of all corridors. The hotel has a shop, sitting rooms, four television rooms, a table tennis room, a library, and a laundry. There are also eight pianos available for guests to use. There is parking available in the hotel drive. Daily newspapers are free, and stamps can be bought at the office.

Guests staying for long periods must pay for their accommodation weekly in advance, and one week's notice is required for departures. Both short-term and long-term guests are welcome, but long-term guests are given priority for rooms. Meal times are: breakfast from 7 am to 9:30 am; lunch from 1 pm to 2 pm; dinner from 5:30 pm to 7 pm. During the week, guests studying or working late can request dinner until 11 pm by writing their name on the late list or calling before 7 pm. There are 10 menu choices available for breakfast and dinner.

No animals or fires (for heating food or rooms) are allowed, and guests are asked to respect the comfort of others. If you have tapes or CDs, please keep the noise level down, especially between 11 pm and 8 am. Guests are advised to use taxis to reach the hotel if they arrive by train, as the hotel is some distance from the main railway station."

PET_49,"Text: 'The Ghan Train Mark Ottaway traveled by train from Darwin, in the north of Australia, to Adelaide, in the south. The Ghan train crosses Australia from the warm northern coast through endless desert to the colder Southern Ocean. It is often called the 'famous Ghan', but it is known for being late. The idea of a rail link between Darwin and Adelaide started in the 1920s with a line from Adelaide to Alice Springs, but there was often flooding, making it hard for trains to pass. A new line was finished a few months before my journey. The railway was built for speeds up to 115 kph, but the Ghan is not a high-speed train. There are few stops, and most passengers are on holiday. The Ghan does not offer luxury like the Orient Express, but the food on board is excellent. The railway was first built to carry goods, not passengers. It was thought that sending goods from Europe to Australia's south via Darwin and the train, instead of by ship, would save time and money. It is not every day a transcontinental railway is completed, and the Ghan claims to be the world's first north-south one. As I waited to board the Ghan, I saw that everyone was excited about the journey. Most of my fellow travelers were Australian pensioners, who were eager to board. Our first stop, where the Ghan waited four hours, was at Katherine. Some passengers got off here and took a boat trip up the gorge. I didn't leave the train until Alice Springs, where I went on a two-day trip to Uluru (Ayers Rock) with a small group and a guide. Climbing the rock is not encouraged now, and few people do. Our group just walked around the rock and stayed to watch the beautiful sunset. From Alice Springs, there are two trains a week going south, so many passengers stop their journey here. The view from the train after Alice Springs isn't very interesting. There is a lot of flat land, with only cattle to see. But at dawn on the third day, we reached the foothills near the Southern Ocean. My journey was over, and although the train might not have delivered on everything the advertisements promise, it took me to some of the most amazing sights in Australia.'"
PET_31,"Title: Climbing to the Top of Britain

Every year, thousands of people climb Ben Nevis in Scotland. Because it is in the north, the weather can be very cold. Climber Keith Hewitt talks about his first time on Ben Nevis. It was February, and it was my first big winter climb. We planned to climb the north side of the mountain to Tower Ridge. This climb is six hundred meters high and is probably the longest in Britain. We planned to camp for three days in the 'Carries', which are like big bowls in the mountain walls halfway up. We carried tents, sleeping bags, and metal spikes for our boots. You need these spikes because the snow can be so hard it feels like ice. Even though some people in our group were very experienced, we packed all kinds of safety equipment, like lights to attract attention, hard hats, and extra clothing. The weather forecast was perfect, with no strong winds, but we still felt nervous when we started. Climbing Ben Nevis in winter is always a challenge. The path soon became steep, and my legs felt tired. I was the weakest in the group, so I had to rest more often. The others sometimes stopped to let me catch up, but as soon as I reached them, they started again. I promised myself that I would always train properly before a climb. After 200 meters, we reached the start of Tower Ridge, the path that would take us to the top of Ben Nevis. It is only a meter and a half wide, and the mountain drops hundreds of meters on each side. We knew we had to stay calm and focus on every step as we moved slowly along it. After seven hours of climbing, we reached the top. On a clear day, you can see the sea and the island of Skye, 48 kilometers away. However, we weren't so lucky because a mist had come down. On Ben Nevis, going back down to camp can be as challenging as climbing up. You need to read a map well because a wrong turn could lead to slopes that are too dangerous to go down in winter. I was glad we decided to take turns reading the map. That first time, I only felt I enjoyed the experience when I was safe in the tent. But at least I made it to the top."
PET_58,"Anna's New School

This week has been very exciting because we have just moved into our new school building! It's an amazing place. The builders used wood for the whole building, just like our old school. But this new school is one of the first in my country to be very environmentally friendly. It took months to build, so we watched it happen. It was exciting to see the builders clear the space for it, although it meant some nice open land disappeared. The noise from the building machines was very loud, and the builders often had to stop because of heavy rain. We started to think the building would never be finished.

Now, we have five classrooms, which are huge - much bigger than in our old school next door, which was very old. We share one room with people in the town when they want to have meetings. There's also a nursery, a lovely dining room, and big changing rooms that we are excited to use once our new sports field is ready.

When you enter the school, one of the first things you notice is that there are no heaters! Instead, the heat comes from us - the children, the teachers, and the computers. The building is designed to keep all the heat inside - and the sound too, so if we sing in our classrooms, it feels like we're in a concert hall!

Another thing you'll notice is that there is a tree on the school roof! The builders put it there after finishing the roof because they said it is a custom in Austria, where the roof was made. The electricity for lights and computers comes from a wind turbine on a hill behind the school. We visited it with our teacher yesterday, and it spins very fast. It's so big that it can be seen from miles away! We took some pictures to put on the website.

Even though we are already using the school building, some parts still need to be added. For example, we are putting on a play for parents, but we have to go back to our old school hall to do it. The new hall will be ready by next year. We are so happy with our new school, and our teachers say we will learn much faster now that we are in it!"

This makes sharks very dangerous for smaller sea animals that they eat. Although sharks are similar to other fish in some ways, their bodies are different. For example, unlike other fish, most sharks need to swim all the time to breathe and stay alive, so they almost never sleep. Also, if sharks are turned over on their backs, they can stop moving completely. This is helpful for researchers who need to study sharks. It allows them to learn more about these interesting animals.'"

At my first ballet class, I was nervous because I didn't know anyone. Everyone gathered around and asked me questions in Russian. I tried to speak Russian, and then they started talking in English, so we could communicate. Now, six months later, everyone is really nice to me, my Russian has improved a lot, and I understand my teachers. For the first two weeks after I arrived, my mum stayed with me, and when she left, I felt a bit sad. I even called home late at night once to talk to her because I felt a little lonely. Compared to my ballet school in England, the classes in Russia are really hard, and I eat a lot to keep up my energy. That makes me confident I can perform to the school's high standards. In the evenings, I watch my favourite films on my computer, but sometimes I fall asleep before the DVD finishes. Now that I've settled down, I feel really at home here. I like walking around the city and going to different shops - even in December when I couldn't believe how cold it was. I decided to buy a fur hat because it was minus 10°C, but the Russians said it was mild for that time of year! At least it was warm and cosy in my room.

PET_55,"**THE ICEHOTEL**

For many years, people visited the Arctic in the summer to see the land of the midnight sun. In winter, only a few people lived there, enjoying the snow and ice alone. By the late 1980s, people thought the dark and cold winter could be a good thing. In the winter of 1990, a French artist named Jannot Derit was invited to open an art show in a special igloo (a building made of snow) in the small town of Jukkasjarvi on the frozen Torne River. This building, called Arctic Hall, attracted many visitors. One night, some foreign guests decided to sleep in the Arctic Hall. The next morning, they were very happy with their experience, and the idea of an ice hotel was born. Today, it is famous worldwide.

When winter starts, a team of snow builders, architects, and artists from around the world come to Jukkasjarvi to build the hotel for that year. As soon as one part is finished, it opens to visitors and overnight guests, while other parts are still being built. The first part is ready in December, and each week a new part opens until January 7th, when the hotel is complete. Since the ICEHOTEL is built outside using natural winter materials, the finishing date can change because of the weather. In spring, when it gets warmer, the hotel melts.

Inside the hotel, the temperature is always between -5°C and -8°C, no matter how cold it is outside. Warm clothes like overalls, hats, and gloves are included in the cost of staying at the hotel. Guests should also bring sweaters, a scarf, and lots of wool socks. It's a good idea to wear shoes that are bigger than usual to fit thick socks. If you plan to visit the hotel, you can buy warm sweaters, wool socks, and more on the ICEHOTEL website. You can order these items when you book your visit, and they will be delivered to your room when you check in.

The hotel is in the village of Jukkasjarvi, 200 km above the Arctic Circle, but only 15 km from Kiruna airport and 17 km from Kiruna train station. You can arrange bus transport from the airport or train station to the ICEHOTEL."

The shop's regular hours will be 9 am to 9 pm every day, but Homestyle had said it would stay open for the first 24 hours. However, it had to close within half an hour of opening. A police officer who was called to the shop said: 'The police knew a large crowd was expected, but people were not patient. The shop was soon full, and the managers wisely decided to close the doors. The people outside got angry because they thought everything would be sold before they could enter, and they refused to wait quietly until there was space for them inside. Another problem was the long line of cars trying to get to the car park. What surprised me was that many people left their cars in the middle of the road and walked the last few meters to the shop. This blocked the road completely.' One customer, Jenny Smith, who got into the shop, said: 'I waited for three hours and didn't have time to buy what I wanted. But the staff were very calm and explained what was happening. They had no choice, as it wasn't safe. So I'll come back when they reopen, but I won't wait in line again.'"

PET_34,"**Free-diving in the Caribbean**

Tanya Streeter holds four world records in free-diving. This sport involves diving deep into the ocean on just one breath. In 2003, Tanya made history by diving 120 meters deep and returning to the surface without help. She had gone deeper the year before but used a balloon to come back up. This time, she held her breath for over three and a half minutes, becoming the first woman to break a man's world record in any sport. Fourteen safety divers watched her dive at different depths. Some people think free-diving is too dangerous because of several serious accidents, but Tanya disagrees. She believes safety and training are most important.

Most free-divers focus on one or two types of events, but Tanya's training routine stays the same. She spends two-thirds of her time training on land at the gym, and the rest in the pool and ocean. She uses an exercise bike to improve her heart fitness but avoids running to protect her knees. Instead, she prefers fast walking to build fitness. When she starts practice dives, she usually travels away from home. She aims to do fourteen dives over four weeks, with a rest day between each dive. It's important she doesn't get tired, as it could ruin her preparation.

When not preparing for an event, Tanya often appears in public to promote sports products. She also supports environmental organizations by doing research projects or making films. Growing up on the Caribbean island of Grand Cayman, she loved swimming and exploring rock pools to watch sea life. Tanya says her life now is like living her childhood dreams. She is well-known in some countries, so people listen to her about environmental issues. In the future, Tanya, now in her thirties, plans to keep breaking her own world records. She started free-diving at twenty-five and doesn't plan to retire from the sport for many years."
PET_12,"Text: 'CARTOON FILMS Cartoon films have very few limits. If you can draw something, you can make it move on the cinema screen. New ideas and advanced computer programs mean that cartoons are becoming exciting again for people of all ages. By the end of the 1970s, people thought cartoons were only for children. But soon after, some directors had new ideas. They showed that it was possible to make films that both adults and children could enjoy. However, not every cartoon film was successful. The Black Cauldron, for example, did not do well because it was too scary for children and too childish for adults. Directors learned from this mistake, and film companies started to make a lot of money again.'"

I had only acted at school before, but I loved the book since I was eleven. My grandmother used to say I was just like Polly Finnegan, and I always imagined playing her. I took a year off to travel before university. While I was in Chile, my mother emailed me about plans to make the book into a TV drama. I knew I had to try for the part. She was surprised at first but sent my photo to the director and convinced him to meet me. I flew back and got the part. The outdoor filming started a week into the term, so I got permission from the university to be away for three weeks. Once back at university, I woke up at 6.00 am to write the essays I missed. I didn't tell my university friends, but they found out and thought it was great. It was an amazing experience, and I'm so lucky. After university, I definitely want to make acting my career. I'm not from an acting family, though my grandfather was an opera singer. I've tried for other TV roles but haven't received any offers yet. I don't know how I managed it all because I had a full social life too. When filming finished, I hardly knew what to do. I've since appeared in two college plays. Unfortunately, I haven't been home much, and now my first year at university is over, I'm off to Greece for the summer with friends.""'"

This is not a typical business book, nor is it just about my life. The main idea is that to succeed in business, you have to be different. Business can be enjoyable, it can be run with care, and it can do good things. In business, as in life, I need to have fun, feel like part of a family, and be excited by surprises. I have always wanted the people who work for 'The Body Shop' to feel the same way. Now, this book shares my ideas with the world and makes them public. I like to think there are no limits to our 'family' and no limits to what we can achieve. I find that an exciting thought. I hope you do, too.'"

PET_7,"Norwich, the capital of East Anglia in Britain, has been a place to live for over two thousand years. It started as a small village by the River Wensum. By the time of the Norman invasion in 1066, it had grown into one of the largest towns in England. Norwich is known for its religious diversity, with two cathedrals and a mosque. The first cathedral was built in 1095 and recently celebrated its 900th anniversary. In 1994, Norwich celebrated the 800th anniversary of receiving a Royal Charter, which allowed it to be called a city and govern itself.

Today, Norwich is smaller compared to cities like London or Manchester, with a population of about 150,000. However, in the 16th century, it was the second-largest city in England. It continued to grow and became wealthy, known for having as many churches as weeks in the year and as many pubs as days in the year. Now, there are fewer churches and pubs, but in 1964, the University of East Anglia was established in Norwich. With a growing student population and success as a commercial center, Norwich offers a variety of entertainment options: theatres, cinemas, nightclubs, cafes, restaurants, and arts and leisure centers. The city also has a football team called 'The Canaries', with green and yellow colors, though the reason for the name is unclear.

One of the city's attractions is a modern shopping center called 'The Castle Mall'. For over two years, the people of Norwich lived with a large hole in the city center as builders worked on the project. They moved nearly a million tons of earth to create a city center park on the roof of the Mall, with water pools and trees. The local people are happy that the old open market remains next to the new development. Both areas are successful, showing that Norwich has combined the best of the old and the new."
PET_43,"**The Albuquerque Balloon Festival**

Every autumn, the sky above Albuquerque, a city in the southwestern United States, fills with bright colors. This is because of the Albuquerque Balloon Festival, a nine-day event held every year. The first festival was in 1972 to celebrate the 50th birthday of a local radio station. Back then, about twelve hot-air balloons took off from a car park in the middle of Albuquerque. Since then, the festival has grown a lot. This year, at least a thousand balloons from over one-third of the countries in the world are expected at the current site outside the city.

**What to See**

The balloon pilots stay in radio contact and light up their burners at the same time. These are called 'balloon glows' and are great for taking photos. To see these 'glows,' you must arrive just after nightfall or before 5:30 am as the balloons rise into the dark sky. During the day, you can walk among the balloons and talk to the pilots as they get ready for take-off. The balloons come in many sizes and colors, some shaped like animals, cartoon characters, or famous products like soft drinks and fast food. Kids will love it.

In the afternoon, you can take a balloon flight over the desert with one of the many companies offering rides. Another option is to take the cable car from the desert floor to the top of the nearby mountains. This is the longest cable car ride anywhere and offers a bird's-eye view of the festival. There are many other attractions for visitors of all ages, including balloon races and fireworks on the opening night and the last three nights of the festival.

**The Albuquerque Box**

This is a local wind pattern that is perfect for balloonists. The Sandia Mountains protect the balloons from strong winds and create gentle wind currents at different heights. This allows skilled pilots to control the direction of their balloons by rising or descending.

**Practical Advice**

Buy your tickets in advance online to avoid long waits at the festival site. Wear several layers of thin clothing. It can be cool at night and in the early morning, but during the day, sunglasses and sunscreen are essential. Bring a flashlight for night events and, of course, your camera. If you use film, you'll need high-speed film for evening and night pictures."

Margaret, who lives in London, likes to start teaching children at three or four years old, but she sometimes makes exceptions for eager five-year-olds. When she began teaching the violin in 1972, her first class was made up of her children's five-year-old school friends. Margaret's students have group lessons. Each group has about twelve students, and each lesson lasts an hour, once every two weeks. In addition, each student has one individual lesson a week with her. Parents also need to attend the classes. It is important that parents show interest in the lessons. From the first lessons, students learn to play by ear. They do not try to read music until they have been playing for several years, and for a long time, there is a big difference between their playing and reading of music. Margaret says her method is not meant to create great violinists, and she often suggests that students who do very well should leave and study the violin using more traditional methods."

From the first song, which is a dance tune, it is clear that the band is not focusing on slow songs anymore. The second song is also a dance tune and is even louder and heavier. Most of the later songs are in the band's usual slow style. These two tracks will surprise many fans. Either of them could easily become a hit single because they are excellent. Singer Rob Letchford shows how good he is by hitting each note perfectly. Fans should be thankful he recorded the songs before he had trouble with his throat. This has caused the band to cancel their next tour. (Anyone who has bought tickets should not worry as all the concerts will be rescheduled once Rob has recovered.) On this CD, Moonshine shows they can make perfect music in different styles, from the slow ones we know to the ones that make you want to dance.

PET_40,"Title: The History of the Iditarod - The Last Great Race on Earth

In the 1880s, gold was found in Alaska, the most northern state of the USA. Many people went there hoping to become rich. New towns were built quickly. One of these towns was called Iditarod, which means 'far, distant place'. In 1909, Iditarod grew so fast that it briefly became the largest city in Alaska. During the summer, boats could bring supplies to these towns, but in winter, the rivers and ocean froze, making travel impossible. So, in 1910, a winter trail was created for teams of dogs pulling sleds. They carried mail, food, and clothes to the gold miners. This trail was called the Iditarod Trail. It took about three weeks for a team of dogs to cross Alaska. They stopped at 'roadhouses' where the drivers could rest and eat, and feed their dogs. The trail was used every winter until the 1920s when airplanes replaced steam boats and dog teams for transport.

However, in 1925, the dogs were needed again when a disease called diphtheria hit the city of Nome. The disease could be treated, but the nearest medicine was in Anchorage, on the other side of Alaska. Airplanes were still new, and it was uncertain if they could fly in such cold weather. Also, Carl Eielson, the only pilot skilled enough for the flight, was away. So, it was decided to use dog teams to transport the medicine. The journey was over 1,000 kilometers, mostly along the Iditarod Trail. It took twenty teams just six days to complete the trip. Leonhard Seppala, a Norwegian who came to Alaska for gold, traveled the first 400 kilometers. He relied on his dog Togo to guide him through the snow, and Togo proved to be a good guide. The last part of the journey was done by Gunnar Kaasen, who had driven dog teams in Alaska for 21 years. His lead dog was Balto. At one point, Balto refused to go further, saving the team from falling into icy water. The diphtheria was stopped, and Balto became a hero.

Today, a dog sled race is held every year from Anchorage to Nome, following the route of the 1925 journey. It is called the Iditarod and is known as 'The Last Great Race on Earth'."

PET_28,"**Antarctica Sightseeing Flights Website**

Welcome to our website. Here is what you need to know before booking a flight. During the short Antarctic summer, Antarctica Sightseeing Flights takes tourists in a large passenger plane (Boeing 747) from Sydney, Australia, over Antarctica and back. Flight dates for next year are not confirmed yet, but if you book now, your deposit can be moved to another date if we need to change the flight day.

**Questions**

These are answers to common questions about Antarctica Sightseeing Flights.

**How long is the flight?**

The flight usually lasts 12 hours. About four hours into the flight, we start seeing the first sea ice and icebergs. We spend four hours flying over Antarctica and the rest of the time flying back. On the way to and from Antarctica, experts who have lived at research stations there give talks about the environment and history, and answer questions. A camera near the pilot, connected to the video system on board, shows you the pilot's view from take-off to landing.

**Will I get a seat next to a window?**

All passengers receive two boarding passes. Halfway through the flight, passengers switch to the seat on their second boarding pass. Business and first class passengers will have a window seat for half of the flight and a seat next to a window for the other half. Economy passengers will have a window seat or a seat next to a window for half of the flight and an aisle seat for the other half. While over Antarctica, we encourage passengers to walk around the plane so everyone can enjoy the views. The pilot flies in long 'figure 8s' over interesting spots so both sides of the plane can see the sights well.

**What happens if the weather is bad?**

We have 17 different approved flight routes. Our captain checks the satellite cloud images on the morning of the flight and chooses the route with the clearest views.

**Will I see penguins and other wildlife?**

Most Antarctic wildlife lives at sea level, over 3,000 meters below the plane, so we can't see them clearly. We do not land on Antarctica, mainly for environmental reasons. To see Antarctic wildlife, you would need to join a boat tour.

**Can I take photographs?**

Yes! All cameras are welcome. We even offer some fun photo opportunities on board where you can try on Antarctic cold weather clothes."

Parents pay £280 for the course where their children can have fun and learn to make good food. Class member Bill, aged ten, says, 'I love my mum's cooking and now I can do it better than her. The teachers make us laugh, especially when we sit down with them to share the food we've made.' Flora is twelve, and she's having trouble preparing onions. 'I love cooking. I made a meal for ten friends which they really enjoyed. Then my mum suggested I take up a hobby, instead of doing nothing at weekends. I was happy staying at home, so I wasn't too interested at first. I'm really glad I decided to come, though.' Their teacher, Philippe, says, 'It's great fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, although the kitchen isn't always as tidy when they're cooking! As adults, we're always learning more about food. If parents interest their children in cooking while they are young, they'll have enough skill to make food for themselves when they leave home.''"
PET_5,"Text: 'Winter Driving Winter can be dangerous because it's hard to know what will happen, and accidents can happen easily. Fog might be waiting for you over a hill. Ice could be hiding under melting snow, ready to make you slide off the road. The car coming towards you might suddenly slide across the road. Rule Number One for driving on icy roads is to drive smoothly. Sudden movements can make a car hard to control. So, when you turn the wheel, touch the brakes, or speed up, do it gently and slowly. Imagine you have a full cup of hot coffee on the seat next to you. Drive so you wouldn't spill it. Rule Number Two is to pay attention to what might happen. The more ice there is, the further ahead you need to look. Test how long it takes to stop by gently braking. Remember, you might be driving faster than you think. In general, allow double your normal stopping distance when the road is wet, three times this distance on snow, and even more on ice. Try to stay in control of your car at all times to avoid trouble.'"
PET_41,"Craigie Aitchison

The painter Craigie Aitchison was born in Scotland. He moved to London planning to study law, but instead, he went to art school. There, he found traditional drawing classes hard, but he continued painting. In his late twenties, he received money from the Italian government to study art. He became interested in early Italian artists, which is visible in some of his work. He loved the greens and browns of the Italian fields and the clear light there, and he wanted to capture this light in his paintings. This led him to paint colors thinly, one on top of another, from light to dark. However, he says he's never sure what the results will be. He explains, 'It's a secret - because I don't know myself. I don't start by painting yellow, knowing I'm going to put anything on top.' Like many talented people, Aitchison makes it sound easy. 'Anyone can do the colors - you can buy them. I simply notice what you put the colors next to.' Unlike some artists, he never makes drawings before starting a painting, as he feels that if he did, he might get bored and not finish the painting. Instead, Aitchison changes his paintings many times before they are done. This is why his favorite models are people who don't ask to see their pictures while he's painting them. 'If I feel they're worried and want to look at the painting, I can't do it.' Since moving to London, he has not felt part of the Scottish painting scene. He says he is not interested in following any tradition, but just paints the way he can. However, his work still influences young British painters."
PET_38,"Text: 'Rock Band Two years ago, our 14-year-old son, Ben, asked us for a set of drums for his birthday. At first, we were against the idea because of the noise. 'It's better than watching television or playing computer games in my free time,' Ben argued, 'and it'll keep me out of trouble.' In the end, we agreed. 'All right,' we said, 'but you must think about the rest of the family and the neighbours when you play.' That was just the start. Because drums are not easy to move, the other members of Ben's band started coming to our home with their guitars and other electrical equipment. So, for several hours a week, the house shakes with the sound of their instruments and their teenage singing. At least Ben's hobby has been good for our health: whenever the band starts practising, my husband and I go out for a long walk. And I must admit that, although their music may sound a little strange, they are a friendly and polite group of young men. I cannot judge their musical skill - after all, I didn't expect my parents' generation to like the same music as I did when I was a teenager - but they do play regularly in local clubs for young people. Our main worry is that they won't spend enough time on their school work because of their music, though this hasn't happened yet. I always tell Ben how important his studies are. But one thing is certain - Ben was right: it has kept him out of trouble and he is never bored.'"
PET_17,"Atlantic College

Last week, I visited Atlantic College, a great private school in Wales. This school is special because it gives young people important experiences outside the classroom, as well as the chance to study for their exams. The students, who are between 16 and 18 years old and come from all over the world, study in the morning. In the afternoon, they do useful activities like helping on a farm, taking care of people with learning difficulties, or checking rivers for pollution.

One of the best things about Atlantic College is that its students come from many different countries and social backgrounds. Since not many can pay the fees of £20,000 for two years, there are grants available. A quarter of the students are British, and many of them can only attend because they get help from the government.

""I really admire the college for trying to encourage international understanding among young people,"" said Barbara Molenkamp, a student from the Netherlands. ""You learn to live with people and respect them, even those you don't like. During the summer holidays, my mother couldn't believe how much less I argued with my sister.""

In conclusion, Atlantic College gives its students an excellent education, using methods that really seem to work."

I decided to go to university after being away from school for fourteen years. As a secretary, I was earning a good amount of money, but I was bored because I didn't have to think much. I felt stuck in the job and became unhappy. I was jealous of the students at the local university. They looked happy and full of hope, and I wanted to be part of that. However, now that I'm a student, I find it hard to mix with younger classmates. They often think I am a lecturer and ask me questions I can't answer. I also feel different from the lecturers because, even though we are the same age, they know much more than I do. But I am happy to study because I know you need a qualification to get a good job, which is very important to me. Unlike most eighteen-year-olds, I prefer spending a weekend with my books rather than going out to party. There are also benefits like long holidays and discounts at theatres and cinemas. I often wonder what I'll do after university, but I hope that continuing my education at this age has been a good decision.'"

After driving it 1,500 kilometers, he sold it and made two bigger cars. In 1903, he started the Ford Motor Company. By using strong but light steel, he made cheap cars for ordinary people. In 1908, he built the first Ford Model 'T', which cost $825. He soon sold 100 cars a day. By 1927, the Ford Motor Company was worth $700 million. Early Ford cars were simple and cheap, but this sometimes meant less choice. 'You can have any color you like,' said Henry Ford of the Model T, 'as long as it's black.' '"

When the cold weather came in autumn, Bill flew to Virginia in the United States, 600 miles south of his home in Canada. The geese followed him all the way. Bill left the geese in Virginia and returned home. This spring, Bill was waiting for the birds to come back. They didn't arrive, so Bill flew to Virginia to find them.

Five years ago, Jenny made some sweaters with the wool and tried to sell them at country markets. But it was summer, and the weather was hot, so people didn't want to buy sweaters. She then made some socks. Everyone loved them because they were cheap, strong, and easy to wash. That's how Jenny's business started. At first, she made the socks at home, but soon she had thousands of customers, so she had to send the wool to a factory, where all the socks are now made by machines.

Inspector Ian Saunders told our newspaper that the number of house burglaries has increased by more than 30% compared to last year. He also said that 67% of burglaries happen when people leave a door or a window open. He reported that night-time burglaries are rare because families are usually at home then. But he said that winter afternoons are the best time for burglars because it is dark and they can't be seen easily. Also, many houses are empty at that time because people are often still at work. Inspector Saunders said it is a good idea to leave lights on in living rooms and bedrooms when you go on holiday. This will help to keep burglars away. He also asked neighbours to watch the other houses in the street when people are not at home. They should call the police if they see anything strange. 'We will also tell you how to make your house safe,' Inspector Saunders said. 'This kind of help costs nothing.''"

KET_44,"Text: 'The History of Farming Before people started farming, they went to the forest to find plants or fruit they could eat. This meant that people were always moving to find food. But about 12,000 years ago, in the Middle East, people began to grow their own food. These people were the first farmers. Farming allowed people to stay in one place, and their villages slowly became bigger. Some people in the villages could do other jobs, like making clothes, because the farmers grew food for everyone. Unfortunately, farming was hard when the weather was bad, and then some people did not have enough food to eat. Today, farmers can grow more food, and it travels thousands of kilometers from where it is grown to our homes.'"

A few old men used to guard the city streets at night, and they were not paid much. About 300 years ago, London was starting to grow. The city was very dirty, and many people were poor. There were so many thieves stealing money in the streets that people stayed in their homes as much as possible. In 1750, Henry Fielding began to pay a group of people to stop thieves. They were like policemen and were called 'Bow Street Runners' because they worked near Bow Street. Fifty years later, there were 120 Bow Street Runners, but London had become very big and needed more policemen. So, in 1829, the first Metropolitan (or London) Police Force was started with 3000 officers. Most of the men worked on foot, but a few rode horses. Until 1920, all the police in London were men. Today, London police are quite well paid, and for the few police officers who still ride horses, the pay is even better than for the others.'"

KET_7,"Text: 'Visit the Edinburgh Festival! Every year, thousands of people visit Edinburgh, the capital city of Scotland, to join the Edinburgh Festival. For three weeks every August and September, the city is full of actors and artists from all over the world. They come for the biggest arts festival in Britain. During this time, the streets are full of music and dance from early morning until late at night. You can even see artists painting on the streets. One of the best parts of the Festival is the 'Fringe', where students perform comedy shows in small halls and cafes. Many tourists come to see new films and plays and listen to music by famous musicians. This year, you can watch over five hundred performances with actors from more than forty countries. The tickets for these shows are quite cheap, and it is usually easier to see your favourite star in Edinburgh than in London. So come to Edinburgh next summer, but remember it can be hard to find a room, so why not book your hotel now!'"
KET_43,"Text: 'ICE-FISHING If you drive north from Toronto for three hours, you will reach Lake Nipissing. In winter, the lake turns to ice, and thousands of Canadian fishermen go there each weekend. They build small wooden houses on the ice and paint them in bright colors. Then they sit inside to catch fish that swim under the ice. Bob Marvisch has been coming here at this time of year for twenty-five years. 'You need clothes that are light but warm: two pairs of socks and gloves, several thin sweaters, and a snow suit on top. Catching the fish is easy,' he says. 'First, you break the ice and make a small round hole in it. Next, you take a fishing line and put some bread on it. Then you put the line through the hole and into the water. You pull the line up when the fish eat the bread. They are between ten and twenty centimeters long. Some people like to eat them, but when I have caught three or four fish, I prefer to have some chocolate or another snack! Today I have caught twenty-five! It's a great sport and you can meet some nice people here!''"

KET_11,"Text: 'Madame Tussaud's A very famous place for tourists in London is Madame Tussaud's museum. Here, people can see wax figures of famous people. Madame Tussaud was born in France in 1761. Her uncle, who was a doctor, made wax figures of people. He opened a museum of these figures in Paris, and Marie helped him with his work. In 1789, during the French Revolution, Marie was sent to prison. There, she had to make copies of the heads of famous people after they died, including Queen Marie Antoinette's. In 1795, Marie married Francois Tussaud, and in 1802 she came to London with her wax figures. She opened a museum there, and her figures can still be seen today.'"
KET_14,"Text: 'BICYCLES The bicycle is an affordable and clean way to travel. The first bicycle was made about 150 years ago. At first, bicycles were expensive, and only rich people could buy one. These early bicycles looked very different from the ones we have today. Later, when bicycles became cheaper, many people bought them. People started riding bicycles to work and in their free time. Today, people use cars more than bicycles because cars are much faster and you don't get wet when it rains. However, some people still prefer to cycle to work. They say there are too many cars in city centers and it's hard to find a place to park.'"
KET_63,"Text: 'The Elephant Show by Daniel Allsop, age 14 Last summer, I went to Thailand for a beach holiday with my family. One day, we visited a park near our hotel. It had beautiful flower gardens, but we were only interested in the elephant show. We went to a large square with seats on three sides. Three elephants came in with their keepers and stood in front of a large white card. Each elephant got a paintbrush and started to paint on its own card. Sometimes, the keepers gave the elephants a new brush with paint and took the old one away. Slowly, following their keepers' instructions, the elephants drew pictures on the cards. I couldn't believe what I was seeing! One picture showed a river, another a tree, and the third a bunch of flowers. When the keepers held up the paintings, everyone wanted to buy one. We gave the elephants the bananas we brought for our lunch. Twenty years ago, elephants worked in the forest. Now, they do not work there anymore, but the smartest of these animals live in special centers where visitors can watch them.'"
KET_56,"Text: 'Big Cats There are many different types of big cats. They are different in size, appearance, and behavior. Tigers are the largest big cats. From head to tail, they can be 3.7 meters long. Most cats don't like water, but tigers often lie in water when it is hot! Lions are the only big cats that live in large family groups. Several lions may work together to hunt for food for the group. They usually live in flat, open areas where they can see far and easily follow other animals. All big cats need good eyesight because they catch smaller animals for food. They also need to be fast and very strong.'"

KET_20,"Text: 'THE OSTRICH The ostrich is the biggest bird in the world, and an adult can weigh more than 90 kilos. Most wild ostriches live in southern Africa, but there are only a few left. Like all birds, ostriches have wings, but they cannot fly. They use their wings to help them turn when they run. Ostriches can run very fast, from 65 to 90 kilometers an hour, so it is very hard for other animals to catch them. Baby ostriches are the same size as chickens and take about 3 years to grow into adults. Ostriches eat plants and can live for many days without water.'"
KET_40,"Text: Victoria Jamieson from Britain started snowboarding when she was 20 years old. Now, at 23, she has won many competitions in snowboarding. We talked to her last week at a snowboarding competition in Switzerland and asked why she began the sport. She said, ""I've always liked sports, especially skiing, so snowboarding was a natural choice. It doesn't take long to learn, and you can become really good in a few months."" We asked if she practices a lot. She replied, ""In winter, I snowboard in the mountains every day from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. I also run and bike. I love doing all of it! I enjoy the competitions and being in the mountains. It's so beautiful. But free-riding, which is doing what you want when not in a competition, is the best thing for me."" We asked what is important when learning. She said, ""You can learn quickly, but you need lessons. It's also important to have the right clothes so you don't get wet because, at first, you spend a lot of time falling down!"""

KET_64,"Mount Kilimanjaro

Mount Kilimanjaro is the tallest mountain in Africa. Many people have climbed Kilimanjaro, including a seven-year-old boy and an 87-year-old man. There are different paths to reach the top. The Marangu path is five kilometers long and is considered the easiest. It takes about five days to climb and is very popular with tourists. However, only half of the climbers who attempt to climb Kilimanjaro reach the top. This is often because the weather can change quickly. At the start, it can be hot and wet, but when climbers get to the top, they find ice and snow, and the temperature can be below 20 degrees. Climbers need to bring both sunglasses and warm clothes!"
KET_29,"Text: 'Otters Not many people have seen an otter. These animals live near rivers and build their homes from small pieces of wood. They usually come out of their homes at night. Otters are very good swimmers and can move in the water at more than 10 kilometers an hour. They have thick brown fur that keeps them warm in the water. An otter can close its ears and nose, which allows them to stay underwater for several minutes. Twenty years ago, there were not many otters in Great Britain. The rivers were very dirty, so many fish and insects died, and the otters couldn't find food. But today, there is plenty of food for them because the rivers are clean again.'"

We use other buildings, like museums, to keep beautiful things. Many people work together on a building. The architect decides how the building will look and draws pictures to show their ideas. Engineers make sure the building will be strong and safe. Then, the workers carefully build it. The Sydney Opera House is a famous modern building with a beautiful roof.

KET_61,"Gail Rollins is one of the best runners in Edinburgh. This summer, she wants to run the 10,000 meters and maybe the 5,000 meters at the European Championships. In the past, Gail was famous for finishing second in big races. But she always laughed and smiled, and people in her city love her for this. Everything changed in 2004 when she ran her first half-marathon, a very long road race. She won with the fastest time of the year for any British woman runner. Gail's manager and husband, Mike Rollins, also used to race when he was younger, but he had to stop because he hurt his right leg. He can still run a little and sometimes trains with Gail. But it's not fun for Mike when Gail runs faster than him and he can't catch up. Gail trains hard. She does a long run in the morning and fast runs in the afternoon. But she always rests from running on Sundays. 'I am with her all the time,' says Mike. 'Sometimes I say, ""Are you sure you should be eating that?"" It's usually cakes, but she can eat almost everything.'"

His first music teacher couldn't play the piano but taught him and his sister opera songs. His mother started teaching him piano when he was six. At ten, he decided he wanted to write music and soon began his first song. Oleg Gagarin Oleg was the youngest of five children. When he was four, his father, who enjoyed playing the piano, taught him some traditional Russian music. At six, he started lessons with a piano teacher in his city. Oleg quickly began winning prizes for his piano playing. At fourteen, he went to a music college in Austria for two years, then returned to Russia. Josef Heptmann Josef's father was German but taught music in Poland, where Josef was born. The family moved to Germany when Josef was two, and he started playing the piano a year later.

Now, thirteen years later, he has written more than 80 books. Every day, he goes to his office to write. In the evening, he gives his work to his wife to read. 'She tells me when she doesn't like something,' says Bill. 'My ten grandchildren don't live nearby, but they also read my stories and tell me if they are good or bad.' This way, Bill has learned what young children like to read. Bill writes about life in his village and the farms around it. His fifth book is his favorite: The Sheepdog is about a farmer and the dog that helps him. 'I have always liked animals,' says Bill, 'and dogs are so clever, they learn very quickly.' Last year, the book was made into a film with real animals and actors. The filmmakers used the latest computer technology to make it look like the animals are speaking. Bill was very happy with the film. 'Sometimes filmmakers change books, but they didn't change mine and I love the film.'"

These postcards often have pictures of beaches, mountains, or castles on them, and you can write a message on the back. Many people send postcards when they are on holiday because postcards are cheap, and the pictures on them are often better than people's own photos. The first postcard was sent at the end of the nineteenth century. It had a picture of a town by the sea. Later, postcards had pictures showing something in the news that week, like an accident or an important person's visit. People liked to see them because they did not have pictures in their newspapers then.'"

The closest living relatives of dinosaurs are birds. Dinosaurs didn't all look the same. There were more than 5000 types. Some were very small, but others were huge. The largest were bigger than any other animals that ever lived on land. The Brontosaurus, for example, was twenty meters long and ate plants. The Tyrannosaurus Rex was not as big, but it was stronger. It had sharp teeth for eating meat and could run fast because it had long back legs.'"

Then, in 1918, the US Post Office started the first airmail service. Aeroplanes changed a lot in the next thirty years. In the 1950s, planes became much faster because they had jet engines. In 1976, Concorde was made in the UK and France. It is the fastest passenger plane in the world and can fly at 2500 kilometres an hour, so the trip from London to New York takes only four hours.

The visitors ate, talked to their friends, walked around during the show, and some people even threw things at the actors! Today, you can still visit the Globe Theatre. A new theatre is in the same place near the river. You can enjoy a Shakespeare play there or just learn about life in the seventeenth century.'"

I'm having a great holiday in Australia. When we arrived two weeks ago, the weather was bad and it was cold. Now the weather is better, and we go to the beach every day.
