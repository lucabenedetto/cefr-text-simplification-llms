CPE_15,"Text: 'Charging families for each bag of rubbish they produce seems like a good idea for the environment and economy. But it might not be. In many developed countries, rubbish collection is a common service. Rubbish bags or bins are collected by a special truck and taken away. Usually, this service is paid for by local taxes, so families that produce a lot of rubbish pay the same as those that produce little. However, more rubbish means more collectors and trucks are needed, and local authorities pay more in landfill fees. If rubbish disposal is free, people might produce too much rubbish. The solution could be to make families pay for each bag of rubbish. This might encourage them to throw away less and recycle more. But two American economists, Don Fullerton and Thomas Kinnaman, found that this idea has complicated results. They studied American towns that started charging for rubbish. The most common system is to sell stickers for rubbish bags. Only bags with stickers are collected. In Charlottesville, Virginia, people were charged 80 cents per bag. The number of bags fell by 37%, but people just packed more rubbish into each bag. The weight of rubbish collected fell by only 14%. In other towns without this system, it fell by 3.5% anyway. Some people also dumped rubbish illegally to avoid paying. Recycling increased by 15%, but this might not be because of the fee, as many people were already recycling. In another study, the economists found that higher prices for rubbish stickers reduce rubbish weight, but not by much. A 10% increase in sticker prices cuts rubbish by only 0.3%. People would need to buy less of everything to reduce rubbish a lot. Other factors like income and education might also affect rubbish production. Richer towns produce more rubbish and have less time for recycling. Charging for rubbish is not a bad idea, but the effects are complex. Simple policies can have complicated results, and sometimes they don't work as expected.'"
CPE_19,"Text: 'Theodore Zeldin talks about how our work life might change. Do you feel respected and appreciated at work? Just having a successful career is not enough anymore. Many people feel their jobs are not valued or understood. Even famous people can feel unhappy. Loving your job used to be special, but now you should ask what your job does to you as a person. Does it help your mind, character, and relationships? This is important. If your job makes you boring or too busy to learn new things, then money and status are not enough. I want to find out how work can help us grow as people, not just be a way to make money. Work should help us discover new talents and meet different people. This does not mean getting rid of unemployment. People want jobs that are interesting and useful. Work should be like art, with happy people at the center. Many jobs, like doctors and accountants, are not as appealing as before. Doctors are stressed, and accountants worry about ethics. Architects and administrators feel limited. Middle managers are losing confidence. Companies are getting smaller, and new ideas like decentralization and performance rewards are not working well. In Britain, only 8% of workers feel their values match their company's values. I am studying different jobs to see how they affect people. I look at happiness, love, friendship, and respect. I want to find better ways to work. Many experts focus on making companies last longer and earn more money, but we also need to think about what kind of people we want to be. Are we really alive at work, or are we just working because we have no other choice? For example, hotel workers often have low pay and long hours, even though they are smart and lively. Hotels have not changed much since the old days. They could be places where people from different countries meet and learn from each other. Hotel staff could have more meaningful jobs, but accountants focus only on profits. Work should be about relationships. People want to be independent and choose their jobs and colleagues. They need to talk to people from different fields. Communication is important, but real conversation is more than just talking. It helps us understand and respect each other. Every good conversation can change the world a little bit.'"
CPE_24,"**Broadcasting: The Social Shaping of a Technology**

The word 'broadcasting' originally meant spreading seeds by hand. This is an agricultural idea, but it also represents modern growth and success. Broadcasting involves spreading information widely, like seeds, from a central source. 

When television was invented, it was set up as a centralised 'mass' medium, similar to the telegraph and telephone. This means that information was sent from one place to many homes. This fit well with the way societies were organised at the time. 

There were some experiments with different ways of using television. For example, in the 1930s, some people in Britain tried to use two-way television, like a telephone. Magazines showed how to build TV transmitters and receivers. However, big companies set standards that made it hard for these small experiments to continue.

In the early 1930s, television was mostly watched in public places, like theatres, in the USA and other countries. In Britain and Germany, people often watched TV in public settings. The idea of two-way or amateur television did not become popular.

Manufacturers saw that they could sell many TVs for home use if the price was right. As people started to have better living standards, especially from the 1920s, having a TV at home became possible for many. This led to centralised broadcasting, where information was sent to many homes.

Broadcasting helped governments share important information with everyone. It also helped create a sense of community in countries. Broadcasting was seen as a way to give people equal access to information, which is important for democracy.

Today, television is changing, and the idea of broadcasting might also change. The term 'broadcasting' might only refer to a certain way of using technology during a specific time in history."
CPE_13,"**Clutter**

Sometimes, it feels like no matter how many things you have, you never feel safe. It is normal to want a home that meets your needs, but sometimes wanting more things can get out of control. Modern advertising is made to make us feel insecure. It often tells us that if we don't have certain things, we are not good enough. To see how much you are influenced, try not to read any advertising signs next time you walk down the street. These expensive messages try to make us buy things without us even noticing. We see them everywhere - on TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, t-shirts, the internet - all telling us to buy, buy, buy.

**Caves**

Scientists and universities around the world study caves. They want to know about their origins, water, and life inside them. Caves are a small but interesting part of nature. They make us curious and we want to learn more about them. Because caves are natural, they have been studied for a long time, especially in places where they affect our lives. However, visiting many caves needs physical skill, so cave research is often done by people who visit caves for fun, not just by professors. There is a special connection between professional scientists and amateur cave explorers.

**Weather Watch**

Many people who watched the weather without any tools helped start the science of meteorology. Since the 17th century, it has become a very technical science. Satellites and electronic tools give us weather information quickly, and computers solve difficult math problems very fast. Meteorology uses long words that are hard to understand for most people. But simple weather knowledge is still important. Human experience is needed to turn computer data into weather forecasts. Human observations can still give special information that helps professionals understand the weather."
CPE_16,"**MUSIC AND THEATRE**

Not long ago, I thought opera was mostly about theatre. But after working at a national opera house, I learned that music is the most important part of opera. This is how it should be. However, I come from the theatre world, where the words and the actors are the main focus. In theatre, there is no one directing the action once the play starts, and the performers and audience usually speak the same language.

At a music performance, like in a concert hall or opera house, many people, like me, might not understand music technically. Some might feel embarrassed about this, but most are amazed by the performers' skills. A great singer or a perfect orchestra is easy to admire. Even a good musician shows us the result of years of hard work. Watching top-class music is like watching a sports match - we know athletes do something similar to us running for a bus, but they do it much better.

Theatre audiences have different expectations. They often do not understand an actor's skill and are not very impressed by something that seems close to what they could do. They are not usually amazed when an actor finishes a long speech, although they often ask, ""How do you learn all those lines?"" This does not mean theatre audiences are more generous or less demanding than music audiences. Many people go to both. But in theatre, audiences and performers meet on more equal terms, no matter how challenging the play is.

Does music need to learn from theatre about this relationship? I think yes. Music in live performance is full of passion, humor, and emotion. It can go wrong, and it connects with the listener's imagination. But the way music is presented, with strict dress codes and respect for conductors and soloists, often feels too formal. Also, when audiences clap between movements or after a great performance, it can interrupt the flow of the music.

Is there a solution? Yes, a lot is being done to bring new audiences to concerts and operas and to make serious music more accessible. I remember a special event, Jonathan Dove's community opera ""In Search of Angels,"" which moved from a cathedral to the town. It was a high-quality musical experience, and it changed many audience members' lives. They were not just watching and listening but also participating.

I wish music had more of the risk and excitement that theatre can have. Sometimes, using unusual or challenging locations can surprise both performers and audiences. It might be uncomfortable, but theatre audiences have learned to follow artists into unexpected places. Most plays are performed in a traditional way, similar to concerts. But I believe something should change in music performances. I am just an enthusiast who loves theatre and music. I want both to succeed and for more people to enjoy them as much as I do."
CPE_21,"**Sand**

I think sand is amazing because it can become useful things like glass and concrete. But, I don't like sand on the beach. It is a problem between the car park and the sea. Sand blows in your face, gets in your food, and hides important things like car keys and coins. When you are wet, sand sticks to you and is hard to remove. But when you step on a towel, get in a car, or walk on a clean carpet, sand falls off. For days, you find sand on the floor when you take off your shoes and socks. Sand stays with you for a long time. I don't like sand.

**Lock and Key**

People have always wanted a safe home. Long ago, they used a beam behind the door. Now, we have electronic locks with many combinations. But people still like using a key. Some companies tried using smart cards for locks, but people prefer keys at home. One company made a new electronic lock with a real metal key.

**Modern Art**

I was nervous about visiting the new Tate Modern gallery because I don't understand modern art. I like some things, like furry art, neon lights, and big photos. Maybe if I knew more, I would have more opinions. Art is not about understanding but feeling it. This idea doesn't work for me. But the new gallery helps visitors understand art. The labels explain the art and what it means. This information helped me understand the pictures better."
CPE_46,"**Every Picture Tells a Story**

When books are turned into movies, a lot of the story is cut or changed. This can be hard for the writer, but it can also be interesting. When I worked on a movie script, I saw that I could remove a lot of the talking and details from the book and still tell the same story. This doesn't mean the book's words were not needed. It's about how each type of story, book or movie, needs different things. In a book, we often see repeated details about characters or who is speaking, which helps us understand better. In plays, which are mostly talking, the extra words can make it feel like real conversation. Some modern plays use a lot of extra words that don't add much meaning, just to show people are talking.

**Watching Movies**

When we watch movies, we can feel like we are part of the movie world. It's like escaping from real life for a while. But when the movie ends and the lights come on, we return to the real world. In the past, some people thought movies were just for fun and not real art. Our parents and teachers often thought this way. They liked movies but didn't see them as art.

**The Film Studios**

The Leiper Film Company studios were a mix of many different buildings. It was hard to find your way around because there were many small rooms that looked the same. There were three main entrances, but none had a place to ask for directions. It was confusing for new people, but not many strangers came there. The people who worked there knew their way around. Together, they made movies that brought romance and adventure to people, helping them escape from their daily problems for a few hours.

**Film-makers**

Many people want to make movies. There are many books and courses on how to write scripts and make films. Some competitions even give away cameras like the one Robert Rodriguez used to make his movie El Mariachi, which cost $7,000. This movie made him famous. He wrote about his experience, saying he wanted to make a great movie before he turned 25, like famous directors Orson Welles and Steven Spielberg. In the past, film-makers took longer to become successful. They worked in different jobs in the studio before directing their own movies. But now, without big studios to help, new film-makers have to be more independent."
CPE_3,"Text: 'In those days, the council houses were all over the west side of the city. They were rows of small, old houses in orange brick or white stucco. In summer, the chemicals from the May and Baker factory, two miles away, made the air smell bad. The most common sight in that part of Norwich early in the morning was a paperboy wrinkling his nose as he walked to deliver newspapers. I have forgotten most of my early life. But I remember sitting near an upstairs window, looking at the houses as they disappeared into the distance. Later, I remember faces I can't name, my mother ironing towels in a house that I don't think was ours, and snow falling over a big mansion at Earlham. My mother is in many of these early memories. I remember her as a small, precise, and often angry woman. I never understood why she was angry, so I couldn't make her happy. Even as a child, when I went with her to the small shops in Bunnett Square or into the city, I knew she was different. She was the most solitary person I have ever known, alone even in a room full of people. She also had strict rules about how to behave, which was unusual in West Earlham. This sometimes led to big cleanings or telling me to 'behave properly'. I didn't understand these rules. It meant not going into neighbors' gardens or touching their rose bushes, sitting quietly in the dining room with hands folded, listening to radio programs my mother liked, and many other rules. Over time, other people appeared in these early memories. My mother had some friends. There was Mrs. Buddery, who loved the Royal Family, Mrs. Winall, who said very little, and Mrs. Laband, who was more lively and not liked by the others. Later, I realized they were not very cheerful company. They talked about bad legs, cold weather, and ungrateful children, a group I often felt I was in. Looking back, it felt like a heavy weight of the West Earlham houses, my mother and her friends, and the need to 'behave properly' was on my shoulders. I felt I had to grow up and get free from it. This was not easy. Growing up in West Earlham had a set pattern. Until you were five, you stayed at home. I remember boring days when I was about four, playing on a rug while my mother sat in a chair. After your fifth birthday, in September, you went to Avenue Road infants school, half a mile away. Some lucky children had a mother with a bike and a child seat. I think my mother let other children take me to school. If I remember anything about these early years, it's the summer holidays. These were days when you saw a bit of the world outside West Earlham. There was an old man next to Mrs. Buddery who told stories about the Merchant Navy. Once, there was a charity event at a house far away, where a kind woman gave out lemonade and talked about the League of Pity, a junior charity. But my mother said they just wanted money. My mother often talked about people wanting money, and she didn't like politicians. She thought they were rich people who took money from the public. Maybe I exaggerate. Maybe I forget her good points and focus on her faults. But my mother didn't have much kindness. To be fair, she did care about my education. Sometimes on Sundays, she took me on the 85 bus to the Norwich Castle Museum. We would look at paintings by the Norwich School of Artists. My mother didn't mind this and even started to have opinions about the paintings. I remember her once looking at a painting of a Roman soldier and saying, 'Well, I wouldn't like to meet him on a dark night!' This was the only time I remember her trying to make a joke.'"
CPE_10,"**Philadelphia Avenue**

I walked down Philadelphia Avenue on the odd-numbered side. It was getting dark, and the air was thick with a light rain. This side of the street was familiar to me since I was a child. Our neighbors were the Matzes and the Pritchards, and there was Han Kieffer's grocery store. My first friends lived in the Kring's and the Pottses' houses. Each house was special to me, just like the little paths in the cement that took rain from the roofs to the street. I used to pass them on my roller skates or scooter. As the street went downhill, the houses seemed a bit less fancy. The porches were lower, and the front yards were smaller. Over the years, things changed: wooden porch railings were replaced with iron ones. In Shillington, some houses became stores, and some stores, like Han Kieffer's, became homes again. I wondered how people lived in those spaces that used to be shops.

**Bachelor Fads**

Rick Gilbert is a furniture designer. He lives in a flat that used to be a curtain warehouse. The flat has big doors and brick walls. Gilbert didn't want an open space because it was hard to relax or work when everything was in one room. So, he used a big plastic sheet to create a hallway and hide his office. This also led to the kitchen, which he wanted to be a place for both cooking and meeting clients. To make the flat feel warm, he used light wood floors and added furniture from his parents and markets.

**Bruce Chatwin**

Bruce Chatwin was a writer who loved to travel. His life was full of secrets and stories. His first book, ""In Patagonia,"" was published in 1977. It was a travel book that felt like a thriller and a romantic story. Chatwin sometimes changed facts to make his stories more interesting. He believed that through travel, people could discover exciting histories.

**Swimming**

One summer, during a heavy rain, I swam in the pool behind my house. The rain made bubbles on the water, and it felt magical. In 1996, I thought about swimming across Britain. I wanted to follow the rain to the sea and escape the routine of swimming back and forth in a pool. Many places today are marked and explained, but activities like walking, cycling, and swimming let us explore the wild and mysterious parts of the world. A swimming journey would help me see the world in a new way."
CPE_67,"Text: 'CRYING Charles Darwin thought that crying had no clear purpose. He was probably wrong. Scientists now say crying is important for social reasons. Psychiatrist John Bowlby said crying helps mothers and children become close. Many people think children cry because they feel helpless. But why do adults cry? It seems that the look of crying is more important than the sound. Crying might have helped early humans build trust and connect with others. Tears can also have other reasons. We might cry to show we care about people who suffer. Sometimes, we cry without wanting to, like when we hear beautiful music or speeches. We might cry during a sad movie, especially when we are with others. Crying seems to have a social purpose, but scientists are still studying it.'"
CPE_27,"**The Heat is On**

We all know about global warming, but how much warmer will the Earth get, and how will it change our lives? Many people have an idea of what global warming is, but no one is sure about its effects. A warmer climate will likely change the weather everywhere. Since the atmosphere is connected to everything on Earth, changes in climate will affect plants, animals, water, and soil. Humans use these natural resources to grow food, build cities, and support billions of people. So, any changes to these resources are important.

The problem is knowing how the world will change and what causes these changes. In the last 100 years, human actions have increased certain gases in the air, which are linked to global temperature. These gases are likely affecting the climate, but we do not fully understand how. We do know that greenhouse gases and global temperatures have changed together over the past 40,000 years, showing they are related. Evidence shows that the Earth's surface has warmed by about 0.6°C in the last century. Most scientists think this is partly due to human pollution.

Scientists use computer programs called general circulation models (GCMs) to predict future climate conditions. These programs use physics and chemistry to study temperature, pressure, and other factors. However, they are not perfect and can be slow and costly. We do not fully understand all climate processes, but we know the climate system is complex. Despite these challenges, most people agree that climate change will happen faster than before.

GCMs suggest that by 2100, the average global temperature will rise by 1°C to 3.5°C, sea levels will rise by 15-95 cm, and rainfall patterns will change. Extreme weather like heatwaves, floods, and droughts may become more common. These changes will affect ecosystems, like forests and grasslands, and the resources we depend on, such as food and water. Some effects may be irreversible and harmful, but not all. Some climate changes might be helpful. For example, in Australia, warmer temperatures have increased wheat production since 1952.

However, many future effects of climate warming are not good. Small climate changes can affect water availability, especially in dry areas. The Mediterranean Basin is already seeing less rain in some parts. Changes in glaciers will affect ice and wildlife habitats. The Arctic ice might melt completely, which could help marine transport but increase iceberg dangers.

The most visible effect of global warming might be rising sea levels. Warmer water takes up more space, and melting ice adds to the ocean. About half of the world's people live near coasts, so rising sea levels could cause severe problems. Cities like London, New York, and Tokyo might face flooding. Many people could lose their homes, creating environmental refugees. Small island countries could disappear if sea levels rise too much, affecting their people and culture."
CPE_66,"Text: 'Mission to Mars Wanted: a middle-aged, married couple for a 501-day trip to Mars and back. Applicants must be strong in body and mind. This will be the profile of the first astronauts to go to Mars if millionaire Dennis Tito's plans to send a capsule on 5 January 2018 work out. The capsule will take the crew to about 160 km above Mars. The spacecraft will use Mars's gravity to return to Earth without using more fuel, because saving fuel is important. The 2018 date is set because the next time Mars and Earth are in the right position is in 2031. It is a big challenge, but the race is on to create new technologies. If these can be ready soon, the spacecraft might succeed. But even if it never leaves Earth, trying to reach these goals will help future missions.'"
CPE_44,"**Aesthetics**

Sometimes, the way we think about art makes it hard to understand. Art is often seen as just a physical object, like a building, book, painting, or statue. But real art is about what these objects do to our experiences. This misunderstanding can make it difficult to truly appreciate art.

Some art pieces are so admired that they become ""classics."" When this happens, they can seem separate from the human experiences that created them and the effects they have on our lives. This separation makes it hard to see their true meaning.

Art is often put in a special place, away from other human activities. This makes it hard to connect art with everyday life. People who study art need to show how art is connected to daily experiences. Just like mountains are part of the earth, art is part of human life.

To understand art, we sometimes need to look away from the art itself and think about everyday experiences. We can enjoy flowers without knowing about plants, but to understand them, we need to learn about soil, air, water, and sunlight. The same goes for art. We need to start with simple experiences that catch our attention and make us happy.

Many people enjoy things like movies, jazz, and comics without thinking of them as art. But these are the arts that are most alive for many people today. When art is only seen in museums, people look for enjoyment in their daily lives. Some people who don't like the idea of art being only in museums still think of art as separate from everyday life.

The best times for art are when it is connected to everyday activities. This is when people appreciate art the most."
CPE_22,"**Observing Lions**

People often think that lions hunt in a very organized way. At sunset, a group of lions quietly moves and surrounds their prey. Lions seem to work well together to catch food. But after many years of watching lions in the wild, we have a different view. We started our research in 1978 to find out why lions hunt together, take care of their cubs, and scare away other animals with loud roars. If an animal's success is measured by how many of its young survive, then working together might not always be good. If an animal is too kind, others might take advantage. So, why do lions work together? We thought we would find the answer in two to three years. But lions are very good at doing nothing. It took many research methods to learn about their behavior. Wild lions can live up to 18 years, so we are only now getting answers to our questions.

**Pop Music Review**

Bedrock's third album was very important for the band. ""New Life"" changed rock music in the country for the next ten years. The old style of music was serious and had loud guitars. The new style was lighter and mixed different sounds. The album had songs about everyday life and feelings. It also had fun and serious songs. The album showed that Bedrock was good at writing songs. They wrote about things like sunbathing and Sunday afternoons. The album's best songs were about deeper feelings, like ""So Low"" and ""To the Brink."" ""New Life"" had 16 great songs with no bad ones, which is rare for long CDs.

**Extract from an Autobiography**

As a child, I loved stories about ""The Sibyl,"" wise women from ancient times. My mother told me a story about one Sibyl. She offered nine books to a king for 300 gold pieces. He said no, so she burned three books and offered six for the same price. He refused again, and she burned three more. He finally bought the last three for 300 gold pieces. I learned a lesson from this story. I was often a lonely child. I wanted to play with other kids, but they said no. My mother told me to do something interesting so others would want to join me. It worked, and I never forgot this lesson. When I had the chance to write a travel book, I looked for something I cared about. I don't like traveling much, so I sent my editor a list of places I didn't want to go. I like to learn about ruins because I enjoy thinking about the past.

**What Becomes of Your Manuscript?**

When you send your manuscript, it goes into a big pile called the ""slush pile."" A junior editor or an experienced person who works part-time will look at it. They want to find something new and interesting. If they like your novel, they will give it to a senior editor. Then, it will be discussed in a meeting. The editor must explain why your novel is good and if it can sell well. They also want to know if you can be a successful author. Publishers often want to meet you before they decide to publish your book."
CPE_39,"**Advertising in the Early 1990s**

If you worked in advertising in the early 1990s, it was a tough time. The economy was bad, and the recession was worse than expected. In Britain, in 1991, the economy shrank, interest rates were high, people spent less money, many lost their jobs, and many homes were taken back by banks. Every business was affected, especially car and building companies, which lost 30% of their business.

People in advertising were not the only ones losing jobs, but those who kept their jobs felt a lot of pressure. They had to help their companies make money with smaller budgets. They were told to do more with less money. At the same time, marketing became more important. Companies started to focus on making products that customers wanted, not just what was easy to make. This made marketing more respected but also more challenging.

In the 1980s, advertising was very successful, but the 1990s started with a big downturn. This was partly because of the bad economy, but also because companies started to question the value of advertising. They wanted to know exactly what they were getting for their money. Advertising was under more scrutiny than ever before.

Companies wanted better strategies, targeting, creativity, and media placement from advertising agencies. They wanted the best people working hard for them. This meant that people in advertising had to find ways to do more with less, just like their clients.

Other challenges made advertising difficult, like changes in population, the power of retailers, changing consumer needs, more sponsorships, and stricter advertising laws. Some companies also had to learn how to advertise in other countries.

Because of these challenges, people in advertising had to figure out which parts of their work were effective. Help was hard to find because companies and agencies were busy dealing with these problems. Successful companies often kept their strategies secret. Books and seminars on advertising were not very helpful because they often made advertising seem easier and more successful than it really was."
CPE_18,"**The Lure of the Kitchen**

When I was at university, I wanted to be a chef. This was not a common choice among my friends. Cooking was not a popular job. Chefs work long hours, have a lot of pressure, and do not earn much money. But I still wanted to be a chef. I was not happy at university. The work was hard, and the social life was not fun. Being a chef seemed like a good change. It felt serious and honest, unlike my college life. I also loved the idea of cooking. I first felt this when I ate at a famous restaurant in London. The meal was amazing. I wanted to thank the chef who made it. After that, I wanted to learn how to cook like that. I started reading cookbooks, visiting markets, and making big meals.

**The Swimming Instructor**

The school's swimming teacher was a small, strong man with tattoos. He used to be a drill sergeant. I asked him to teach me how to dive. He told me to sit on the pool's edge, put my hands above my head, and roll forward. I practiced this for an hour. Next time, he had me stand and dive off the edge. He was very strict. He always told me to look up and keep my legs straight. The next week, I went to the high diving board. It looked very high. I was scared but tried to be brave. I jumped and felt like I was flying. When I hit the water, my dive was not good. The instructor was not happy, but I felt great. I thought, ""This is what it means to be free as a bird.""

**The Traveller**

For people who like comfort, travelers seem strange. Travelers choose to take risks. They climb dangerous mountains, sail alone in big seas, and eat strange food. They live with the unknown. Some people think travelers are odd. They are different from our everyday life. We like our safe world with microwaves and phones. We think travelers are not important. We are happy with our predictable lives.

**Sailing**

Jonathan Raban is afraid of the sea, but he spends a lot of time on it. He is not the best sailor, but he is good. He sails because he likes to write about it. Sailing gives him stories to tell. His boat has a device that shows his exact location. He likes this device, but he thinks other sea tools are not good. He believes the compass changed how people see the sea. Before the compass, sailors watched the waves and felt the sea. Now, they just follow the compass. The sea is now just a space to cross. Raban thinks this is why he can look at the waves so closely."
CPE_62,"**Holiday Reading**

Summer gives us two great joys: leaving home and reading books. These joys are connected. Books help us feel more at home in the world. We can see our own experiences in stories from long ago or far away. In books, we find our own thoughts and feelings. Authors can describe situations we thought only we felt. They express our thoughts clearly. We feel thankful to these writers for helping us understand ourselves. Reading and travel help us escape our daily routine. Our eyes are open when we visit a new place or read a great book. We notice things we ignored before, like the sky, a friend's actions, or a hidden sadness.

**Author's Note**

These travel stories were first in the Observer newspaper over seven years. I made small changes to some parts, but not much. I fixed a few mistakes, but only small details. I did not change the stories to predict the future. For example, in a story about China, I thought the Hong Kong dollar would stay strong, but it fell later. I wrote the story as it happened, not knowing the future. This is the story of travel: seeing the world with just a ticket. I believe other travelers notice things too. Even a postcard can have a purpose.

**Ecotourism**

The word 'ecotourism' is often misused. It started in the 1980s when people became more aware of the environment. Travelers wanted to know their trips did not harm nature. It became a popular term for holidays. Now, 'ecotourism' can mean many things, like living with tribes or a short boat trip. It includes cultural, natural, or adventure tours. The original idea was to help people make good choices, but without clear rules, travelers can be confused.

**Transylvanian Journey**

I lost my notebook from my trip to Transylvania for 50 years. I found it again by luck. It helped me remember that time, but I did not write much then. I stayed in friendly homes for weeks and stopped writing. I thought there was nothing to write about when I was not moving. When I started writing this book, I worried about the order of events. But then I decided it was okay, so I let the story tell itself."
CPE_49,"**Fashion**

Fashion is not just a modern thing. Many people think it started with the business growth in the 1800s and 1900s. But, fashion has been around for a long time. Historians say it began in the 1500s and 1600s when trade and markets grew. As societies became more complex, and more types of clothes were made, the meanings of clothes also became more complex. Today, it is hard to say exactly what any piece of clothing means. For example, a man's suit can mean different things to different people and in different situations.

**Writer**

People often think that all writers are rich and famous because of stories about big book deals. But for most writers, life is different. Many writers have other jobs during the day and write in the evenings. Some, like me, do different small jobs, like teaching or writing articles, to make money. I have heard about a job writing for a chocolate factory, but I never got such a chance. Still, by doing part-time jobs and with help from friends, I manage to write my books.

**Sudden Fame**

Our small shows around the country started to sell out, and we needed more security to handle the excited fans. We had to use secret ways to enter the places we played to avoid being surrounded by fans. On our days off, it was hard to go out without being followed by fans. In just a few days, we became famous. Our fans watched our every move, and our management took care of everything we needed. Even though I was always shy, I started to feel strangely confident, which is something only shy people who suddenly become famous might understand. In short, I felt overwhelmed."
CPE_31,"**Music and the Future**

Technology is changing our lives at work, home, and in our free time. Susan Hallam talks about how this affects music in Britain. In the late 20th century, we had more ways to listen to music, like radio, TV, records, tapes, CDs, and videos. But, there are fewer live music shows and jobs for musicians. More people can listen to music now, and this will probably continue because music is important to us. Music is part of big events and personal activities. A world without music is hard to imagine. The question is not if there will be music in the future, but what kind of music it will be and if people will still want to learn instruments.

The music industry makes a lot of money in Britain. Musical skills will still be important for jobs, especially in media. Playing an instrument can also help develop skills early on. Research in the USA shows that music can improve thinking skills. In Europe, group music lessons help children with social skills and focus. Playing an instrument might also help with skills like studying and being organized.

In the future, people will listen to more types of music. New styles will mix different kinds of music. Technology will help people compose and play music, making it easier for everyone to create music. This might mean fewer live performances. More people of all ages will want to make music together in their communities.

To prepare for this future, music teaching needs to change. More people should be able to learn different instruments throughout their lives. Music lessons and tests will need to change to stay relevant. Musicians will need to learn how to teach and inspire people of all ages and work with different groups. They will also need skills in communication and management for community work. This is a big change from the past, but it is a chance to show the quality of music education.

Finally, we need to make music more important in our lives. Music is crucial, but often not appreciated enough. Everyone in the music profession should work together to change this."
CPE_58,"**The Actor's Craft**

Sometimes, people make fun of actors. This happens because actors often talk about their work in interviews. They should be like the dancer Pavlova, who said, ""If I could tell you, I wouldn't dance it."" But instead, actors often use boring phrases or talk about gossip. Paul Scofield, a famous actor, once said that acting is interesting only when you do it. Talking about it makes it seem empty. Every time an actor starts a new play, they learn everything again. When the play ends, they feel empty until the next one. This emptiness is clear when people talk about acting.

**A Review of Hamlet**

Adrian Lester plays Hamlet as a young man between boyhood and manhood. His performance is simple and confident. He understands the text well and controls his body and mind. Lester plays Hamlet as a young man full of anger but also funny and lovable. His performance is very skillful. Watch how he moves his body, like he is waiting to come alive. Handy, who plays Horatio, also shows this feeling. Acting makes us ask: What is acting? What is behavior? Is acting copying real life or creating something new? Who controls the actors' bodies and minds? This is a big question in theatre.

**One Director's Approach to Rehearsal**

This director starts rehearsals with a method called ""dropping in."" The stage manager shows the script on a screen. Actors sit quietly and listen. When it's their turn, they read the line, think about its meaning, and wait for the right moment to speak. For example, if the line is ""Queuing all night, the rain, do you remember?"" they breathe, imagine the scene, and then speak. The director says not to plan too much. Go with an open mind and trust that something will happen.

**The Perfect Theatre**

The perfect theatre makes you feel like your presence matters. Going to the theatre is special, and the staff should feel this too. The theatre should connect the performer and the audience. Everyone should see and hear well. The size of the theatre is important. It should fit the human voice and body. Many old theatres did this well. They feel like they have a history, like old church steps. You can't please everyone with a play. People don't know what they want to see until they see it. When you go to the theatre, you want to see something surprising. Otherwise, you could just stay home."
CPE_37,"Text: 'Paul Simon Rock and roll in the 1950s was mainly for young people, but it was also important for older people. It changed the middle class and middle-aged people a lot. It also helped create new rock stars. These new stars listened to rock and roll and knew it would be a big part of their lives. For Paul Simon and other young people in the US, the best way to hear this exciting new music was on Alan Freed's radio show, Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party. Freed's show was very popular with young people who wanted to be rock stars. Like young John Lennon in Liverpool, who listened to Radio Luxembourg to hear rock and roll, Paul Simon loved the music on Freed's show. He was ready to go from listening to music to making his own music. Snow I could not see a path, but I thought I would be okay if I was careful. The wind was strong and pushed me down as I slipped on the ice. Suddenly, the snow under me broke. I fell into a hole about four feet deep. The snow had made a roof over a gap between two rocks. I climbed out, feeling scared and thinking about what I would do if the hole was deeper. I sat against a pine tree sticking out of the snow to think. In one hour, I had walked about half a mile. I knew I had to change my plan. Qualitative Research There are many books that try to help researchers with qualitative research. These books talk a lot about collecting data, but not much about how to analyze it. Many people do not know how researchers look at their data. So, we asked different social scientists to talk about how they analyze data. The idea was to share how they do it, not to make a guidebook. This means making hidden steps more clear. This sounds easy, but it is not. We let our contributors show their work in different ways, like personal stories or more formal writing.'"
CPE_2,"**Screen Learning**

A few days ago, I saw my six-year-old eating noodles in a funny way. He was pulling them up with his teeth and trying to look fierce. ""I'm a little dinosaur,"" he said. He was acting like a scene from a TV show. I asked him what he remembered about dinosaurs. He didn't remember much. Many people like learning on the internet and computers, but is it a good way to learn? One writer tried an interactive program with his son. The father read the words, but the son played with the pictures. ""If he had spent ten minutes with a book, he might have learned something,"" said the father. TV, like my son and his noodles show, gives ideas but not much detail. Research says learning happens best when talking with teachers or parents. New technology can help teach children, but formal education is still important.

**Hollywood**

By 1918, most of the world's film-making moved to Hollywood. Locals didn't like it, seeing their area of Los Angeles changed by new people. But in the end, success was more important. Success in Hollywood means making money from movies. Hollywood knows a good film when it sees one: it might make a star, but it must make money. In less than 100 years, Hollywood grew from a small village to a famous town like New York, Rome, or Paris. A century ago, you would walk through orange groves to the village store. Now, it is still like a village with one main topic: films. People talk about how much money films make, who is dating whom, and who is working on which project. Successful people often try to live somewhere else but work in Hollywood. It is still the place where many people in show-business want to be.

**Photography**

Photography was invented in the 1800s by artists. They wanted to keep a lasting record of what they saw. They found a way to make images that were more real and detailed than paintings. This worried other artists. At first, art critics liked the new images, but then they said photography was not art. They thought it was too mechanical. But photographers knew they had found a new art form. They used cameras like other artists use brushes and pencils. They wanted to show the world and its beauty, as well as people and things in it.

**Book Illustration**

In the past, every children's book had illustrations. This was also true for many novels for older readers. But as time went on, there were fewer illustrations because books were printed in smaller numbers. Children's publishing was busy, but it was often done with low budgets. This led to some average work, but the best artists always did their best. The black-and-white illustrations from this time are a mix of good and bad work. They are interesting for research or just looking. The best works will be shown again, either in new books or exhibitions. There are signs that people are starting to appreciate these illustrations again. Soon, a publisher might make a series of classic children's book illustrations from this time."
CPE_68,"**Blogging: Sharing with the World**

Some time ago, a website talked about the dangers of telling everyone online where you are. The website's message was clear: when you say, ""Hey, I'm at this place,"" you are also telling everyone, even people you don't know, that you are not at home. This made people think about the problems of sharing too much online. The internet lets us share everything about our lives with many people. This can be exciting because it might bring us money or fame. So, we start sharing our secrets, photos, and stories online. But soon, we realize that the internet can be a dangerous place, and we can get lost in it.

This might sound sad, but don't worry. There is hope. A long time ago, some brave people started sharing their lives online. They learned about the dangers before social media existed. These people, the first bloggers, experienced many things that we are now facing. We can learn from their stories.

In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started posting on the web. Back then, the web was mostly used by students and scientists. Hall saw it as a chance to share his life. He created a website full of his personal stories, photos, and art. In 1996, he started a daily blog, and many people read about his life. Hall shared everything, and nothing was off-limits. But one day, his website disappeared, and there was only a sad video called ""Dark Night."" Hall had fallen in love, but his partner said, ""Either the blog goes, or I do."" Hall realized that sharing too much online made people not trust him. He stopped blogging, but the problem of sharing too much online is still here.

In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a young woman in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job. One day, a coworker sent her blog to the bosses, and she lost her job. This is called the ""online distribution effect."" It means we feel we can say things online that we wouldn't say in person. But our online and real lives are connected. If we forget this, we can make big mistakes.

Armstrong's story ended well. She stopped blogging for a while but later started again, writing about her family. Now, she is a famous ""mommy blogger,"" and her blog helps support her family. Armstrong learned an important lesson: just because we can say anything online doesn't mean we should."
CPE_23,"Text: 'Enough Sleep? Many people today feel tired all the time. In busy and rich countries, more people have trouble sleeping and feel anxious. In the USA, research shows that 40 million people have serious sleep problems. In Britain, some popular books talk about people who can't sleep or about sleep research labs. People are interested in sleep: how it works, why we need it, and what happens when we can't sleep. A sleep expert says, 'People need more sleep. They sleep less when they are busy and wake up early to avoid traffic.' 

A sleep researcher did an experiment. He let people sleep up to 14 hours a night for a month. It took them three weeks to sleep about eight hours a night. This shows they needed more sleep. In Europe, a university in the English Midlands studies sleep. They look at how tiredness affects sailors, how airport noise affects sleep, and how dangerous it is to drive when tired. They find people to study by advertising in student newspapers. These people are paid and asked to change their sleep patterns. Dr. Louise Reyner says some people worry because they put electrodes on their heads, but they only study physical things.

In a dark room, there is a driving simulator. People come at 2 pm, after little or no sleep. They drive while answering questions. The road on the screen goes on and on, and the room is warm. Many say they won't fall asleep, but Dr. Reyner has a video of one person trying not to. At first, he is awake, but then he starts to blink and nod off. The car goes off the road. Coffee can help. Dr. Reyner says two cups can make you a safe driver for a short time. She suggests using tablets, energy drinks, and caffeinated gum, especially for people who work at night.

We know some things about sleep. Humans sleep in cycles like other animals. There are four stages of sleep, from light to deep. We dream in the lightest sleep, and the brain stops the body from moving to prevent injury. Scientists think women sleep half an hour more than men, and older people need less sleep, but they don't know why. Some researchers say sleep helps us 'travel through time without injury.'

In the past, people had different sleep patterns. A professor found that between 1500 and 1850 in Britain, people went to bed early, woke up after midnight, stayed awake for an hour, and then slept again. This time was used for thinking, remembering dreams, or even stealing. The poor liked this quiet time. By the 17th century, with more artificial light, the rich started sleeping like we do now. The industrial revolution made people work longer hours, changing sleep patterns. In some places outside Europe and America, people still sleep in short periods. They wake up to watch for danger or take care of the fire. It seems people everywhere need more sleep.'"
CPE_60,"**Text for A2 Level:**

I was wearing very expensive cowboy boots in the Arizona desert. I had a full cowboy outfit, but I was not a real cowboy. I looked at the Arizona mountains and knew I did not belong there. I flew from Denver early in the morning and thought I might look like a cowboy. But when I saw a real cowboy at the Phoenix airport, I knew I was not one. He wore an old T-shirt, needed a shave, and carried a dirty bag. He looked at my new boots and walked away.

I used to be a racing driver, and I loved it. But I don't race anymore. I don't know what to do now. I thought I could talk about races on TV, but many other drivers want to do that too. I also tried to sell old cars, but nobody was buying them. Being an ""ex"" racing driver is hard. People don't want to hear about how I almost became a champion. Even if I was a champion, people would only listen for a short time.

I miss racing cars. I miss the speed and the excitement. I miss being famous. People used to want my autograph. Now, I have a lot of free time. I looked at the sky and saw some birds. They seemed to tell me to leave their home. I realized I have a lot to learn."
CPE_1,"**Vancouver**

In the last ten years, many people from all over the world have moved to Vancouver, in western Canada. In the evening, people walk down the city streets, and if you join them, you will hear many different languages. People come to Vancouver for its mild weather, beautiful location between the ocean and the mountains, clean and safe environment, and good schools and jobs. Some people complain about the many new buildings, but the new people and tourists have helped the city grow. People used to call Vancouver 'Terminal City' because it was a gateway to other places. Now, Vancouver is more of a gateway than ever.

**Writing Letters**

Journalists like me are usually not good at writing letters. Some say it's because we don't like writing for free, but I don't think that's true. It's more likely because we try hard to make our writing have a big impact, so writing a simple letter is difficult for us. Real artists, who don't think about the effect of their words, don't have this problem. I think a real artist knows how to use words well. When Shakespeare wrote his famous lines, he probably didn't think about why they were so good, but they showed he was a great writer.

**Supermarket Opening**

In the past, opening a new supermarket in Britain was a big event. A soap star, a disc jockey, or a minor royal would come to cut the ribbon. Now, new supermarkets open so often that they don't need famous people. Last week, people waiting to enter a new Superbuy didn't care who opened it, as long as they were first in line. The first five men would get a bottle of aftershave, and the first five women would get flowers. This news spread quickly, making those at the front feel happy and those who came late feel jealous."
CPE_53,"**Citizen Kane**

The film *Citizen Kane* came out in 1941. There was a lot of talk about it before its release because people were worried about William Randolph Hearst, who the film was said to be about. Even though the reviews were very good, the film did not make much money at first. It was television that made it popular again. *Citizen Kane* is a film that has inspired many people to become filmmakers. This is surprising because it was Orson Welles's first film. Welles said he succeeded because he didn't know what he could or couldn't do, so he just did what he wanted. He had a great team, including cameraman Gregg Toland, screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, and special-effects expert Linwood Dunn. Welles and Mankiewicz decided to make a film about a newspaper owner who was like Hearst. Welles saw this as a great chance for himself as both director and actor.

**Dermot and Carmel**

Dermot thought Carmel was acting a bit strange that morning. He told her twice that he might be late and not to worry if he stopped at the golf club on his way home. He needed to talk to someone, and the golf club was the best place for it. Carmel nodded her head but seemed like she didn't really hear or understand. Dermot asked, ""Will you be all right? What are you going to do today?"" Carmel smiled and said, ""Funny you should ask that. I was just thinking I had nothing to do all day, so I was going to walk downtown and look at the shops. I thought it was almost a sinful thing, just wasting the day."" Dermot smiled back and said, ""You're allowed to enjoy yourself. And if I'm late, I won't need anything to eat. So don't worry about it."" Carmel replied, ""No, that's fine.""

**Title Race**

A recent study showed that job titles can cause jealousy and problems at work. A survey by a big recruitment company found that 90% of employers and 70% of employees agree that titles create divisions among colleagues. Surprisingly, the survey found that 70% of office workers would give up a pay raise for a more 'motivational' or 'professional' job title. It seems that people care more about their job titles than money. Today, nobody wants to be called a subordinate. The titles focus on skills (like specialist or coordinator) but are really just nicer ways to say the same thing."
CPE_55,"Text: 'The Vienna Assignment I was in Vienna to take photos. That was usually why I was anywhere. Photos were more than my job. They were part of my life. The way light touched a surface always excited me. One picture, one snapshot, could show the essence of a time and place, a city, a person. I always hoped to take the perfect photo. As long as I had film in my camera, there was a chance. Finish one roll, load another, and keep looking. That was my way. It had been for a long time. I almost succeeded once, when a photo of a smoke plume from a burning oil well became popular in newspapers and magazines worldwide. It was just luck. But they say you make your own luck - both good and bad. I went freelance after that, which seemed smart, but life outside photography took some wrong turns. The mid-nineties weren't as successful as I thought they would be when my photo was on the cover of Time magazine. That's why I was in Vienna, not somewhere more newsworthy. But I was still taking photos and getting paid. That was fine with me. The assignment was a bit of luck. I did the London photos for a picture book: Four Cities in Four Seasons - London, Paris, Rome, Vienna. It was a European project that paid me well to take photos in my home city in spring, summer, autumn, and winter. I gave my own view of daffodils in Hyde Park and traffic in Piccadilly. I accepted that the best of my work might be ignored. It was just a picture book. It wasn't meant to change anyone's views. After a cold Christmas and New Year, I handed in my London-in-winter photos and learned that the Austrian photographer, Rudi Schussner, had left the Vienna job. They offered me the role instead. The Austrian publishers liked my work. Also, I was available, unlike the French and Italian photographers. I was happy to go. Things at home weren't great. A week in snowy Vienna was a good escape. They put me up at the Europa, in the heart of the old city. I had last been to Vienna with my wife for a busy summer weekend. It was hot and not very memorable. I hadn't taken many photos. Alone, in a cold January, it would be different. I knew it when I got off the bus from the airport and saw the city. I was going to enjoy myself and take great photos. The first day, I didn't even try. I rode the trams around the Ringstrasse, getting on and off to feel the city's mood. The weather was set, frozen like the old empire's buildings. I hadn't seen what Schussner did with other seasons. I didn't want to. This was going to be my Vienna. A photo is a moment. But you have to wait for the moment. So I waited and looked until I could see clearly. Then I was ready. The next morning, I was out at dawn. Snow overnight meant Stephansplatz would be white and empty. I hadn't figured out how to capture the cathedral in one shot. Its spire was tall, but at the bottom, it was huge. Probably there was no way to do it. I'd have to settle for part of it. In that weather, it could still be magical. Photography has always been magical. In the 19th century, people thought it was magic before they understood the chemistry. Pictures develop and become strong on their own. You can watch a blank paper become a photo. Even when you know why it happens, it still feels mysterious. That feeling stays with you forever. Maybe that's why what happened at Stephansplatz that morning didn't surprise me.'"
CPE_50,"**Kinetic Art Exhibition**

Something amazing has happened at London's Hayward Gallery. It has become a place full of wonder. This change is not because of a big, expensive show, but because of a special exhibition about kinetic art. Kinetic art is art that moves or shows movement. This exhibition looks at the history of kinetic art in the 20th century. It shows that making art that moves has been an important but often unnoticed part of art in the last 60 years. The exhibition has many paintings, drawings, documents, and films about kinetic art. Guy Brett, who has studied this art for a long time, put it all together. There are not many explanations, so visitors can enjoy discovering things on their own.

**David Hockney**

David Hockney's art is liked by many people, even those who usually do not care about art. People might like his work because it is easy to understand or because it shows fun and relaxing subjects. Some people might be interested in Hockney because of his friendly personality and clever words in the media. Some critics think Hockney is not a great artist. But others say he might seem less important because he is very popular, not because his work is not good. Hockney knows his limits and does not claim to be a great artist. He believes only time will tell how important his art is.

**Window-shopping - An Art Exhibition**

I have seen many contemporary art exhibitions. Some are great, and some are not. I do not like shows that try to push a certain idea or trend. Sometimes it works, but often it feels forced. As a curator, I wanted to create a show that was different. I worked with seven artists in an empty warehouse. The show, called 'Window-shopping,' was a collection of different artworks. The only thing they had in common was that they were all art. For example, Sam Cole's knitted cats moved around on a toy train track. Matthew Crawley opened a video camera and broke it, which showed on a screen. These works did not fit into a theme, but they worked well together. I did not try to make a big statement about art, but I think art is personal, and artists decide what they want to do.

**Art History**

People who like paintings sometimes do not want to analyze them. They think it might ruin their enjoyment. Some say art historians focus too much on theory and forget the pleasure of looking at art. This is like saying knowing how a dish is made ruins its taste. But knowing more about art can make it more enjoyable. Our enjoyment of art is not just about our personal taste. It is also influenced by the society we live in. While enjoying art is important, thinking about it does not take away from the experience. In the past, people thought art was separate from thinking, but this idea is outdated."
CPE_25,"**Metals**

A long time ago, people in the Stone Age might have found metals because they wanted to look nice. Imagine sitting by a river, waiting to catch a fish, and finding a shiny yellow stone. This stone was gold. It was not like other stones, and it was very pretty. Gold was easy to shape, so people liked it a lot. Copper might have been found by accident too. When people saw how useful copper tools were, they looked for more copper and learned how to get it from rocks. This is how metalworking started.

**St Ives**

We walked down a small, winding street with our bags. The wind was very strong, and the waves were cold and big. No one was outside, and the windows of the houses were closed tight. We saw the weather get worse as we arrived in St Ives on a small train. The sky was dark, and visiting Cornwall without a car did not seem like a good idea anymore. I told my friend we would have nice walks by the sea and warm evenings by the fire.

**Computer Modelling**

Studying the past is hard because it is gone. The people who lived in peace or had hard times are not here anymore. We do not know why they moved or stayed in one place. Archaeology gives us some clues, but we cannot test our ideas on past cultures. We cannot watch the past like a movie. But maybe we can. With computer modelling, we can make old landscapes and put virtual people in them. These digital people can act like real people. We can change things like rain or population and see how these virtual people react."
CPE_34,"**Vervet Monkeys**

Cheney and Seyfarth studied vervet monkeys. One day, the leader male monkey saw a new male monkey in nearby trees. The new monkey wanted to join the group. If he joined, the leader might lose his position. To stop this, the leader monkey had a clever idea. When the new monkey tried to come closer, the leader made a loud call that means a leopard is near. The new monkey quickly went back to his trees. This happened many times. But then, the leader made a mistake. He made the leopard call while he was walking calmly on the ground.

**What Cats Catch**

In a village in England, people counted what their cats caught. In one year, 70 cats caught over 1,000 animals. An American professor saw this and thought all cats in Britain might catch 100 million birds and small animals each year. But this is not true. Most cats live in towns and catch fewer animals. The important question is: are these numbers too high? The answer seems to be no. In winter, people feed birds, and gardens have places for birds to live. So, the bird population stays high. The survey showed cats are hunters, but they are not destroying the bird population in Britain.

**Buffalo's Day**

Buffaloes are very important to marsh people. Every morning, buffaloes leave their sleeping place slowly. They make tired sounds as they move to the reed beds. They stand at the edge of the platform, making noises about the hard day ahead. Finally, the leader buffalo moves into the water. In the water, they seem to forget their plan and stay there for a while. Slowly, they start swimming, looking very tired. They spend the day in the reeds, eating green plants they find.

**Picasso's Painting**

In 1940, Picasso painted fish while staying in a fishing port. The painting shows a fish seller's table with a crab and some fish. The fish look alive. The painting is hard to understand because Picasso used flat shapes and soft colors. It looks like an underwater world. But there is tension in the painting. The fish and crab seem ready to fight. The sharp shapes and a chain around a fish add to this feeling. There is a hidden sense of danger in the picture."
CPE_12,"Photography

For the last 150 years, photography has been used to capture all parts of human life. In this short time, photography has grown to show moments in time and space, letting us see both big and small things. It has shown us pictures from faraway places on Earth and in space, as well as the complex and difficult parts of modern life. Photography is a powerful way to show human experiences.

However, using pictures to record events is much older. The first pictures go back to about 35,000 years ago. We do not know exactly why early humans made cave paintings. They might have shown real events, helped with hunting, been religious symbols, or just made life more colorful. But pictures have always been important to human culture.

People have always wondered if pictures show the truth and what their role in society is. The idea that ""seeing is believing"" gave pictures a special place. When photography was invented in the mid-1800s, it seemed to promise a true visual record. The camera, like the human eye, was seen as a tool that could capture a real image. This image was thought to be very close to what we see.

Photography was seen as a great cultural achievement, creating images that artists had worked hard to make by hand. Because photos seemed so real, people thought everyone could understand them. This led to the idea that photography might be a ""universal language."" In 1933, photographer August Sander said even isolated people could understand a photo of the sky.

But as global communication grew in the late 1900s, we had to ask if photos could be understood across different cultures. Is photography limited by cultural rules like language? Are we so used to photos that we forget how complex they are in showing ""reality""?

Photography is often seen as clear evidence, making it seem like there is no difference between real life and photos. It is common for someone to show a photo and say, ""this is my grandson.""

Since its invention in 1839, photography and how people use it have changed a lot. Photography has moved from just keeping records to becoming historical documents. Photos now tell us about the people and society that made them, not just the subjects in the photos.

The camera is not just a silent recorder of events. Photography can inspire social and political change. For example, the Italian Renaissance in the 1400s used new ways of showing images. Similarly, photography has helped create our media culture and also shows the world's harsh realities."
CPE_26,"**How to Write Poetry**

Writing poetry can be tricky. It's like walking through a field with hidden dangers. You need to be spontaneous, but one wrong move can cause problems. It's hard to give advice because everyone is different. The best way to learn is by reading a lot, writing often, and using your imagination. Some people need to feel safe to write, while others write when they are sad. Some write on a schedule, and others wait for inspiration. All ways are good if you are true to yourself. It's important to find your own voice and let it grow.

**The Short Story**

In a short story, you can't have too many characters or long descriptions. Flashbacks should be short and only used if necessary. A character's memory can help move the story forward. Dialogue, or conversation between characters, is useful because it shows different sides of a story quickly. It keeps the reader interested. A short story should not be too long, but it should still have conflict and action. Every word should be important.

**Screenplays**

Writing a screenplay is like playing chess. At first, you might not know what will happen next. You learn by playing more. In chess, you need a long-term plan, not just short moves. Over time, you see the whole game and patterns. Screenplay writing is similar. The more you write, the more you understand its complexity.

**Looking at Writing**

Charles Darwin said that speaking is natural for humans, but writing is not. All societies have language, but writing systems were invented only a few times in history. Writing started in complex societies and improved slowly. In the past, most children didn't learn to read or write. Even today, many children find it hard. Children naturally learn to speak, but writing is something they must learn with effort. We need to understand how writing works and how children learn it."
CPE_8,"I have never started a book with more doubt. I call it a novel because I don't know what else to call it. I have a small story to tell, and I don't end with a death or a marriage. Instead, I leave my reader wondering. This book is about my memories of a man I met only sometimes, and I don't know much about what happened to him in between. I could make up things to fill the gaps and make my story clearer, but I don't want to do that. I only want to write what I know. To avoid embarrassing people who are still alive, I have given the people in this story made-up names, and I have tried to make sure no one can recognize them. The man I am writing about is not famous. Maybe he never will be. When his life ends, he might leave no more trace than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the water. Then my book, if read at all, will be read only for its own interest. But maybe his way of life and his strong and kind character will influence others, so that, long after his death, people will realize he was a remarkable person. Then it will be clear who I am writing about, and those who want to know about his early life may find something useful in my book. I think my book, with its limits, will be a good source of information for my friend's biographers. I do not claim that the conversations I have written are exact. I never took notes of what was said, but I have a good memory for what matters to me, and though I have put these conversations in my own words, they truly represent what was said. I said earlier that I have invented nothing, but I have taken the freedom that historians take to put words in the mouths of people in my story that I did not hear myself. I have done this to make the scenes lively and realistic. I want to be read, and I think I am right to make my book interesting. The smart reader will see where I have used this trick, and he can choose to ignore it. Another reason I started this work with worry is that the people I write about are from another culture. It is very hard to know people, and I don't think you can really know anyone but your own countrymen. People are not only themselves; they are also the place they were born, the home they grew up in, the games they played as children, the food they ate, the schools they went to, the sports they played, and the poets they read. All these things make them who they are, and you can't know them just by hearing about them; you can only know them if you have lived them. You can only know if you are them. And because you cannot know people from another country except by watching them, it is hard to make them believable in a book. I have never tried to write about anyone but my own countrymen, and if I have done so in short stories, it is because you can describe your characters briefly. You give the reader a general idea and let him imagine the details. In this book, I do not pretend that my characters are as they see themselves; they are seen, like my main character, through my own eyes."
CPE_4,"**Poetry Recitals**

Today, poetry can be confusing because there are many different styles and ideas about poetry. Some poets write poems to be read in books, while others like to perform their poems in front of people. This has been happening more and more over the last twenty years. 

In small towns, people gather in village halls or homes to listen to poetry. Schools and colleges invite poets to read to students. Arts festivals also have poetry readings by famous poets. 

For poets who like to perform, these events are good. Their poems are simple and easy to understand when heard. But, when you read them on paper, they might not seem as good. 

Poets who focus on writing carefully crafted poems might not be appreciated by people hearing them for the first time. They might choose to read their simpler poems to connect with the audience quickly. 

Listening to poetry is fun and helpful, but it is not the same as reading it. Hearing a poet read their work can show you how to understand it better. It is good if the audience can read along or know the poems beforehand. 

The main reason for poetry recitals is to make people enjoy poetry and not see it as something only for experts. Sometimes, these events include music, like jazz, to make them more enjoyable."
CPE_30,"**Oral History**

Historians are using more oral evidence, but it has problems. It is not simple to think that someone's story is a clear picture of the past. In an interview, both the historian and the person telling the story affect each other. The historian chooses who to talk to and what to talk about. Even if the historian just listens, their presence changes how the person remembers and talks about the past. The final story is influenced by the historian's position and how they understand history. Historians help create new evidence. The person telling the story is also not directly connected to the past. Their memories can be mixed with other things they have heard, like from TV. They might remember the past as better than it was or feel upset about things that happened later. Feelings make the story seem real, but they might come from later events, not the past.

**Animal Science**

There are two main ways to study animal science: looking at how the body works and looking at the whole animal. Physiologists study how nerves, muscles, and senses work together for behavior. The 'whole animal' approach looks at the behavior of the entire animal and what affects it. Within this approach, psychologists and ethologists are different. Psychologists study learning in animals like rats and pigeons in labs. Ethologists study natural behavior in wild animals. These two groups are now working more together. Physiologists think their methods are more basic. But even if we know how every nerve cell works, we still need to study behavior as a whole. Behavior has its own structure that we must understand. Describing a bird's nest-building by nerve cells is like trying to read a book with a microscope.

**The Social Sciences**

Students studying social science for the first time face a challenge. They need to learn the content of the subject and the methods used to study it. They must know the facts and how these facts are found and organized. Social sciences are not just common sense. Each social science looks at a different part of social life, uses different study methods, and has its own ideas. These ideas help social scientists go beyond common sense and make each discipline unique.

**Classical Architecture**

In Ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was more than just building. The Roman architect Vitruvius said architecture is about order, arrangement, proportion, symmetry, propriety, and distribution. He used Greek words for some of these ideas, which came from an earlier Greek source. Utility and function are not part of his definition, but he does talk about the best forms for different buildings. The focus is on architecture as an art. Classical architecture has complex origins. There was a long history of simple huts in Greece and Italy that did not meet Vitruvius' artistic standards. These simple forms were important and influenced later architecture. The classical temple, though fancy outside, is basically a simple, single-room hut."
CPE_7,"**Simplified Text:**

The two sisters, Lily and Mui, kept Lily's driving a secret from Chen for a while. Lily would drive around the allotments, near the railway line and gasworks. She once made a mistake by jumping a small bridge with all four wheels in the air, but Chen found it funny when he found out. He was happy and said, ""So you can really drive, Lily? Well done!"" Mui thought men were strange because Chen wasn't upset. Instead, he was excited and planned a trip with Lily. They chose a Monday at the start of next month, the quietest day of the week, to leave early and return by midday, so they wouldn't lose customers. Lily practiced driving around the allotments in the meantime. Mui, despite her worries, bought a road map and got a ten percent discount, which impressed Chen. Lily felt a bit hurt by Mui's lack of trust in her driving skills.

On the day of the trip, they left home and soon saw the English Channel. Lily drove very well. Even Mui, who was ready to give directions from the back seat, had to admit it. Lily even passed a few slow cars with great skill, and Chen clapped for her. They drove through the seaside town, past the lagoon with small motorboats, and along the empty promenade. Lily parked in a street with many empty parking spaces. She wasn't sure about the road markings, so she decided to pay a parking fee to avoid any trouble. Lily locked all the van doors carefully. Chen joked, ""Don't worry, no one will want that old van."" The sisters were annoyed. Lily said Chen was ungrateful, and Mui told him he was too easily fooled by looks. Surprised, Chen took their son, Man Kee, to look at the sea. He held Man Kee on the railing and thought about his future. Chen wanted Man Kee to have a good education and own many restaurants one day.

The sea made Chen feel thoughtful. He saw a ship in the distance and used a telescope to look at it. At first, he couldn't find it, but then he saw it—a small, old, rusty ship. Chen showed it to Man Kee and said, ""This is a special ship for us. It will take us back home one day."" Chen kissed Man Kee's head. Lily and Mui joined them. Chen said, ""Let your mother see the ship, Son."" But Man Kee didn't want to let go of the telescope. When he finally did, the view was gone, and Lily only saw a white light. By the time Chen found another coin, the ship had disappeared, and Lily saw seagulls instead."
CPE_43,"**THE WELL**

I read that if you dig a deep hole, you can see stars during the day. I wanted to try this, so I asked you to help me. You watched as I pulled up the well bucket and climbed in. I told you to let me down. I didn't think about how heavy the bucket would be or that you might not be strong enough. You tried to hold the handle, but I fell into the well. I hit my head and saw strange lights. Later, I realized they looked like stars in cartoons when someone gets hit.

At first, I was confused, then scared, then angry at you for letting me fall. I was also worried about what Mother would say. You called down to ask if I was okay. I didn't answer. You ran to get help. I climbed out of the well and hid. I heard Mother, Father, and Arthur looking for me. I felt happy but then saw the wet spots I left on the ground. I was scared they would find me.

Mother was screaming, and I knew I had to do something. I came out of hiding, pretending to be hurt. I told them I found a secret tunnel from the well to the moat. I said I swam through it to escape. Father asked me to repeat my story. I added that the tunnel collapsed after me, so no one could find it. Father didn't believe me. He looked at me with disappointment. Arthur also looked sad, knowing I was lying.

I realized my lie was obvious, and I felt ashamed. Father's words hurt me, and Arthur's look made me feel even worse. I understood that lying was wrong and that I needed to change."
CPE_51,"**Moving Day**

Susan is a widow. Her children are grown up. She has to leave her family home. The moving van says ""Removers of Distinction."" Susan sees that everything special in the house is being packed. Fred, the removal man, is careful with the breakable things. His helpers are not as gentle. Susan is leaving a lovely house. It is a four-storey building near a small harbour. She remembers the years her children grew up there. 

When they bought the house, her son Robert, who was five, asked, ""Mum, when you buy a house, how do you get it home?"" Now, Robert is an adult and is helping with the move. He makes sure Susan does not talk about the piano. Francesca, her daughter, is also helping. She is very careful with the Steinway piano.

Fred, the removal man, says, ""She doesn't look like she's going to cry."" Susan asks if people cry. Fred says, ""You'd be surprised. They cry when everything is in the van, but they are fine at the new place.""

Susan remembers when they moved in. The piano was the first thing they brought in. It got stuck on the stairs. They had to cut the banister rails. Peter, Susan's late husband, solved the problem. They took out a window and used a crane to bring the piano in. It cost a lot, and they couldn't tune the piano for months. Peter said, ""That's there forever."" But forever is a long time. 

Now, Susan is not as mobile, and the children are busy. She thinks about the stairs and the banister rails. She should have warned the movers, but it is too late. Fred says, ""It's just the piano to come now."" Susan is nervous. Robert and Francesca watch. Fred and his team move the piano down the stairs and out the door. 

Robert laughs first, and then they all laugh. They are relieved it is over. They walk down the path for the last time, arm in arm, laughing. The only tears Susan sheds are tears of laughter."
CPE_11,"Text: 'Online Book Reviews for Everyone

Writing your own book reviews: is it just fun? From the start, the Internet was meant to be open to everyone. In theory, anyone could share their ideas or start a music channel online. But in the early days, you needed some technical skills. However, one area really became open to everyone: book reviews. On Amazon.com, the first big online bookstore, anyone could write a book review. Amazon allowed anyone to say what they thought about a book and give it up to five stars. This seemed like a great idea. Each book had its own page, and new reviews appeared automatically. This way, Amazon got free reviews, and people could see what other readers thought, not just what the publisher or professional critics said. Other online bookstores did the same, but Amazon was the biggest, with over 80% of the market. Because of this, Amazon had the most reviews and also some problems. Many reviews were submitted every day, so it was hard to check them all. Amazon had a team to make sure reviews followed their rules. Reviews with just one word, personal attacks, bad language, or spoilers were not allowed. But reviewers were anonymous, and bad reviews were only removed if Amazon found them. This allowed for some tricks. For example, writers could give their own books great reviews. One writer, Lev Grossman, wrote fake positive reviews for his book after getting bad ones. He was caught when he wrote about his trick. Authors could also comment on their books by clicking a special link. Most authors used this to encourage people to buy their books. Some even shared their email addresses. But Amazon did not always check if the comments were really from the author, except for famous writers. A fake comment pretending to be from John Updike was removed. Problems mostly came from readers, not writers. When James McElroy's book about a cheerleading team was published, it got good reviews from the press. But people in the book felt upset and wrote angry reviews on Amazon. These reviews disappeared after a few days. Despite this, Amazon liked that many people wrote reviews because it was good for business. Reviews were meant to be a place to talk about a book, not a chat room. Amazon watched popular books closely to make sure reviews followed the rules. Funny reviews were often posted on less popular books. For example, a children's book called The Story about Ping inspired jokes because 'ping' is also a computer term. One review compared the book's story to the Internet. But most reviews on Amazon were serious. They gave a good idea of whether a book was worth buying. The writer George Orwell once said that reviewing too many books meant making up feelings about books you didn't care about. This is why letting everyone review books is a good thing.'"
CPE_14,"**Art in Modern Times**

In the last 200 years, people often think that artists must be different from others. We like art that is new, surprising, or shocking. We admire artists whose work was not liked 100 years ago. But with today's art, we sometimes feel unsure and say it is not art. The media often say this, and we agree because we expect art to be new and different. We forget that today's art also has old themes and methods. We think artists are special and different from us. In the past, people asked artists to make art for specific reasons. Today, artists work alone, and we get upset if they try to be like everyone else.

**Picture This**

I will describe a situation and ask an important question. An artist picks a piece of text from an art book. The text talks about different pictures and says, ""There is no end to the number of different kinds of pictures."" The artist asks someone to make a canvas and take it to a sign painter. The sign painter writes the text on the canvas in simple black letters. My question is: Is this a painting?

**Underground Encounters**

At the Mercury Gallery, London until 26th June

Artists usually stick to one style if it sells well. People expect them to keep doing the same thing. Some artists, like Picasso and Hockney, change styles and succeed. Eric Rimmington is trying something new. He is known for still life paintings but now paints the London Underground. He likes railways and has made 40 paintings and drawings of the underground world.

**Extract from a Novel**

I have come to this island with a few books. The villagers joke that only a sick person would come here to rebuild. I am alone except for an old woman who cleans the house. I am not happy or unhappy. I think about the past. Art helps me find meaning in life. It lets me see the important parts of reality. Art is a way to deal with what hurts us in life. It helps us use our imagination to find our true potential. Otherwise, why do we hurt each other?"
CPE_63,"Text: 'Family Business'

""Look here, it's no good!"" said my Dad. We were in the car going back to London. My father and my brother Maurice had just picked me up from my school. I had won the Latin prize and the prize for doing best in my exams. My father talked with my headteacher, and now we were going home for the holidays.

""What isn't?"" I asked, though I knew what he was thinking. My father usually talked a lot. ""You can't fool me. You'll do what you want now,"" he said. ""With all those certificates, I was told you will get a scholarship to Oxford.""

""So?"" I said. ""Mightn't that be useful?""

""I also heard,"" he continued, ""that you want to be a barrister. A barrister of all things!"" My father knew a lot about barristers and the law.

""I just said that,"" I replied. ""I couldn't think of anything else to say!""

""And apparently,"" he went on, ""you have the right personality - you can understand things quickly, you like talking, and you enjoy performing.""

""I don't know about that,"" I said. ""I only know what I see on TV.""

""Anyway,"" he said, ""I feel you won't want to join the family business now. You'll go to Oxford, and after that, I can't see you wanting it.""

Like many children, I felt trapped by family expectations. I wanted to explore other jobs. But I didn't want to upset my father. I wasn't as scared of him as Maurice was - I was the favorite - but I found him strong.

""It's too soon to know,"" I said weakly.

""I tell you, you're not going to want to join us,"" said my father, who was often right, ""and it's a pity because you've got the gifts - the brains, the nerves, the vision.""

""There's still Maurice,"" I said, unhappy. My father snorted. We both knew Maurice hated the business.

""Anyway,"" I continued, ""you could always use me as a consultant.""

My mother wasn't around to help - she died when I was young, and my father raised me and Maurice. Maurice was two years younger, and I often took care of him. I loved Maurice. Because the business was successful, we lived well - a big house in London, good schools, nice clothes, parties, theatres, operas. My father knew many people - politicians, actors, businessmen - and our house was always lively.

""I tell you what,"" my father said. ""You can help us during holidays until you leave Oxford, and then decide. It will give you some pocket money and help me.""

""OK,"" I said, happy to avoid making a decision now. My father would get upset if I opposed him. This was how he controlled us.

So it happened. In my last term at school, and during university vacations, I helped out, never more than twice a year, and always on easy tasks. I became a smart student, with a little house, a small white car, designer clothes, and a black dress with a Paris label for my final exams.

In my last term, my father visited me. He took me to a village for a meal and a chat. There were only a few weeks left. My tutor said I might get a First Class degree in Law. I felt ready and focused.

But my father told me he needed me for one last job, the most important for the family business. He promised it would be worth it.

""But Dad,"" I protested, ""I have my final exams soon, and I need to focus on them. It's really important.""

I could tell my father didn't understand my pressures, or maybe he was jealous of my life away from him. He would see a refusal as a betrayal.

As he explained the job, I saw his dedication and skill. He was a sort of genius, and I respected that. It made my own plans seem less important.

""All right,"" I said. ""I'll do it."""
CPE_56,"Simon Costello realized that buying the house in Pembroke Square was a mistake within a year of moving in with his wife, Lois. They could only afford it by being very careful with money. At first, it seemed like a good idea because Simon had many successful cases, and Lois got a raise at her advertising job, making thirty-five thousand. Lois wanted to move because their flat was too small for a family, and they needed more space, a garden, and a place for an au pair. They could have found this in a cheaper area, but Lois wanted a better address. She felt their old place wasn't good enough for a young barrister and a successful businesswoman.

To save money, Lois decided one of them should use public transport. Since her job was far, Simon had to take the crowded tube, which made him unhappy. He often thought about his grandfather's house in Hampstead, where he was treated well after a long day. But times had changed. Lois made it clear that her career was as important as Simon's. They needed both salaries for their lifestyle.

Now, their life was at risk because of Venetia. She came to their office angry, accusing Simon of knowing that a client, Brian Cartwright, had bribed a jury four years ago. She also said Cartwright gave shares to Simon's fiancée before the trial. Simon denied it, but his denial sounded weak. He felt guilty and remembered being punished as a child. He wished he had said Cartwright was lying to make himself important. Venetia didn't believe him, and he worried she could ruin his career. If people heard about this, even as a rumor, he would be in trouble."
CPE_36,"Text: I chose this place to live because I thought I could be anonymous. I hoped people here wouldn't care if the houses were old and the gardens were messy. But I was wrong. People in the shops soon start to recognize you. The roses next door remind me that the gardens were once loved. Usually, I stay inside, but tonight, I am watching the birds fly. I have cleared some space in the garden for a chair, and my arms are scratched. It is a small London garden, where plants must grow tall. 

My upstairs neighbor, Jaz, leans out of the window. She writes books that are not published, and I sometimes have to talk about them because I am an English teacher. I have her latest book now. 'How's the work going, Jaz?' I ask. 'In no other job do people ask you about your work all the time,' she says. Then she offers to bring a drink. I don't want Jaz in the garden, and I see it looks messy. The only way to the garden is through my flat, and Jaz is knocking on my door. 'So, you're on holiday now,' she says. She sits on the chair while I put a cushion on the grass. 'Cheers,' she says. 'I should've been a teacher - a writer doesn't have holidays. They say, those who can, do, those who can't, teach.' And some can't do either. 'So, what plans for the holidays?' she asks. 

I feel worried about the school holidays. Empty days. Hot streets. The walk to the shops and back. The little park with its fountain, and feeling lonely on the bench. 'Actually, I'm going to Stonebridge tomorrow. Can you feed the cats?' I ask. My heart races. 'Of course,' Jaz says. 'If I'm around,' knowing she will be. 'Where will you stay?' she asks. 'With my oldest friend, Ruby, at the Rising Sun,' I say. It's not true, but I often deal with fiction. 'Going back to your roots. So what do you think of my book?' Jaz asks. Her book, The Cruelty of Red Vans, is on my desk. I like the title and tell her. I can see how red vans could be cruel, always bringing things to other houses and returning her manuscripts. I decide to be honest. 'Try writing about nice people for a change,' I say. 'Teachers!' Jaz says, upset. 'I keep a journal,' I say. 'I write something good about each day.' 'Keep a journal! Nice people! Get a life, Ann,' Jaz says. 

Oh, I've got a life. I have my work, and I go out sometimes. When we go inside, my kitchen feels calm. Then I remember my school geography teacher, Miss Tarrantine, who was about my age now, winking and saying, 'I've had my moments.' We almost died laughing."
CPE_6,"**Heritage**

Heritage is important because it helps people feel connected to the past. We often know about our personal heritage, like who our grandparents were and stories about their lives. But we also need to learn about our past to understand our future. Heritage gives us a sense of continuity, helping us feel part of history. Just like we inherit our genes, we also inherit culture from past generations. There might be parts of our national heritage we don't like, but it is still ours, and it makes us feel part of something bigger. Heritage teaches us a lot and is important for our well-being. It affects our customs and the things we use every day. In the past, we learned about our heritage through stories from our ancestors. But now, because of changes in society, many of these stories are lost. Instead, we learn from places and buildings that remind us of the past. It is important to keep these links to remember our ancestors.

**The Fens**

I started writing a book called ""Waterland,"" where the Fens, a part of England, became important. People ask why I, a person from London, wrote about a place I don't know well. I chose the Fens because they seemed simple and empty, a good place for my story. But I learned that the Fens are not empty. They are very English but also strange and mysterious. Many English people find the Fens foreign, even though other unique areas in Britain are part of the country's culture. The Fens are both empty and full, wild and cultivated, open yet mysterious. I didn't visit many places in the Fens while writing. I like to imagine places rather than just describe them. The Fens are not just a place but also a feeling.

**Museums**

Museums should make their collections easy to see and understand. In the past, this meant putting items in cases with long labels. Now, displays should be interesting and use creative ways to catch visitors' attention. Museums should also reach out to the community. For example, they can lend objects to schools or use them to help elderly people with memory loss. Museums show real items, not copies. They help people see and understand things from the past. This makes them different from theme parks or books. Museums that make their displays exciting and accessible will find that people want to see the real things they offer.

**Architecture and Environment**

People have always wanted to keep things from the past, but now changes in towns happen quickly and affect everyone. Some people want to preserve everything, while others think about how towns should look in the future. People who have lived through big events, like wars, may want to preserve things more. If people need to preserve things, planners should consider this. Change is not bad if we know how to manage it. Changes in our towns show changes in society, like how many people live there and what they need."
CPE_33,"**Einstein**

If you ask someone to name a scientist, they will probably say Albert Einstein. His face is used to sell smart products like computers and encyclopedias. Most people don't know much about what Einstein did, except that he made some theories called 'relativity'. These theories are famous for being hard to understand and for making strange predictions. Einstein was part of a big change in science in the 20th century. Scientists were trying to describe the universe better by studying matter and forces. Einstein helped by looking at time, space, matter, and energy in a new way. Before, people thought like Isaac Newton, who said stars and planets moved in a fixed space and time. Einstein said time and space are not fixed but relative.

**Young Readers**

When we were children, Lydia and I did not like prize-winning books because we thought they were boring. Our mother did not like this, but our father would give us money to read good books. He also gave us some books as gifts, saying they were not just literature. We thought most of these books were for boys, but we did read some short stories and a book of poems.

**Language**

In 1851, Jacob Grimm said that the origin of human language is a secret and amazing. Many strange ideas have come from this mystery. In 1928, Charles Caller said early humans made sounds like ""meuh"" when they were in danger. These sounds were sad, and languages kept some of these sounds, like ""malaria"" meaning ""fever"". Because of these strange ideas, many people did not talk about language origins. But now, it is an important research area. Language probably started in East Africa about 100,000 years ago. It was mainly used for friendly talk and power struggles, not for sharing information, which is different from what philosopher John Locke thought."
CPE_20,"Text: 'Writing Reviews Frank Kermode talks about how to write reviews. Most reviews are written quickly and are not read for long. They have deadlines and are usually short. When published, they are only read for a short time, like a day or a week. People often think reviews are not important. Many believe writers do reviews because they need money or because they can't work on big projects all the time. But writing reviews is a skill. It is different to write a short review for a newspaper and a long one for a journal. Reviewers must think about who will read their review. Some readers just skim, while others are very interested in the topic. A reviewer needs to know a lot about many things and write clearly. Reviewers often write other things too. For example, the American writer John Updike writes reviews when he is not writing novels. He collects his reviews in books. Some people think only famous writers should keep their reviews, but others believe anyone can do it if they want. I feel the same about my work. I am a professor, and my main job is academic writing. But in English-speaking countries, it is normal for professors to write reviews too. In the past, some people thought professors should not write reviews, but now it is common. There are more reviews now, so many people can write them. I think this is good for readers because they know the reviewer understands the topic. It is also good for professors because it helps them communicate better with people who are not professors. Writing reviews is a secondary job. You can only do it well if you are also doing something else well.'"
CPE_40,"Ralph opened the door to his apartment. As he walked into the dark, quiet hallway, he felt a small worry about owning the place. Even after three years, he sometimes felt this way when he came home alone at the end of the day. When he first bought the apartment, he used to come home excited and curious, often as early as he could, wondering what the apartment had been like while he was away. It felt like a welcoming place to him, where he was in control. He thought he should worry about things like burglars or broken pipes, but the apartment always seemed to be waiting for him, either tidy or messy, depending on how he left it. Over time, he started to see it as just another part of himself, a space filled with his thoughts and feelings. He became frustrated that it couldn't change. Sometimes, there were letters by the door or the answering machine had messages when he got home. He was glad the windows weren't broken and nothing was stolen, but he wondered what it would look like if that happened. From his boring office on the third floor on Holloway Road, Ralph often looked forward to his three or four quiet evenings at home each week. Once he left the busy office and started to feel like himself again on the bus ride home, he didn't need to be alone anymore, but he often forgot this when planning his social life. At his desk, he wanted to be alone with his things, but once he got home, he felt empty and waited for a sense of self to return. Instead, he felt a big emptiness, making him think that doing work he didn't like had changed him, moving him away from who he thought he was. He often read or listened to music at night, but now he wondered why he did these things. His thoughts and feelings were unclear, and he felt lost. There was a time, he thought, when he didn't feel this way, when he could have changed his life if he had known his own value. But he was eager to find something, so he followed the first path that seemed right. After university, he tried to make a plan for a better life, but he only wanted to survive quietly. He applied for jobs he heard about from friends, following their paths without thinking he could find happiness in his work. He went to one job interview and didn't think much about the job itself. It was an editorial role at a free local newspaper. He was happy to have a nice conversation with Neil, his boss, and didn't think about the long meetings he would have later. Neil offered him the job right away, saying Ralph was the only graduate who applied, which Ralph took as a compliment at the time."
CPE_45,"**Goat Racing**

I was going to see goat racing. It was Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. There were many ice-cream vans, lots of people, food stalls, and loud music. Everyone was moving towards the racecourse. I pushed through the crowd to find a good spot. A part of the area was marked for the race. It was not like big racecourses, but people stood on both sides of the track. They tried to keep some goats in order. It was not easy because goats can eat almost anything.

**Canoe Trip**

As the day ended, I thought about the night and felt scared. The canoe was too wet to sleep in, and there was no place to stop. We had not seen any villages or huts since morning. In the dim moonlight, we used our torch to see the cliffs. The torch batteries were low, so we put in new ones, but they did not work. We could not find a camping place. A few miles later, Lesley saw a light, and we felt hopeful. But it was just moonlight on the waves. Soon, we heard the loud noise of fast water, but we could not see it. Time felt slow, and we kept moving.

**How to be Good at Presentations**

I am not good at making presentations. But as a managing director, I have to present to my colleagues and big shareholders. How can I get better at presentations and feel more confident? You are not alone. Presentations need different skills than running a company. Many senior executives need to be good at it. If you want to convince your audience, you must believe in what you say. Show your belief with passion and enthusiasm. Do your homework. Test your ideas before the presentation. Ask colleagues to find the 'hard questions' the audience might ask. Start with something everyone agrees on and slowly build to your conclusion."
CPE_64,"Some activities cannot be rushed. They need time. If you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you add oil too quickly to mayonnaise, it will not work. If you pull hard on a tangled fishing line, the knot gets tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some things it does very fast, like solving puzzles or doing math. But other things take longer, like learning or thinking deeply. If you rush these, they might not work well, like the mayonnaise or the fishing line.

We learn and think in different ways, and these ways work at different speeds. ""He who hesitates is lost,"" says one saying. ""Look before you leap,"" says another. Both are true. The mind has three speeds. The first is faster than thought. Some situations need a quick reaction. For example, when my motorbike slipped on a wet road, my body reacted quickly to keep me safe. A concert pianist or an Olympic fencer also reacts quickly. This fast reaction is called our ""wits.""

The second speed is thought itself. This is when we think carefully, like a mechanic fixing an engine or a student doing homework. We call this ""intellect."" People who are good at this are called ""bright"" or ""clever.""

The third speed is slower. It is more relaxed and dreamy. We use this when we are thinking deeply or being creative. For example, when sitting by the sea and listening to the waves, we are in this slow thinking mode. This slow way of thinking is important. It helps us solve complex problems and be creative. Scientists are now studying this slow thinking. They find that it helps us understand difficult things better than fast thinking."
CPE_29,"**Surviving in a Foreign Land**

I have been welcomed warmly. It is a friendly and well-supplied camp in a very isolated place. There are about forty people here - scientists, students, weather experts, and satellite trackers. We are a close group, and everyone helps each other. My basic French is just enough to talk, but not to have fun conversations. I miss the small details, and my phrasebook is not helpful at breakfast. This is not a big problem for me, but at first, I felt less confident. I was a bit scared of mealtimes. I would wait, worried about which table to sit at, afraid of the silence when I spoke, nervous like I was in my first weeks of school. I still smile awkwardly or panic when people talk to me. I think the reason I sometimes feel sad is not because I miss talking to people, but because I have lost the social confidence I used to have.

**Elliot**

When I first met Elliot, I was just a young writer, and he did not pay much attention to me. He never forgot a face, though, and when I saw him again, he shook hands with me nicely, but he did not want to become friends. If I saw him at the opera with important people, he would pretend not to see me. But then I had a big success as a playwright, and I noticed that Elliot liked me more. One day, he sent me a note to invite me to lunch, and I thought he was testing me. After that, because my success brought me many new friends, I started to see him more often.

**Alfred Hitchcock**

The film director Alfred Hitchcock always said he didn't care about the story of his films or the acting. He cared about the photography, the music, and all the technical parts. For Hitchcock, it wasn't the message or a great performance that moved the audience. He believed that people are excited by pure film, no matter where they are from. So, if a film is made correctly, people from Japan and India should react the same way. Hitchcock was always clear and logical about his work. He was a man of reason and a talented craftsman who liked to hear an audience scream. He didn't guess or use abstract ideas, and he didn't explore his characters deeply. He focused on film, pure film, and the exact, calculated beauty of what a film can do to an audience."
CPE_57,"**Amateur Astronomy**

Many things have changed in astronomy in the last 50 years. About 30 years ago, there were not many charts and catalogues. Telescopes were simple, and there were few books on how to do astronomy. Today, you can buy many different telescopes and equipment. Electronic calculators and computers have changed how we make charts and study the stars. This might be the best time for amateur astronomy. But, some things are not as good. Now, you might have to travel 80 km to see a sky like the one in cities 50 years ago. Airplanes leave trails in the sky that can last for hours and make it hard to see the sun and stars.

**Too Much Choice**

Today, there are too many things to do and too many choices. People always want the newest product or service. Technology makes things change quickly. There are always new products coming out. This can make people feel tired and stressed. More choices mean more stress and less time. People are now looking for simple things that make life meaningful. But, it is hard to make life simple when there are so many products. There are more types of soap and cereal than we need, and too many software updates and phone plans to remember.

**McAndrews Hotel**

Every summer, we spend two weeks at McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. It is a family tradition started by my grandmother. We do not let anything change this tradition. The people who stay at McAndrews are like us: old-fashioned and maybe a bit snobbish. I do not like rude shop assistants or waiters who act too friendly. I know most of the guests' names because they have been coming here since they were children. We greet each other politely but do not have long conversations. It is hard to find this kind of respect for privacy in hotels today."
CPE_9,"**Othello**

A special show of Shakespeare's play ""Othello"" moved from Stratford to London. I want to change my earlier review of this play. Before, I said Ray Fearon was too young to play Othello and criticized his acting. I still think Othello should be older than Desdemona, but I now believe Mr. Fearon's acting is excellent. The whole cast is great. Some memorable parts are when Cassio plays games with other officers, and things get out of control, and when Iago starts to lose control. The scene where Emilia helps Desdemona get ready for bed is very emotional. The play is exciting and full of tension. Don't miss this show.

**Lake Vostok**

In the middle of Antarctica, there is a place where nothing moves. Around the edges of the continent, there are many penguins, seals, and birds. But in the center, there is no life. Except for a large hidden lake called Lake Vostok, under almost 4 kilometers of ice. This lake has been without air and sunlight for up to 25 million years. Scientists are eager to explore it and find out what strange creatures live there. Geologists and glaciologists are also interested. For two years, researchers from around the world have been planning to study the lake. In the next few years, we might learn a lot about Lake Vostok.

**Scientists**

There was an interesting talk on the radio last week. Some scientists are discussing why they want to be scientists. We know they want to learn about everything, from atoms to black holes. But they are asking why we want to know these things and why science can't explain this. It is important to know if what scientists do is right, rather than worry about why we do it. The main point is that science is a tool, and we should decide how to use it."
CPE_42,"**Food**

Food is important and makes us happy. Many people think cooking is hard and only for special days. But that's not true. You can make a tasty soup by putting some chopped carrots, a leek, celery, and herbs in water. This is better than buying soup from a packet or a can. Instead of buying a chocolate mousse with many chemicals, you can make a delicious one in five minutes that everyone will love. Cooking is a way to show care and love. Sharing food is important for people, and we celebrate special days like birthdays and weddings with meals. No one would have a takeaway for a wedding or anniversary party!

**In the Elevator**

This morning, Alistair tried to clean his office, but papers were everywhere. Tax forms and other papers filled his desk and boxes. He also had many books and journals. As he went up in the elevator, he knew Mallory would be on time for their meeting. She was always on time and liked things neat. He wondered what she would think of the mess. Mrs. Wilson, who cleaned for him, came while he was trying to tidy up. He hoped she would help, but she only cleaned his apartment, not his office. She thought he was from somewhere far away, not from her world in Brooklyn.

**Karen**

Karen wanted to be different from her mother. She made her own story of strength. When she was twelve, her brother accidentally hit her eye with a golf club. She thought she was blind, but the doctor said she was okay. She only needed a few stitches. When she saw her mother in the doctor's office, she felt she was saved for a reason.

**Miss Fogerty**

Miss Fogerty was walking across the village green. She felt both happy and sad. She was happy to know something important first, but sad about Dr. Bailey's health. He was her doctor for many years and helped her with her throat problems. He always listened to his patients and made them feel important. The village loved him for this."
CPE_59,"Joanna's Lessons

Joanna MacGregor is a busy concert pianist. But she also writes books for young children learning the piano. Joanna is famous for her amazing piano performances. She plays many styles of music like classical, jazz, and blues. At a concert for kids, a boy asked her to play ""Match of the Day."" Joanna found it funny and played it, making the boy happy.

Joanna is different from many top pianists because she cares about how children learn the piano. She wrote a book called ""Joanna MacGregor's Piano World"" for beginners. She did this even though she has a very busy schedule. She performs at many festivals, runs her own recording label, and likes to work with other artists.

Joanna believes the first piano lessons are very important. She thinks music should be for everyone, not just for those who want to be stars. She grew up with many children learning different kinds of music at her home, where her mother taught piano. Joanna wants everyone to try learning the piano, just like learning to swim or speak a little French.

Some children learn piano quickly, but others take more time. Joanna is interested in helping those who find it hard. She worries that some parents push their children too much, making them feel they have to be perfect. Joanna wants music to be fun and enjoyable.

Her books are colorful and have stories to make learning fun. They come with CDs that have music for parents or teachers to play with the child. Joanna thinks practice is very important. She didn't practice a lot until she went to the Royal Academy of Music. Now, she practices eight hours a day and loves it. She says it's important to know what you want to achieve when you practice. Her advice is to mix hard and easy pieces and enjoy playing."
CPE_54,"**Writing by Hand and on Screen**

Dr. Johnson said, ""What is written without effort is read without pleasure."" This means good writing is hard work. When I look at my old school essays, I see few mistakes. Today, I would rewrite them many times. I think this is because writing by hand is slow and makes you think carefully. It is hard to change or erase, so you write with care. But with computers, it is easy to be careless. Many writers find they spend the same time fixing computer drafts as they did writing by hand. Also, emails are not as personal as handwritten letters. People say emails have brought back the love letter, but they often lack the feeling of handwritten words. Words on a screen can seem harsh and lose their meaning. 

**The CD**

I put down my cup and looked at the CD. The case was not special, but the shiny disc was interesting. ""Wonderful little things, aren't they?"" Mr. Warriston said. I agreed and gave the disc to him. ""Amazing they hold seventy minutes of music,"" he said, turning on the hi-fi. He pressed a button, and a drawer opened. He put the disc in and closed it. ""Some say they sound sterile, but I think they..."" ""Do you have to turn them over, like records?"" I asked. ""No,"" he said. ""You only play one side."" ""Why?"" I asked. He thought for a moment. ""I don't know. You could have two lasers or turn it over by hand."" He smiled. ""Good point."" He pointed to my chair. ""Let's get you in the best place for the stereo effect.""

**Books versus Electronic Text**

Malcolm Bradbury said if matches came after lighters, we would think they were better. People say electronic text is like the invention of printing, but changes take time. In 1979, a book said books would disappear in the 1980s. That was wrong. Reading long texts on a screen is hard, so people don't do it. Computers make people read bits of text. Some say this leads to new ways of storytelling, but non-linear reading is not new. Many books, like religious texts and dictionaries, are not read from start to finish. Computers don't encourage reading everything in one go.

**The Office**

Charles walked into the office. It was neat and tidy. The carpet was clear, and the desk was dark wood. Files were in drawers, and journals were on shelves. Kathleen said, ""You need to use computers, Charles. This is too much."" ""Hello, Kathleen. This is amazing,"" he said, looking at the room. He did not think about computers. They had talked about this many times. She did not understand why he resisted technology when he was good with computers and had written a paper on it. She inspired that paper. She could use any software and make it do amazing things."
CPE_32,"Text: ""You don't take sugar, do you?"" shouted his secretary. She wasn't really asking because she had been making Lancelot coffee for many months. She sometimes forgot because he wasn't supposed to be there. But now, he was there all the time. He found that staying away caused too many problems. Lancelot thought about how he went from being an important advisor, meeting authors and playwrights over lunch, to being very busy with no time to park his car in the morning. ""This came,"" she yelled, waving a folder before putting it in front of him. ""From that guy in Los Angeles. You said you wanted to see it."" The label said: ""A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert."" It also said ""An Expanded Synopsis."" Lancelot did not want to see another synopsis. He wanted to see a ""First Draft."" Ian Cuthbert had been given a lot of money for this book when Lancelot bought the company. Ian was an old friend, but he was not easy to work with. Lancelot skipped the introduction and looked at the synopsis. It was almost the same as before. He closed the folder and put it aside. Ian's manuscript seemed like it would never come. The synopsis was not very good and lacked excitement. Lancelot remembered a story about a famous author whose last book was published incomplete after his death. Ian's advance was large, which was not a good business decision. Lancelot, who studied languages at Oxford, remembered when Ian was a promising talent at Cambridge. Ian's friends took over British theatre quickly, but Ian was even more talented. He wore his coat like a cape and talked about famous writers as if he knew them. But Ian's talent stayed hidden. While others succeeded, Ian became more difficult. He was chosen to edit an arts magazine but never published it. His contract with a fashion magazine was renewed three times, but he produced little. At meetings, Ian was witty but critical. Ten years later, he was unreliable. Lancelot was starting to think that ""A World History of the Short"" was a mistake from the beginning."
CPE_65,"Text: 'Breakfast in England

Health experts say breakfast is very important. But in history, breakfast is quite new in England. In medieval times, breakfast is not often mentioned in books. Sometimes, travelers ate early before long trips, and sick people had breakfast for health reasons. But most people did not eat breakfast unless they were kings or nobles. 

In the sixteenth century, breakfast became normal for everyone. Some people think this is because there was more food. But there were also big social changes. For example, people started working set hours and often began work very early. So, eating in the morning became necessary, not just for rich people.'"
CPE_61,"**Photography**

When a photographer takes a picture, they choose what to show based on their skills, personal ideas, and cultural rules. In this book, we will see how these things change the style and meaning of a photo. We will also see how people look at and feel about these photos. For example, when someone reads a newspaper, they might think they understand the photos. But we can ask if the photo shows the scene as it really was. Or does it show what the photographer thinks? Is the exact moment important, or is the photo a symbol of something in the world?

**More than a Game**

For me, sport is more than just playing. The best people in sport believe in themselves completely. You need to focus if you want to be the best. You have to give up other things. Sport is tough, and no one will do it for you. You have to try hard or you will fail. Sport has taught me to be disciplined and determined. It also shows how to work in a team. My sport lets you be great alone, but it is also a team game. It is like life - you can do well alone, but you must remember others. Sport has given me a lot, not just money. It has shown me new things and places. But you also have to give up a lot for these benefits.

**Tuning In**

Some experiences stay in our memory very clearly. For me, this happened one night in California many years ago. I was awake, listening to a bird singing in a tree. I don't usually have trouble sleeping, but the bird's song was so beautiful that I stayed awake. The bird's music reminded me of jazz and Indian music. It felt like the bird was making up the music as it sang. I was amazed by the bird's song until I finally fell asleep."
CPE_52,"Text: People have always had strong feelings about birds. But what do these feelings say about us? Paul Evans writes about this. There is a noise from the greenhouse. A small brown bird is hitting the glass. It is a wren. Some people think wrens bring messages or signs. Is it trying to tell me something? Or is it just a bird stuck in the greenhouse? Maybe both are true. Wrens have been part of British culture for a long time. In the past, people watched wrens to see if they would have good or bad luck. Today, we still see wrens in pictures and decorations in British homes. Even if old beliefs are forgotten, people still like wrens. A forest without wrens feels empty. This is because there is a lot of folklore about birds. In the past, people needed to understand nature to survive. They created stories about animals. These stories can change over time. For example, the red kite was once common in London. People liked them because they cleaned the streets. But later, people thought they were pests, and they disappeared from most places except Wales. Now, red kites are protected and are a symbol of conservation. Our connection with birds is very old. Early humans watched birds to know about danger, weather, and food. Birds also seemed magical to them. When we think about why birds are important, we also think about what it means to be human. Birds can fly and sing, and we admire these things. Some people think our feelings about birds are old and not needed now. But like some parts of our body, these feelings are still with us. Birds show us how the environment is changing. In Britain, 30 bird species are in danger. This is sad because it means losing part of our culture. Birds like the skylark, turtle dove, and lapwing are in poems and stories. Losing them is losing a part of our history. But birds not in stories are often ignored. Folklore is important. Stories and legends about birds help us feel connected to them. These stories are more powerful than scientific words. They help us feel and understand birds in a special way. Watching birds, whether on TV or in our gardens, is exciting. Science cannot fully explain why we love birds. The wren in the greenhouse makes me think about the past and the future. It is a mystery that keeps me wondering."
CPE_28,"Text: 'Maps The purpose of a map is to show how places and features on the earth relate to each other. This is done using distance and direction. In the past, people often measured distance by time, like 'a day's walk' or 'a day's journey by river'. This told more about how easy it was to travel the land than the actual distance. Direction was also important, but for most travelers, the main questions were 'Where do I go from here?' and 'How far is it?'. Because of this, written directions were often used instead of maps. Even today, some maps, like train maps, do not show true directions. Early maps used signs to show important landmarks, and these signs could be different sizes to show their importance. The way maps were made changed depending on their purpose and where they were made. To understand old maps, it is important to know the method used to make them. The history of map-making is about making maps more accurate and detailed. Map-making has used other sciences to help. For example, instead of using the sun or stars to find direction, people used the magnetic compass. New tools were made to measure angles accurately. As people learned more about the world, they tried to map it. Astronomers found out that the earth is not a perfect sphere, but is slightly flat at the poles, which changed how large areas were mapped. Over time, different people needed maps for different reasons. Soldiers needed accurate maps for planning battles. Archaeologists, historians, and geographers also needed special maps. Today, map-makers create maps showing many things, like weather patterns and land use. The value of maps in many sciences has led to a new interest in map-making. The progress in map-making has not always been steady. Sometimes, old ideas stayed around even when new ones were better. Map-makers often knew how to improve maps but had to wait for better tools. Since it is easy to copy old maps, some map publishers did not want to change. So, maps should not always be trusted as proof of what people knew at the time. The many maps we have today show a lot of human work and thought. They are a valuable record of human history. This makes studying old maps interesting and educational.'"
CPE_35,"**Simplified Text:**

I was invited into a young man's nice living room. It was a calm and tidy place in a messy house. The kitchen was like economy class, but his room was like business class. He had the biggest collection of records I had ever seen and the first stereo record player I had come across. He also had expensive wine glasses, pictures, and furniture. His name was Andrew Lloyd Webber. He had a scholarship to study history at Oxford University, but he had nine months free before starting. He wanted to become a famous composer like Richard Rodgers. I also had big dreams. I wanted to be a pop star for women, money, and fame. The difference was that my dreams were not as serious to me. When Andrew suggested I try to become a famous lyricist like Oscar Hammerstein, I agreed. Andrew played me three tunes he had composed, and I could tell he was very good. He played more music from shows he had written at school. I was impressed. He needed a new lyricist, and I had a song that was recorded by a pop group. We decided to meet again and write something together. I was more interested in pop music than theater, but I knew Andrew was talented. I thought it would be smart to work with him. Even if we didn't succeed in theater, we could try to compete with famous bands like the Beatles later. The next day, at my office job where I was training to be a lawyer, I wasn't as sure about a career in show business. I still looked for bands needing a singer and wrote simple songs. I thought I might end up as a lawyer by age 25. My father said I would stop liking pop music by age 21, which worried me. But I decided to see Andrew again. It would be fun to write musical lyrics with him. Andrew was interesting and liked good food and old buildings. He also supported a football team. I wasn't sure about his idea for a musical about Dr. Thomas Barnardo, who helped orphans. The story didn't excite me, and it seemed too much like another show, Oliver. But Andrew believed in his music, and it was catchy. I didn't know much about musicals, but I thought we could be successful. I started writing lyrics, especially for the funny songs. Andrew told me the story, played the tunes, and gave me some titles. I skipped a day at the office to write my first theater lyrics. I didn't know it then, but I had changed my career."
CPE_5,"**Language**

Humans have a special ability: we can communicate with each other using language. Language is a big part of our lives, and it is hard to think about life without it. If you see two or more people together, they will probably start talking. Even when alone, people talk to themselves, their pets, or even their plants. I like to say that language is like an 'instinct'. This means people know how to talk naturally, like spiders know how to make webs. Spiders did not learn web-making from school or from a smart spider; they just know how to do it.

**Climate and Weather**

Climate and weather are made by the air around us and have a big effect on where animals and plants live. Climate can change how a place looks. For example, warm and wet places can have tropical jungles with many different species. Cold and windy places have fewer living things. Weather patterns, which make up the climate over time, happen because big masses of air move and mix. The air moves because the earth spins, and the air does not move as fast as the earth. The sun is also important for making the air move.

**Coffee**

As a bar-person, I had to serve drinks and make coffee. In Lygon Street, Melbourne, a restaurant's success can depend on its coffee. I had to learn a lot about making coffee, especially using the espresso machine. I learned how to make a good cappuccino, which is a coffee with rich, frothy milk. By the end of the first week, I realized making good coffee was not easy, and I thought I might have to do simple tasks like cleaning ashtrays again. But my boss was patient. He said, 'Making coffee is both an art and a science, and you need time to learn it.'"
CPE_41,"**Art on TV**

Why does TV often fail with shows about art? Painting and sculpture should be easy for TV because the camera can show a whole artwork and then zoom in on details. But few TV series show the joy and complexity of art. A good example is Robert Hughes's series ""American Visions."" Hughes is a trusted critic with a strong personality. He had almost eight hours to show British viewers American art, which British galleries often ignore. I thought the series would focus on great artworks. Instead, it was about how American history and culture are shown in art and buildings.

**Dealing in Metals**

For 20 years, I worked as a metals dealer and became known for taking risks. Metals are less controlled than other markets. With luck, risk-taking, and market knowledge, you can make a lot of money. Risk is a big part of the industry. This fits well with a free-market global economy. But now, free-trade economists see that the market is not keeping metal prices high. More minerals are being taken out, and raw material costs are going down. Adjusted for inflation, most metal prices are about half of what they were 20 years ago. Recently, I was asked to investigate claims against a big company that benefits from cheap raw materials.

**Extract from a Holiday Brochure**

Abaco and its small islands are part of the 700 islands of the Bahamas, stretching from Florida to Cuba. Each island is unique and has something special. To get around Abaco and its islands, you need a boat. If your room doesn't include one, don't worry. There are many ferries and water-taxis. You can also rent a boat if you want to go on your own. Sailing is very popular here. Abaco is called 'The Sailing Capital of the World' because of its calm, protected waters. These waters are great for fishing, diving, snorkeling, and swimming. The islands and beaches stretch for 200 miles like a string of pearls. At night, the lights of the restaurants and cafes in Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay shine brightly."
CPE_69,"Text: 'Build Your Own Bamboo Bike in the UK

The Bamboo Bike Club in Hackney Wick, east London, offers a special course. Run by engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan, the course lets you build your own bamboo bike. It's a fun weekend activity where you get a custom bike frame designed by a computer.

Bamboo is becoming popular for making bikes. Companies like Calfee Design in California and Bamboo Bikes in Yorkshire use bamboo, a method first tried in 1894. But buying a bamboo bike can be expensive, costing around $2,995 or £1,868. James and Ian wanted to make bamboo bikes affordable for everyone. They spent years working in a shed in Wales to create a business that lets people build their own bikes.

The Bamboo Bike Club is more like a community than a company. James and Ian have other jobs; James works with wind turbines, and Ian is a civil engineer. They offer monthly courses where you can build your own bike for a good price.

On the first day of the course, you learn how to choose strong bamboo and make strong joints. You start by putting together the front triangle of the bike with bamboo tubes. Metal tubes are used for parts that need extra strength, like the handlebars and wheel forks. James and Ian help you with every step, making sure everything is done right.

Most people enjoy building their own bike. Even if you make a mistake, you can try again with a new piece of bamboo. On the second day, you wrap the joints with hemp and glue them to make them strong. After adding a waterproof coating, the bike is ready for wheels, brakes, and other parts.

Bamboo bikes are strong and can last a long time. Ian has used his bike for over a year, and James has tested one off-road for three months. The bikes may look a bit rough compared to professional ones, but they are unique. James and Ian say that's the point.

Bamboo bikes are great for a smooth and easy ride. They are light and fun to ride. The cost of building your own bamboo bike is less than £500.'"
CPE_38,"**Self-help Books**

Dione Reverend was an editor at Random House in New York. She found a book by Dr. John Gray, a pop psychologist. She thought it would be a bestseller, and she was right. Dr. Gray is now very rich, and Dione Reverend has her own company. Dr. Gray's book helps people understand communication between men and women. It is very popular in the self-help industry. This industry is growing and helps people who want to improve their lives. It also helps the publishing world in New York. In Britain, many self-help books are published, but many are not good. For every book published, many are rejected. Editors look for books that can sell well. They ask questions like, ""Is the author easy to promote? Is the idea interesting to many people?"" Dione Reverend says a good title is very important.

**Autobiographies**

When someone writes an autobiography, they make a promise to tell the truth. But often, they do not tell everything. There are many reasons for this. Some things are too embarrassing to share. Some things seem unimportant. Sometimes, writers think they can show the truth better by making up stories. Some writers never plan to tell the truth. They call their book an autobiography to make readers believe it is true. Readers might think they read a true story, but it is fiction. This is not always done to trick people.

**Dashiell Hammett's Detective Stories**

Detective stories became popular in the late 1800s and early 1900s. They show the problems of society at that time. In these stories, a crime shows human desires like greed. Solving the crime helps society work well again. In Hammett's stories, society is still not perfect after the crime is solved. The detective and the criminal are similar. They understand each other. The detective is both a good person and a bit of a crook. He is not fully on the side of the law. Sometimes, he feels guilty about this. Other times, he is very eager to catch the criminal.

**Science Writing**

Stephen Jay Gould is a famous science writer. He says that to write well about science, you must understand the culture of science. Only scientists can explain science well. If you do not know the rules of the science community, it is hard to write about it. Gould believes you should never talk down to readers. You can make the language simple, but not the ideas. If readers feel you are treating them like they are not smart, they will not like your writing."
CPE_17,"**Air-conditioning**

At Cannons Gym in the City of London, the air feels very cold. The gym is a popular place for workers to go during lunch. This summer, the gym used a lot of air-conditioning because it was very hot outside. Sometimes, the gym feels as cold as the Arctic. This is an example of how people often use too much air-conditioning. Air-conditioning is important in many places, but there are other ways to keep buildings cool. Buildings can use natural light and fresh air. They can also have thicker walls to keep out the heat during the day and release it at night. These ideas can help reduce the need for air-conditioning.

**Sundials**

Sundials are tools that tell time by the sun's position. People are interested in sundials again as we start a new millennium. A hundred years ago, sundials were important for keeping time. But as clocks and watches got better, sundials became just garden decorations. Now, people are taking sundials seriously again. David Harber, who makes sundials, thinks they are special because they connect us to the planets. He says there is a magical moment when a sundial starts working. Sundials are calm and romantic objects that remind us of our place in the universe.

**Paint Your Own China**

I used to think china-painting was only for very skilled people. I once saw older women painting teacups with perfect flowers. They were very good, and their hands never shook. I wondered who would want to learn china-painting. Would beginners be as good? When I visited a china-painting class, I found it was not scary at all. The students were there to have fun, and even the teacher did not want to paint quickly like the women I saw before."
CPE_47,"**The Wrong Country**

Uncle chose a holiday for Keith and Dawne. It was a good price: a flight from Gatwick Airport and twelve nights in Venice at the Pensione Concordia. When they went to the travel agency, the clerk said the other people on the trip were a school group learning Italian. But something went wrong. Keith and Dawne ended up in a hotel called the Edelweiss, in Room 212, in Switzerland.

At Gatwick, they gave their tickets to a girl in a yellow-and-red uniform. She checked their tickets and said everything was fine. On the plane, they heard people speaking with North of England accents. Keith thought maybe the Italian class was on another plane. They ordered drinks and relaxed.

When they arrived, a woman with glasses said, ""The coach will take us on."" Keith thought it was an overnight stop. It was late, and they were tired, so they didn't ask questions. But the next morning, they realized they were staying there for the whole holiday. The receptionist said they could enjoy the lake and take a boat to Interlaken.

Keith told the receptionist there was a mistake. They were supposed to be in Venice. The receptionist said their group was booked for twelve nights in the Edelweiss Hotel. Dawne described the man who made the booking. A woman named Mrs. Franks, who they saw at Gatwick, came over. She explained that many holidays have similar tickets and labels.

Keith insisted they were not meant to be in Switzerland. Mrs. Franks said she would check and left. Keith thought about everything that happened: giving the tickets, waiting, and getting on the plane. An old man named Nottage talked to them, saying he and his wife slept well because of the lakeside air.

Keith and Dawne left the reception area. They didn't say it, but they knew it was ironic. On their first holiday since their honeymoon, they ended up with a group of elderly people, even though they wanted to get away from the needs of the elderly. Uncle had said so himself when they asked him to come with them."
CPE_48,"Text: 'HE WAS A PEOPLE PERSON American business leaders are learning from the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton. Eluned Price reports. Many people in Britain know who Sir Ernest Shackleton was and what he did. In America, he is becoming popular now. The Wall Street Journal called Shackleton 'an Antarctic explorer whose achievements were mostly unnoticed for most of the 20th century.' But now, Americans are very interested in him. Books about Shackleton's journey on the Endurance are being written, and they are expected to sell quickly. The American Museum of Natural History is having a big exhibition, and Columbia Tristar is making a movie about Shackleton's life. Some American managers see Shackleton as a role model. They talk about his actions with admiration and learn lessons in leadership and communication from him. They even say they are 'speaking Shackleton.' Shackleton, with his reindeer sleeping bag and blubber-stove, is now a model for modern management consultants. Jim MacGregor, a manager in New York, has used Shackleton as a role model for years. His company helps with communication during business problems. For example, if a company's factory explodes or if many workers lose their jobs. Shackleton also worked in public relations for a Glasgow steel company. It might be hard to see how surviving in freezing temperatures relates to managing a business crisis. 'Even if a company handles its problems well, it can still cause harm by not communicating well,' says MacGregor. 'Shackleton is a model for management because he was a good leader and communicator. He had strong values. He was at his best when he and his team had a lot to lose, like their lives. One of Shackleton's most important decisions was to turn back when he was only 97 miles from the South Pole. This decision showed his credibility for the next expedition: the lives of his men were most important.' This refers to Shackleton's 1908 expedition to the South Pole. He turned back 97 miles from the goal because of delays and low supplies. In a crisis, says MacGregor, people want to know someone is in charge. Today, managers often avoid responsibility, but Shackleton was ready to take it. His 1914 expedition became legendary. His ship, the Endurance, was stuck in ice for nine months and then crushed. When it sank, Shackleton told his men, 'we will all be safe if you do your best and trust me.' From diaries and accounts, it is clear that Shackleton was always in charge. 'Shackleton planned for everything, kept his men informed, and asked for their opinions,' says MacGregor. 'He was flexible and ready to start over if needed. We have created a set of principles that Shackleton shows. Clients can relate to his story without feeling criticized.' Shackleton believed an explorer needs optimism, physical endurance, and patience. 'One of the hardest things to do in difficult times is to do nothing, especially in America, where people want quick solutions,' says MacGregor. 'If you buy bonds and the interest rates are wrong, you wait, and eventually, you'll get your money back. To sell quickly would mean a big loss. Also, don't be afraid to change plans if they aren't working. If a new product is bad, stop selling it.' Shackleton led by example. On the way back from the Endurance, he saw Hurley, the expedition photographer, without gloves. He gave Hurley his own gloves, saying he would throw them overboard if Hurley didn't wear them. Someone else remembered him doing the same with a biscuit when they were starving in 1905: 'He said he'd leave it in the snow. Millions of pounds couldn't have bought that biscuit.' Caroline Alexander, author of Endurance, says: 'People want to hear about heroic actions more and more. Shackleton shows that there is nothing heroic happening now. Everything else fades away, and he stands as the true example of the ideals we miss today.'"
CAE_15,"Text: 'Finding Food in Madagascar In the forests of Madagascar, there is a special animal called the aye-aye. It lives like a woodpecker. Both the woodpecker and the aye-aye look for insect larvae inside wood. The woodpecker uses its beak to make holes and its long tongue to get the insects. The aye-aye uses its teeth to make holes and its long, thin third finger to reach the insects. Scientists have known about the aye-aye's way of eating for over a hundred years. But they have only recently learned how it finds insects inside the wood. Dr. Carl Erickson from Duke University studied the aye-aye's hunting skills. He worked with two male aye-ayes, Nosferatu and Poe, a female, Samantha, and her baby, Annabelle. Dr. Erickson wanted to know if the aye-ayes found insects by seeing signs on the wood. He gave them logs with holes. Some holes had mealworms, and some were empty. The aye-ayes went straight to the holes with food, without needing to see signs. Dr. Erickson also tested if they used smell or sound to find the insects. The aye-ayes could find mealworms even when they couldn't smell or hear them. So, how did they find the insects? Dr. Erickson found that aye-ayes tap the wood with their middle finger and listen with their big ears. They might be using echo-location, like bats, to find empty spaces in the wood. They can also hear insects move when they tap. The idea that the aye-aye is like a woodpecker in Madagascar is interesting. But there are birds in Madagascar that also look for insects in wood. The aye-aye is not only like a woodpecker and a bat, but also like a squirrel. Its teeth grow all the time, like a squirrel's. It can also open nuts and eat the inside with its long finger.'"
CAE_19,"Text: 'Ordinary people, ordinary lives Many of us have photos of our grandparents, but do we know what their lives were like when they were young? Old diaries and family stories often don't tell us much. And what will our grandchildren know about us? We often plan to write things down but never do. We might leave videos, but they are still just images. Hannah Renier has an idea: she writes autobiographies for other people. She creates a book of at least 20,000 words, with pictures if wanted, about ordinary people. The idea came when she talked to her family and saw how much of the past was disappearing. ""When I started, I didn't take it so seriously,"" she says. ""But now I see people enjoy talking about their lives. They do it for their children or the future, but they also enjoy it themselves."" People feel safe to be honest with her. A 62-year-old man who lost and made a fortune said, ""I was surprised at what I shared. Some things were painful, like my divorce."" He did it for his family but hasn't let his children read it yet. ""If they insist, I'll let them. But I'd rather they read it after I'm gone."" He saw patterns from his childhood in his life. Ms. Renier noticed this in others too. ""Many people are influenced by their parents,"" she says. ""Things from childhood affect them all their lives. They marry people their parents liked or do the opposite to rebel."" ""Many people still feel disappointed about things with their parents, even 60 years later. They try to impress a parent who wasn't impressed."" Ms. Renier listens but doesn't judge. ""It's not for the public, and I'm not nosy. People sometimes tell me things and then say, 'I'm not sure if that should go in.' I include it, but they can remove it later. People want to be honest."" ""It's not about showing off. Life is moving fast, and we forget the past. This gives us roots. We need a link to our ancestors because families don't stay together as much now. People want a little immortality."" Each book takes up to 30 hours of interviews. Ms. Renier uses these to write the life story, organizing and interpreting it. Modern technology helps her make everything except the book cover. The book is for a private audience and costs nearly £3,000, with extra copies at £25 each. She gets about 10 inquiries a week, but the cost stops many people. ""I thought it would be cheaper,"" she says. ""But the people I've worked with are often wealthy, like readers of Harpers & Queen, where I advertise. They are the kind of people who used to have portraits painted for their descendants.""'"

The Cambridge Brass Rubbing Centre is the second oldest and longest-running centre of its kind in the world. It is a unique tourist attraction. You can enjoy making wall hangings by rubbing one of over a hundred brass plates from tombs of medieval knights and ladies. The centre has made resin copies, called facsimiles, to preserve the originals and make brass rubbing available to everyone. Brass plates were used as memorials and spread from Germany across medieval Europe and Scandinavia. Most original brasses were destroyed, but many are still in Britain, and the Cambridge Centre has a wide range of examples."

I have had small children for 35 years because of my unusual personal life. I love being a father. I fed the baby this morning, and that is what being a father means to me. I am lucky because my children and I love the same things: opera, theatre, books, and music. This makes us close, especially now that they are older. I try to be available for them, but I don't call them often. I wait for them to call me. My parents used to make me feel guilty for not calling, and I don't want to do that to my children.

**B. The Advertising Executive**

I was about 25 when my children were born. It was hard for me to handle the responsibilities, but it also kept me young. As they grew up, they showed me new music and fashion, which helped me in my job. I missed some important events when they were young because I was busy with work, but now I can take them on nice holidays. They like coming to parties and events with us. They think my job is exciting.

**C. The Politician**

My first child was born when I was starting my political career. My wife and I wanted to spend time with our children, but my job makes it hard. I try to take them with me to weekend meetings so they know what I do. This way, they don't feel like I am gone all the time. More politicians are bringing their kids to work now, which is good.

**D. The Writer**

My first marriage ended when my children, Kate and Bonnie, were young. I tried hard to stay close to them. My ex-wife and I even lived next to each other for a while, but it was confusing for the kids. Kate says I was always there for her, but I think I treated them like adults too soon. I wish I had been more organized. I still worry about my older daughters as much as my youngest. Your kids are always your kids.

I was ready to have children when I turned 30. My wife and I had a nice house, so we decided to have a child instead of buying more things. Having my daughter Betty made me think about who I am. Being a parent is special, but it also makes you like other parents. Sometimes I feel annoyed, but Betty's smile makes everything better. A baby's smile can make anyone happy."

CAE_46,"**Science and Weightlessness**

Journalist Tom Mumford joins students testing their ideas in weightlessness. The aircraft looked normal from the outside. The pilot told the young passengers it was a Boeing KC-135, built in 1964. But inside, it was different. It was a long white tunnel with lights on the walls. Most seats were removed, except a few at the back. The 13 students from Europe and America sat there, looking nervous.

For a year, they competed with other students to join this flight. The European Space Agency asked for creative experiments to do in weightlessness. The best ideas won a place on this special flight. The flight was like a roller-coaster. For two hours, the plane flew up and down. At the top of each curve, the pilot cut the engines. The plane went higher by itself before falling back to Earth. In those few seconds, everything inside became weightless. The students felt like they were closer to the moon than Earth.

The plane took off smoothly. But soon, the pilot made the plane climb at a 45-degree angle for 20 seconds. The engines were loud, and blood drained from our heads. Then the engines stopped, and we felt weightless. For 20 seconds, we floated. The floor felt like a trampoline, and one step sent us to the ceiling. We floated without direction. After ten seconds, the pilot pulled the plane out of its dive. Gravity returned, and some students landed hard. There were 30 curves in total, giving ten minutes for experiments.

The Dutch students studied their robotic cat, Leonardo, to see how cats land on their feet. They used a device to turn it belly-down. A German team studied how metal joins in space. A team from Utah State University tried to make solar sails from thin films. They believe these sails could use the sun's radiation like a yacht uses the wind.

After two hours, we felt a bit sick, but mostly excited. One student said, ""It was unforgettable. I wanted to be an astronaut, and now I want it even more."""
CAE_3,"Text: 'With the trees, I planted my stake in New Zealand JONATHON PORRITT TALKS TO DANNY DANZIGER Jonathon Porritt is the author of Seeing Green - The Politics of Ecology'. I had a strange time in my life when I didn't have any summers. I went to New Zealand every summer here, which is winter in New Zealand, so I had nine winters in a row. I like winter, so it was great. My parents had an idea to buy a small piece of land for my brother, sister, and me to take care of. My mother said, 'If you plant trees on it, you can have it.' This way, we would always have a connection to New Zealand, which was nice because my father grew up there. They found land about 20 miles north of Auckland in a place called Rangitoupuni. The land wasn't very good, but it was okay for planting trees. I have always liked land. I spent a year in Australia working on sheep farms and other farm jobs, so planting trees sounded nice, and I was excited. The rest of the family got excited too. I started planting in 1968, and by the end of 1972, we had planted all 70 acres. In New Zealand in 1968, it rained a lot, almost every day we were planting. I was never wetter or colder for so long, but it was a happy time. Every morning, I got ready for planting. I came out of the Land Rover warm and dry, but it was raining, and my clothes were still wet from the day before. My boots were wet, and my hands were cold. In the first year, I had a man to help me who knew how to plant trees, which was helpful because I had never done it seriously before. You have a bag around your neck full of trees, and when it's full, it's hard, but it gets easier as it gets lighter. The hardest part was making the lines straight. You decide how far apart to plant the trees, then line up three poles to guide you. Once in line, you plant all the way down, turn around, and come back. I like hard work, and it made me fit. After a while, you can plant trees almost automatically. You get used to a rhythm, using the fewest spade strokes to dig the hole. The rhythm is important, and many farm jobs are like this. You train your body to do the same moves, and it becomes easy: take the tree out of the bag, dig a hole, put it in, stamp it down, and move on. Mentally, it's interesting. Your mind starts to think about different things. Many of my thoughts about nature and our place in it started then. I've been back to New Zealand four times since then and watched the trees grow, which is satisfying. I worry when I read about bad weather in New Zealand because I care about the trees. But it worked out well, and the trees are now 20 years old and healthy. I took time off from teaching and went back in 1984 for three months alone. I wrote my first book, Seeing Green, there. There's a small cabin on the tree farm with just a bed, table, and chair. I wrote in the mornings, pruned trees in the afternoons, and did research in the evenings. I still feel a strong connection to that place. It's where I feel most connected to the earth.'"
CAE_10,"**Bringing Up Badgers**

""What now?"" I thought when a helper handed me a cardboard box. My husband Derek and I have an open farm in Somerset, where we care for orphaned animals. The noise from the box was strange, so I looked inside. I saw three small grey badger cubs, each about eight inches long. Their fur was soft, and their eyes were milky-colored. I had never seen badger cubs before. Most are born between January and March and stay underground. If they lose their mother, they often die of hunger. These cubs were found by builders who accidentally dug into their home. The mother was dead, and the cubs were still with her. They were healthy but cold and crying. I cleaned them and put them by the stove for warmth. There were two females, Primrose and Bluebell, and a male, Willow. I fed them with a syringe and wiped them with a warm cloth to help them go to the bathroom. For the first few days, they ate every four hours. Soon, they drank from a bottle and moved around a bit. They seemed happy with each other and a heated pad as a substitute 'mum'.

Three weeks later, Willow seemed tired but still ate normally. I didn't realize it was a warning sign. The next morning, I found him dead. The vet said he had a lung infection. When bottle-feeding, it's important not to let the animal drink too fast, or liquid can go into the lungs. This happened to Willow, and he got an infection. I was sad but continued caring for the others. Six days later, a local farmer brought me another male cub, also named Willow. He was found cold and hungry. Willow II was hard to feed. I had to move the bottle around in his mouth to get him to drink. By the end of April, the females ate creamed rice and other foods. Willow II was different. He struggled to eat without making a mess. Eventually, he ate a sausage, and after a week, he was ready for other foods.

At nearly five months old, they ate cereals for breakfast, meat and vegetables for lunch, and fruit, nuts, cheese, eggs, and seeds in the evening. Badgers usually eat earthworms, beetles, bugs, and small animals. My badgers were lucky because the summer was hot, and finding earthworms was hard. By August, the cubs became more active at night. We often walked through the orchard, and they played and chased each other. Derek joined us sometimes but didn't learn to avoid their playful bites.

During these walks, I saw other badgers in our field. They were looking for food because of the dry weather. Badgers are territorial and can be aggressive. We were warned they might harm our cubs, so we made the pen secure. The local press took pictures of me with the badgers, and we started a project to build a home for them. With help, we designed a new home with tunnels and a gate. It had three rooms, one with a glass side for viewing. As we built it, the badgers explored it. They soon forgot about walks and enjoyed their new home. The building cost more than expected, but a local bus company and other businesses helped. Everyone wanted the badgers to have a home. One evening, they moved in. Later, I checked on them and saw them sleeping peacefully.

Now, I don't walk with them as often because they are active late at night. We see Primrose sometimes, as she joined another group, but Bluebell and Willow II still greet us before going off into the night. This is their home now, a place they know well and have accepted."
CAE_67,"Text: 'Looking for true north - and the man behind Halley's comet Dr. Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, wants to follow Sir Edmund Halley's journey to study compass changes. Anjana Ahuja reports. Astronomer Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) is famous for the comet named after him. But one of his important achievements was to study compass 'variations' during his sea trips on the ship Paramore. These variations, now called 'declination', are the angle between magnetic north and true north. Without knowing this, sailors could not correct their compasses and find their way across the oceans. Halley, one of the few people paid to do scientific research at that time, sailed to the Cape Verde Islands to study declination in the Atlantic Ocean. The trip stopped early because of problems with the crew, but Halley tried again. This time, he traveled to Rio de Janeiro, South Georgia, Newfoundland, and back to England. From these trips, Halley published a map in 1701 showing compass variations in the oceans. This map was very useful to sailors for over a hundred years until changes in Earth's magnetic field made it less accurate. Dr. Clark, who also loves sailing, plans to celebrate the 300th anniversary of Halley's trip by following the same route. He needs to raise £70,000 for the trip, and Sir Vivian Fuchs, who led the first expedition across Antarctica, is helping him. Dr. Clark became interested in Halley while working in Antarctica, where he read about Halley's life. 'Halley had an amazing life,' says Dr. Clark. 'He was a respected scientist and led expeditions. He was not just an astronomer but also did research in geophysics. While he was Astronomer Royal, he mapped the stars and also helped Sir Isaac Newton with his famous book, Principia Mathematica.' Dr. Clark believes that recreating the voyage will give Halley the recognition he deserves. The new expedition, called 'In the Wake of the Paramore', will also have scientific value. It will involve making the same measurements Halley did, but with better tools. These measurements are important because Earth's magnetic field is always changing. The data will help improve the current model of Earth's magnetic field. 'It is common to measure the size but not the direction of the magnetic field. That's because you need to know true north to measure the direction,' says Dr. Clark. 'On our expedition, we can use global positioning satellites to find that.' The British Geological Survey and the United States Navy will provide instruments. A Danish satellite will also be taking similar measurements around the world. Dr. Clark hopes his measurements will fill any gaps in the satellite's data over the Atlantic Ocean. Halley's Atlantic journey was very important. It was the first scientific sea expedition, and Halley was the first civilian made a naval captain to study declination. Does Dr. Clark have the skills to make his journey a success? He spent two years in Antarctica and works in the geomagnetic group at the British Geological Survey. He has also sailed 13,000 kilometers from Rio de Janeiro to England. He plans to complete the expedition in four stages with four different crews. Does he share Halley's passion? 'I am ready to give up my life for eight months to do this, so some people might think I'm obsessed. But I wouldn't want to sail across the Atlantic again without a good reason. Halley and his amazing life have given me a real sense of purpose.'"
CAE_27,"Text: 'PEACOCKS AND THEIR TAILS Every summer, peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire show their beautiful tails to the female peacocks, called hens. This display puzzled Charles Darwin, who wondered why peacocks have such big tails in a world where animals need to be strong and fast to survive. Darwin thought animals evolved through natural selection, meaning the strongest and smartest survive. But the peacock's tail seemed to be a problem, not a help. So, Darwin suggested another idea called 'sexual selection'. He thought females liked beauty, so they chose males with beautiful tails. Darwin's friend, Alfred Russel Wallace, had a different idea. He believed that if hens chose males with big tails, those males must have other good qualities. Wallace thought the tail was a sign of something important for survival. Today, scientists like Marion Petrie study peacocks at Whipsnade to find answers. They want to know if hens really choose males with the best tails and if those males have other good qualities. Observations show that hens prefer males with more eye-spots on their tails. But it's still unclear if these males are better in other ways. Some scientists think showy males might be healthier and have fewer parasites. Marion Petrie is studying if the children of attractive males grow faster and are healthier. This could mean hens choose mates for practical reasons, as Wallace thought. Another idea, called 'Fisher's Runaway', suggests that if females start choosing males with slightly better tails, over time, tails will get longer because both sons and daughters inherit these traits. This could support Darwin's idea that females choose beauty for beauty's sake.'"
CAE_66,"**THE BOAT OF MY DREAMS**

Tom Cunliffe believes the best boat design should mix old and new ideas. He did this with his boat, 'The Westerman'. This week, the Summer Boat Show in London has many new yachts with the latest technology. Most of these boats are from a design change that happened 25 years ago. My boat, however, is on a quiet creek on the south coast. It was designed last year, but it looks like it is 100 years old. People might think I am a romantic dreamer, but I am not sure about that. My boat uses old boat design ideas, but modern technology helped make it better. 

Modern technology is important in boat design and building, but it can make sailing too easy. Some people go to sea to experience the challenges of sailing. I think it's important for boats to have some comforts, like a stove for warmth and good places to sleep. But if everything on the boat is automatic, it takes away from the experience. For example, setting and taking down sails should be part of sailing. 

Some boats have steering positions in the middle, which makes more room inside, but I think a boat should feel like a boat, not a house. My old boat, Hirta, had comforts but no luxury. It had heavy sails, no electric water pump, no fridge, and no electronics, but it was the best boat I ever sailed. 

Old boats need a lot of care. After I hurt my back, I had to sell Hirta. I couldn't find a new boat I liked, so I decided to build one. The Westerman was designed by Nigel Irens and Ed Burnett. They started with a drawing on a napkin, then used a computer to finish the design. The boat was made like old boats, with a model first. The final design was perfect. 

The Westerman has crossed the North Atlantic and won races. It looks timeless and is comfortable at sea. The inside is made from old wood and feels peaceful. The boat was designed for sailing, not for furniture. It shows that you don't need to follow new trends to be happy. The boat is made from wood treated with glue, so it doesn't let water in. It has the benefits of a modern boat but looks and feels like a traditional one."

Health farms and country house hotels with spa facilities are very popular. We asked five journalists to visit some of these places.

**A. HENLOW GRANGE**

I was happy to visit Henlow Grange for six days because I was tired and needed to relax. My room in the big 18th-century house was very comfortable. On the first day, I did nothing and slept a lot. From the second day, I joined many classes like yoga and body conditioning. The instructors are very good. I felt more flexible as the week went on. They offer many treatments like aromatherapy, seaweed baths, and facials. The staff are friendly and professional. Henlow is planning to add a new swimming pool and a Light Diet Room. You can also ride bicycles or walk in the garden. I left feeling happy and full of energy. I want to visit again. This is a great break for a busy working woman. Save Room 5 for me! - Marcella D'Argy Smith

**B. SHRUBLAND HALL**

This calm and relaxing place felt peaceful as soon as I arrived. The Hall has a beautiful library and conservatory. When you arrive, you get a medical check-up. They check your weight and blood pressure. I was called a patient, which was strange because I am healthy. But they found a shoulder problem and helped me with it. Each person gets a special diet. I lost weight but felt hungry and got a headache on the second day. My meals included grapefruit, salads, and fruit with yogurt. You can have a massage or water therapy every other day. Extra treatments are not too expensive. - Liz Gregory

**C. CAREYS MANOR**

Careys is not a health farm. It is a nice old manor with warm fires and a big lounge. If you want to lose weight, you might skip the rich food. The French chef makes delicious dishes. The hotel has a gym and pool to help burn calories. There is also a spa bath, steam room, and sauna. They have a sports injury clinic. I got advice for my shoulder injury. Careys is comfortable and relaxing. You can also explore the countryside. - Beverly D'Silva

**D. CLIVEDEN**

Cliveden is a grand country home and a five-star hotel. It offers health and beauty treatments, a gym, saunas, a pool, tennis, and horse riding. There are beautiful walks and gardens. Waldo's restaurant has amazing food. The menu is long, and the food is delicious. I enjoyed a facial and an aromatherapy massage. Cliveden has many fitness and beauty options if you want them. - Kay Letch

**E. SPRINGS HYDRO**

The best and worst thing about Springs Hydro is the carrot cake. It is delicious but has 360 calories, which is not good if you want to lose weight. The aromatherapy massage is also great. I chose relaxing oils and had a very good sleep. The place is modern and well-run, with many treatments available. Guests include football teams, families, and friends. I would like to visit once a month. - Eve Cameron"
CAE_22,"**Natural Talents**

Humans and chimpanzees are very similar. We are more than 98% the same in our genes. This means that the things that make us different from animals are new in our history. Our ability to make art and do other human things comes from a small part of our genes. 

Animals and humans share many skills. For example, chimpanzees use sticks as tools, and sea otters use rocks to open clams. Monkeys have simple language with different sounds for 'leopard', 'eagle', and 'snake'. These examples show that the differences between us and animals are not big.

The first human art might have been wood carvings or body painting, but we can't find these because they don't last. The first clear human art we know of is from the Cro-Magnons, about 35,000 years ago. They made cave paintings, statues, necklaces, and musical instruments.

People say human art is different because it is not useful, it is made for beauty, and it is learned, not instinctive. Let's look at these ideas:

1. **Not Useful**: Oscar Wilde said, ""All art is quite useless."" Human art doesn't help us survive or have children. Birdsong, for example, helps birds find mates and protect their area, which helps them pass on their genes. By this idea, human art is different.

2. **Made for Beauty**: Humans make art for pleasure. We can't ask birds if they sing for beauty, but they mostly sing during mating season, so it might not be for pleasure. This makes human art seem unique.

3. **Learned, Not Instinctive**: Human art styles are learned. For example, songs in Tokyo and Paris are different, but people can learn each other's songs. Some birds, however, are born knowing their songs. If a French baby grew up in Japan, it wouldn't sing French songs naturally. Human art changes quickly, unlike animal sounds that stay the same for thousands of years.

In the 1950s, two chimpanzees named Congo and Betsy made paintings. Their art was shown in a London gallery, and many paintings were sold. These paintings were not made for a specific purpose, just like human art. Some people might say human art is different because it communicates, but even some famous human art was made for personal satisfaction."
CAE_39,"**A Big Adventure**

The Taklamakan Desert in western China is one of the last places on earth that people have not explored. It is also very dangerous. Charles Blackmore crossed it and survived to tell his story.

There are not many big adventures left and not many heroes. In the past, children's stories often had brave explorers with sunburnt skin and eyes looking far into the distance on their journeys. Today, you don't find such people in stories or real life. But then I met Charles Blackmore.

Blackmore's big adventure was leading a team across the Taklamakan Desert in western China. The name means 'once entered you never come out', but local people call it the Desert of Death. He talked about the dangers and excitement of the journey at his home.

The team had four Britons (one was a doctor), an American photographer, four Chinese experts, 30 camels, and six camel handlers. The camel handlers had never worked with camels before; they were truck drivers. This mistake could have been very dangerous for the team.

This group started to cross 1,200 kilometers of the desert. Charles Blackmore wrote a book about their journey. At that time, he was leaving the Army after 14 years. He started the expedition for fun and to learn more about himself. 'I always thought I would stay in the Army. I was offered a promotion, but I wanted to see who I really was outside the Army. It was a big risk. My wife, Tina, was worried because nobody had done that route before. We went into it without knowing what to expect. In the end, it took 59 days to cross from west to east, and the desert was kind to us.'

Anyone reading his story might wonder why he said the desert was 'kind'. The team faced many problems: illness, very hot and cold temperatures, thirst, and losing some of their water. 'But', Blackmore says, 'when we were very tired and the camels had no water for seven days, we found some. We didn't have the desert's famous sandstorms. And we didn't face the very cold weather that could have stopped us. But we had many challenges. The sand got into everything, especially blisters and wounds. The high dunes were hard to climb for us and the camels, which sometimes fell on us.'

'What kept me going was the need to survive. We had no backup plan. We didn't have the money or time for one. No planes flew over us. Once we were in the sandhills, we were alone. I knew I was mentally strong, but I was scared about my physical strength. I remember the first day -- we sat at the edge of the desert, and it was so hot you couldn't breathe. I thought, ""We have to do it now!"" I was very scared.'

If it was like that at the start, how did they feel at the end? 'When you've walked 1,000 kilometers, you don't give up. You've gone through so much. We were very thin but strong. My body was fit, and my legs were strong. I could walk over anything.'

In the middle of the book, Blackmore talks about lying in the desert, looking at the moon, and thinking of his family. How did he feel about what his family went through? 'Inside me, there's someone trying to find peace. When I doubt myself now, I think of the desert and how we did it. I am prouder of that expedition than anything else. But when I think of my life, I think of my family and our happiness. Compared to that, the desert is not as important.'

Has Charles Blackmore found peace? 'I miss the challenge and the open spaces. We had a strong sense of purpose. Now, I find it hard to be part of the sameness of modern life.'"
CAE_18,"Text: Susan Harr was feeling stressed, so she decided to unplug her gadgets and enjoy doing things by hand. Many people love technology because it gives us gadgets that make life easier. But Susan started to think that maybe we rely too much on technology. She had a bad experience with her broken word processor, which was expensive to fix. This made her wonder if gadgets are worth the trouble and cost.

Susan began to let her household gadgets stop working as they got old. She questioned what ""extra time"" technology really gives us. Is it just time to buy more gadgets? She thinks maybe we are being tricked by marketing experts. When her sewing machine started making strange noises, she decided to stop using it. Now, she sews by hand and enjoys it. She can take her sewing anywhere and doesn't have to worry about noisy machines.

There are some gadgets Susan still likes, like the washing machine. But she found joy in getting rid of others, like the color TV. Now, her family spends more time walking the dog, reading, and talking. Susan also enjoys sewing by hand. She listens to the radio or talks with family while sewing. It makes her feel relaxed and happy.

Susan realized that doing things by hand is not as hard as she thought. It is calming and satisfying to see her work improve. She doesn't feel rushed anymore and enjoys simple tasks like washing dishes. Now, she looks around her house and wonders if they really need things like the freezer or microwave. She thinks they could save money by using fewer gadgets."
CAE_62,"Text: 'The Cabinet-Maker Charles Hurst makes a living from making beautiful furniture. Joanna Watt meets him. Charles Hurst seems like a man in a hurry. I arrive at his workshop, which is under a railway arch in East London. He greets me with a quick handshake and says, 'Well, fire away then!' It is not clear if he is really in a hurry or just shy. But his workshop shows he is busy. There are many half-made pieces of furniture and planks of wood in different natural colors. Hurst has been a cabinet-maker for ten years and has a good reputation. His order book is always full for months, even though he does not advertise. People know that if you want a good cupboard, table, bookcase, or kitchen units, Hurst is the person to go to. Finding a furniture-maker is not hard, but finding one who makes beautiful furniture with simple lines is not easy. 'There are few real cabinet-makers now. People call themselves furniture-makers,' Hurst says. He is disappointed by some modern furniture. 'I am amazed by what some furniture-makers get away with, and saddened by what people will accept.' He does not like bad, mass-produced furniture. Hurst wants perfection, and this is a key to his success. He is also talented. He is confident about his ability. 'I have a huge natural ability,' he says. 'I have always been good at making things.' Hurst is self-taught. How did he learn? 'I asked the right questions and picked it all up,' he says. Most of his work comes from private people. Some clients come back many times. 'You end up doing the whole of their house. That is very satisfying.' But he admits that working with clients is not always easy. 'The most annoying clients are those who don't know what they want, and then decide they do when it's too late ... my favorite clients are the exacting ones.' Hurst is happy with his work but also praises others. 'There are people far better than me. I can admire other people. After all, I wasn't trained at Parnham' (a top furniture design school). He is critical of craftsmen who 'are trying to be artists and take a year to make one piece.' He also does not like degree shows where students try to make fashion statements. 'A piece of furniture is not about making a statement. It has to be something that people really can use.' Hurst is confident but not pretentious. As I leave, he says, 'After all, I am only making furniture.''"
CAE_49,"Text: 'Three ideas about why we sleep People spend about one-third of their lives sleeping. This means sleep is very important. But, we are not sure why sleep is so important. Scientists have three main ideas. The first idea is that sleep helps our body stay healthy. When we sleep, our body fixes any problems from the day and makes us ready for the next day. The second idea is that sleep helps us learn. It says that sleep helps us remember what we learn during the day. Without sleep, we might not learn well. The third idea is about energy. It says we need sleep to get more energy for the next day.'"
CAE_31,"**Eccentrics**

An eccentric is a person who acts differently from most people. They do not follow the usual rules of their society. This makes us ask, ""What is normal?"" Many of us have our own little habits. Some people love entering newspaper contests, collecting beer mats, or writing letters to newspapers about many topics. Eccentricity is about being unique. Inside us, there is a fight between wanting to be different and wanting to fit in. It is like having two trains pushing against each other. One train is called individualism, and the other is conformity. Most people want to fit in, be liked, and feel part of a group. This is stronger than wanting to be different.

People with unusual hobbies or strong opinions often find others like them. They form clubs and have meetings to talk about their interests. They want to share what others might think is strange. Being in a group, even a small one, feels good. We all feel a pull between being ourselves and fitting in. We might say we are different, like when someone at a bar says, ""I say what I think,"" or when a new person says, ""You must take me as you find me.""

Anyone can choose to be more individual. Many successful people have done this. For example, Bob Dylan, an American singer, said, ""When you feel in your gut what you are doing and then dynamically pursue it - don't back down and don't give up - then you're going to mystify a lot of folk."" But being different on purpose is not the same as being eccentric. If a pop singer wears strange clothes for attention or a hostess says shocking things to be noticed, that is not eccentricity. If they keep doing these things until they cannot act 'normal' anymore, then they might be eccentric.

The key to being eccentric is being natural. Eccentrics do not try to be odd; they just are. They do not care about what others think. They do what they do because of who they are. This makes them different from people who are very aware of the world, like enthusiasts, practical jokers, or exhibitionists. These people react to the world around them. Some want to impress society, and some want to escape it, but they all think about society. Eccentrics just live their lives without worrying about what others think."
CAE_58,"**Natural Books**

We asked four nature experts to tell us about the wildlife book that influenced them the most.

**A Geoffrey Lean**

Choosing the author was easy for me. As an environmental journalist, I have met many important people in this field. None are more important than Barbara Ward, a small, frail woman who was at the center of environmental issues in post-war Europe. She turned her experiences into a strong philosophy. As a young journalist, she helped me understand the field. Choosing the book was harder. It could have been ""Only One Earth"" or ""Progress for a Small Planet."" But ""The Home of Man"" is, to me, her most important book. It talks about the fast growth of cities and the big themes she cared about. It is a strong call for what we now call 'sustainable human development'. I have read many books since, but none are as good.

**B Linda Bennett**

When I read ""Signals for Survival"" by Niko Tinbergen, I can hear the calls of herring gulls and remember the smell of the colony. This book explains animal communication with words and pictures. After reading it, watching a gull colony changes from chaos to an organized social structure. You can see which birds are partners and recognize families. Niko Tinbergen was a great behaviorist who wanted to explain his findings to everyone. He worked with Eric Ennion, a talented wildlife artist, to create this book. Ennion's paintings show how one gull is aggressive and another is peaceful. This is the work of a true field naturalist.

**C Lee Durrell**

""My Family and Other Animals"" by Gerald Durrell is the book that influenced my life the most. It led me to a wonderful husband and a career in conservation. This book defined my love for the natural world. I was researching animal sounds in Madagascar when I first read it. I was discouraged by setbacks, but reading this book made the world brighter. It shows animals, people, joy, and beauty together. Many say humans are the worst because of the harm we do, but I think of Gerald as a boy in the book, seeing the world as a family. This is a concept we all need to understand.

**D Bruce Pearson**

I found ""The Shell Bird Book"" by James Fisher in my school library after it was published in 1966. I was drawn to the 48 color plates of birds by Eric Ennion. I already had other bird books and learned to identify birds during holidays. They encouraged me to sketch birds to help identify them. ""The Shell Bird Book"" had more to offer. It had chapters on bird migration, the history of birds in Britain, and birds in music, literature, and art. This book showed me that my emotional and creative response to nature was as valid as a scientific one. As art was my strong subject, I saw a new path opening for me."
CAE_37,"Title: Do Reviews Help Sell Books?

We asked five big British publishers if book reviews help sell books. Here is what they said:

**Publisher A**  
Reviews are very important for publishers. Many people buy books because of reviews more than ads or word of mouth. Authors and publishers both feel bad if there are no reviews. But publishers think any review, good or bad, can help sell books. They like reviews that agree with their own thoughts about the book.

**Publisher B**  
Publishers and newspapers both care about book reviews, but they want different things. Newspapers want to entertain readers, while publishers want their books reviewed positively. Book reviews are better now than 40 years ago, but paperbacks still don't get enough attention. Reviews help make books and authors known. A good review by a trusted person can increase sales.

**Publisher C**  
Reviews are very important for us. We publish books by authors who are not famous, so we need reviews to help sell them. Good reviews are better than ads because they are honest. Reviews can help a book become popular, but they need help from other things like word of mouth and good marketing.

**Publisher D**  
In the US, a review in the New York Times can make a book popular. In Britain, it is not so clear. Sometimes, books with bad reviews sell well, and good books take a long time to become popular. Non-fiction reviews often talk more about the subject than the book.

**Publisher E**  
Publishers and writers want long, good reviews. But do they sell books? I published a biography with great reviews, but it did not sell well because people felt they knew the book from the reviews. The reviewer's name used to matter more. Now, a surprising reviewer or a fun review can make people want to buy the book."
CAE_2,"Text: 'WEATHERVANE MAKER Making weathervanes is a very old skill, starting in early Egyptian times. Today, Graham Smith keeps this craft alive in his workshop. He is one of the few people in the country who make weathervanes by hand. Graham's designs are special and made to fit what his customers want. 'This way, I can make a unique item,' he says. 'Many of my customers are women buying gifts for their husbands. They want a special gift that shows the man's work or hobbies.' This is different from the usual cockerel design, which is the most common weathervane. Graham's first weathervane was not a cockerel but a witch on a broomstick. He made it as a surprise gift for his wife. Friends liked it and asked him to make weathervanes for them. 'I saw that I could make many different designs,' he says. Graham decided to start a weathervane business. He had worked as a precision engineer for 15 years. Then, he and his wife, Liz, decided to change roles. She went to work as an architectural assistant, and he stayed home to take care of the children and grow the business. That was five years ago, and he is happy with his choice. 'My old job was not artistic, but this is fun and creative,' he says. 'I really like designing.' Graham has made over 100 original designs. He works with great detail and always asks the customer to approve the design before cutting it by hand. Graham also keeps many traditional designs because they are popular. 'People like hand-made things,' Graham says. 'They like to have something a little different.' Graham does not want to expand his business because he wants to keep it as a small craft. 'I have found my place in the market. People love the unique designs, and I enjoy turning a simple shape into something almost real,' he says. 'For many years, weathervanes have helped people know the weather by showing wind direction changes,' he explains. 'Now, more people are moving to the countryside, and they want a special touch for their homes. This helps crafts like mine.' Graham is very busy, sending flat-packed weathervanes to clients around the world. American and Danish buyers are especially interested. 'The price,' he says, 'depends on how detailed the design is.' His latest request was for a curly-coated dog. Whatever the occasion, Graham can make a special gift.'"
CAE_68,"**Beginner Takes All**

Before it was published, *The Horse Whisperer* was already a very popular book. It is the first novel by British screenwriter Nicholas Evans, and it made him a lot of money. Here, he talks about his inspiration and success.

At the start of the year, things were not going well for Nicholas Evans. He was a screenwriter, producer, and wanted to be a director. A film project he was working on, called *Life and Limb*, suddenly failed. He was worried because he had not earned money for two years, and the film was his only hope to pay the bank.

Instead of finding a job, Evans made a surprising decision. He bought a ticket to America to research his first novel. The idea for the story came from a farrier he met on Dartmoor. The farrier told him about a horse that became wild, but a gypsy calmed it by talking to it. These men were called 'horse whisperers'. Evans was interested and started to learn more about them.

He decided to write a book instead of a screenplay. So, he traveled across the US, visiting ranches and learning about horses. He felt alone and worried about his future. By August, he had written half of the book and showed it to a friend who was a literary agent. The agent thought it was ""fine"" and said Evans might get $30,000 for it. Evans needed more money to pay his debts and support his family.

In October, the first part of the book and a summary were sent to seven UK publishers. Soon, his agent called to say they had turned down an offer of $75,000. The book was sold to Transworld Publications in the UK for $550,000 and to Delacorte in the US for $3.15 million, both record amounts for a first novel. Hollywood studios also wanted to make a movie from it.

Evans decided not to write the screenplay for *The Horse Whisperer*. He wanted to stay involved but not be too close to the project. The success of his novel also brought new interest in his film *Life and Limb*, but he was not sure if he wanted to make it anymore. He thought it would be smart to write another novel."
CAE_23,"Text: 'Young Chess Players Bobby Fischer is trying to prove himself again in the world of chess. Chess is now a game for young people. After 20 years away, Bobby Fischer is playing against Boris Spassky. Fischer won the first game, but he is not the same as in 1972. He is 49 years old and not in practice. Spassky is even older. Chess has changed a lot in 20 years. Fischer made chess popular, and now it is more professional. Winning is the main goal for modern players. In international chess, players need strong nerves and stamina, as well as intelligence. The game is very intense: players must make a certain number of moves in a set time, or they lose. Games are longer now, and many are played without breaks. This makes it better for younger players. In the last 30 years, each new world champion has been younger than the one before. Of the top ten players in the world, eight are under 30. The way chess is played has also changed. Players must prepare well before matches, especially because computers have changed chess a lot. A small computer can hold one million chess games and help players study their opponents. In one match, players used teams to find weaknesses in each other's games. The start of a chess game is now studied very carefully. Being well-prepared can decide the game. Today, there are more top players than ever before. Many grandmasters compete for small prize money around the world. Success needs both physical and mental effort. A game can last up to eight hours. Players must stay focused, as a mistake can be very bad. The chess clock adds pressure. The end of a game can be a fast 'time scramble', where players have only seconds to make moves. This is not for thinkers; it is a battle of nerves and will to win. Losing is very painful at the top level. Winning brings happiness and a chance to rest. But one win is not enough to win a tournament. Chess competitions last 9-11 days, with games every day. World championship matches are even harder. In 1984, a match between Anatoli Karpov and Gary Kasparov in Moscow stopped because both players were too tired. Karpov lost about 10kg in weight. Can Fischer succeed? He once said, ""All I want to do is play chess."" This made his leaving chess in 1972 surprising. But it made him a legend. If he returned for money, he will earn a lot. Whatever happens in his match with Spassky, both will become much richer. But if Fischer wants to prove he is still the best, losing could be very sad for him.'"

Nick Grosso is in his early 30s and has written three successful plays. He is now turning his first play, ""Peaches,"" into a movie script. ""It's a low-budget film, but we don't know how low,"" he says. ""It won't be more than £30 million, but it could be as little as £30."" Before writing ""Peaches,"" Nick had never seen or read a play. ""When I wrote it, I never thought it would be performed,"" he says. ""It's set in a car. I wouldn't do that now because I know it's difficult. I knew nothing back then."" Nick left school at 16 but returned a year later. After finishing his A-levels, he joined the Young People's Theatre. ""I wanted to write for actors. I wanted my writing to be heard, not just read, because of the rhythm and rhyme,"" he says. ""It was the first time I enjoyed being in an educational place. It was very exciting.""

**B. Simon Pegg**

Simon Pegg, 28, has made great progress since studying drama at Bristol University. He is writing a TV comedy series and has just finished a tour with comedy star Steve Coogan. Simon has always worked hard. Even at university, he was performing in comedy clubs. ""University was very theoretical,"" Simon remembers. ""It made me realize I didn't want to be a serious actor. I was more interested in comedy. People think comedy is the hardest job, but it isn't. If you have courage and good material, making people laugh is wonderful."" He has worked with the comedy group Funny Business, but his work with Steve Coogan has been the most successful. ""Steve saw my show, and since I was a big fan of his, he probably saw me copying him,"" Simon admits.

**C. Ciaran McMenamin**

Ciaran McMenamin, 24, became famous when he starred in the series ""The Young Person's Guide To Becoming A Rock Star."" The show was very successful, and his career has grown quickly. ""It's been a great opportunity for me,"" he says. ""Now I can choose what I want to do, which is what I've always wanted."" This is a rare position, especially since he just graduated. Looking at Ciaran's early career, it's clear he was always going to be successful. Encouraged by his mother, he went from school plays to the Ulster Youth Theatre, where he stayed for four years. ""I used acting as an excuse not to do homework,"" Ciaran laughs. ""But then I decided to take it seriously because I was good at it and loved it."" Now he is waiting for more success, but he knows fame is not the most important thing. ""When you're 18, you think you'll love the photos and interviews, but you soon realize it's not about that. It's about getting respect for doing good work.""

**D. Neil Taylor**

Neil Taylor, 25, is the lead singer of the pop band Matrix, which has signed a three-album deal with Domino Records. Neil and his bandmate Rick Brown are expected to be very successful when their single ""Chimera"" is released. ""The record company talks about a big hit, but I don't know. If two people buy it, I'll be happy,"" he says. Unlike many new pop stars, Neil has worked hard for his success. He left school at 16 and has been trying to succeed in music ever since. ""It's funny how things happen,"" he says. ""I was doing student gigs for eight years and was about to give up when I met Rick Brown, who had contacts at Domino, and we formed Matrix. It couldn't have happened at a better time. There were times when I was very depressed, but hopefully, it will all be worth it.""

**E. Stephen Richards**

Stephen Richards, 27, is a poet and author who has won many prizes and awards. He is well-known in the poetry world and has been touring and giving readings for six years. His first novel, ""Hidden,"" will be published in March. ""It's a story of obsessive love. It was a strong idea that I couldn't do as a poem."" Stephen loved creative writing at school but later became unhappy with education. ""I decided not to go to university, but when I got bored with a job at a theatre, I decided to go."" After university, he published his first work, a children's book, in 1992. ""My parents didn't expect me to be a writer. They thought I'd be a reader because that's all I did as a child."" With his poetry being so successful, moving to novels is brave. ""There's a structure with my poetry, so there's less chance to make mistakes,"" he explains. ""A novel can be any length, so there are more chances for bad words. My main goal is not to just produce work without caring about the quality."""
CAE_1,"Text: A. Isabel is an art student who is 31 years old. She likes historical romance stories and is looking for Mr. Right. Isabel thinks she looks good in jeans but doesn't wear them often because she doesn't want to meet the wrong people. She worries about her knees but stays hopeful. The story is fun and exciting, like an old silent movie. B. This story is about a local radio station in America. A smart child named Francis With works for WLT Radio, which was started by Roy and Ray Soderbjerg to promote their sandwich shop. The station plays music, talks, and shows. The story is funny and takes us back to the 1940s and 1950s, with old cars and radios. C. In this story, a professor named Richard Vaisey falls in love with a Russian poet. He talks to his wife's first husband about it. The poet writes bad poems and wants Richard to help her brother, who is in jail. The story is funny and smart, and the author makes the complicated story easy to follow. D. Two women and two men become best friends in London during the 1960s. One of them, James Hudson, starts a newspaper with his friend Richard Blake. They both loved a woman who died years ago. The story is about murder, ambition, love, and jealousy.

To make up for it, he takes care of his brother's three children. Ian is 40 years old and lives alone. The story shows his special relationship with the youngest child, Daphne. It's a warm and funny book."
CAE_53,"**Volunteer Tourism**

Four writers talk about international volunteer work.

**A.** Volunteer tourists often help build homes or schools. They pay a lot of money to do this work. If they gave this money directly to the local community, it could pay for more work than one volunteer can do. This is especially true for gap year students who do not need special skills. Many studies question if gap year volunteering is really about helping others or if it is more about helping the volunteers' careers. However, these projects can help volunteers learn to act kindly towards others in their future lives.

**B.** Volunteering can help people from different countries understand each other better. It can help solve conflicts and encourage people to take part in global issues. It can also create international friendships. This can be good for both volunteers and the communities they visit. But if only rich people from wealthy countries volunteer, it might help them more than the communities they visit. These volunteers might use the experience to improve their own careers.

**C.** Sometimes, international volunteering can be seen as a way for rich people to feel good about themselves. It can also be a way to help with international development. At its best, volunteering helps both the volunteers and the communities. It allows people to share skills and learn from each other. Volunteering can also make people aware of problems like poverty and injustice, and encourage them to help solve these issues.

**D.** Volunteer tourism is popular because people want to help others. It seems positive because it avoids big government and business. But it also avoids the need for government to help and makes development about individual acts of charity. Some people think volunteer tourism is just simple charity. But when it is called sustainable development, it can be misleading. It can ignore the real reasons for poverty and inequality in the world."
CAE_55,"**Sound the Alarm**

**Stuart Harris reports**

Many people listen to the radio in the morning and need an alarm to wake up. That's why we have clock radios. But how do you choose a good one? Our team, including me, inventor Tom Granger, and broadcaster Paul Bridges, tested five clock radios.

The first model has a 'dual alarm function'. This means you can set two different wake-up times, one for weekdays and one for weekends. It also has a cassette player, which is nice because you can listen to your own tapes. The radio quality is good, but it's big, like a rugby ball. Paul Bridges said he needs space on his bedside table for his keys, wallet, glasses, and phone. He also books a wake-up call just in case the alarm doesn't work.

The second model was the best-looking and the overall winner. Paul Bridges loved it, but the clock sometimes got stuck at 16:00. The digital display is nice, and the snooze bar is easy to use. It has a self-power back-up, so you don't have to reset it if the power goes out. However, it was hard to set up.

The third model has an extra lamp, but Tom Granger thought it was poorly made. The light is hard to use, and the radio is difficult to tune. The buzzer is loud, like a submarine alarm. Despite this, it's the third most popular model.

The fourth model is colorful and aimed at young people. Tom Granger liked it because it stands out. It was easy to set up without reading the instructions. However, the alarm can be 10 minutes early or late, which Paul Bridges found annoying.

The last model is the simplest and cheapest. Tom Granger liked it because it is small and easy to set up. It has old-fashioned dial tuning, which he found more reliable. The radio quality is fine, and the buzzer works well, waking me up in just two beeps!"
CAE_50,"Text: 'Hedgehogs A hedgehog is a small animal with sharp spines on its body. Hedgehogs live in many parts of the world, but not in America or Australia. All hedgehogs can roll into a tight ball when they are in danger. This helps protect them because their spines point outwards. The number of spines a hedgehog has can make this protection better. Some hedgehogs that live in the desert have fewer spines because they need to be lighter. These hedgehogs might try to run away from danger first and roll into a ball only if they have to. Hedgehogs are mostly active at night and sleep during the day, usually under bushes or in a hole in the ground. All hedgehogs can hibernate, but not all of them do. If the weather is good, some hedgehogs stay awake all year.'"
CAE_25,"**Great Sports Women on a Winning Streak**

Being good at sports is hard, especially for women. They have to work very hard and give up a lot of their normal life. But many women are doing great things in sports. Here are some stories of British sportswomen who are reaching their goals.

**A. Jill, 27, Skier**

Jill loves skiing. She says it feels great to fly through the air, but it can be scary. Sometimes the weather is bad, but she keeps going. Skiing takes a lot of time, so she doesn't have much time for friends. There are six men and three women in her team, and they all compete together.

**B. Caroline, 22, Cyclist**

Caroline started cycling two years ago and won her first race. She is now a professional cyclist and trains a lot every day. She worries people might think she is successful because of her looks, not her skills. Her boyfriend is also a cyclist, so he understands her busy schedule.

**C. Annabel, 26, Rower**

Annabel says rowing is hard for girls because not many schools offer it. Most girls start rowing when they are older, which makes it harder to compete internationally. Coaches change often, so the team is not very organized. But she enjoys being fit and the social life.

**D. Ffyona, 24, Long Distance Walker**

Ffyona dreamed of walking around the world when she was 13. She walked across Australia, which was very painful. She walked 50 miles a day with little sleep and many blisters. She needed to finish in 95 days because of her sponsorship. People think sponsoring women is risky.

**E. Lisa, 26, Saloon Car Racer**

Lisa says some men have big egos when driving. They don't like it when she does well. Racing is hard, and she doesn't earn much money. Women have been racing for a long time, but they were seen as unusual. More women are racing now, and Lisa loves trying to be perfect.

**F. Alison, 28, Triathlete**

Alison wakes up early to swim and trains in the evening. She sometimes falls asleep at work. She likes staying fit and enjoys the social side of racing. Men and women often compete together, but the media focuses more on men. The prize money is also less for women, but they are working to change this."
CAE_34,"**The Day I Met Picasso**

Richard Cork remembers meeting the famous artist Picasso when he was 18 years old. Richard was traveling around Europe and Morocco before starting university. He had run out of money and found a job painting boats in Cannes. One day, while eating at a restaurant, he saw Picasso sitting with his wife and friends. Richard was surprised because Picasso was known to be a private person.

Richard's friend encouraged him to ask Picasso for his autograph. Nervously, Richard approached Picasso and offered his sketchbook. Picasso kindly signed his name and drew a little picture on the page. Richard was very happy and started a conversation with Picasso, even though they needed help from an American woman to translate.

After showing his friend the autograph, Richard's friend suggested he draw Picasso's portrait. Richard returned to Picasso's table and started drawing him. Picasso made funny faces to make it difficult for Richard, but eventually, he sat still. Richard noticed how young and strong Picasso looked, even though he was almost 84 years old.

When Richard finished, Picasso wanted to see the drawing. Richard was shy but showed it to him. Picasso then took the crayon and quickly drew a funny picture of Richard. Richard asked Picasso to sign it, but Picasso said he had already given his signature.

Richard felt very lucky to have met Picasso and to have received his attention. It was a special moment that meant a lot to him."
CAE_12,"**Shopping Tricks**

Have you ever gone into a store and bought more than you planned? Stores use many tricks to make you spend more money.

**A. Fresh Look**

Supermarkets know people like fresh food. They often put fruits and vegetables at the entrance. They might also have a bakery that smells like fresh bread. The store might use green colors because it reminds people of fresh food. Most of what they sell, like frozen foods, is not fresh.

**B. Smart Display**

Where products are placed in a store is very important. Supermarkets use computers to know which areas people shop in the most. They put expensive or fast-selling items there. Shelves at eye level are popular because people see them first. Special offers in big bins attract people who love bargains. Stores also put items that go together, like salad dressings near salads.

**C. Staples Spread Out**

Supermarkets put basic items like bread and tea far from the entrance. This way, you pass by other tempting products. Stores put popular items far from the entrance too, so you see other things while looking for them.

**D. Less is More**

Some stores, like Next, show fewer items to make them look special. They want you to think their clothes are unique, even if they are not. This is because of good store design.

**E. Total Temptation**

People care more about the total bill than the price of each item. Supermarkets mix cheap and expensive items. They might sell some items at a loss to attract you. They buy in large amounts to get discounts.

**F. Price Tricks**

In chain stores, people notice prices more. Pricing something at $14.99 instead of $15 makes a difference. It also helps reduce theft because staff must ring up the sale to give change.

**G. Lighting Magic**

Stores use special lighting. Chain stores want natural light so clothes look the same outside. Supermarkets use lighting to make fruits and vegetables look better.

**H. Walking Paths**

Stores use different carpets to guide you. One type is for walking paths, and another is for sales areas. Some stores use wood or marble for paths to make you walk on the carpet in sales areas.

**I. In-Store Ads**

When you enter a supermarket, you see big pictures of delicious food. In the U.S., some supermarkets use video screens on shopping carts. These screens show ads for products as you shop. They are for people who buy on impulse and can increase sales by 30%."
CAE_26,"Text: 'Chris Bonnington (58) is famous for climbing Everest in 1985. He has also made new climbing routes in Britain and the Alps and written books like Quest for Adventure and Everest the Hard Way. Robin Knox-Johnston (53) started his sea career in the Merchant Navy. In 1968-9, he was the first person to sail around the world alone in his yacht, Sunhaili. He also broke the transatlantic record, taking 10 days to sail from New York to the Lizard. Chris and Robin worked together to sail and climb in Greenland, and they wrote about it in their book: Sea, Ice and Rock. In 1979, Chris was working on Quest for Adventure, a book about adventure after the war. He called Robin for an interview, and Robin invited him to sail. Chris could teach Robin climbing, and Robin could teach Chris sailing. It was Chris's first time on a yacht. They sailed and then stopped. Robin's wife and daughter stayed on the boat, and Chris and Robin went to the shore to climb. The climb was hard, but Robin was calm and steady. Chris showed Robin how to climb, and Robin used his own way to go down safely. During this trip to Skye, Chris and Robin became good friends. Robin suggested they use their skills together on a trip to Greenland. Robin was a good leader. He asked everyone for their opinion before making decisions. Chris found sailing boring and difficult. He liked being on land more. Robin enjoyed fixing things on the boat. Chris felt a bit useless sometimes. The yacht was small, with six people on it, but it was made for four. In Greenland, Chris led the climbing. He was worried about Robin's safety. Climbing the Cathedral, Greenland's highest mountain, was hard. Robin was not a natural climber, but he did well. They tried to reach the top for 24 hours but had to turn back. Robin trusted Chris and followed him. Robin was also worried about the boat, but he wanted to try climbing again. On the way home, there was a small problem. Chris was supposed to be on watch at 4 am, but Robin did not wake him. Chris thought Robin did not trust him, but Robin explained it was not true. By the end of the Greenland trip, Chris learned that Robin was a kind and sensitive person.'"
CAE_8,"**A Simple History of the Apple**

**Early Apples (8,000 BC)**  
People have been eating apples for a very long time. In ancient times, people in Britain and around Swiss and Italian lakes ate wild apples. These apples were small and not like the ones we eat today. In Switzerland, people even saved apple halves for winter.

**Apples in Britain (1000 AD)**  
The French learned how to grow fruit from the Romans. They brought this knowledge to Britain. The Normans, who came to Britain later, had better apple varieties for the British weather. British monks worked on creating new types of apples, and many of today's apples come from these.

**Popular Apples (1200)**  
In the 1200s, some apples became popular in Britain. The Old English Pearmain was a dessert apple, and the Costard was used for cooking. But then, problems like droughts and wars reduced apple production. In the 1500s, King Henry VIII sent Richard Harris to France to learn more about apples. Harris brought back new apple types, including the famous Pippins.

**Apples Around the World (1750)**  
By the 1600s, apples were so loved in Britain that settlers took them to Canada, Australia, the US, South Africa, and New Zealand. Captain Bligh took apples to Australia, and the Pilgrim Fathers took them to America. In America, Johnny Appleseed planted many apple trees.

**New Apple Varieties (1850)**  
In Iowa, a farmer named Jesse Hiatt found a new apple tree. The apple was called 'Delicious' and became very popular. In Australia, Maria Anne Smith found a new green apple tree. This apple became known as the Granny Smith apple.

**Modern Apples (1950)**  
Today, apples are grown all over the world. Most apples come from just a few types, chosen for their looks and ability to travel well, not for taste. Many old apple types have been lost, especially in the US. People now want more variety in apples. It's important to protect different kinds of apples for the future."

CAE_30,"Text: 'Richard Nerurkar is a long-distance runner from Britain. He is one of the best 10,000-metre runners in Britain. Richard visits a training camp in Kenya. The camp is in a place called Nanyuki, which is ten miles south of the equator. It is a quiet and beautiful place near Mount Kenya. Richard has been coming here for three years to train in the winter. But he never trained with Kenyan runners before. On his fourth trip, he decided to change this. He ran his first race in Kenya and stayed at the national team training camp. This is where the best Kenyan runners train for the World Cross-Country Team Championships. Richard was invited by the Kenyan coach because he finished fifth in a big race. Training at high altitude helps runners because it makes more red blood cells. This helps them carry more oxygen. Kenyan runners have been very successful because of this. Richard's first race in Africa was in Nairobi. It was the first international cross-country race in Africa. Many Kenyan runners finished before him, but he still felt he did well. Richard thinks Kenyan success is not just because of altitude. Kenyan runners have a simple way of running and living. They enjoy competing. Richard learned how they train when he stayed at the camp. The camp is at St Mark's College, 6,200 feet up Mount Kenya. It is a simple place with few comforts. The athletes live with the college students. They sleep six to a room. They train three times a day: an easy run in the morning, interval training in the mid-morning, and a steady run in the afternoon. They run about 40 kilometres each day, except on Sunday when they run 20 kilometres. Life at the camp is simple. Breakfast is tea, bread, and boiled eggs. Lunch and dinner are ugali, stew, cabbage or spinach, and tea. After running, they wash in streams from Mount Kenya. Richard learned that Kenyan success is not just about genetics or altitude. It is also about their simple lifestyle, hard training, and love for running. These might be the real reasons for their success in distance running.'"
CAE_7,"Text: 'Hit and Miss of Mass Marketing

Advertising is having problems. It's not just because of the recession. Advertising started to drop in 1989, before the recession got worse. The problem is bigger and affects the whole world. Advertising has not kept up with economic changes. Advertisers think about big markets and big media, but now markets are smaller. Even big brands should focus on smaller groups, but they often don't. This is where advertising has gone wrong.

Think about your shopping habits. When you go to a supermarket, you might buy 30 to 50 items. Many of these are not advertised brands. You might buy a few advertised brands from the 15,000 items in the store. In a year, you probably buy only a few hundred brands. For things like cars, you might buy one every three years. You don't buy many clothes either, and most are not advertised brands. Even with other things like candy, medicine, and services, you probably don't buy more than 400 different brands a year.

There are 32,500 branded goods and services advertised. Let's focus on the 9,500 brands that spend more on advertising. Mr. and Mrs. Average buy 400 of these 9,500 brands, and not all because of advertising. That's about 4 percent. So, you could say 96 percent of advertising is wasted, but nobody knows which 96 percent.

When you watch TV, count how many commercials are for brands you buy or might buy. For most people, it's about one in 16 (6 percent). The other 15 commercials (94 percent) seem wasted. You might think you don't pay attention to advertising, but most people think the same. The truth is, nobody buys most of the brands they see advertised.

Waste is part of advertising. Not everyone who sees an ad will buy the product. People notice only a few ads and ignore the rest. But advertising can still be cost-effective. It reaches many people to find the few who will buy. Media advertising works because it is a cheap way to reach many people.

With smart targeting, advertisers can reduce waste by reaching more people who will respond. But they can never know exactly who will respond. Even the best direct mail never gets a 100 percent response. This is different from face-to-face selling, where a salesman might succeed with every client. If advertisers knew exactly who would respond, they wouldn't need media.

Any advertiser who gets one million new customers (2 percent of adults) is doing well. For soap powder, the top brands would be happy with a million extra customers. Any advertising campaign that wins over 2 percent of the population is very successful. To succeed, advertising needs to target its message more carefully.'"
CAE_43,"Text: 'Charles Clover visits Britain's most environmentally-friendly home. Southwell in Nottinghamshire has two surprises. The first is Southwell Minster, an old cathedral with 'green' men figures carved by medieval craftsmen. The second is Britain's greenest house, the 'autonomous house', built by Robert and Brenda Vale. The Vales use rainwater for washing and drinking, recycle their sewage into garden compost, and heat their house with waste heat from electrical appliances and their own body heat, along with their three children and two cats, Edison and Faraday. The house looks traditional with a clay tile roof and is 300 yards from the Minster. It matches the town's old buildings and was approved by planners even though it is in a conservation area. The house is very quiet because it is super-insulated with special windows. Inside, you must take off your shoes. It is a sunny day, and the conservatory warms the air for the house. Robert opens windows to create airflow because the house is very draught-proof. Even the cats have their own special door. The Vales, who teach architecture, cared about the environment before it was popular. They wrote a book on green architecture in the 1970s. They designed a house with no carbon dioxide emissions and no mains water. They use composting toilets, rainwater tanks, and copper gutters to protect drinking water. Water from washing goes into the garden. They don't use a dishwasher to avoid strong detergents. 'We wanted to show that you can have an eco-friendly house without living in the dark,' says Robert. The house's only old-fashioned part is the hall, which is tall. The Vales pay no water bills. Last winter, the house used only nine units of electricity a day, costing about 70p. Soon, they will add solar panels to use even less electricity. The house will still use mains electricity for cooking but will make extra electricity. The only heating is a small wood stove, used only in the coldest winter. Is it warm in winter? One February night, Robert was reading and said it was too warm to light the fire. The room was 18C, which is comfortable because there are no draughts. In the past, people were comfortable at lower temperatures because of their clothing. The house is simple and low-tech, with few things to break. It was built cheaply, costing the same as low-cost housing. Commercial builders do not like this idea.'"

In 1939, the two women who took the photos said they were fake. They had cut out pictures of fairies from a book and put them among flowers. The photos are very pretty. But this simple trick shows that the camera can lie. Today, we use computer programs to change our digital photos, and it is not true that photography was ever completely honest.

CAE_11,"**Blacksmiths**

Iron has always been important to people, and blacksmiths, who work with iron, have been seen as more than just workers. Before machines were common, blacksmiths were as respected as doctors because they made weapons, armor, and farming tools. They were also seen as artists. In the 1700s, blacksmiths made beautiful ironwork for places like St Paul's Cathedral. The fancy metal designs in French and Belgian buildings were also made by talented blacksmiths.

By the late 1960s, there were not many blacksmiths left in Britain. Big factories did not need them, and new buildings did not use pretty iron designs. But in the last 10 years, blacksmithing has become popular again because people are more interested in decorative buildings and creative interior design. Still, many iron products look old-fashioned, like gates and balconies called 'classical' or 'Victorian-style'. In many design stores, you see rusty candlesticks with decorations.

Luckily, there are new ideas, and some events are promoting blacksmithing. One event is an exhibition by the British Artist Blacksmiths Association (BABA) at the Fire & Iron gallery in Leatherhead, Surrey. Alan Dawson, BABA's secretary, says we might be starting a new Iron Age. Power tools help blacksmiths work more easily, allowing them to bend and shape metal creatively. Dawson says, 'These artists now have a material which allows them to express themselves.'

About 250 items are in the show, from bookends to a spiral staircase. Prices start at £90 and go much higher. Most money goes to the makers, but some helps promote good ironwork. Dawson's own work includes an eight-foot gate and a lamp with a glass shade. He says his style is like 'drawing with metal in space.'

Many artists love working with iron. Unlike other metals, iron is hard to shape when cold. Susan May, a jeweler, says, 'It's magical because it's soft when hot, but hard when it cools.' Ann Catrin Evans makes door-knockers and handles inspired by castles in horror films. One looks like a ball and chain, another like a Celtic cross. She says, 'I love that steel feels like it will last forever.'

Iron has given people visual pleasure and a feeling of safety. It will likely be used decoratively for many years, as long as we avoid more rusty candlesticks."
CAE_14,"Title: The Day I Stopped Smoking

I thought everyone would be happy when I stopped smoking, but one of my colleagues was very angry. ""What do you mean?"" she shouted. ""If it was that easy, why didn't you stop years ago?"" I couldn't really explain how I went from smoking a pack a day to not smoking at all in just four hours. It was strange to me too. 

The stop-smoking session was a mix of group therapy and hypnotherapy. It happened two months and three weeks ago. I didn't plan to stop smoking, and I didn't really want to. I didn't like the pressure from people who wanted me to stop smoking. Also, I was healthy and didn't feel sick. I didn't cough and got over colds quickly, unlike some of my healthier friends.

On a normal Thursday afternoon, I went to a session called The Easy Way to Stop Smoking in Birmingham. I was there to write an article about other people trying to quit. I said, ""I won't try to stop myself, it wouldn't be fair. I'm here to write, not to stop smoking."" I enjoyed smoking and it made me happy. The counselor seemed to understand something I didn't.

We could smoke as much as we wanted, and the room was so full of smoke that we had to open the windows. I noticed that when we were told to smoke, I didn't want to, and neither did the others. The messages about stopping smoking made sense to me. Stopping smoking started to feel like a good idea. The thought of not being a smoker made me feel strong. It was a secret feeling just for me. Could I do anything?

In many ways, it was easy. The craving for nicotine, like hunger, went away after a minute or two. I only felt it for four or five days. I thought working without cigarettes would be hard, but it wasn't a problem. I believed I needed cigarettes to meet deadlines, but I didn't. Surprisingly, being at home on weekend mornings was the hardest part, and it still is. I think smoking was something I did when I was bored. Having a cigarette was an activity. Yes, I miss my cigarettes, but not too much. Each new experience as a non-smoker is different - eating out, waiting for a plane, checking into a hotel, or during a theater break. These were all times when I used to smoke."
CAE_63,"Dorothy who? Dorothy Hodgkin is the only British woman scientist to win a Nobel Prize, but not many people in Britain know her name. Georgina Ferry has been asking her friends if they know who Dorothy Hodgkin is. If they do, they pass her test. Dorothy Hodgkin won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1964. She was a great scientist and studied crystals. Her life shows important changes in the 20th century, like the progress of women's education and the spread of science around the world.

When Georgina started her research, she read other scientific biographies. A friend suggested a book about Linus Pauling, a famous chemist and friend of Hodgkin. But she couldn't find any books about him in her local bookshop. This shows that people often don't find scientists' lives interesting enough to read about. Even some scientists think their lives are boring to read about. This idea makes it hard for publishers to sell books about scientists.

Some scientists avoid being in the media because they don't want to seem like they are promoting themselves. But this can make science seem less interesting to young people. Luckily, some scientists are now appearing on TV and in other media, which helps people see them as real people.

Books about scientists are also changing. They used to be very serious and not talk much about the scientist's personal life. But now, books show scientists as real people with families and personal challenges. For example, Richard Feynman's book, ""Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman?"" is funny and shows his life outside of science.

Dorothy Hodgkin was very dedicated to her work. She solved the structures of penicillin, vitamin B12, and insulin. She also had three children and a husband who was often away. Her personal life may not seem important to her work, but it shows how she balanced different parts of her life.

Understanding science is not harder than reading Shakespeare or learning a new language. It's sad that many educated people don't know about scientists like Dorothy Hodgkin."
CAE_56,"Margaret and her special skill

Margaret Wilkins has a special skill. She can find water underground using a forked hazel stick. Many farmers ask for her help when their wells dry up. Margaret and her husband have a business that drills wells. They use machines like drilling rigs and hammers. But to find water, Margaret only needs her hazel stick. They are successful more than 90% of the time.

This skill is called dowsing. Dowsing is finding water, minerals, or lost things underground. Some people think it is a special sense. There are many ideas about how it works. One idea is that everything on Earth vibrates, and water vibrates more. Dowsers, like Margaret, might feel these vibrations. Some say they can even smell water.

Margaret and her husband are very busy, especially when there is little rain. They have many customers, mostly farmers with dry wells. Some customers have holiday homes far from water pipes. Others are building golf courses. Margaret looks for water 50 to 70 meters deep. She makes sure the water is clean and not near waste. The water is in rock cracks, and it is important to bring it up clean. They also need electricity for the pump, so the well should be near power supplies.

Margaret starts by looking at a map with a pendulum. The pendulum swings over places with water. Then, she walks with her hazel stick over the land. When she is above water, she feels a strange sensation. The stick helps her find the exact spot to drill. Her husband checks the same area. They must agree on where to drill. If they don't agree, they keep looking.

Margaret's skill is not just an old tradition. Many people are interested in how she does it. She calls it an 'intuitive perception of the environment'. This means she understands the land in a special way. Her skill helps their business succeed year after year."
CAE_36,"Text: 'We changed lives for a day! Have you ever thought about swapping lives with someone else for a day? Maybe you think it would be fun to do something different? We made it happen for four people - read how it went. Amanda (23), a young mother with two daughters, swapped lives with her friend Cindy (30), who works as a waitress in a busy London restaurant. A. Amanda's story I had never been in a place like it before. It was dark and noisy, with many people and a great atmosphere. It was very different from my home town, and I wasn't sure I would manage! Being a mother is busy, but this was something else! I had just fifteen minutes to learn how to carry a tray of drinks with one hand. The other waitresses made it look easy, but just as I was getting used to it, the drinks fell off the tray and crashed on the floor. I was so embarrassed, but the other waitresses laughed. Everyone makes mistakes at first! By opening time at 11.30 am, a line had already formed outside, and I felt really nervous. I was worried about remembering all the orders, but that wasn't a problem because everything was automated. After a couple of hours, my feet hurt, and I couldn't get used to the loud music. Every time a customer spoke to me, I had to say 'Pardon?', which was embarrassing! By the end of my shift at 5 pm, I was very tired and wanted to soak my feet in hot water. I couldn't believe it when one of the waitresses told me it had been a 'quiet' day! I never knew how tiring waitressing would be. I've always thought it was a job for shy people, but you need to be friendly and able to handle lots of customers! I'm quite shy, and I don't think I could cope on a busy Saturday night. I wasn't impressed with the pay either. I must have been a bad waitress because even the rich Americans didn't tip me! I was very glad to get back to my children. It seems easy after waitressing! B. Cindy's story I was nervous about being a 'mum' for the day, but I was looking forward to it too. I was told the girls were cheeky, but I thought I could handle it. I was wrong! As Amanda left for the restaurant, I had to get the two girls dressed and fed. After dropping off Sophie at school and Katie at nursery, I thought I'd have three hours of peace. Wrong! A note from Amanda reminded me that I still had to make the beds, clean the house, and do the washing. At 1 pm, I picked up Katie, went to the supermarket, and then took her home for lunch. But when I brought Sophie home from school, the real trouble started. They turned the sofa into a trampoline and played a game that involved screaming as loudly as they could! I decided to let them play, thinking they'd get tired. Wrong again. I thought I had a lot of energy, but they beat me! After much persuasion, I got them into bed by about 8 pm, but then the fun and games started! How many glasses of water can a child drink? I knew it was just a trick so they could come downstairs and watch TV, but it was exhausting to spend all evening negotiating with them. I never knew how tiring it could be looking after two small children. You don't get a second to think about yourself, and the responsibility is huge. Even so, I really enjoyed the day. Rosemary (42) runs a dairy farm. She swapped with Hilary (30), a teacher at a primary school. C. Rosemary's story On the farm, I have to get up at 5.30 am, so sleeping in until 7 was a luxury! But I took a long time deciding what to wear. I couldn't turn up in overalls and boots, could I? Looking at about 400 pupils at assembly, I hoped I blended in and that my fresh complexion didn't make me stand out as being from the farm. After that, it was time for a maths class. The children worked in small groups, using workcards graded by difficulty - very different from when I was at school and we had to recite tables together! Then I helped with a nature project - identifying and feeding snails. By lunchtime, I was exhausted and looking forward to a break, but the teachers only have about five minutes to eat. There's so much to do before classes start again. I attended a staff meeting about reports and helped with athletics trials. After lunch, there was a silent reading lesson (bliss!) and then a French lesson in the video room. This was fun because all the children wanted to practice on me, which showed my rusty French. Finally, we moved to the school hall for Physical Education. I was tired by now, but the children seemed to have endless energy. The hardest part of the job was standing up in front of the class and speaking - even for just two minutes, it's scary. Teachers may get more holidays a year, but I think I'll stick to farming! D. Hilary's story I arrived at White House Farm at 8.30 am, bright and early, only to find out that Rosemary had been up for three hours! Rosemary's 280-acre farm has 100 Jersey cows, 15 calves and heifers, and about 800 ewes! As well as milk, she makes ice-cream, yoghurt, and cream, which is sold in shops, restaurants, and at tourist attractions. I spent most of the morning in the ice-cream parlour, bottling milk into plastic containers, squeezing ice-cream from a machine into cartons, and sticking on labels. It was hard to stop myself from tasting the goodies! At lunchtime, it was time to check the sheep. I drove to one of the fields and picked up a ewe that had fallen over. If the sheep are left for more than 12 hours once they have fallen over, they could die, so they have to be checked every day. What a nightmare it must be in winter! After feeding the calves, I started the milking. The process took an exhausting two-and-a-half hours. And Rosemary does this twice a day, starting at 6 am, seven days a week, 365 days a year! I found it quite a lonely day. I was surprised how much I missed the children - animals don't talk back! The worst part of the job is not being able to get away from work. The cows always have to be milked twice a day, so it's really hard to plan any time off. Rosemary will only get about three days' holiday this year. Farming seems romantic, but the reality is very different. The income is irregular, and I'd hate to be at the mercy of the weather.'"
CAE_6,"Text: 'A trumpet isn't just for Christmas... It is interesting how many musicians come from homes without music. Hakan Hardenberger, the only son of parents who did not play music, is from a small town in southern Sweden. At 30 years old, he is now one of the best trumpet players in the world. His records include new music and old music from the baroque and classical periods. When you meet him, he looks young and friendly, like the sound of the trumpet. Recently, he played the Hummel Trumpet Concerto in a big concert hall in London, and there was a TV show about his work and life, filmed in both England and Sweden. 

Hakan was born near Malmo. His career started because of a Christmas present when he was eight. His father, who liked Louis Armstrong, decided to give him a trumpet. He bought a real trumpet, not a toy. Hakan loved it and played all the time. His mother found a teacher for him, the second trumpet player in the Malmo Symphony Orchestra. The teacher, Bo Nilsson, saw that Hakan had talent. Hakan is grateful to have had such a good teacher who loved the trumpet and knew many trumpet players around the world. 

Hakan says the trumpet is a simple instrument, and it is hard to make a perfect one. Every trumpet has problems, and no two mouthpieces are the same. He learned to work with these problems. Even as a child, people could recognize his special sound. Unlike John Wallace, a famous British trumpet player who started in a brass band, Hakan always wanted to be a solo artist. He admired Maurice Andre, a French trumpeter who also played solo. Hakan bought all his records and looked up to him. His parents supported his dream to be a trumpet player. 

At 15, he needed to decide where to study. America was too far and dangerous, so he went to Paris at 16 to study with Pierre Thibaud. Thibaud told him that playing in an orchestra was like working in a garden. Hakan knew he played better than others his age, but he realized he could also connect with people through music. Thibaud suggested he enter a competition for experience. Hakan learned the music for the first round and made it to the second round. He knew most of the music for that round too, but the final round had a difficult piece. He did not win first prize, but he enjoyed playing and saw that people listened to him. 

Hakan is realistic about his work and does not try to explain his gift of communication, as he believes it might ruin it. He thinks the power of music is that it can always move people.'"

CAE_20,"**Take Five Careers**

Rebecca Cripps talks to five women about their jobs: the good parts, the hard parts, and what they do every day.

**A. THE BRAIN SURGEON**

**Name:** Anne  
**Age:** 34

**ANNE'S DAY**

""I wake up at 6:30 am, go to the gym at 7 am, and start work at 8 am. I begin operating at 8:30 am. I do surgeries all day on Monday and Wednesday, and sometimes on Friday afternoons. Most surgeries take three hours, but some take all day. I've worked ten hours without eating or going to the bathroom. Deciding when to operate can be stressful. I don't feel stressed during surgery, but I worry about the next day. Brain surgery is often a last option for patients, but when it works, it's amazing. From 10 am to 1 pm, I talk to patients about their operations. I like this part and find it easy to talk to them. If they are upset, I try to comfort them, but I don't always have enough time. I leave work between 6 pm and 8 pm. Some nights and weekends, I'm on call and carry my pager. On holidays, I worry for the first three days about my patients, and I dream about surgery at night. I find it hard to relax.""

**B. THE SENIOR DESIGNER**

**Name:** Marita  
**Age:** 31

**MARITA'S DAY**

""I wake up at 7:45 am, leave home by 8:20 am, take the train, and arrive at work by 9:15 am. On Monday at 10:30 am, we have a meeting to discuss our work and any problems. We work in teams. My team has three senior designers, a company partner, and a junior designer. I spend 10-15% of my time designing; the rest is production. I get a brief from the client and spend three to four weeks designing and developing the project. After the client agrees, we plan budgets and hire photographers and illustrators. I talk to the printers and make sure everything is on time. I manage people and need to communicate well. When their work is done, I send it to the printers. Managing many jobs can be stressful. Deadlines are always close, and no day is the same. Lunch is at 1 pm for an hour. We try to go out, but sometimes I eat sandwiches and work. It's great when a client likes your work, but disappointing if they don't. I get home at 7:30 pm at the earliest, often later. I find it hard to relax when I'm busy.""

**C. THE CHAUFFEUR**

**Name:** Linda  
**Age:** 42

**LINDA'S DAY**

""I wake up at 7 am most days, but two or three times a week, I meet early flights and wake up between 4:30 am and 5 am. At 10:30 or 11 am, I might go for a bike ride or swim. Driving is a sitting job, so I watch my diet and exercise. I have a big breakfast and snacks during the day. People ask me to recommend places, so I need to know the area well. Many jobs are booked in advance, so I can check routes. Not everyone is polite. Some passengers are rude, but most are nice, and I have good relationships with regular clients. Sometimes I hear conversations in the car and have to focus on driving. The press has tried to make me talk about clients, but I don't. I work seven days a week, up to fifteen hours a day. I try to sleep by 11 pm.""

**D. THE LANDSCAPE GARDENER**

**Name:** Tracy  
**Age:** 27

**TRACY'S DAY**

""I wake up at 7 am, leave home at 7:30 am, and go to my first job. My assistant and I mostly maintain gardens we designed. We do some commercial jobs, but mostly private gardens. We spend about an hour and a half at each house. At 11 am, we get hungry and go to a cafe for breakfast. In summer, I may work until 10 pm; in winter, until 4:30 pm. The office is at home, so I check messages and calls when I return. If someone wants their garden designed, I meet them in the evening. We use old materials to make gardens look old. Sometimes people have specific ideas that aren't great. It's satisfying to see a garden finished and blooming. It's hard to relax in the evenings because I hear the business phone. I sleep well because the work is physical, and I'm tired. It's a tough job, but it lets me be creative.""

**E. THE CIVIL ENGINEER**

**Name:** Zena  
**Age:** 27

**ZENA'S DAY**

""I arrive at the site by 8:30 am. I'm the assistant resident engineer, looking after building bridges and a wall to keep cars from falling into a quarry. I check that contractors follow the schedule and safety rules. I help solve problems. Contractors start at 6 am, so I first check with the clerk of works about what happened since I left. The rest of the day depends on what he tells me. I look at paperwork or answer design questions. Lunch is usually for half an hour between 2 pm and 2:30 pm, but I eat as I go. When contractors eat, it's easier to check the site. We check their work, which can cause conflict, so we need a good relationship. I see the duty resident engineer once a day. If something important happens, I act before telling them. I usually leave the site at 6 pm and am on call all the time."""

**A. Credit Card Executive**
I wake up at 6 am and get to the office by 7.30 am. I work with customer programs for our credit card users. I help start and manage the Membership Rewards program in Europe. I talk to current card users, find new ones, and work with partner companies. I spend the first 45 minutes planning my day and answering emails. I handle advertising for the membership program in Europe, so I meet with marketing staff and advertising agencies to plan and develop strategies. I have meetings most of the day, but I keep my door open for questions. I travel to different markets in Europe once or twice a week. When I'm in London, I leave work between 6.30 pm and 7.00 pm.

**B. Record Company Executive**
I start work at 10.00 am and check the mail. I receive 10 to 20 demo tapes a day, letters, and concert information. The phone starts ringing at 10.30 am with calls from producers and publishers. I have meetings to discuss campaigns or projects for artists. When I listen to demo tapes, I try to be helpful. I know if the sound fits our record label. After signing a band, we work on the first album, choosing songs and musicians. I share my vision of the album with the company for marketing. I also manage budgets. I leave work at 7.00 pm and often go to concerts, sometimes seeing five new groups a night. I might visit an artist in the studio after a concert. I usually get home at 1.00 am and listen to music to relax.

**C. Sales Director**
I wake up at 8.00 am and drive to work, arriving at 9.30 am. I check the mail and diary to see if we have clients visiting. I enjoy showing people around the showroom and selling furniture. We sell antiques from £1,000 to £6,000. We buy from London salerooms, country house sales, private clients, and overseas. Many items need restoration. I work with restorers, gilders, and framers. I read the Antiques Trade Gazette with coffee to stay updated. I visit the Victoria and Albert Museum to compare furniture. I do the accounts monthly and tax returns every three months. I go home at 5.30 pm and take an hour to relax.

**D. Air Traffic Controller**
I work shifts and leave home at 6.00 am for early shifts. At 7.00 am, I take over one of four control positions in the tower. We rotate stations, working for 1.5 hours, then taking a 30-minute break. We control aircraft movements as a team. In winter, we handle about 1,000 movements a day, more in summer. Night shifts are quieter, and I read about new air traffic rules between 12 and 4.00 am. It's important to be alert, so I take sick leave if needed. The job is stressful, and it takes time to relax after a shift. I hope to become a watch manager and maybe a general manager.

**E. Shop Manager**
If I work an early shift, I leave home by 8.00 am. I start by setting up the electronic sales system. I ensure someone watches the till and coordinate breaks. I help customers find and order books. I enjoy serving customers, though it can be annoying when they bring reviews and expect quick service. Between 2.00 pm and 4.00 pm, publishers' reps visit, and I discuss new titles. I decide how many copies to order. I ensure new titles arrive on time. The early shift ends at 5.45 pm. I work late shifts twice a week, closing the system and locking up before going home.

**F. Financial Analyst**
I listen to the news at 7.00 am, then take a taxi to work, arriving at 8.45 am. I contact freelance reporters to learn about my region. I assess financial risks for multinational companies. I provide three services: an online newsflash, a security forecast, and a travel security guide. From 9.15 am to 9.30 am, I meet editors to discuss stories. My first newsflash is due by 10.00 am, and the second by 11.00 am. I write, send, and edit stories before they go online. I travel to Africa three times a year to report on events.

CAE_45,"**Career Power: How to Be a Good Leader at Work**

A. **What is a Good Leader?**  
A good leader inspires others and helps them change. Leadership is not about being tall or very smart. Pat Dixon, who wrote a book about men and women at work, says leadership is about making things happen with people who are as excited as you are. A good leader should speak clearly and confidently. Dixon says, ""Say 'I believe' instead of 'I think'.""

B. **Can Anyone Be a Leader?**  
John van Maurik, who teaches about leadership, says many people can be leaders. We all have some leadership skills, but we need the right situation to show them. We often see leaders like Mahatma Gandhi or Richard Branson, but leadership is also important in our own jobs.

C. **Think About Your Bosses**  
Think about the best and worst boss you had. Both might have been good at meeting goals, but how did they do it? The best boss motivated and supported you. The worst boss made you feel unimportant and blamed you when things went wrong. The first was a good leader; the second was not.

D. **Leaders vs. Managers**  
Leaders and managers are different. Managers like to work within rules. Leaders create new ideas. Michael Shea, who wrote about leadership, says a good manager can keep a company running, but a good leader can change a company for the better.

E. **Improve Your Leadership Skills**  
Whether you are a boss or a middle manager, you can learn to be a better leader. Here are some tips:  
- Find what you are passionate about and lead with that energy.  
- Think of yourself as a leader.  
- Sometimes you need to lead firmly. Try different styles and see what works.  
- Set goals and try to beat them. Look at your job and see where leadership can help you do better.

F. **Keep Learning**  
- Leadership takes practice. Take risks and learn from mistakes.  
- Learn to delegate tasks and motivate others.  
- Your way of leading might not work for everyone. Keep improving your communication skills.  
- Be visible and available to important people.  
- You don't have to lead all the time. Know when your leadership is needed and help others become leaders too."

Before Titanic, director James Cameron made this exciting Cold War movie. It is about oil workers and navy experts trying to save a submarine deep underwater. The leader, Bud, and his team are brave and funny. The special effects are very good, but the story is simple.

**B. The Thin Red Line**

This film is based on a book about the battle for Guadalcanal. Directed by Andrew Marton, it is a traditional war movie. It focuses on one soldier and his tough sergeant. The film has some good parts, like a dream sequence about the soldier's wife.

**C. On Guard**

This film is based on a novel from 1875. It is a fun adventure with sword fights. Fabrice Luchini plays a clever villain, and Vincent Perez is a lively hero. The film is full of action and humor.

**D. Character**

Set in old Rotterdam, this film looks like a museum piece. It tells the story of a strict bailiff, Dreverhaven, and his difficult relationship with his son. The film focuses a lot on the historical details.

**E. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly**

This is a re-release of a classic film. The sound is very clear, and the music is exciting. The story is about three men, the good, the bad, and the ugly, who are all looking for treasure in the West.

**F. The Longest Day**

This is a long war film with many stars and extras. It shows the planning of a big invasion. The film is impressive but is better on a big screen. On video, it loses some of its impact."

Steve Martin's ""Compelling Evidence"" is a very interesting story. The narrator is a lawyer who starts a new job after leaving a big law firm. He has to defend his boss's wife when she is accused of killing her husband. The trial is exciting, and the ending is surprising. This is a great first book in a popular genre.

**BOOK B**  
""Curtains for the Cardinal"" starts with excitement. Sigismondo, who helps the rich people of the Italian Renaissance, gets involved in politics and murder. We know he will find the guilty people. The story is a bit complicated and long, but it is still very good.

**BOOK C**  
""File Under: Deceased"" is a new detective story by Sarah Lacey. Leah Hunter is a tax inspector who starts investigating when a man dies near her. She faces many challenges, but she is brave and smart. Leah is a great character.

**BOOK D**  
""Double Deuce"" by Robert B. Parker is about Spenser, a smart private investigator. He helps his friend Hawk to stop drug dealers in a poor area of Boston. The conversations are quick and clever, and there is more thinking than usual. It is very entertaining.

**BOOK E**  
""False Prophet"" by Faye Kellermann has detectives Pete Decker and Marge Dunn. They look into a robbery and attack at a famous actress's daughter's house. The author's easy style and interesting characters make this a fun mystery.

**BOOK F**  
Diane Henry and Nicholas Horrock wrote ""Blood Red, Snow White"" together. It is about a lawyer and his female client, but the action happens outside the courtroom. The lawyer becomes a victim as the story goes on. It has romance, money, and violence, making it a thrilling book.

**BOOK G**  
""Dead for a Ducat"" by Simon Shaw features actor Philip Fletcher. He is in danger while filming a Robin Hood story. The funny characters make the story entertaining, but it is not as good as Shaw's other works.

**BOOK H**  
""Fall Down Easy"" is Lawrence Gough's best book in a while. Canadian police are after a smart bank robber who targets female bank workers. The story builds tension slowly and is better than the average detective story."
CAE_57,"Text: ""I might be too old for this, but here I go! At 34, Tim Pozzi left a good job to go backpacking. He thinks about why he and others his age decide to do this. This summer, I quit my job, rented out my flat, and decided to travel in South East Asia for a year. You might think I'm lucky, but I'm 34 years old, and I'm nervous. It's not like I haven't traveled before. After university, I spent two years backpacking in North and South America. When I came back, I wanted to do it again someday. But then I fell in love, started a career, bought a flat, and got used to earning money. But I realized I was giving up my happiness for my salary. When I quit my job, it felt like I was in control of my life again. I have no ties now. Many of my friends are married with children, and while they wouldn't change places with me, they envy my freedom. I'm not in a relationship, and I have no big career goals. I feel like I should enjoy this freedom, even for my friends' sake! Why am I nervous? First, it's about making plans. How could I let someone else live in my home? How do I rent it out? And I had to decide where to go. I'm bad at making decisions and am already late. 'Might as well enjoy the summer in England,' I told myself. Then, 'Why not stay for the start of the football season?' Leaving emotional ties makes it harder. I'm delaying because I wonder if I can still handle backpacking. Will I adjust to a simple life? Will I fit in with young backpackers? Maybe not. Many Britons in their late twenties and thirties want to leave their lives and travel. Jennifer Cox, from Lonely Planet, says people realize they can have adventures if they are brave and organized. Danny, a 30-year-old accountant, and his girlfriend Tammy, a 28-year-old teacher, want one last adventure before settling down. They bought a round-the-world ticket for a year. 'I'm ready to give up job security for the trip,' says Danny. 'I worry I won't move up in my career, but it's a risk worth taking. When I left the office, I threw my calculator into the river as a sign of defiance!' For Matt, who just left the Army, a year of travel was a big change. 'In the military, there's a set way to do things. I needed to change this to live as a civilian.' There are many reasons to travel at my age, but some are common. 'We have a more flexible workforce today,' says Angela Baron from the Institute of Personnel Development. 'More people work on short-term contracts, so if your contract ends, you have nothing to lose.' Big companies even have career-break policies. 'If you train someone, it's nice to know they'll come back rather than work for a competitor.' Dan Hiscocks, from Travellerseye, says more people in their thirties are thinking about their lives. 'If you're not happy, it's not about just staying in the job. Now people know there are opportunities, and a job isn't ""for life"" anymore. Travel lets you think about your life.' Is wanting to travel just a sign that my generation can't grow up? Jennifer Cox thinks not. 'It's a sign of a better society when we care about living a balanced life. We ask, ""Is this what I want?""' Ben, a 32-year-old going to Central America for a year, doesn't think he's running away. 'It's more about going towards something I want.' But he is a bit scared. 'It's about leaving behind a comfortable routine, like going to the office, saying ""hi"" to everyone, and having coffee.' I also worry about leaving a simple life, and I'm not sure I'd travel if my boss wasn't so bad. As Jennifer Cox says, 'There's often a reason, like a breakup or losing a job, that pushes people to do it.' It took a push to get me moving, but now I'm excited about the next 12 months. Whatever happens, I'll be happy I took this chance. I think all of us older backpackers feel the same."""
CAE_42,"Text: 'Plugging in the home Georgina McGuiness had taken a long break from journalism and felt out of touch with technology. She shares how she changed her family home into a good workplace. The Christmas before last, I turned 37 and realized I needed to restart my career in journalism. My skills were old, from the 1980s, when typewriters were used. I didn't know how to use a computer, and many jobs wanted experience in desktop publishing, which I didn't have. I was afraid of technology; even pocket calculators confused me. I thought it would be hard to work again until I entered a competition in a local newspaper. My family and I won a computer package. We got a laptop for my husband and a personal computer for the family. We learned new words like cyberspace, Internet, and surfing. We started chatting with people around the world on the Internet. The children stopped watching TV, and I set up a small office in the kitchen with a phone, fax machine, CD-ROM, and modem. I could work from home and still take the children to school. The children were good with computers because they learned at school. I was slow and worried I would lose my work by pressing the wrong button. But I learned the basic skills I needed. It was logical and easy. I started writing for a magazine, about two articles a month, and I felt happy to have the best of both worlds. The computer helped me become organized. I used to lose important papers, but now I use spreadsheets to keep track of money and pre-made invoices and letterheads to save time. As a journalist, the Internet helps me research stories and talk to people about working from home. But working from home can be lonely. There are distractions, like house chores, and the children and I sometimes argue over who uses the computer. Many people now buy computers for education and fun. In my street, people work from home to avoid traveling to the city. A report says the average computer user is 38 years old, well-educated, and owns a personal computer. Many have a CD-ROM, laser printer, and modem. I am ahead of this trend. Maybe one day, I will send a column to a newspaper in Melbourne or start my own magazine from home. The sky, or cyberspace, is the limit.'"
CAE_59,"Text: 'The Tartan Museum The new buildings of Scotland's national museum look very different from the old buildings in Edinburgh. But are the things inside the museum as interesting? Sally Varlow visited the museum before it opened. You cannot miss it. The outside of the new Museum of Scotland is very noticeable. It is on the corner of Chambers Street in Edinburgh, with a big, yellow tower and buildings that look like a piece of cheese. Last winter, people had different opinions about the building. Some people loved it and called it a 'masterpiece', while others were not sure or did not like it. This winter, the inside of the museum is almost ready, and people might have different opinions about the exhibitions too. The museum tells many stories with important historic objects. There is a timeline to help visitors understand, but it does not make the displays boring. The museum does not let its beautiful national treasures, like Mary Queen of Scots' jewels, get lost in national pride. The real question is whether people will find the museum interesting enough to visit again. Dr. David Clarke, the head of exhibitions, says a visit should be fun and easy to understand, even for people who do not know much about history. Clarke believes in showing the truth. He does not like fake scenes from the past. He says, 'The public deserves the truth.' So, in this museum, you see what experts know. But can the stories be interesting with just explanation panels and a few computers? It is hard to say before the opening. Some things are clear, though. The views of Edinburgh Castle are amazing. Inside, the museum has many different spaces. The galleries are different sizes and shapes, with pale walls that look like stone and deep display cases. Light comes through small windows and from the roof. There is space to enjoy every item. Thanks to a group of children from all over Scotland, the museum has a Discovery Centre. The children wanted to ride through the displays, but they got a special hands-on centre instead. The Twentieth Century gallery, on the top floor, is the only temporary exhibition. It will change after three years. It has objects chosen by Scottish people and other famous people as important to life in Scotland in the twentieth century. The Prime Minister chose an electric guitar. Others chose televisions, Thermos flasks, and favorite toys. The idea is fun, but it might not seem very serious. It might feel more important when the computer with personal stories starts working next week. Dr. Clarke is right when he says, 'Objects open windows on the past more vividly than anything else.' The modern buildings look great from the inside and the top, but some people might think they do not fit in with the old buildings around them.'"
CAE_54,"Text: 'The end of print may take some time Peter Preston Transition. It's a nice word and a calming idea. Change can scare some people and challenge others. But transition means moving slowly and nicely from now to the future. Unless, it is newspapers' 'transition' to the online world, which is not easy - because it might not happen at all. But surely (you say) it will happen one day. Everyone knows that print newspaper sales are going down while visits to their websites are going up. Just look at the latest print circulation numbers. The Daily Telegraph, The Guardian, and others are down between 8% and 10% each year, but their websites are getting more visitors. This might be true, depending on time, age, place, and more. After all, everyone - from web experts to print experts - says so. But wait a moment and think about some things that don't quite fit. If sales in that area have fallen so little, maybe the problem mostly affects newspapers? Yet again, the messages are mixed. The latest survey by the World Association of Newspapers shows that global circulation rose 1.1% last year (to 512 million copies a day). Sales in the West dropped, but Asia made up the difference. As for news and current affairs magazines - which you'd expect to be in trouble - they had a 5.4% increase. In short, on both sides of the Atlantic, although some magazine areas went down, many grew quickly. You can see a similar thing with books. Kindle and similar e-readers are selling a lot more this year. The first step of transition seems clear. Yet, when booksellers looked at the value of the physical books they sold over the last six months, they found it just 0.4% down. Screen or paper, then? It wasn't one or the other: it was both. Stories like these of young people stopping reading newspapers are not true. Look at the latest National Readership Survey numbers and you'll find nearly 5,000,000 people aged between 15 and 35 reading the main national dailies. And even in Europe, different countries have different stories. There's Britain, with a 10.8% drop in recent years (and a 19.6% fall for quality papers), but in Germany, the decline has only been 7% all round - with a mere 0.8% lost to quality titles. And France shows only a 3.1% fall (0.8% at the quality end of the market). These different national trends may show a situation more complicated than the digital revolution experts think. America's media experts used to say that online advertising money would pay for change and, with lower production costs, make online newspapers a success. But now, with digital ads on newspaper sites going down, such ideas seem old. Already 360 US papers - including most of the biggest and best - have built paywalls around their products. However, the best way to get people to pay seems to be a deal that offers the print copy and digital access together. In other words, print is also important in selling internet subscriptions. And its advertising rates make nine to ten times more money than online. Of course, this big difference isn't good news for newspaper companies, as keeping both a website and a print edition is hard, complex, and expensive. But newspaper brands still have much of their high profile in print; on the web, the job of just being noticed becomes much harder.'"
CAE_32,"**Taking Photos of People**

People are very interesting to photograph. A photo with a person is usually more interesting than one without. But, taking good photos of people can be hard. The photographer must think about actions, gestures, and expressions. Sometimes, the camera can make people act differently.

**A. Group Photos**

In group photos, avoid straight lines. Ask people to stand at different angles and distances. Some can sit or kneel in front so you can see all faces. Or, you can take the photo from a higher place.

**B. Posing for Photos**

People often act stiff in front of a camera. Help them relax by finding a comfortable position. They can fold their hands or put them in their pockets.

**C. The Right Way**

Do not pretend you are not taking a photo. This can make people feel tense. Most people will agree to have their photo taken. They might feel shy at first, but they usually like it. You may need to guide them. A photo can be ruined if the person is looking away.

**D. Eye Contact**

A photo is more powerful if the person looks at the camera. Ask them to look into the lens. They do not have to smile. Remind them to look just before you take the photo. You can also say something funny to get a real reaction.

**E. Candid Focus**

Instead of looking at the camera, the person can focus on something else in the photo. This can make them feel more comfortable. The viewer can see what the person is looking at. Candid photos are interesting, and the expression is important.

**F. Expressions and Gestures**

Expressions and gestures tell us a lot about a person. A laughing child makes us smile, while a sad face makes us feel sad too. Look for familiar expressions like winks, anger, or thumbs-up. They are a visual language.

**G. Background Interest**

A background can add interest to a photo. Make sure the background does not take attention away from the person. Use a wide-angle lens to make the person look larger compared to the background.

**H. Interaction**

When people are talking, joking, or working together, there are chances for good photos. Look for eye contact or physical contact, like a handshake. Show how one person reacts to another.

**I. People and Places**

Many photos of people are taken on holiday. To show people with a background, use a wide-angle lens. Move back to get the whole scene in the photo. Ask people to stand close to the camera. A good photo shows a balance between people and the place.

**J. To Pose or Not to Pose?**

Decide why you want to take the photo. If you want to remember someone, ask them to pose with a nice background. Family photos can be boring if they are all posed. Candid photos of events are more lively. A spontaneous photo can bring back memories better than a posed one."
CAE_65,"Text: 'Under Sarah's Spell Sarah Janson is an artist who makes trompe-l'oeil paintings. These paintings trick the eye and look very real. Joanna Watt interviews her. Sarah Janson does not usually sign her paintings unless someone asks her to. She believes the work is more important than the artist. Janson is very modest and acts like her paintings make themselves. She says, 'I don't like to talk about myself,' and feels shy about being photographed. But later, in her living room full of art, she becomes more relaxed and the interview is fun and interesting. Janson has been a trompe-l'oeil artist for sixteen years. She studied drawing for two years at art school, got a degree in graphic illustration, and worked at a publishing house. But she was not happy with illustration, so she joined a decorator named Jim Smart. He asked her to make a trompe-l'oeil painting, and she loved it. She decided to work on her own, feeling she was on the right path. Janson's skills in observing and detail, learned from illustrating, are important for trompe-l'oeil. She says, 'No one can teach you trompe-l'oeil. It's about observing life.' She believes she is still learning and says, 'If you think you know everything, you should stop.' Janson is honest about her weaknesses, like not being able to paint bread well. When she had to paint a big ceiling, she felt unsure and thought, 'I'm not Michelangelo.' Janson sometimes talks about herself as if she is someone else. She says, 'When I finished that ceiling, I thought, ""Well I didn't do it, she did"".' Her work is very good and different from others who try trompe-l'oeil. She has done many big projects for companies and private clients. Her work is often inspired by buildings. For example, she painted a dining room to look like a Venetian palace and a corridor to look like it leads to more rooms. Trompe-l'oeil must trick you and keep your interest. Janson says it should also be personal for the client. She enjoys working with clients and getting ideas from them. Some clients know what they want, and others do not. She listens to them and tries to understand their imagination. Many clients become her friends because she spends a lot of time with them. Janson thanks her clients for letting her paint on their walls. They are happy with her work, so she is always busy, even though she does not like to talk about her talent. She says, 'I don't like to talk about myself. Like my work, I am quiet. I don't want it to be loud.' But you could never get bored with Janson or her work. It should be more famous, and I am happy to talk about how great she is.'"
CAE_61,"**Emotional Intelligence - The Key to Success**

Daniel Goleman talks about 'people skills' that are important for success at work.

**A** The way we are judged at work is changing. It's not just about being smart or having good training. It's also about how well we handle ourselves and others. These skills help decide who gets hired or promoted. They show who might do very well and who might not. These skills are important for future jobs too. They are not about doing well in school exams. Instead, they focus on social skills and personal qualities like being able to take action, understand others, adapt, and persuade. These are called emotional intelligence.

**B** Today, job security is not guaranteed, so personal qualities are important at work. Emotional intelligence is a new name for skills like understanding and managing our own and others' feelings. It includes self-awareness, self-control, motivation, empathy, and good social skills. It's not just about being nice. Sometimes it means telling someone the hard truth. It also means managing feelings so people can work well together.

**C** Many businesses now see emotional intelligence as important for management. The more complex the job, the more these skills matter. People with good emotional intelligence help companies work better together. In today's workplace, teamwork and customer focus are important, so emotional skills are needed everywhere.

**D** Unlike IQ, which doesn't change much, emotional intelligence can grow as we learn from life. Studies show people get better at handling emotions and social skills over time. This growth is called maturity. We can learn emotional intelligence and use it to help us in life. It's important now when job stability is uncertain. Emotional intelligence is not a magic solution for all problems, but without it, other things may not work as well."

Social media has changed how people share these pictures. Now, news often starts on social networks, and some journalists use these pictures for their stories. Sometimes, reporters use these pictures without asking. There is a rule that says pictures on social media can be used without asking if there is a very good reason. But people still talk about whether this is right or wrong. Research shows that about one in ten people would take pictures or videos of a news event. This means that these pictures are important for the media's future. But, to keep a good relationship with the public, the media should make sure people are paid for their pictures and always ask for permission.'"
CAE_28,"**Ancient Chinese Medicine in the West**

**Acupuncture** is a treatment that is 2,000 years old. It comes from traditional Chinese medicine, which also includes herbal medicine, massage, diet, and exercise. Acupuncture is used to help with many health problems, but it is most known in the West for helping with pain. Some doctors, midwives, and physiotherapists use it to help people with pain.

**What is Acupuncture?** Traditional Chinese medicine believes that health is when the energy of the mind, body, and spirit are balanced. This energy is called Qi (pronounced ""chee""). Qi moves through the body along lines called meridians. There are twelve main meridians, each connected to an organ. If the flow of Qi is blocked or weak, the body can become unbalanced, leading to illness. An acupuncturist will try to find where the Qi is not balanced. They do this by feeling your pulse, looking at your tongue, and asking about your health, mood, and habits. They use thin needles in the skin and may also use heat or pressure to help Qi flow.

**Acupuncture Points** There are over 300 points on the main meridians where needles can be placed. These points may not be near where you feel pain. People often feel a dull ache or tingling when the needle is used. This feeling shows the needle has reached the Qi.

**How Does It Work?** Western doctors have found that acupuncture can help with pain. They think it works because it might block pain signals from reaching the brain or because it releases natural pain-relieving chemicals in the body.

**Types of Pain Treated** Many people with long-term pain try acupuncture. It is used for back pain, sports injuries, arthritis, headaches, and pain after surgery. Acupuncturists also say it can help with menstrual pain, facial nerve pain, and pain in very sick people.

**Modern Use** Acupuncture has been used in China for over 2,000 years, but using it instead of anesthesia in surgery started in the 1950s. This helped some doctors outside China see that acupuncture could be more than just a mental effect. In China, acupuncture is used in many surgeries, sometimes with electrical stimulation or drugs. It is said to reduce pain without the side effects of regular anesthesia, like nausea.

**Effectiveness** Clinical trials for acupuncture are hard to do, but some show that 50 to 80 percent of people find it helps with chronic pain. Acupuncturists say it usually takes six or seven visits to feel real relief, but some improvement should be felt after two or three visits.

**Different Views on Pain** Western and Chinese medicine see pain differently. Acupuncturists look at the whole person, not just the symptoms. They spend time finding out what might be causing the pain, like if it is worse in cold or damp weather. This helps them decide how to treat the pain.

**Choosing an Acupuncturist** Some medical professionals are trained in traditional acupuncture, while others use scientific explanations. Traditional acupuncturists believe that using Chinese medicine can lead to a longer-lasting cure. It is important to choose a good acupuncturist who will refer you to a doctor if needed."

James is very humble and does not think she is the most famous crime writer in Britain, even though many people around the world read her 12 detective novels. She likes the books of her friend Ruth Rendell, especially those written under the name Barbara Vine. She also enjoys books by women writers like Iris Murdoch and Anita Brookner, and some male writers like Graham Greene.

P.D. James became successful later in life. She was 42 when her first book, ""Cover Her Face,"" was published. She was born in Oxford and grew up in Cambridge. She met her husband, Connor Bantry White, in Cambridge. He was a student there. Her life was difficult at times. Her husband came back from World War II very sick. She had to work hard to support him and their two daughters, Clare and Jane. Her husband's parents helped a lot by taking care of the children.

She worked for the National Health Service and later for the Home Office. She worked in the Police Department and the Criminal Law section. She saw many dead bodies while working in forensic science, but she was more interested in writing crime stories. She liked the challenge of writing a detective story. She wanted to be a serious writer and thought detective stories were a good start. Writing these stories helped her bring order to chaos. She believes solving a crime shows the importance of life, even if the person was not well-liked. She says nobody really likes violence."
CAE_5,"Text: 'Handwriting Can Show Your Character

In some countries, when you apply for a job, you might need to give a sample of your handwriting. This is because handwriting analysis, or graphology, is used to see if you are right for the job. Many people believe that graphology is a real science. They say it can help find illnesses like heart disease and cancer, and show how a person feels or if they have emotional problems. Big companies use graphologists to look at the handwriting of people who want important jobs. But many doctors and psychiatrists do not believe in graphology.

Patricia Marne, a graphologist for over 20 years, thinks doctors should take it seriously. She says handwriting can show if someone is smart, what they might be good at, and if they are honest or tricky. She also says it can help see if someone might be a criminal. Criminals often have messy handwriting. They might write like children or go over letters many times. Ms. Marne can tell if people are honest, tricky, or good workers. She says young male criminals often have tall letters, showing they dream a lot. Graphologists can see if someone might become violent, is under a lot of stress, or has mental problems. Handwriting can also show if someone might think about suicide.

Ms. Marne says handwriting can show health problems too. If handwriting changes a lot, it might mean something serious is happening. A big emotional problem can change a signature for a short time. She also says people with 'thread' letters are clever but tricky. People who write in all capitals are hiding their true selves. Light writing means someone is sensitive. Original handwriting shows confidence and artistic talent. Disconnected writing means the person likes to be alone. Small signatures show someone might feel shy or not good enough. Circles over the 'i' mean the person wants attention, and crossing the 't' hard means they might be bossy.

Ms. Marne says it takes six years to learn how to read handwriting well. She thinks more research is needed to make graphology a real science. She believes it is better than psychoanalysis because you can learn about a person without asking them questions. But there is not much proof for these ideas. Some psychiatrists say handwriting only shows how a person was taught to write and their artistic skills.'"

We visited four different offices to see how healthy and happy they were. Our expert team included a building health consultant, an ergonomist (who studies people's working conditions), and an occupational psychologist. Here are their opinions.

Office A: Advertising Agency
Building Health Consultant: This office is very simple; no central heating, no mechanical ventilation, and windows open to the street. The team of seven people seems happy and adapts to the seasons by opening doors and using electric heaters. They have created a homely work environment without much outside control.
Ergonomist: The furniture is mixed and often creates bad postures. Chairs are old, not adjustable, and many are broken. However, the team has a varied work schedule, which helps reduce tiredness and boredom.
Occupational Psychologist: Staff enjoy the variety of work and the flexible office space. The office is the right size for knowing what others are doing but also having personal space. It feels efficient and creative.

Office B: News Service
Building Health Consultant: The office is comfortable and the air quality is good, helped by a No Smoking policy.
Ergonomist: Chairs, lighting, and computer equipment are good. The space is well-used, but the layout could be better. The office feels impersonal with grey walls.
Occupational Psychologist: Walls are bare except for planners and a poster. Staff relationships are okay. The office could improve by making it easier to share information and displaying success stories.

Office C: Bank
Building Health Consultant: The office feels like a glass case. Even with smokers, the air is not stale.
Ergonomist: The office is standard and uninspiring. Desks are just adequate, and not all chairs meet requirements. Computer setups are outdated.
Occupational Psychologist: Staff support each other and use technology well. The office is busy, but the wood panels and brown carpet make it look dull.

Office D: Newspaper
Building Health Consultant: The air-conditioning is poor, causing temperature changes. The space is cluttered and dusty.
Ergonomist: The furniture is not suitable for a modern office. Chairs are old and not adjustable, making it hard for shorter people to work comfortably.
Occupational Psychologist: The office is dirty and needs cleaning. There is little conversation, and everyone seems stressed. The company should focus on teamwork.'"
CAE_38,"**Chewing Gum Culture**

Chewing gum is popular and people in America chew 12 million pieces every day. It started as an old custom and is now a big business. Each piece of gum has less than ten calories, but it is still considered food. This means it must follow the rules of the American Food and Drug Administration. 

Today, most gum is made from synthetic materials, with added pine resins and softeners to keep the flavor and make it feel nice to chew. But this was not always true. Long ago, the ancient Greeks chewed a gum-like resin from the bark of the mastic tree, found in Greece and Turkey. Greek women liked mastic gum to clean their teeth and freshen their breath. 

In America, colonists learned from the Amero-Indians in New England to chew resin from spruce trees. In the early 1800s, people in the eastern United States could buy lumps of spruce for chewing, making it the first commercial chewing gum in the country.

Modern chewing gum began in the late 1860s with chicle, a milky substance from the sapodilla tree in Central America. This gum was smoother and more elastic, leading to a new industry. However, growing sapodilla trees commercially has not worked well. As the gum market grew, synthetic alternatives were needed. 

Today, a few chicle gatherers, called chicleros, still work in difficult conditions. They travel long distances in hot, humid forests to collect sapodilla sap. They face dangers like poisonous snakes and insects. The chicle fly is especially troublesome because it lays eggs in the tappers' ears and nose. Chicleros climb trees with just a rope and an axe to collect the sap, which they carry to a camp to boil and make into bricks. Life at the camp is hard, with simple food and local alcohol.

Even though their work is tough, chicleros worry about losing their jobs. The United States used to import 7,000 tonnes of chicle a year from Central America, but last year only 200 tonnes were collected in Mexico's Yucatan peninsula. As gum sales have increased, manufacturers use more synthetic materials to save money and meet demand.

Gum producers are finding new ways to sell their products. They say gum helps you relax, gives you energy, and reduces tension. Soldiers in both world wars were given gum. Gum is also said to reduce tooth decay by increasing saliva, which helps protect teeth. Research continues to create new textures and flavors. Glycerine and vegetable oils are used in gum, and most new flavors are artificial, but some still need natural ingredients. In America, 137 square kilometers are used to grow mint for the two most popular chewing gums in the world."

Sue Brown works as a hotel inspector. Christopher Middleton watched her do her job. During the annual check, the Globe Hotel is already having problems. The receptionist is talking on the phone and does not notice Sue Brown, the real guest. Sue whispers, ""Very poor."" This is a common mistake she has seen many times in her 11 years as an inspector. The Globe Hotel has three red stars, which means it is one of the top 130 hotels out of 4,000 in the guide. But Sue is not impressed. 

When they arrived, they had to enter through an empty door with a buzzer and walk down a long, empty hallway. Sue says, ""Not what I expected."" Things get worse when the receptionist says they have no record of Sue's booking. Most of the hotel's rooms are empty that night. Sue's room is on the top floor, but she does not like it. It is stuffy, and there is a big hole in the wall behind the wardrobe.

Sue used to be known as ""The Woman in Black"" because she was tough, but she says she was never too tough. The next morning, after paying her bill, she tells the hotel manager, Robin Greaves, who she is. He looks worried. He apologizes for a bad smell in the main lounge. Sue suggests fixing the plumbing and not taking guests to that room. Greaves agrees and takes notes. He has been at the hotel for only five months. Sue says her feedback will help the hotel in the long run.

Not everything is bad. Sue praises Emma, the assistant manager, and Trudy, the waitress, for their good work. Dinner was good enough to keep the hotel's two-rosette food rating. Greaves asks how to get three rosettes. Sue says, ""Don't serve a pudding that collapses."" Greaves looks disappointed.

Sue's job is to say what other guests are afraid to say. Sometimes people complain about her, but she tells the truth. Sue writes a full report for the hotel. They pay to be in the guide, so they want her advice. The good news for Greaves is that Sue will not recommend taking away the hotel's red stars. But another inspector will come in the next two months to check if things are better. Greaves says, ""Good,"" but he does not look happy."

This was strange because only Dougal and I were there. I thought it was because of low oxygen. I then found myself talking to my feet. The cold was getting to my feet, and I remembered other climbers who lost fingers and toes to frostbite. We were more worried about how we would survive than if we would survive. Over the next two days, I thought about our time on the summit ridge. I realized I couldn't have been there with a better person than Dougal Haston. He gave me confidence, and I felt calm, thinking it would all work out. I knew I needed a better rhythm to reach the top, and I did. B. Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m) This mountain is known as one of the most dangerous in the world. In April 1976, Dougal and I arrived at the Kahiltna Glacier and spent four days carrying equipment and food to the base. After the first day of climbing, we realized how big our task was. On the lower part, we followed a route from 1967, but halfway up, we took a new route to the upper snow basin and the summit. We decided to climb 'alpine style', carrying our equipment and food. It was the first time a major new route was climbed this way. We climbed up the snow of an avalanche scar to camp under a rocky cliff, and by the third day, my sleeping bag was wet. We spent the third night on a windy ridge; by now, we were both suffering. Mt. McKinley, because of lower air pressure in polar regions, affects the body more than its height suggests. It felt like we were at 7,000m, not 6,100m. We packed our bags and finally reached the summit and went down the other side, feeling triumphant. C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,895m) In September 1976, Paul Braithwaite and I flew to Nairobi to climb Mt. Kenya. But we got a free ride to the Tanzanian side of Kilimanjaro, so we climbed Africa's highest mountain. On our way, we got lost in the thick jungles of the lower slopes. It was serious because water was scarce. On the second day, we found arrows on trees and a trail of rubbish that led us to a rock pool. I was never so happy to find rubbish on a mountain. We tried a direct start to the breach wall, a 305m-high icicle. After falling rock and ice, we wisely chose the Umbwe route to reach the summit. D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m) The original route up Aconcagua is like a walk. In January 1992, I arrived with my wife, Sharu, at Punta del Inca and met fellow climber and guide, Phil Erscheler. He was taking a group up the mountain via the Polish Glacier, away from the busy route, and suggested we join them. After three days of bad weather, we left base camp. The Polish Glacier was icy and windy. With a time limit to return to Buenos Aires for our flight, we skipped the glacier. Instead, we went across the north ridges to the standard route and joined many people on the path. The wind was strong as we walked the last few meters to the summit, and just before dark, we camped outside the refuge. Back at base camp, we met eight members of the Jakarta Mountaineering Club. They wanted to climb the Seven Summits and thought I should do the same when they learned I had climbed four. This was the first time I seriously thought about such a goal. E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m) When I learned that climbing Vinson Massif was just about guiding enough people to pay for the trip, climbing all Seven Summits became possible. Our team left Britain in late November 1992 and traveled to the South Pole. At this time of year, the sun is always up, day and night, and when the wind stops, it is very quiet. In the clean air, the atmosphere is refreshing, and spirits are lifted just by being there. On December 7, we left camp and headed to the summit. Despite strong winds and temperatures below minus 50°C, we all reached the top in 8 hours. Our happiness was lessened by the storm, which reduced visibility to a few meters. F. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m) Our team met in St Petersburg in early summer 1994. When we arrived at Terskol, below Elbrus, a fee was asked from our guide for bringing foreigners, but it was later waived. After a few days of getting used to the altitude, the group took a cableway to 3,900m. From there, we walked to the refuge at 4,200m. Two days later, the wind was strong as we crossed open slopes, some icy. By mid-afternoon, we reached what we thought was the summit. But there was another kilometer-long ridge to the actual summit. As night fell, we returned to the refuge and the next day went down this extinct volcano. G. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m) On our trip to Carstensz, we wanted to make a new route and spend time with the aboriginal Dani people. The largest gold mine in the world is cutting into the mountain, which is sacred to the local tribes. We were warned we might be taken hostage or harmed by bandits, but we continued. On May 12, we started climbing. The weather got better, and two team members went ahead. We were slower because Sham was filming. Climbing in rock shoes, we reached the summit by 11 am. I received a standing ovation on this, my seventh summit. Mission accomplished!'"
FCE_15,"Text: 'Style Merchants Style is important in our lives today, from clothes to home decoration and accessories. Jo Foley talks about the trends for this year's fashion lovers. Ned Ingham: Dress Designer Ned Ingham makes beautiful, romantic wedding dresses. 'People should choose simpler styles instead of traditional, stiff dresses,' he says. Ingham started drawing and designing wedding dresses when he was a schoolboy. At 16, he went to fashion school to learn how to make clothes. You don't have to be a bride to wear an Ingham dress: he also designs long evening dresses with new colors and fabrics. For those who like classic styles, Ingham offers a summer navy-blue suit, a key piece in English fashion for many years. Sally Quail: Jeweller Sally Quail used to work for an art dealer but didn't study jewellery formally. She started designing jewellery when she couldn't find an engagement ring she liked. This led her to become a designer in 1990. Now, many famous people wear her jewellery. Her style includes large semi-precious stones set in gold, inspired by the 18th century. Recently, she started using diamonds. 'It reflects my age,' says 36-year-old Quail. 'I wanted a diamond, so I began working with them.' Lily Grimson: Handbag Designer Lily Grimson started her business four years ago and has already had two of her handbags chosen for a big design exhibition. Her bags are always noticed. All of Grimson's bags are handmade in the UK. They are glamorous, made from fine calfskin or heavy silk. A mix of style and care makes a Grimson bag special. Peter Little: Hairdresser For over 20 years, Peter Little has styled the hair of many famous people. 'Most women want hair that looks natural and is easy to manage at home,' he says. His goal is to make sure his clients don't look like they just left a salon. But this natural look is expensive - £250 for the first visit, and there's a three-month waiting list. Peter has also created his own line of hairdryers and styling tools. Now, people can style their hair at home. Penny Pratt: Florist Penny Pratt runs a small shop and is a flower consultant for a big supermarket chain. She also gives ideas to top restaurants. She used to be a teacher but changed careers 10 years ago. Her simple, modern flower designs have won many prizes, helping her start her own London Flower School. She has given successful lectures in Japan and the USA. She says, 'Flower arrangements are simpler now. Keep them simple but strong, and don't use too many leaves. For wedding bouquets, use flowers of the same kind.'"
FCE_19,"**Five-star luxury with modern technology**

The five-star Merrion Hotel has just opened in Dublin. It took almost two years to change four big old houses into this hotel. The hotel has the latest technology for both staff and guests. The General Manager, Peter MacCann, wants his staff to know guests by name. For other details, he uses the hotel's computer system. This system helps treat returning guests in a special way. It cost £250,000 to install, but MacCann believes it will be worth it. For example, if a guest asks for certain music CDs during their first stay, they will find those CDs ready on their next visit. 

Guests often complain about room temperature. The hotel has a high-tech system to control this. Guests can change the temperature a little themselves, or the front desk can adjust it more. Business guests will like the technology in their rooms. MacCann thinks 65% of guests will be business travelers. Each room has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine, and a video-conferencing facility. The hotel has extra cables for future technology changes. TVs are rented, so they can be updated easily. DVD recorders can also be upgraded.

Even with all this technology, the rooms are comfortable and welcoming. The hotel has 145 large bedrooms, a swimming pool, gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a beautiful garden. The food must be excellent. Chef Patrick Guilbaud, who has two Michelin stars, moved his restaurant to the Merrion. This is good for both him and the hotel. He has a new kitchen and better parking. The hotel offers a popular place to eat without financial risk. With technology and a great staff, the Merrion is likely to succeed."
FCE_24,"Artist Susan Shepherd is famous for her flower paintings. Her big garden around her house gives her many flowers to paint. She loves tulips and poppies the most. Some plants grow wildly all over the garden. The garden looks beautiful with colors and shapes, thanks to the people who owned it before. They were good gardeners and left plants that Susan likes. She also got a gardener named Danny from them. Susan says, ""It was really his garden."" They worked well together. At first, Danny didn't agree with some of Susan's ideas, but when she explained she wanted to paint them, he understood.

Susan likes to paint one plant at a time, not the whole garden. Sometimes she paints a group of plants, but usually, she picks them and takes them to her studio. She paints one flower at a time, which can take a few days, and then adds more flowers. Sometimes, it takes years to finish a painting. Spring and early summer are her busiest times because the tulips and poppies bloom then. She finds it interesting how flowers change over time. For example, tulips change shape when you put them in water.

Susan has always liked plants. She studied botany in school and collected wildflowers. She didn't like garden flowers before because they looked fake to her. She was amazed by how wildflowers grew in difficult places like rocks. Now, her garden has plants from faraway places like China and the Himalayas. She lets the garden grow freely, like a kind aunt who lets children play as long as they don't break anything. Susan is busy with two upcoming exhibitions and doesn't have much time for gardening. She hired another gardener but knows she needs to work in the garden to stay connected to her art."
FCE_13,"Many trees in the Brackham area fell down in the big storms that March. The town lost two big lime trees from the old market square. This changed how the town center looked, which upset some people. One of these people would usually be Chief Inspector Douglas Pelham, head of the local police. But during the storm, when the wind knocked down the walnut tree in his garden, Pelham was too sick to notice. He was a strong man, but he got very sick with bronchitis for the first time. When he first felt a headache and tightness in his chest, his wife, Molly, told him to see a doctor. Pelham thought the police needed him, so he ignored her and kept working. This made him forget things and get angry easily. Finally, his colleague, Sergeant Lloyd, took him to the doctor. He was too weak to argue. Soon, he got his medicine and went home to his wife, who sent him to bed. On Thursday morning, Molly told him the walnut tree fell during the night, but Pelham couldn't understand. On Thursday evening, he asked about damage to the house, was happy there was none, and went back to sleep. On Saturday, when he felt better, he saw that the missing walnut tree changed how the living-room looked. The Pelhams' big house had a large garden. It was expensive, but Pelham was happy they bought it. The garden made it feel private. But now, the storm changed things. Before, the walnut tree was part of the view from the living-room. It didn't make the room dark because there was another window, but it made nice light patterns that hid the old furniture. With the tree gone, the room was very bright, and the old furniture looked shabby. The view from the window was not nice. The tall house next door, which the tree hid before, was now visible with its ugly purple bricks and pipes. It had many windows that seemed to watch the Pelhams. 'Doesn't it look terrible?' Pelham said to his wife. But Molly, standing in the doorway, sounded happy. 'I've been telling you since we moved here. We need to buy a new sofa, no matter the cost.'"
FCE_16,"**Living in the Valley**

We had been living in our valley for sixteen months when we first understood the dangers in the hills around us. It was the year when the storms came early, before winter, even before November ended. Until then, we felt safe in our valley below the hills. Soon, snow began to fall. In one day, it was about 15 centimetres deep. It almost blocked our road and made the path by the stream slippery and dangerous. But on the hills, the snow was much deeper and stayed longer. Up there, the wind was very strong. In our valley, we only felt sudden strong winds; trees moved, but the branches stayed strong. Still, we knew we had a reason to worry. The snow and wind were inconvenient, but they did not trouble us much. It was the river, the Ryburn, which usually flowed gently, that worried us most. It reminded us of what could happen if the water from the hills was not controlled by dams built many years ago.

Soon, the snow started to melt. Every day, we watched dark clouds over the hills to the west. Grey clouds spread over the valleys. They moved and rose, warning us of what was coming. We had seen enough of the sky; now we watched the river, which was becoming fuller and wilder every day. The snow was washed away as more rain came from the clouds, but high in the hills, the reservoir was filling and was close to danger level. Then it happened - for the first time in years, the reservoir overflowed. Up in the hills, it was like Niagara Falls, as water rushed over the dam and into the stream below. The river seemed wild as the waters rushed down. Just a couple of metres from our cottage, the stream was wild under the bridge. It was deeper than we had ever seen it near our home, hitting its banks hard. For three days, we hoped it would stay below its wall. Luckily, our hopes were answered as the dam held and the waters began to go down.

Many times before the dam was built, the river had flooded the nearby villages. Now, the dam controls the river, and usually, all is well; the water from the hills, from snow and heavy rain, stays behind the dam with just a little overflow sometimes. We can enjoy, not fear, the big clouds over the valley, and be amazed by the river's power. Thanks to this protection, we feel our home in the valley is still safe."
FCE_21,"Text: 'Film Critic Mark Adams talks about his last ten years working as a film critic for a newspaper called The Front Page. Writing about films for The Front Page was my first real job. Before that, I wrote reviews for novels in other newspapers, films for a magazine, and anything for the radio. That's how I met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page. He also wrote for radio and TV. He hired me, but Tom was not mainly a journalist, or he would have been more careful in choosing his team. At first, he wanted a team of critics to cover art forms that didn't need special knowledge: books, TV, theatre, film, and radio. We would have a weekly lunch to choose what to review from the material Tom picked, and there would be guests to make it friendly. It felt like a dream then: a new newspaper, and I was part of the team. It seemed unlikely that a new paper could succeed in a crowded market. It seemed just as likely that a rich person wanted to help me and was pretending to hire me. I didn't have much confidence. The first time I saw someone reading the newspaper on the London Underground and turning to my review, I didn't know where to look. Tom's idea for a team of critics never happened. It was a good idea, but we didn't meet as planned, so everything was done by phone. It turned out that people preferred a reviewer to focus on one subject, so I chose film. Without Tom's help, we wouldn't have the current setup, where I write a long piece each week, usually on one film. This way of working suits me well. I wouldn't like the usual film critic's job, which means reviewing every film that comes out. That would make me bored quickly. I would soon be sitting in my seat on a Monday morning thinking, 'What bad film must I watch now?' - a feeling common in screening rooms worldwide. The space I have lets me expand my argument - or forces me, in a dull week, to make something interesting. But what is my role for the public? I think people choose films based on the stars, the publicity, or the director. People also have loyalty to a 'type' of film or the opposite. It's rare for someone who hates westerns to buy a ticket for one after reading a review, or for a fan of love stories to avoid a romantic film because of a review. So if a film review isn't really a guide for choosing films, what is it? I don't feel I have to be 'right' about a movie. I also don't think there should be a set number of 'great' and 'bad' films each year. All I have to do is present an argument. I'm not a judge, and I don't want to be.'"

Chance to work with a possible Olympic champion. Must like distance running (15km sessions), distance swimming (training in cold rivers), and distance cycling (100km rides). Must do all three without stopping. The triathlon is becoming a popular Olympic sport. Many people watch athletes swim 1500m, cycle 40km, then run 10km without stopping. But why do triathletes want to do this? And why does a 17-year-old girl with good school results want to do it? Melanie Sears has not learned the usual answers about personal satisfaction and mental challenge. She says, ""You swim 1500m, then get on your bike, still wet. You freeze. After the 40km cycle, you run 10km, which is hard when you're tired. But it's fun and worth it."" Melanie did her first triathlon at 14. ""I won the junior section, but I was the only junior. It seemed easy, so I waved at my team-mates."" Confident, she entered the National Championships. She had the second fastest swim and the fastest run, but she got lost and cycled 20km too far.

FCE_70,"Text: 'The Collectors Amanda Roy talks about the things she collects and why many people like this hobby. I have always loved collecting, and one in three adults enjoys this hobby. It is a world of passion and happiness. But remember, if you do not love an object, do not collect it. Since ancient times, people have wanted to collect things. Early humans collected pebbles and wore them as necklaces. They liked their shapes and colors. Over the years, not much has changed. Children still collect stones and seashells because they are beautiful. I have been collecting all my life. I collect many things, like flowers, pottery, and paintings. My first collection was stones from my parents' garden. When I was six, I went to a school in a remote part of England. It was cold and windy, with many hills. When my parents visited, they took me to a local museum. It was full of objects collected by people in the past. I was fascinated by these objects. Many people are interested in collecting. One in three adults shares this passion. People collect for different reasons. Some people like it because they can control it. For me, it's just something I enjoy. A famous collector was the Duc de Berry in France. He had a 'room of wonders' with many interesting things. Catherine the Great of Russia collected over 4,000 paintings. But you do not have to be rich to start a collection. I have collected tulip bulbs and china cups. I remember getting a special tulip from another collector. I planted it, but one year it was stolen. I also collected 350 American rag dolls. I looked all over the USA for them. This collection was destroyed in a house fire. The next day, I saw the remains of my furniture and collection. I was very sad. I am interested in how collections change hands. A silver spoon that belonged to a king or poet is valuable. As small objects become popular, their prices go up. Toys from the 1950s are now an investment if you kept the original boxes. (I threw mine away.)'"

Four people talk about their jobs.

**Lisa - Exhibition Programmes Organiser, Science Museum**

I organize temporary exhibitions. This means I plan and design the exhibition and tell people about it. I read about the exhibition topic and talk to experts. I decide on the main themes and what objects and pictures to show. I make sure visitors understand the exhibition by planning interactive displays, workshops, and theatre. I also work with engineers and electricians to keep the exhibition safe. Before it opens, I help create brochures and leaflets to inform people.

**Janet - Teacher of London Taxi Drivers**

I start work at 7.30 a.m. by checking the accounts. Then, I see what new maps and documents are needed for the London taxi-driver test. By midday, about 50 students are learning the routes. They find the best way using one-way streets and turns. I help when there is a disagreement, like if a right turn is allowed at a junction. Close to the test, I give them a route and tell them to find another way because the road is closed. This makes them think.

**Sarah - Marine Conservationist**

I live by the sea and work from home. I answer phone calls, create educational materials, and set up training courses. Sometimes, I go to the main office, but mostly I am by the sea. I work with schools and run courses for people who make decisions about the sea. I take them out on a boat to see sea life. This often changes their views. I love my job because conservation is my hobby. But, I work for a charity, so I always need more money and resources.

**Chris - Map and Atlas Publisher**

My job is varied. I make sure our books match what the market needs and keep stocks of about 300 books. We have high standards for information. We get letters from readers about things like international boundaries, and I answer them carefully. I talk about future projects and sales with co-publishers. I work with a great team, which makes the job fun. The downside is there is too much paperwork, leaving less time for interesting tasks like product development and design."

It's a big house by the sea, near the village of Ardbeag. An English couple, the Malseeds, own the house. They have made some changes to it, but very carefully. Strafe found Glencorn for us. He saw an advertisement when the Malseeds still needed to advertise. 'How about this?' he said one evening and read the details. The summer before, we went to a hotel our friends recommended, but it wasn't good because the food was terrible. The four of us have played cards together for a long time: Dekko, Strafe, Cynthia, and me. They call me Milly, but my real name is Dorothy Milson. Dekko got his nickname at school. He and Strafe went to school together, so we call Strafe by his last name, like the teachers did. We are all about the same age and live near the town where the Malseeds lived before moving from England to Ireland. We think it's a coincidence. 'How very nice,' Mrs. Malseed said, smiling when we arrived this year. She always seems to know when guests are coming because she's usually waiting in the big hall that smells like flowers. 'Arthur, take the luggage up,' she told the old porter. 'Rose, Tulip, Lily, and Geranium.' These are the names of the rooms for us. Mrs. Malseed painted flowers on the doors instead of using numbers. In winter, when not many people come to Glencorn Lodge, she does things like that; her husband does repairs. 'Well, well, well,' Mr. Malseed said, coming in from the kitchen. 'A hundred thousand welcomes,' he greeted us in the Irish way. He smiled with his dark brown eyes twinkling, making us feel special. Everyone smiled, and I felt like our holiday had really started. Nothing had changed at Glencorn, everything was good. Kitty from the dining room came to greet us. 'You look younger every year, all four of you,' she said, making everyone laugh. Arthur took our luggage to the rooms, carrying as much as he could and coming back for the rest. After dinner, we played cards for a while but not too long because we were tired from the journey. In the lounge, there was a man alone and a French couple. There were other people at dinner because in June Glencorn Lodge is always full. From where we sat by the window, we could see some people walking on the lawns, others going down the cliff path to the sea. In the morning, we'd do the same: walk along the beach to Ardbeag and have coffee at the hotel there, back in time for lunch. In the afternoon, we'd drive somewhere. I knew this because we always did it. Since we first came here, we all loved the beautiful landscape.'"
FCE_67,"Title: Keeping the Holiday-Makers Happy

Sarah Sutherland-Pilch is a 24-year-old from West Sussex. She works as a chalet girl in Val d'Isere, France. This is her second year doing this job. Sarah cooks and cleans for people who come to ski and stay in chalets. Chalets are wooden houses typical of the area.

Sarah studied French and History of Art at Oxford Brookes University. She says being a chalet girl is not a career, but it is fun for a year or two before starting a serious job. She meets many successful people every week.

Sarah does not live in the chalet. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks to the chalet, which can have up to 18 guests each week. She eats her breakfast and then prepares breakfast for the guests. They have porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants. After breakfast, Sarah cleans up and makes afternoon tea or cleans the rooms. She says cleaning is the worst part of the job.

By 11 a.m., Sarah is ready to ski. She skis as much as she can. On a good day, she skis until 4.30 p.m. She returns to the chalet to prepare dinner. Dinner is three courses and is served at 8 p.m. After dinner, she cleans up and fills the dishwasher. Sometimes she talks with the guests, and other times they want to be alone.

Sarah meets her friends at the chalet where she lives and they go out at about 11 p.m. They visit places like Bananas, G Jay's, and Dick's T-Bar. But she does not stay out late on Saturday night because Sunday is her busiest day.

On Sunday, work starts early. Breakfast for guests leaving is at 7 a.m. After they leave, Sarah cleans the chalet quickly. She clears breakfast, changes the beds, and gets everything ready. If she did not shop on Saturday, she does it now. At 3 p.m., she prepares tea for new guests who arrive at 4.30 p.m. She helps them with questions and takes them to get ski equipment if needed. Then she prepares dinner again. Sometimes she has a drink after dinner, but often she is too tired and goes to bed early."
FCE_27,"Miss Rita Cohen was a small, pale girl who looked much younger than Seymour's daughter, Marie. But she said she was six years older. One day, she came to Seymour's factory. She wore overalls and big shoes, and her pretty face was surrounded by curly hair. She was so small and young that Seymour found it hard to believe she was studying at the University of Pennsylvania. She was doing research on the leather industry in New Jersey for her Master's degree. 

A few times a year, someone would call or write to Seymour to ask if they could see his factory. Sometimes, he would help a student by answering questions on the phone or giving a short tour if they seemed serious. Rita Cohen was almost as small as the children from Marie's third-year class. Years ago, these children came from their school 50 kilometers away to see how Marie's dad made gloves. They especially liked the laying-off table, where the men shaped and pressed each glove over steam-heated brass hands. These hands were very hot, shiny, and stood straight up from the table. Marie called them the 'pancake hands' because they looked flat.

Rita asked, 'How many pieces come in a shipment?' Seymour answered, 'Between twenty and twenty-five thousand.' She kept taking notes and asked, 'Do they come directly to your shipping department?' Seymour liked that she was interested in every detail. He explained, 'They come to the tannery. The tannery is a contractor. We buy the material, and they make it ready for us to work with. My grandfather and father worked in the tannery here in town. I did too, for six months, when I started in the business. Have you ever been inside a tannery?' Rita said, 'Not yet.' Seymour offered, 'I'll set that up for you if you'd like. Tanning is an old industry. They found 6,000-year-old tanning relics in Turkey. The first clothes were just skins tanned by smoking them. My father is the leather expert; you should talk to him. He can talk about gloves for two days. Glovemen love their trade. Have you ever seen anything being made, Miss Cohen?' Rita replied, 'I can't say I have. I saw my mother make a cake when I was a child.' Seymour laughed. She made him laugh. She was eager to learn, like his daughter Marie. 

Seymour said, 'I'll show you the whole process. We'll make you a pair of gloves, and you'll watch them being made from start to finish. What size do you wear?'"

The average earnings are between £25,000 and £35,000, and much of that is spent on travel and hotels. He was 31 when he first caddied for the golfer, Greg Norman. 'You're not just carrying bags. You're giving advice, using your knowledge against the weather, and trying to understand the course.' His accountancy skills were recently noticed by European Tour Productions when they made him a statistical data administrator. From cards brought in by the caddies, he collects and analyzes the statistics of each day's play. The results are wanted by TV commentators, golfing magazines, and the golfers themselves. C. Martin Fern Martin Fern is the editor of the 'Food and Drink' pages of a daily newspaper, and one of his easier tasks is to try food in the best restaurants. What does he think about restaurants that charge very high prices? 'For those who can afford it, it's their choice,' he says. 'I'd rather spend £120 on a meal I'll remember for the rest of my life than buy a microwave.' His talent as a cook led to the offer of a food column from a friend who edited a Saturday Review. For Martin, who was then a creative director of an advertising agency, it was a useful extra income. He was 42 when another newspaper called to offer a full-time job. 'It meant a 50% cut in guaranteed income,' he says. 'But it was a chance to turn my passion into a profession.' He still does all the cooking at home and tries to keep his waistline under control by cycling a couple of miles to the nearest tube station. D. Dick Prince 'I started writing children's stories about 20 years ago,' says Dick Prince, one of Britain's most popular children's writers. 'Before that, I always loved words and enjoyed using them, but my writing was mainly poems. Then I had this idea for a story. I had been a farmer and knew the problem of chickens being killed by a fox. So I wrote a kind of role reversal story called The Fox Busters, which became my first published children's story.' Where do his ideas come from? 'Well, it's not easy, I have to work at them,' he says. 'That is what I usually do in the mornings. I'm not up with the dawn, I'm afraid. After lunch, I spend another couple of hours typing out the morning's writing - all of which I do with one finger on an old portable typewriter rather than on one of those awful laptops. I get between 50 and a hundred letters a week, and that is the part about being a writer that I enjoy the most. I do try to answer them all, but nowadays I have some secretarial help.'"
FCE_66,"Text: 'In the lumberyard by the lake, where trees were made into boards for building, there was an old brick building with two floors. Around the building were big piles of soft sawdust. These piles looked like golden mountains and went all the way to the blue lake. That afternoon, because they were bored, all the boys followed Michael up a ladder to the roof of the old building. They sat with their legs hanging over the edge, looking at the lake. Suddenly, Michael said, 'I dare you to jump down,' and without thinking, he jumped off the roof and landed on the sawdust, laughing. 'I dare you all!' he shouted. 'You're all scared,' he said, trying to make them jump too. Laughing, he watched them from the roof. They looked scared, but one by one, they jumped and smiled with relief. In the hot sun, they lay on the sawdust, telling jokes. Then one boy said, 'Let's go up and jump again.' They weren't very excited, but they all went up and jumped off again, until only Michael was left. The others were below, calling, 'Come on, Mike. What's wrong?' Michael wanted to jump and join them, but he stayed on the roof, nervous and smiling awkwardly. It seemed like a longer drop this time. At first, they thought he was joking, but then they saw him clenching his fists. He tried to count to ten and jump, but it didn't work. He tried to take a deep breath and close his eyes. The boys started to laugh at him; they were tired of waiting, and it was almost dinnertime. 'Come on, you're scared. Do you think we'll wait all night?' they shouted. When he didn't move, they started to leave, still shouting. 'Who started this? What's wrong with you?' he called. But he stayed on the roof, looking sadly at the ground. He was alone for almost an hour while the sun, like a big orange ball, went down over the lake. His clothes were wet from sweating. Finally, he closed his eyes, slipped off the roof, fell on the sawdust, and lay there for a long time. There were no sounds; the workers had gone home. As he lay there, he wondered why he couldn't jump before. Then he got up slowly and walked home, feeling very ashamed and wanting to avoid everyone. He was so late for dinner that his stepmother said coldly, 'You're old enough to come home on time. If you can't, you should stay in tonight.' She was a strong woman with fair skin, a little grey in her hair, and a patient smile. She spoke seriously, but Michael, feeling sad and miserable, hardly listened. He still saw the boys' smiling faces and heard them laugh at him.'"
FCE_44,"**Careers Advice**

Are you unhappy with your job but don't know how to change it? Kitty Doherty has some advice. Many people who want to change jobs go to a careers adviser. You will write a short history about yourself and take some tests called 'psychometrics'. After the tests, you get a report with career suggestions and possible retraining needed.

I tried Career Analysts, a big company that gives career advice. The test felt like a science exam. I was with about ten people, answering questions quickly. It was not about passing or failing. The tests included finding mistakes in lists and matching shapes. After the test, I talked with an adviser. He gave me a report with his thoughts and advice. I agreed with most of it, but I was surprised I did poorly in science and technical tests. I was happy to know I made the right choice with journalism.

Changing your career doesn't always mean a big change. Last March, Donna Laney, 25, lost her job as a marketing manager. Her friends told her to try Career Analysts. 'Losing my job was a chance to look at my career and skills,' says Donna. She found out she was good at design but had to think about the cost of retraining. Other ideas included working in the Far East for a year. She decided to use her skills in a new job as a Public Relations officer. Career Analysts helped her see what she wanted to do. She recommended them to her friends.

Some people feel they couldn't have changed without help. Juliet Greene, 26, went to Career Counselling Services. She worked at a bank for six years and wanted a new challenge. The tests showed she liked sciences. After four sessions with an adviser, she decided to study geology. She thinks the advice was worth the money and feels happier now.

But careers advice doesn't work for everyone. Amanda Margetts, 24, a sales representative, didn't find it helpful. She wanted new ideas but didn't like the options because they needed a big pay cut or a lot of retraining. She felt she didn't learn anything new about herself. She thought a friend could have given similar advice."
FCE_22,"**Fun at the Dentist's?**

If you visit W. Lloyd Jerome's dental office in Glasgow, you will see bright paintings on the wall and a stylish blue couch. Patients sit on this couch while he checks their teeth. Jerome says, ""Half of the people only go to the dentist when they have pain. They are scared."" To help with this, he tries to make a place where people are not afraid. He does not wear a white coat because people think it means pain. He believes dental visits should be relaxing and even fun.

This is surprising for many people who think dental visits are painful or very serious. Jerome says, ""If people are relaxed and happy, they will forget bad experiences."" He uses virtual-reality headsets to help people relax. His office was the first in Britain to use them, and they are very popular. During the first check-up, patients sit on the blue couch and watch a film about underwater animals while he checks their teeth. Then, the headset shows a camera view inside their mouth. Many patients like this part of the visit.

The office smells nice, like a perfume shop, not like a dentist's office. Today, it smells like orange. Jerome says, ""When people come in, I want them to know it is not like a usual dentist's visit. Smell is important. The usual dentist smell can make people scared."" I found the smell very nice.

Jerome is known as Glasgow's most fashionable dentist, but he takes his work seriously. Relaxation is important, but good treatment is the most important. He uses a special tool that sprays warm water to clean teeth instead of scraping them. It feels strange at first, but it is not painful if you are relaxed.

Five years ago, Jerome went to the United States to learn about dental techniques. He learned that making it easier for the patient also makes it easier for the dentist. He thinks this patient-friendly approach will slowly change the formal British dentistry style.

A patient arrives, and Jerome offers him tea and asks what video he wants to watch. The patient seems to enjoy this special treatment. The office feels more like a beauty salon than a regular dentist's office."
FCE_39,"**Chocolate: From Ancient Times to Today**

Chocolate comes from South America and is now a big business around the world. In the UK, people spend over £230 million on chocolate at Easter. Eight percent of all chocolate is bought during this time. Only at Christmas do people eat more chocolate.

The cacao plant, used to make chocolate, was first grown by the Aztec, Toltec, and Mayan people in Central America over 3,000 years ago. The cacao tree is a tropical plant found in Africa, South and Central America, the West Indies, and South-East Asia. Its fruit is the size of a melon and has 20-40 seeds. When dried, these seeds become cacao beans, also known as cocoa beans.

The Aztecs used cocoa beans as money and to make a drink called xocoatl, meaning 'bitter water'. They added spices to the drink for special events. The Spanish liked it better with cinnamon and sugar, but it took a century to become popular in Europe. In the late 1600s, chocolate houses opened in European cities where people drank chocolate.

In 1826, CJ van Houten from the Netherlands made chocolate powder by removing most of the cocoa butter from the beans. In 1847, Fry and Sons in Bristol made the first chocolate bar by mixing cocoa butter, chocolate liquor, and sugar. Later, a Swiss company added milk to make milk chocolate.

In the early 1900s, French companies led the British chocolate market. In 1879, Cadbury named their factory Bournville, hoping to add French style. In 1905, Cadbury's Dairy Milk bar became popular with ads linking it to healthy English milk.

Today, people in Britain eat about four chocolate bars each week. To attract more customers, companies now make chocolate bars into ice creams, drinks, and desserts. Meanwhile, cacao farmers still struggle after a drop in cocoa prices in the 1980s. Many small farmers went out of business. Remember them when you enjoy your next chocolate bar."
FCE_18,"Title: THE SHELL ARTIST

Peter Cooke is 83 years old and very good at his art. He wants to try new things like making paper and working with feathers. But right now, he is happy making beautiful objects from shells. He has been doing this for ten years.

Peter shows me his work in his apartment. He is very excited about it. He points to some shell ornaments above his fireplace. He says he doesn't mind if people don't buy them because he loves them. He never planned to sell his work, but friends encouraged him to have an exhibition. Five years ago, he had an exhibition in London, and 70% of his work was sold. His second exhibition opened yesterday.

The pieces are expensive, with some costing around £2,000. There are 86 pieces in the exhibition, with prices starting at £225 for a shell-flower in a crystal vase. Peter says he doesn't set the prices. He believes no one else makes art like his, and the gallery owner told him that people will want his pieces when he stops making them.

Peter wishes he started this art earlier in life. He feels he could have made even better things. Now, he is limited by his age, but he still creates amazing work. His art is different from the usual shell items found in seaside shops. He makes boxes with tiny shells, pictures from shells, and flowers that look real.

Peter has his own way of working. He uses cardboard from laundered shirts, special glue, and washing-up liquid to clean the shells. He travels to places like France, Thailand, and Mexico to find beautiful shells. He only collects dead shells and defends himself against people who say he is harming the beaches. He believes he is saving shells that would otherwise be broken by the sea or people."
FCE_62,"Text: 'The Schoolgirl Model When 15-year-old Kira Langer is not traveling to exciting places and appearing on magazine covers, she is probably studying for her school exams. Jane Laidlaw finds out more. 'I'm afraid Kira will be a little late,' the receptionist at the agency told me. 'Oh, fine,' I said, 'no problem.' I was trying to forget all the bad things I had read about models, like being difficult, vain, and not smart. And now she was going to be late. How late? An hour? Three hours? Maybe she wouldn't come at all. What if she thought going to the hairdresser's was more fun than talking to me? If she was late, she might be in a bad mood and not answer my questions. But when the winner of the Looks magazine supermodel competition walked in, she was smiling, relaxed, and said sorry for being late. She was with her mother. Kira was not wearing expensive designer clothes but a simple black dress and trainers. She was not selfish; she was just a very friendly, very tall, very pretty girl. All models under 16 must take an adult with them when they work, she explained. Her mother looked like a normal mum, proud of her successful daughter. Kira seems a bit surprised by her new fame, which makes sense because it was not planned. Her older sister decided she should enter the model competition. 'She saw the competition and said I should try it,' Kira remembers. 'I said no, but she sent some photos anyway.' When they called to say she was a finalist, she was at school. Being chosen for the final made Kira confident to continue, and she did great. She won easily, and the Select model agency in London offered her work. Kira now finds it hard to manage her two lives. But her friends and teachers are used to having a star among them. 'They're really proud of me,' she says. However, some unkind people at her school are rude about her success. 'They say I think too much of myself.' This must be hard for Kira because she is not self-important. But she says, 'They think that because I'm a model now, I can't stay the same. But the only thing that's changed is I'm more confident - not in a bad way, but I can stand up for myself more.' As a busy model, her social life is affected. The Select agency can call anytime and tell her she has a job the next day. 'If my friends are going out, I can't say I'll come because I don't know what I'm doing the next day. I can't really make plans, and if I do, they sometimes get canceled, but my friends are good about it. They don't say, ""Oh, you're always going off modeling now, you never have time for us"".' Kira has the looks, ability, and support to have a great career ahead of her. Not many people can say that before they finish school. I am about to finish the interview with the girl who has it all, and I ask what she would like to do if she wasn't a model. She pauses and replies: 'I'd like to do what you're doing.' '"
FCE_49,"Father and Son Search for Gold

Terence and Chris Madden are a father and son team. They have traveled from cold Canada to hot Africa to find gold. Terence is an explorer, and Chris is a mineral expert. They think their mine on a Welsh mountain might have up to 10,000 ounces of gold. After ten years of digging, they believe they are close to finding a gold vein worth five million dollars. Terence, who is 68 and from Liverpool, said, ""We are finding a lot of gold as we dig. We just need to dig a few more meters.""

The Maddens have spent their lives looking for gold. Their search started when Terence read about gold in the ""Dolgellau gold belt,"" near a Welsh town with the same name. They read old mining journals and newspapers at the Welsh National Library in Aberystwyth to find the best place to dig. After clearing the land and finding some gold in the rocks, they spent ten years getting permission to dig, taking earth samples, and cleaning up the area. They dug out 150 tonnes of rock to make a tunnel and a 10-meter shaft. Now, they are running out of money. They need to find someone to give them £50,000 to dig a few more meters. Chris Madden says, ""It looks difficult, but we have some people we can ask.""

Last week, people in the valleys heard about the dig. The idea of finding gold excited both the locals and the gold diggers. Dolgellau depends on tourists, and the residents are hopeful. Peter Woolven, manager of the Royal Ship Hotel, said, ""If they find gold, more people might visit. But I hope not too many people come and dig up the hillside.""

The Welsh gold industry was very busy in the late 1880s, with many mines and workers. But now, it has declined. One of the last mines, Clogau-St David's, which made wedding rings for the Queen and the Princess of Wales, closed a month ago. However, some people are still looking for gold. George Hall, another gold seeker, plans to dig a tunnel on the other side of the hill from the Maddens. Hall, who is 70, said, ""Searching for gold is emotional. It's exciting to find hidden treasure. Maybe I'll be lucky this time."""
FCE_31,"**IN HOT WATER**

Rachel Mills is a scientist. She spends a lot of time at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. Rachel teaches and studies marine geochemistry. This means she looks at chemical processes in the sea. She works at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she is not teaching, she goes into a small steel vehicle. This vehicle is for exploring underwater. It is the size of a small car. She dives three kilometers down into the Atlantic Ocean to study underwater volcanoes. 

Inside the vehicle, space is very small. Rachel can touch the two pilots next to her. They cannot stand up or move much. They must stay inside until someone opens the door from outside. A dive lasts 16 hours. It takes three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours to collect rock and water samples, and three hours to go back up. If there is a problem, they can press a panic button. This releases a small escape vessel that goes quickly to the surface. It is like a ping-pong ball in water. No one has tested it yet, but Rachel thinks it would not be a nice journey.

Rachel remembers her first time in the vehicle. It was on a ship's deck. She got in with an instructor. He showed her emergency procedures, like what to do if the pilot has a heart attack. They wanted to see how she would react in a small space. Now, Rachel has made six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian crew. They went to a place five days' sail west of the Canary Islands. There are many underwater volcanoes there. The Russian team was putting scientific equipment there to study a volcano.

When Rachel is not at sea, she is in her office at the Oceanography Centre. She spends two-thirds of her time teaching. She loves teaching, but she does it so she can continue her research on ""black smokers."" This is another name for underwater volcanoes. Water comes out of the rock and looks like black smoke. It comes out fast and is very hot, at 350 degrees.

Rachel was scared once when she first went down with the Americans. They were towing equipment on a 50-meter rope. Suddenly, there was a big explosion. The shock waves hit their vehicle. Rachel thought she was going to die. They waited in silence. When nothing happened, they were very relieved.

Diving to the deepest part of the ocean is an adventure for Rachel. Every time she looks out and sees the chimneys, she feels wonder. She is at the bottom of the sea, and no one else has seen these places before. She studied the black smokers for three years for her PhD. Seeing them for real was an amazing feeling."
FCE_58,"I was dirty, smelly, hungry, and a bit suntanned. It was the end of my Inter-Rail holiday. My body was tired. My mind was tired of foreign timetables, money, and languages. ""Never again,"" I said when I got home. But I said the same thing the next year. And the year after that. I just needed to buy one train ticket, and because I was under twenty-five, I could travel anywhere in Europe for a whole month. Sleeping in a train corridor is different from sleeping in a bed. The train's movement helps you sleep deeply. Carrying everything in a backpack makes you travel simply. You might even burn socks that smell bad or throw away books when you finish them. This is the Inter-Rail spirit. You can forget about common sense and just enjoy the trip. All you need is a ticket. This train ticket lets young people visit many countries quickly. On my first trip, my friends and I didn't know how special this ticket was. We thought it was just a cheap way to get to our camp-site in southern France. But we wanted to keep traveling because there was always another country to see. And it didn't cost us extra. We were not only interested in culture. This was our first holiday without parents, like many other Inter-Railers. We made our own plans and only saw the easiest sights. We wanted to escape guided tours and do something different. I was proud that sometimes I only saw the view from the train station. We just wanted to have fun. We were like other Inter-Railers, sharing train floors, food, water, money, and music. The excitement of travel comes from seeing a place that was just a name before. It feels like the city is real only when the train arrives, and you see it with your own eyes. By seeing Europe, watching the landscapes change, and noticing different attitudes and lifestyles, you can understand the continent better. Everyone knows what is there, but it means more when you see it yourself. This is why other people's holiday photos can be boring. The train trip won't show you new things in the world, but it is a valuable personal experience. Europe is big, and Inter-Rail helps people see this, even if it takes time."
FCE_37,"Text: 'It is very disappointing to arrive at an airport in another country and find out that your baggage is not there. You might have to wear the same clothes for hours or days until the airline finds your luggage. Sometimes, you might be in a place with a different climate and have to wear clothes that are not right for the weather. Airlines do not often say how many bags they lose, but it happens to people who travel a lot. Even the best airlines make mistakes, and they cannot promise that your checked luggage will be on the same flight, especially if you have to change planes. 

Airlines ask you to check in early to give enough time for your baggage to go through the airport and onto the plane. Minimum connecting times (MCTs) are the shortest times to change between flights, and they are also longer to help with baggage transfers. Usually, this system works well. But extra security checks and air traffic problems can delay flights and cause baggage issues. Sometimes, human error or a torn destination label can also cause problems. These issues are worse at big airports, called 'hubs', because they handle many bags. For example, last year, London's Heathrow airport had over 41 million passengers, with nine million changing planes. British Airways had two million transfer passengers at Heathrow, mostly moving between Terminal 1 and Terminal 4. Even good airports like Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Singapore, and Zurich have bad days. 

The chance of losing baggage is higher at some airports. In the United States, Miami airport is known for losing luggage when passengers connect to flights to Latin America. To avoid losing your baggage, choose direct flights if you can and check in early. If you must change planes or it makes your flight cheaper, try to fly with the same airline. Allow more time for connections by taking an earlier flight to the transfer airport, and label your luggage inside and out with your home and holiday addresses. Include the flight numbers. If your luggage still goes missing, contact the airline official in the baggage hall and fill out a property irregularity report (PIR) before leaving the airport.'"
FCE_2,"Text: 'The Kingfisher Wildlife photographer Charlie James knows a lot about the kingfisher. This is a beautiful blue-green bird that lives near streams and rivers and eats fish. Old trees hang over the stream, giving some shade to the shallow water. The main colors are soft greens, mud browns, and different yellows from the sunlight. The bird moves quickly through this scene, like a flash of light. It is gone in a second, but you remember its image. Charlie James loved kingfishers from a young age. He cannot say exactly why he likes this little bird so much. There are many stories about kingfishers. In Greek myth, a moon goddess turned into a kingfisher. Another story says the kingfisher flew so high that its top became blue like the sky, and its bottom was burned by the sun. There is some truth in this. Kingfishers have no blue color in their feathers. The structure of their feathers reflects light and looks blue. This is why a kingfisher can look bright blue or green, depending on the light. Many wildlife photographers love them. Kingfishers are shy but can be watched from a hideout. This makes people want to photograph them. Charlie James used an old blanket as his first hideout. He waited near a kingfisher's favorite spot. The bird came back and sat close to him. But it took him four years to take a good picture. During this time, he spent a lot of time by a stream with many kingfishers. School made it hard to spend time with the birds, so he missed classes and did not do well in school. But people noticed his interest in kingfishers. At 16, he worked for a nature magazine. Later, he became a freelance wildlife film cameraman. Now, he wants to make a film about kingfishers with just beautiful images and no words. He likes to photograph parts of kingfisher wings. He thinks about the colors of the bird he loves. His photos show some of his feelings, but there is more to his love for kingfishers than his work can show.'"

Anne is American and works with a London opera company that focuses on modern music. She is also becoming known in other European countries with help from the British Arts Council. She has worked with Abbado on many projects since then. B. ANDREW CONSTANTINE Andrew Constantine, 31, says the hardest part of being a conductor is getting the right opportunities. He won a big competition in 1991 after trying twice before. He thinks the timing was perfect because it helped him get many chances to perform. He worked as an assistant to a famous conductor. Now, orchestras like the English Chamber Orchestra invite him back. He hopes people will remember him for his work, not just the competition. C. WASFI KANI Wasfi Kani started Pimlico Opera and loves the long practice time for opera. She began conducting in her late twenties. After university, she worked in London until Pimlico Opera became professional. Lessons with Sian Edwards were important for her.

FCE_23,"**Theme Parks in Britain**

If you want to take children to a theme park, there are many to choose from in Britain. We asked five families to visit some of the best parks.

**Fun Island - The Burns Family**

Last year, we visited a big theme park in the US, so we thought Fun Island might not be as exciting. But we were surprised! The park is great for young children, so our three-year-old had fun too. The kids loved the Crocodile Ride and the Giant Wheel. There is a special dodgems ride for very young kids, which was a big hit. For older children, there are scarier rides like Splash Out, where you jump into a pool! After five hours, Steve and I were tired, but the children wanted to stay longer because they were having so much fun. Our only complaint is that the park could have better scenery. But the staff are very helpful, and the park is clean and safe.

**Wonderland - The McMillan Family**

None of us had been to a theme park before, so we didn't know what to expect. We thought Oscar might be too young, but he loved it. He enjoyed the Mountain Train and Little Land, which has small models of famous buildings. The older children liked the ferris wheel and driving toy cars on a road. We spent six hours there and liked the places to rest. The park looks beautiful, and the staff are friendly. There is something for everyone, even adults.

**Adventure World - The Jeffree Family**

After seven hours, we still had more to see. The children loved the Big Top Circus with its exciting trapeze act. We went on the Terror Line, and although the girls were scared, they enjoyed it. Their favorite ride was Running River, where you think you'll get wet, but you don't. For younger children, Toy Land is fun. The children wanted to try the new ride, Fear Factor, but they were too small. The park is well designed, so waiting in line isn't too boring. It's very clean, and the staff are great. On one ride, a staff member helped by sitting with one of my daughters.

**The Great Park - The Langridge Family**

We arrived at one o'clock and were sad that the park closed at 5 p.m. This park is great for younger children because the rides aren't too scary. I'm usually scared, but I had fun. We all loved Exotic Travels, a boat ride that starts slow and then gets exciting. We waited for half an hour for Lightning River, and it was over quickly! I didn't go on the Big Leap, but it looked fun for brave people. If the children were older, they might find it a bit boring, but they loved it.

**Fantasy World - The Break-all Family**

The park says there is 'No Limit to the Fun', and we agree. Europe's tallest roller-coaster, the Rocket, is very scary, and Ben thought it was the most frightening ride. Jennie thought the Hanger, where you hang upside-down 30 meters above the ground, was even scarier! There are about twelve main rides, and the older children went on them many times. Sarah was too small for some rides, but she liked the Long Slide. The staff were sometimes nice, but not always. You need a full day to enjoy Fantasy World. We couldn't tell the kids we were leaving early."
FCE_60,"**Running a Business in the Countryside**

Five women share their stories about starting a business in the countryside.

**A. Christine Hogan**

Christine Hogan runs a computer-aided design business. She makes over £200,000 a year and has four full-time workers. Christine and her husband moved from London to the countryside when their children were young. She wanted a job she could do from home. Christine had worked with computers before, so her husband suggested starting a computer-aided design business. It was hard at first and needed a lot of money. Christine was careful with spending and talked to the bank manager if she needed more money. Working from home saves money, and she can work in the evenings. Her business is small, and local people usually come to pick up their work.

**B. Maggy Sasanow**

Maggy Sasanow designs greeting cards from home. She studied art at university and wanted to work in a museum, but there were no such jobs in the countryside. So, she started her own business and makes 50 different greeting cards, which she sells to museums. Maggy works in a big room at home. She doesn't advertise; people hear about her through others. She is cheaper than other artists, so people send her work from London. Maggy misses sharing ideas with others, but she likes being independent.

**C. Delia Turner**

Delia Turner has a curtain-making business. She started it eight years ago. At first, her business grew quickly, and she managed six full-time workers. But when the economy got worse, she had to let them go. Now, Delia makes curtains at home with her husband's help and other women who work from their homes. She has to lower her prices sometimes and look for new opportunities.

**D. Tessa Strickland**

Tessa Strickland runs a children's book publishing business from her farmhouse. She moved to the countryside three years ago because London was expensive and she loves the country. Tessa works with authors and artists from around the world. Most of her income comes from deals with Australia, the Far East, and North America, so she takes calls at odd hours. It was hard at first because she felt alone, but she enjoys working when she wants.

Meg Rivers runs a cakes-by-post business and a shop. She makes £250,000 a year and employs six people, some part-time. Meg started making fruit cakes at home ten years ago. She used good quality ingredients and soon got requests from friends and family. Now, she sends cakes all over the country. Seven years ago, she rented a small building for her business. Meg doesn't bake anymore; she manages the business side. Her biggest challenge has been the financial side because she didn't have a lot of money to start with."
FCE_1,"Text: 'Meet the Amazing Watkins Family The sons are musicians and composers, and their dad makes instruments. Matthew Rye reports. Families with musicians are not rare, but it is special to find one with music writers, performers, and an instrument maker. John and Hetty Watkins, teachers from South Wales, needed a cello for their ten-year-old son, Paul. It was too expensive, so John thought about making one. He found the Welsh School of Instrument Making nearby and took evening classes for three years. After making some violins and violas, he tried making a cello. Paul, now 28, says, 'It turned out really well.' John later made another cello for Paul, which he used until recently. John retired from teaching to make instruments full-time and makes about twelve violins a year. He sold one to famous American player Jaime Laredo, which was a big success. Paul and his younger brother, Huw, started playing music early. Paul first played the piano and then the cello. His parents wanted him to play the violin, but he liked the cello player in his dad's music group. Huw was also encouraged to play the violin but chose not to. Huw says, 'My parents were supportive and relaxed.' Now 22, Huw is becoming known as a pianist and composer. John's cello helped Paul win the BBC Young Musician of the Year competition. At 20, Paul became the main cellist of the BBC Symphony Orchestra, using his dad's cello. Now he plays a Francesco Rugeri cello, which is 304 years old, from the Royal Academy of Music. Paul will play the Rugeri on TV in Elgar's Cello Concerto. He says, 'I'm always going to do it my way.' Paul can't watch himself on TV because he is playing at the Cheltenham Festival the same night. Huw's String Quartet will also be performed in London that night. John and Hetty will have to be busy to follow their sons' musical events.'"
FCE_53,"Text: 'Looking after the countryside THE NATIONAL TRUST The National Trust is a group that works to protect the British countryside. Gill Page visits the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales and talks to Gareth Roberts, a warden for the Trust. Gareth says a warden needs common sense and must be good with people. Wardens talk to farmers, visitors, conservationists, and builders. Gareth grew up on the Lleyn Peninsula and worked on his parents' farm. He got the warden job because he knows the area well and has farming experience, even though he didn't have formal training. Gareth still helps on his parents' farm, which helps him understand farmers' problems. He is also strong enough for the job, which includes building fences, planting trees, and making walls. Gareth has learned more about nature conservation since working with the Trust. He remembers collecting flowers and bird nests as a child and now sees how farming has changed the countryside. He says it's not the farmers' fault; they followed government advice. When Gareth started, farmers and conservationists disagreed. Now, they talk and understand each other better. Gareth's work includes conservation, letting people visit Trust land, planting trees, and meeting farmers. He makes sure jobs are done well and cheaply. He likes finishing projects, but he also spends time on paperwork. Gareth loves his job, even though he is always working. He enjoys talking to most people, but some visitors can be rude. He says common sense is important for the job. If you have common sense and like working outside, you might want to be a warden like Gareth. But there might not be a job on the Lleyn Peninsula for a long time!'"
FCE_55,"**The Netball Captain**

In our series about women in sports, Suzie Ellis met England's netball captain. Kendra Slowinski is the captain of England's netball team. When I met her, she had a busy day. She taught at a local school and then trained in a supermarket car park. I asked her, ""Don't people look at you strangely?"" She said, ""I'm too focused on my movements and my feet to notice. I might see cars slow down, but that's all.""

Kendra says, ""My whole life now is about being my best for the Championships."" She follows a strict plan to be very fit. These are her fourth World Championships, and they will be the biggest ever, with 27 countries playing. ""We will have support from people at home, which is special,"" she says. ""It's important to make netball more popular in our country. Playing here means more pressure. People expect us to start with a good game.""

Their first game is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. ""As far as I know, we have always beaten them, but they are exciting to play. They have lots of skill."" The England team is ranked fourth in the world. But the World Championships will be hard. ""You have to play every day, with no rest between games. In a series, you can lose the first game and still win. But in the Championships, you only have one chance.""

In the 15 years she has played at the top level, the sport has become harder and faster. Players are more aggressive. ""You train hard to win,"" says Kendra. ""But after the game, we are all friendlier.""

Netball now uses more science for fitness. ""We must think and train like world-class players,"" says Kendra. ""As captain, I need a strong mind and must lead by example. I support and encourage my team.""

""From the start, my netball career was planned,"" she says. ""I decided this competition would be my last as a player."" She might coach young players in the future, but now she focuses on her last big event. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she might have a tear in her eye."
FCE_50,"**Specialist Music Schools**

What should you do if your child is very good at music? It can be hard to know how to help them. Some parents might not notice their child's talent until the child becomes upset or difficult. Most schools can help children who are good at subjects like math or science, but musically talented children need special help. Regular schools might not have this help, especially if music is not important there. 

Children who are very good at music might benefit from going to a specialist music school. In Britain, there are five such schools. These schools help children aged seven to eighteen to improve their music skills with the help of professional musicians. At these schools, children spend a lot of time on music activities like lessons, playing in groups, singing, and learning music theory. They also practice a lot in special rooms. The rest of their time is for regular school subjects like English, math, and science. 

These music schools are private, and classes are small. Most children live at the school, which means they spend a lot of time with other children who also love music. 

There are some problems with these schools. First, they are expensive, costing between £12,000 and £17,000 a year. But schools try to help parents with scholarships. Second, not all parents want their young children to live away from home. Some school directors think it might not be good for very young children to be in such a strict environment. They want to make sure children grow up to be well-rounded people. 

Being in a music school can be stressful. Some children might lose interest in music as they grow older. The pressure to be the best can make them feel like they have failed. But schools watch each child's progress and offer help if needed. 

Many students from music schools say they learned a lot, but some wish they had more regular school subjects. Many musically talented children are also smart and want to learn more than just music. 

For these reasons, it might be better to wait until a child is older and can decide for themselves if they want to go to a music school. Children who are good at both music and school subjects might do well in a regular school with a good music program. They can also take music lessons on weekends at music colleges, but this is only possible if they live near a big city."
FCE_25,"Artist Susan Shepherd is famous for her flower paintings. Her big garden around her house gives her many flowers to paint. She loves tulips and poppies the most. Some plants grow wildly all over the garden. The garden has beautiful colors and shapes, thanks to the people who owned it before. They were good gardeners and left plants that Susan likes. She also got a gardener named Danny from them. Susan says, ""It was really his garden."" They worked well together. At first, Danny didn't like some of her ideas, but when she said she wanted to paint them, he understood.

Susan likes to paint one plant at a time, not the whole garden. Sometimes she paints a group of plants, but usually, she picks them and takes them to her studio. She paints one flower at a time, which can take a few days. Then she adds another flower to the painting. Sometimes, it takes years to finish a painting. Spring and early summer are her busiest times because the tulips and poppies bloom then. She says, ""They all come out together, and you're so busy."" She also likes to watch how flowers change over time. For example, tulips change shape when you put them in water.

Susan has always liked plants. She studied botany in school and collected wildflowers. She didn't like garden flowers before because they looked fake to her. She liked wildflowers because they grew in hard places like rocks. Now, her garden has plants from faraway places like China and the Himalayas. They grow well in her garden. Susan lets her garden grow freely, like an aunt who lets children play as long as they don't break anything. She is busy with two art shows and doesn't have much time for gardening. She hired another gardener, but she knows she needs to work in the garden to stay connected to her art. ""You have to get your hands dirty,"" she says."
FCE_34,"**Keeping the Holiday-Makers Happy**

Sarah Sutherland-Pilch is a 24-year-old from West Sussex. She works as a chalet girl in Val d'Isère, France. This is her second year doing this job. Sarah cooks and cleans for people who come to ski and stay in chalets, which are wooden houses. She graduated in French and History of Art from Oxford Brookes University last summer. Sarah says being a chalet girl is not a career, but it is a fun way to spend a year or two before starting a more serious job. She meets many successful people every week.

Sarah does not live in the chalet. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks to the chalet, which can have up to 18 guests each week. She eats her breakfast first, then prepares breakfast for the guests. They have porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants. After breakfast, Sarah cleans up and either makes afternoon tea or cleans the rooms. She says cleaning the rooms is the worst part of the job. By 11 a.m., she is ready to go skiing. She skis as much as she can. On a good day, she can ski until 4:30 p.m.

Sarah returns to the chalet to prepare dinner. She takes a shower before cooking but does not sleep because it makes her too tired. Dinner is a three-course meal served at 8 p.m., and coffee is ready by 10 p.m. After dinner, Sarah cleans up and fills the dishwasher. Sometimes she talks with the guests, and other times they prefer to be alone. Good guests can make the week fun, but some weeks are not as good.

Sarah meets her friends at the chalet where she lives, and they go out at about 11 p.m. They visit places like Bananas, G Jay's, and Dick's T-Bar. Sarah does not stay out too late on Saturday night because Sunday is her busiest day. She starts work earlier on Sunday because breakfast must be ready by 7 a.m. After the guests leave, Sarah cleans the chalet quickly. She clears breakfast, strips the beds, and gets everything ready. If she did not shop on Saturday, she does it now. At 3 p.m., she prepares tea for the new guests, who arrive around 4:30 p.m. Sometimes they are confused and have many questions. Between tea and dinner, Sarah helps guests with ski equipment. Then she prepares dinner again. Sometimes she chats with friends, but if she is very tired, she goes to bed early."

Mandie Currie is a zoo-keeper. She spent a day at the magazine Marie Claire. ""Choosing clothes for Marie Claire was hard because I usually wear a uniform. First, I went to a photo studio, then to press previews, all before lunch. The zoo is calm and quiet, but here I was busy. Some fashion team members seemed stressed. My job is not stressful. At a fashion shoot in the afternoon, I laughed because I usually clean cages or handle rats. I like seeing how magazines work, but I love my job at the zoo, so I will stay there.""

Alice Cutler is a fashion assistant at Marie Claire. She spent a day at London Zoo. ""I arrived at the zoo in leather boots and dark blue trousers. The zoo gave me a green polo shirt to work in, which was good because I got very dirty. I stroked an elephant and thought Mandie was probably packing clothes. By five o'clock, I smelled bad, but I had a great day. When I stop working in fashion, I might work with elephants, maybe in Africa.""

Karen Hodson is a nurse at Hammersmith Hospital. She went with the TV gardening show Ground Force. ""I was very excited to meet the team, and Alan Titchmarsh, the presenter, was nice. I liked being in the fresh air. Sometimes, I don't see daylight because of my shifts. It was hard work but fun. I thought I was strong, but I felt weak compared to the team. I didn't know gardening was so much work. I am more enthusiastic than good at gardening, so I will keep my job as a nurse.""

Charlie Dimmock is a landscape gardener with Ground Force. She worked at Hammersmith Hospital. ""I made beds and gave out tablets. I thought I would faint, but I was okay. The nurses are very friendly, and it felt very 'girlie' compared to my usual work with men. I feel my job is not as important as nursing. My day at the hospital was not fun, but it was satisfying.""

Lucy Harvey is a personal trainer. She spent a day with Ryanair as cabin crew. ""I changed into the uniform, and I felt different. People respected me. Before the flight, our supervisor talked about safety and what to do if someone had a heart attack, which I knew from my training. On the flight to Paris, I gave out magazines. Everyone looked at me, and I felt shy. On the way back, we had 80 schoolchildren who wouldn't sit still. I wished I was back in the gym with one adult.""

Sonia McDermott is an air hostess with Ryanair. She spent a day as a personal trainer in a gym. ""I was worried about this swap because I don't exercise. I was surprised at how much attention you give to one person. In my job, I meet 130 passengers four times a day. I was surprised at lunch to see some trainers don't eat very healthily, but they drink lots of water. I wouldn't swap my job for this. But it has inspired me to join a gym and be healthier."""
FCE_26,"Text: 'On the Train: Five Celebrities Share Their Favorite Train Memories. A Andrea Thompson - Newsreader I love the south of France and visit often. There is a train from Cannes that goes along the coast and into Italy. The views of the sea are amazing. It doesn't matter if it is sunny or rainy, it is always beautiful. You can also see some of the nicest gardens and houses in France. It feels like you are looking into the homes of rich and famous people. The people on the train are always interesting, with a mix of tourists and locals. Raj Patel - Explorer I have enjoyed many train trips, but my favorite is the Nile Valley Express in Sudan. When I was young in South Africa, I missed a family train trip to the Kruger National Park because I was too young. When I moved to England, I had never been on a train. London Waterloo was the first big station I saw, and it amazed me. Betty Cooper - Novelist I love the Blue Train because it took my husband and me on our honeymoon across France to catch a boat to Egypt. On the train, my husband gave me a pink dress, which I loved. Someone said pink is good for the brain, and I have worn it ever since. The journey through France and then by boat up the Nile was the perfect way to relax after our wedding. Martin Brown - Journalist We were working on a series of articles and had to cross a desert in Africa. There was no road, so we took the Desert Express train. The schedule was not reliable, and the driver would wait for people. When the train came, many people climbed on, even on the roof for free. At night, the train went through beautiful landscapes. It felt like a dream. Arisu Mezuki - Actress Most people love trains from when they are children, but not me. I grew up in Singapore and Cyprus, where I saw few trains. As a teenager, I made a film in Yorkshire with a railway. The old train line was kept by volunteers. That's when I started to love steam trains. When we were not filming, we rode the train. When I went back last year, everything was the same, even the gas lights on the station!'"
FCE_8,"Text: 'Do you want to get your story published? Our expert, Margaret Stubbs, can help you. Many people ask, 'I have written a story or book. Who should I send it to?' First, you need to learn about publishers and practice your writing. Selling your writing needs knowledge about the 'writing world'. No matter what you write, you need to know about the markets you want to reach. The best way to do this is by reading a lot. Visit your local library, bookshops, and newsagents. Reading will show you what publishers are looking for. Remember, things change over time. New magazines come out, editors change jobs, and magazines change their style. Publishers always want new writers, so we must give them what they want. If you want to write short love stories, first find out which magazines publish them. Get recent copies and see what kind of stories they like. Pay attention to who the readers are. Writers often ask me, 'My story was rejected three times. Am I wasting my time?' As a former teacher, I never want to discourage anyone. But maybe the work is not ready to be published. Most new writers send their work too soon. If you have only written one story, it is not likely to be published. Success usually comes after years in publishing or journalism. When you send your work, keep writing more stories. Write ten or twenty more. Each one will be better, and you will feel more like a writer. Don't throw any stories away—improve them. I also suggest not showing your work to others at first. Remember, every successful writer has faced rejection. Do everything you can to become a writer. Look for a creative writing course or join a local writers' group. This will help you get ideas and confidence. Think of yourself as a writer and practice writing every day if you can.'"
FCE_4,"Text: 'No Title On the last day of a bad year, I was leaning against a pillar in the Baltimore train station. I was waiting for the 10.10 train to Philadelphia. There were more people than I thought there would be. The station didn't feel as nice and clean as usual. Older couples with matching bags sat on the benches, and many college students sat on the floor with their bags. A man with grey hair was talking to different people. He looked rich: tanned skin, nice sweater, and a soft, beige coat. He asked a woman sitting alone a question. Then he came to a girl standing near me. She had long blond hair, and I thought I might like to talk to her. The man asked, 'Are you going to Philadelphia?' 'Well, I'm going north,' she said. 'But to Philadelphia?' 'No, New York, but I'll be ...' 'Thanks, anyway,' he said, and moved to the next bench. Now I was interested. 'Ma'am,' he asked an old lady, 'are you going to Philadelphia?' When she said, 'Wilmington,' he didn't say anything, just moved on to a couple with matching bags. I stood up straight and moved closer, looking at the platform like I was thinking about the train. I was going to Philadelphia. He could have asked me. I knew why he didn't. I probably looked unreliable. He just looked at me quickly and then went to the bench at the other end. He looked very stressed. 'Please!' he said to a woman reading a book. 'Tell me you're going to Philadelphia!' She put her book down. She was about thirty-five, older than me. She looked like a teacher. 'Philadelphia?' she said. 'Yes, I am.' 'Could I ask you a favour?' I stopped a few feet away and looked at my left wrist. (I don't have a watch.) Even without looking, I could tell she was careful. The man must have noticed too, because he said, 'Nothing too hard, I promise!' They were announcing my train now. People started moving to Gate E, the older couples pulling their bags like big pets. Then I heard the man talking. 'My daughter is flying out this afternoon for a study year abroad, leaving from Philadelphia. I put her on a train this morning, stopped for groceries, and came home to find my wife upset. She hardly said ""hello"" to me. My daughter forgot her passport. She called home from the station in Philadelphia; she didn't know what to do.' The woman made a sympathetic sound. I would have stayed quiet. Waited to see what he wanted. 'So I told her to stay there. Stay in the station, I said, and I would get someone here to take her passport.' A likely story! Why didn't he go himself if it was so important? 'Why don't you go yourself?' the woman asked. 'I can't leave my wife alone for that long. She's in a wheelchair.' This seemed like a bad excuse, if you ask me. Also, it was too much bad luck for one family. I looked at them. The man was holding a packet, not a plain envelope, which would have made more sense, but a padded envelope the size of a small book. Aha! Padded! So you couldn't feel what was inside! And from where I stood, it looked stapled shut too. Be careful, lady, I thought.'"

My son, Gary, got his chance with cooking, and my chance was to run a restaurant. When I heard about the opportunity, I quickly went to see the place. It was in very bad condition, but it was perfect for me. Starting this business reminded me of my childhood. I remember my mother going to work in a factory, and I was upset because I was alone. So, I thought, 'We need time for family.' My wife took care of the children and did my accounts, while I ran the business. We lived above the restaurant, and we always made sure to have meals together. This was good for our children, Gary and Joe. They are both very confident. From a young age, they would come and talk to our regular customers. This gave them a great start in life. Gary was a lively child. When he was about seven, he jumped into a bath like it was a swimming pool and hurt himself. When he was older, he worked for pocket money. He started with small jobs and by ten, he was in the kitchen every weekend, so he always had money at school. He was disciplined. He used to wake up even before me. In a family business, it's for the family, and it was nice to see him helping. Gary wasn't very good at school, but he was great in the kitchen. By 15, he was as good as the men working there, and sometimes he was in charge. He made over a hundred meals, and I knew he would go into catering because he was talented. When he needed work experience for school, I sent him to a friend's restaurant. Gary recently started playing the drums and now has his own band. I wonder what will happen to his cooking if the music becomes successful. My advice to Gary is: if you try to do two things at once, you might not succeed in either, so focus on what you know you can do. I told him: 'Gary, if you want to succeed, do it by 30. After that, it might be too late.' Gary went to catering college at 17. On his first day, he and the other new students were given a morning's work. But in an hour, Gary finished everything. That's my son! In the end, he helped others. We can't believe how successful Gary's TV cooking show is. I'm very proud of him. I've always told him that if you want something, you have to work hard for it. He's seen his chance and taken it. You talk to your children as they grow up, and if they remember even a little of what you say, you should be happy. The things Gary says and does make me think he listened sometimes.'"

But if you were new in Dublin, like Jo, you had no personal contacts. Jo had to stay in a hostel and search for a flat. Dublin was a big unknown place for her. She didn't question why she was going there. Everyone from her school thought they should leave their small town and see more of the world. Some of her classmates went to towns like Ennis or Limerick, but Jo was the only one going to Dublin. She was going alone.

Jo's mother thought it would be good if she stayed in the hostel run by nuns, where she would be safe. Her father hoped the hostel was warm because hostels were often cold. Jo's sisters, who worked as waitresses, thought she was crazy to stay in a hostel for a week. Jo didn't know her family was still thinking about her as she answered an ad for a flat in Ringsend. The ad said, ""Own room, own television, share kitchen, bathroom."" It was close to the post office where she worked and seemed perfect. She hoped it was nice, that they would like her, and that it wasn't too expensive.

There wasn't a long line for this flat because it was more like ""Third Girl Wanted"" than ""Flat to Let."" The ""own television"" part made Jo wonder if it was too fancy for her, but the house looked normal. It was a red-brick terraced house with a basement, but the flat was upstairs. A cheerful girl with a college scarf, who didn't get the flat, was coming down the stairs. ""Desperate place,"" she said to Jo. ""They're both awful.""

""Hello,"" said a girl with ""Nessa"" on her T-shirt. ""Did you see that snobby girl leaving? I can't stand her type.""

""What did she do?"" asked Jo.

""She didn't do anything. She just looked around, made a face, and said, 'Is this all there is? Oh dear,' in a fancy voice. We wouldn't have her here, would we, Pauline?""

Pauline wore a very colorful shirt and had bright hair. Jo was amazed because she had never talked to a punk before. ""I'm Jo, I work in the post office, and I called about the flat.""

Nessa said they were about to have tea. She brought out three mugs; one said ""Nessa,"" one said ""Pauline,"" and the other said ""Other."" ""We'll put your name on it if you stay,"" she said kindly."
FCE_43,"People love dolphins. We like to see them in marinas, movies, and TV shows. But the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society says dolphins are in trouble. Mark Simmonds talks about how dolphins are disappearing. Dolphins are special to us. They are very smart, understand human feelings, and make us dream of freedom in the sea. TV shows like Flipper and Seaquest make us love them more. But these shows do not show the real problems dolphins face in dirty and overfished seas.

The number of North Sea harbour porpoises, a type of dolphin, has gone down by up to 89,000. You might think dolphins are protected by law, but they are not. This could become a big problem for wildlife. There are 40 kinds of dolphins in the world. In northern Europe, the most common are striped, common, bottlenose dolphins, and harbour porpoises. The first two live far out in the sea and are seen only in small groups. We do not know much about them. Bottlenose dolphins and harbour porpoises used to be common near European coasts. Bottlenose dolphins are very social and were found on the Channel coast and in British rivers like the Thames. Now, they are only in Moray Firth in Scotland and Cardigan Bay in Wales. The few left have skin injuries, showing they are stressed.

It is hard to know why dolphin numbers are going down. Overfishing is a big problem. It reduces fish stocks and threatens dolphins. Dolphins need to find food quickly. If fish are gone, they may not survive. They can also get caught in fishing nets, which they cannot see. Many dead dolphins have been found on beaches in France and Cornwall. Marks on their bodies show they died from getting caught in nets.

Pollution is another problem. Waste in the sea can build up in dolphins' bodies. Pesticides, which dissolve in fat, can be passed from mother dolphins to their babies through milk. There is a case where a baby dolphin died from its mother's milk.

Noise pollution is also a threat. Dolphins live in groups and use sound to understand their world. Noise from ships and oil wells can disturb them. This noise travels better in water than in air and may affect dolphins in ways we do not know yet."
FCE_51,"**GETTING FIT**

Exercise is very important for your mind, body, and spirit. It helps you stay balanced when life feels busy and stressful. You might think, ""Oh no, another article about exercise!"" But there are many good reasons to exercise. Exercise is really good for you.

Exercise makes your muscles stronger and changes your body shape quickly. It helps you stand or sit correctly, which is called good posture. Good posture is important because it stops muscle problems that can cause injuries. Exercise also helps your heart, lungs, and blood move better.

Exercise can make you feel less sad and tired. It helps you sleep better and manage stress. Exercise can even help with some health problems. 

There are many types of exercise you can try, like aerobics, jogging, or lifting weights. But be careful not to train too hard or lift too much weight, as this can cause injuries. Start slowly and carefully. If you are unsure, ask your doctor what is good for you.

Good posture is important for how you look and feel. If you slouch, imagine a balloon pulling your head up to the sky. This helps you stand tall and breathe better. It also makes your body look slimmer.

Stretching your muscles makes you more flexible and helps prevent injuries. Stretching should be part of your exercise routine. Do it slowly and carefully, four or five times a week, for a more flexible and fit body.

The best exercise routine includes a good warm-up, stretching, an energetic workout, and a cool-down period."

Why do film-makers Amanda Barrett and Owen Newman leave their home for many months? They want to find the perfect shot. In the jungles and plains of East Africa, it is hard to find producer Amanda Barrett and cameraman Owen Newman. They are now in the Ngorongoro Crater, where it has rained for six months. This rain causes problems. Newman said they bought an expensive tool to help when their car gets stuck in the mud. Amanda can then pull him out. Together, they have made some of TV's best wildlife films, like their famous film on leopards. Even when this film was on TV, they were back in Africa, this time looking for the shy jackal. 

This is normal for TV partnerships. Film-makers travel the world to film wildlife since TV began. I talked to Newman at a safari lodge. He said, 'We sometimes argue, but we get over it quickly.' They do not see one as the leader. They get along well because they see animals the same way. 'When we travel, we set up our tents each night. But now, we have a fixed camp. We leave at 5 a.m. each morning, so we make tea the night before and keep it warm in a flask.' They eat pre-packed meals, heated by whoever is free. 'We can be away for up to eight weeks, so food can be a problem,' says Newman. It is a tough life, but being alone in remote areas lets them get close to animals. Newman remembers filming lions. One lioness would greet their car like it was part of her pride.

Newman first worked with Barrett in 1988 on a film called 'The Great Rift'. Two years later, they filmed Arctic foxes together. They spend four months in one place to get enough material for a half-hour film. Before filming, they must submit a script for approval. 'Amanda and I worked well together from the start,' says Newman. 'We share the same ideas. We want to make films that show the true spirit of the place and animals and touch people's hearts. If you can make people feel something, it is better than just making them think.'"

These are her fourth World Championships, and they will be the biggest ever, with 27 countries playing. 'We'll have support from people at home, which is special,' she says. 'It's important to make netball more popular here. Because we are playing at home, there will be more pressure. People will expect us to start with a good game.'

Their first game is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. 'We have always beaten them, but they are exciting to play. They have lots of skill.' The England team is ranked fourth in the world. But, as Kendra says, the World Championships will be hard. 'You have to play every day, with no rest. In a series, you can lose the first game and still win. But in the Championships, you have only one chance.'

In the fifteen years she has played at the top level, the sport has become harder and faster. On the court, players are more aggressive. 'You don't train so much not to win,' says Kendra. 'But after the game, we are all friendlier.' Netball is also more scientific now with fitness testing. 'We must think and train like world-class players,' says Kendra. 'As captain, I need a strong mind and to lead by example. I support and encourage my team.'

'From the start, my netball career was carefully planned,' she says. 'I decided this competition would be my last as a player.' She will probably coach young players in the future, but now she is focused on her last big event. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she might have a tear in her eye. Her loyal supporters will be with her every step."
FCE_63,"Text: 'In hot water Rachel Mills is a scientist who works at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. Rachel Mills teaches and studies marine geochemistry, which means she looks at the chemical processes in the sea. She is a teacher at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she isn't teaching, she goes into a steel vehicle, like a small car, and dives three kilometres down into the Atlantic Ocean to study underwater volcanoes. 'Inside,' she says, 'space is very small, and I can touch the two pilots. We can't stand up or move, and we must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can last for 16 hours - three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours collecting rock and water samples, and then three hours to go back up to the surface.' 'If there is a problem and we need to go up quickly, we can press a panic button. The outside part drops away, and a small escape vessel goes up fast, like a ping-pong ball in water. No-one has tested it yet, but I think it would not be a nice trip.' 'I didn't know how I would feel the first time I got into the vehicle. It was on a ship, and I got in with an instructor. He showed me what to do in an emergency, like if the pilot had a heart attack! They wanted to see how I would react in a small space.' Now Rachel has made six dives. Last year she dived with a Russian team. 'We went to a place five days' sail west of the Canary Islands in the Atlantic. Here, on the ocean floor, there are many underwater volcanoes, with chimneys blowing out black smoke. It is where the Atlantic Ocean is very active. The Russian team was putting some scientific equipment there to study the effect of a big project that would make a hole 150 metres through a volcano.' When she isn't at sea, Rachel is in her office at the Oceanography Centre, Southampton. 'Two-thirds of my salary comes from teaching, which I love, but I do it so I can continue my research into the ""black smokers"". This is another name for underwater volcanoes - water comes out of the rock and looks like black smoke. It comes out at one metre per second and at a temperature of 350 degrees.' 'The only time I was scared was when I first went down with the Americans. We were pulling equipment on a 50-metre rope when suddenly there was an explosion. There was a big bang, and I thought, ""I'm going to die."" We looked at each other in silence, waiting. When nothing happened, we couldn't believe it. We were so relieved - we were still alive!' 'It's such an adventure diving to the deepest part of the ocean. Every time I look out of the window and see those chimneys, I feel wonder. Here I am at the bottom of the sea, and no-one else on this planet has ever seen them before. I studied the black smokers for three years for my Ph.D. When I got down there and saw them for real, it was an amazing feeling.'"
FCE_56,"**Interview Tips**

First impressions are very important. People decide what they think about us in the first few minutes. They look at how we dress, our eye contact, our body movement, how fast or slow we talk, and our voice. Mary Pearce studied to be a teacher. She says, 'I worked hard to get my degree. When I graduated, I was very confident.' She applied for a job at a primary school and got an interview with the Head Teacher. 'I saw a small hole in my jacket that morning,' she remembers. 'I wanted to change, but I knew it would make me late, and I think it's important to be on time.' Mary didn't get the job. Her friend, who also teaches at the school, told her the Head Teacher said, 'If someone doesn't try to look their best at an interview, what kind of teacher will they be?' 

Simon Grant, a hotel manager, says: 'People who look like they care about themselves are more likely to care about their jobs. People think it's what's inside that counts, but in an interview, you should try to look your best.' Many people forget how important it is to look professional. For example, Janet Goodwood worked for ten years as an assistant in a big accounting firm. When the office manager retired, she applied for the job but didn't get an interview. 'I thought it was a mistake, so I asked the Director of Personnel what happened,' she says. 'He told me I didn't look like an office manager. He suggested I improve my clothes before I apply again. I was shocked. I do a very good job, and the way I dress shouldn't matter.'

Movement and gestures also affect an interviewer's first impression. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian found that 7% of our message comes from words, 38% from voice, and 55% from facial expressions. If our facial expressions and words are different, the listener will believe the facial expressions. So make sure your words and body language match. Mixed messages will confuse the interviewer. It is also important not to look too desperate for the job or too eager to please. When Sheila Rice, a marketing specialist, applied for a promotion, her interview went so well she got the job right away. 'I was happy,' she remembers. 'But I showed too much excitement. When the boss saw how excited I was, he knew I wouldn't say no. So, he offered me a lower salary than I wanted. I'm sure I could have got more if I controlled my excitement.'

Finally, what we say and how we say it is important for a successful interview. David Artesio, a manager of an employment agency, suggests learning about the company before the interview. 'The annual report, for example, will tell you about the company. Mention something that interests you during the interview. This will show your interest in the company.' Business consultant Marian Woodall suggests having a few questions ready and avoiding long, confused sentences. She says, 'Poor communicators talk in paragraphs. Successful communicators talk in short sentences and clear points.'"

**The Farmer**

Matt Froggatt used to work as an insurance agent in London. Now, he has a sheep farm. He worked in the city for 14 years, but it became boring. He lost his job suddenly and used the money he got to start the farm. He met a chef from a famous hotel, and now he sells meat to them and by mail. He is happy not to be in an office, but he still works long hours.

**The Painter**

Ron Ablewhite was a manager in advertising. Now, he is an artist. Painting was his hobby, and he enjoyed it more than his job. He decided to leave his job and become an artist. A career counsellor helped him. Ron and his family moved to the north of England. They left their friends, but many friends visit them now.

**The Hat Maker**

Katherine Goodison was a lawyer. She started her own business making hats in her London flat. She liked her job as a lawyer, but the hours were too long. She did not want to work more, so she left. People thought she would get bored, but she is always busy. She likes being responsible for her work. She misses talking to colleagues but feels happier and less stressed now.

**The Masseur**

Paul Drinkwater worked in finance for 16 years. Now, he is a masseur at the Life Centre in London. He liked the excitement of finance but not the work. He almost lost his job in 1989, so he quit and traveled for a year. He wanted to work in health, so he learned about massage. He got a part-time job at the Life Centre. He feels in control and happy with his new job."
FCE_6,"**Dedicated to Their Sports: Four Young Sports Stars Talk About Their Lives**

**A. Darius (Runner)**  
I have always loved sports. I tried many, but I was best at football and running. When I was 14, I had a chance to join a professional football club, but I chose running instead. My best moment was when I ran for my country and won a medal. Sadly, it didn't get much media attention, and I hoped for some sponsorship because training is expensive. I train at home in winter and then go to Florida for three weeks before the season starts. It's fun there, with great places to train and good nightlife. But I must be disciplined. If friends ask me to go out before training, I have to say no. I want to go to the next Olympics - that would be amazing.

**B. Gabriel (Surfer)**  
The surfing community is small, so you meet the same people at competitions. Serious surfers know the best waves are early in the morning, so you can't party late at night. I don't mind that, but I miss sleeping in. It's worth it because I won the National Championships last year. After a win, I celebrate with a big night out, and if I win money, I go somewhere nice. Winning the championship helped me get a job on a TV surfing show. I guess I'm a bit famous now.

**C. Dieter (Yacht Racer)**  
With five guys on a boat, we have a lot of fun. We celebrate wins in style, but we don't look for media attention. Reporters sometimes care more about our celebrations than our race results. I'm away for eight months a year, so it's nice to come home and hang out with friends. You can't think about the sport all the time - it's not healthy. I'm known in sailing, but I'm rarely recognized on the street. I don't want to be a celebrity. I get letters asking for signed pictures, and I reply to all of them, even if it takes time.

**D. Tomas (Tennis Player)**  
It's great to feel the crowd's support when I play. At the last tournament, it got a bit crazy with fans. I like being recognized by fans when I'm out, but it can be hard. My last girlfriend didn't like it when I got attention from female fans. Tennis players travel a lot, and that's why we broke up. It was tough, but you have to be serious in any sport. I'm okay with focusing on my game now and enjoying other things after I retire, which happens early in tennis."
FCE_33,"Text: 'Shopping with Children Shopping with children can be very difficult for parents. One mother says, 'They want everything they see. If it's not the latest sweet breakfast cereal, it's a Disney video or a comic. Usually all three. I can't buy all this stuff, and I feel bad about buying unhealthy things. But I also feel bad for saying no all the time, and I get upset before we even leave home. I try not to take them shopping, but then I worry they won't learn how to make choices. I can't win.' Research shows that children ask to buy something every two minutes in a supermarket. More than £150 million a year is spent on advertising to children, mostly on TV. This number will probably grow, and supermarkets are where this advertising works best. Children often don't understand why parents say no to buying things. They don't believe that sugar is bad for their teeth when they see fun and exciting ads. Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says, 'Most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, but these ideas are not always right. It's good for parents and children to talk about food because if children only learn from TV ads, they get a one-sided view. Parents don't like competing with ads and having to say no to their children.' The Independent Television Commission, which controls TV ads, does not allow advertisers to tell children to ask their parents to buy things. But, as Dibb says, 'The goal of advertising is to make people want to buy something. So even if they can't say, ""Tell your mum to buy this,"" they still want that to happen.' Some parents find it stressful to decide which things to buy and which to refuse. One mother says she talks a lot with her children about food, and now they don't ask for things she doesn't want to buy. Parents also say they are not always fair when they say no. Mike, a father of two, says, 'We say no to sweets because they are bad for him, but we buy cream and chocolate for ourselves. It's fun to buy nice things, and it's normal for children to want them too. But I still get annoyed by their demands. It depends on how I feel. If I'm happy, I'm more likely to say yes. It's hard to be fair all the time.' Supermarkets could help by not putting sweets near the checkout or by having play areas for children. Parents might spend less if their children are not with them, but shopping without a child's demands might bring more customers.'"
FCE_20,"**Five-star luxury with modern technology**

The five-star Merrion Hotel has just opened in Dublin. It took almost two years to change four big old houses into this hotel. The hotel has the latest technology for both staff and guests. The General Manager, Peter MacCann, wants his staff to know guests by name. For other details, he uses the hotel's computer system. This system helps treat returning guests in a special way. It cost £250,000 to install, but MacCann believes it will be worth it. For example, if a guest asks for certain music CDs during their first stay, they will find those CDs ready on their next visit. 

Guests often complain about room temperature. The hotel has a special system to control this. Guests can change the temperature a little themselves, or the front desk can adjust it more. Business guests will like the technology in their rooms. MacCann thinks 65% of the hotel's business will come from them. Each room has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine, and a video-conferencing facility. The hotel has extra cables for future technology changes. TVs are rented, so they can be updated easily. DVD recorders can also be upgraded.

Even with all this technology, the rooms are comfortable and welcoming. The hotel has 145 large bedrooms, a swimming pool, gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a beautiful garden. The food must be excellent. Chef Patrick Guilbaud, who has two Michelin stars, moved his restaurant to the Merrion. This is good for both him and the hotel. He has a new kitchen and better parking. The hotel offers a popular place to eat without financial risks. With technology and a great staff, the Merrion is likely to succeed."
FCE_40,"Text: 'Where I get my energy Emma Marsden asked six women who live life fully to tell us how they do it. A. Jeanette Kupfermann Journalist and author: 'I think it's excitement. I need to do something challenging. If I'm learning something new, I get a lot of energy. Anything with rhythm gives me energy, too - right now I'm learning flamenco dancing. Dance is wonderful and gives energy. I think you can feel tired if you're bored. Doing something useful, even if it's small, gives you energy.' B. Linda Kelsey Magazine editor: 'I have a lot of work but I enjoy it - I love being at work, it isn't hard for me. If you enjoy something, it doesn't make you feel bad even if you're tired. I need a lot of sleep, so when I get it, I feel good. When I sleep only six hours a night, I feel tired. I know exercise gives me energy, but it's hard to start! I do a yoga class once a week before work and try to do a workout at home. But if I've done exercise, I feel much better. I feel tired in the office between 3 and 5 in the afternoon and think it's good to eat something then.' C. Annie Nightingale Disc jockey: 'I don't eat healthily to get my energy - I think it's natural enthusiasm and being positive. I don't like people with negative attitudes. I think we should all enjoy our lives. Enjoyment comes first. You have to achieve things and set goals. I enjoy what I do and the last two years have been very exciting. In my job, there are lots of lively young people and you can't help feeling that energy. I love being busy with work. I'm very sociable. I enjoy taking photos but I'm not sure if I'm good at it. I rush to get them developed and can't wait to see them. I've also started writing words for imaginary songs - it's just for fun and helps my mind when I travel a lot.' D. Floella Benjamin Author and children's TV presenter: 'My energy comes from things I do and enjoy. I believe in what I'm doing, both at work and at home with my family. Being positive about life helps. That's why I love working with kids, they give so much and are strong. Energy is like a natural chemical, it starts when you talk to others - just try smiling at people and feel happy when they smile back. It's better than feeling sorry for yourself. I try to eat healthily and don't smoke or drink, but I don't have an exercise plan. The most energetic I get is running around with the kids and playing with them.' E. Deborah Moggach Author and playwright: 'What I love doing most is making a garden out of a wasteland. I did that once. The garden was all concrete - I broke all the concrete and put in a lot of soil. It was better than any workout or tennis. The other thing that gives me energy is knowing that someone wants to read what I'm writing - I find it hard to write if no one is interested. I also like going into a farmer's land or a wood. If I'm found, I say ""Oh, what a wonderful wood, I didn't know it was private,"" and so on. I like it because it's childlike.' F. Katherine Monblot Therapist: 'I believe you must have an interest in and respect for what you do in life. I like to take risks and I get bored quickly, which keeps me motivated. Doing things you don't want to do makes you tired. I used to be a member of different committees and didn't like the time they took. You only have a certain amount of energy, so use it for the things that are most important to you.' '"
FCE_45,"**ICE SKATING**

Ice skating has been around for thousands of years. People have found old skates made from animal bones. These bone skates were used until about 200 AD when iron skates came to Scandinavia. In Scandinavia, rich people thought skating was an important skill. In the early 1900s, skating was calm and stylish. But in the 1924 Winter Olympics, 11-year-old Sonja Henie made skating more athletic and popular. Today, skating is both beautiful and physically hard.

For beginners, balance and control are very important. You can go faster only when you get better. Your body position helps with balance. Keep your legs slightly bent and knees bent to stay balanced. Relaxation is very important in skating. To start, your heels should almost touch, and your feet should point outwards. Push forward with your back foot and make a small movement with the other foot. It seems easy, right? As you practice, you can make bigger movements.

Learning how to fall is one of the first skills. Even the best skaters fall. To fall safely, try to stay relaxed. This helps reduce the shock when you hit the ice. To get up, use your hands to kneel, then stand.

Once you can skate confidently, you can try different styles like figure skating, freestyle, distance, speed, and pair skating. But first, learn figure skating and basic freestyle. Most ice rinks have teachers to help you learn. You can soon learn basic moves and then turns, jumps, and spins.

Good skaters look relaxed and move easily. To be like them, practice exercises regularly. It is dangerous to skate with a stiff body. Warm-up exercises should include legs, back, shoulders, ankles, and knees. After skating, do the same exercises to avoid stiffness.

Skating helps improve balance, coordination, relaxation, and movement. It is good for the heart and lungs and makes the body stronger. When combined with swimming or jogging, it is a great way to stay healthy and fit."

FCE_29,"Text: 'We are all getting taller Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his teacher he wanted to join the navy. The teacher joked, 'Do you want to be the flagpole on a ship?' because Chris was already almost two meters tall. Today, at 228 cm, he is the tallest man in Britain. Every ten years, people in Europe grow about one centimeter taller. More tall people are born every year. This does not mean we are becoming a new super race. We are going back to how we were as cavemen. We are losing the effects of bad diets from the past. 'We are becoming like Cro-Magnons again,' says Professor Chris Stringer. Cro-Magnons lived 40,000 years ago. In the past, people got food from many places: women gathered herbs, fruits, and berries, and men hunted animals. One study found they ate 85 different wild plants. About 9,000 years ago, farming started, which changed everything. Farmers took over green areas, and now three plants - wheat, rice, and maize - give us more than half of our calories. This poor diet made people unhealthy. Over time, we ate soups, porridges, and breads that left us underfed. In Ohio, scientists found that when people started growing corn, healthy hunter-gatherers became sick farmers. Tooth decay and diseases increased. Corn was not a blessing but a health problem. Farming spread because it could support more people than hunting and gathering. But people were poorly nourished. Only recently have richer countries improved their diets. Now, the average man in the US is 179 cm, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm. This is good, but there are problems. Beds are still 190 cm long, and leg-room in planes and trains is small. Clothes makers have to change their products. We cannot grow forever. There must be a limit. Robert Fogel from University says it could be 193 cm, and we might reach it this century. But scientists say we are actually shrinking as a species. During the last ice age, 10,000 years ago, people were rounder and taller to keep warm. As the climate got warmer, we became thinner and smaller. If the planet keeps getting hotter, we might shrink more. So, global warming could make us smaller.'"
FCE_57,"Text: 'Studio Audiences What is it like to be in the audience when a TV show is made? Cosmo Landesman found out. Studio audiences are a common part of TV, but many people don't know much about them. When we see them excited on game shows, we wonder - who are these people? Some people think studio audiences are not very important. I heard that even TV workers don't respect them much. I thought studio audiences were just people who wanted to be on TV for a short time. But there is no typical studio audience. They come from all kinds of backgrounds. TV shows try to get different people for different shows. Some people like to watch TV at home and don't understand why others go to a studio. Why would someone get tickets, travel far, and sit for hours in a studio to watch something they can see at home? One idea is that people want to be on TV for a moment. I didn't believe this until I talked to Angela. Why did she come? She wanted a chance to be on TV. Another idea is that people are curious to see behind the scenes. But the most common reason I heard was 'a friend gave me a ticket'. Not many of us have been in a studio audience, but we think we know what it's like. You sit with strangers, and someone shows cards that say APPLAUD or LAUGH - and you clap or laugh. This might be true for some shows, but not all. A studio manager said, 'We hope a show is good enough not to need these signs.' Is there a difference between being in a studio and watching TV at home? For Claire, sitting in a studio is 'more exciting', and Charlotte liked being part of live TV. 'Last year I saw my favorite comedian. At home, you miss a lot.' I missed seeing live actors - I could only see the back of someone's head. The first scenes were so far away that I watched on a studio screen. Going to a studio might not be the best way to watch TV, but that's not the point. For most people, it was just fun and a free night out.'"

Bruce
I don't like places that are wild and empty. I like places with people. It's the same when I travel. I like pretty villages with old temples, not empty deserts. When I was eight, I went to school in England. On Saturdays, I would ride my bike to the village of Lastingham. It was in a nice valley. Riding my bike was a break from school. I loved exploring the hills, valleys, and old villages. I am from Scotland, so the landscape was familiar but also different. I still visit there today. I used to write about my adventures in my diary. That was my first try at travel writing, which I became known for later.

Sophia
There is a small train that goes from Hythe to Dungeness. It is run by people who love trains. I always travel first class because it is not much more expensive. The scenery is not amazing. The train goes across Romney Marsh with its sheep and next to a canal. But there is one part of the journey I love. The train goes through back gardens. For a few moments, we can see people doing everyday things, like making tea or washing dishes. I see myself as a woman in a small train, looking into other people's homes. I like the simple landscape. Just fields, sheep, and a faraway grey sea. It makes me look closely to find something special.

Matthew
The Hartland Peninsula is a beautiful and quiet coast. The beaches are hard to get to and have many rocks, so not many people go there. Some brave surfers come, but most people like to look at the sea. The coast faces the Atlantic Ocean and is known for shipwrecks. There are walks along the coast and trips inland to valleys with oak trees, ferns, and wildflowers. We stay in simple places with a family in the village of Southole.

Annette
My favourite place in England is the Trough of Bowland. It is a wide-open moorland, great for hiking. Not many people live or visit there. It's a quiet and empty place, and I like the space. I found it by accident when I was a student. Since then, I visit every year, sometimes alone, with my boyfriend, and now with my son. It has not changed much since my first visit. Having a child makes these visits special. It makes me sad that he is growing up in a city.

James
I bought Glenthorne, my favourite house in Britain. I wanted peace and to connect with my English roots. I grew up in Sri Lanka, but at twelve, I went to school in Devon, England. I used to ride my bike around the moors and village streets. We had a story about a place we never cycled past: if you went down the driveway, you'd never return. That place was Glenthorne. It's my dream place. It's a magic, quiet, romantic house. You can't hear anything except the sea, wind, and birds.'"
FCE_42,"Text: 'HAPPY HUNTING GROUND We are a family who loves animals. One afternoon, my daughter called me at work. She was excited because she found a pine snake. 'Can we keep him?' she asked. I said, 'Yes, but only for one night.' We had a special tank for animals we found, so we could look at them and read about them in our nature book. I got home late. I started cooking when I heard my sons shouting, 'Oh, Mother! Help!' I ran to their room. Domino, our cat, had Bianca, a white mouse, in his mouth. Bianca was a Mother's Day gift for me. Domino ran around the room with the mouse, trying to find a place to eat it. I tried to catch Domino but tripped and fell. Then I saw the snake. It was escaping from the tank. The room was full of noise and movement. The cat, mouse, kids, and snake were all moving around. The dog was barking. I turned off the boiling pot in the kitchen and went back to the room. I caught Domino by the tail and saved the mouse. The mouse was not hurt. This mouse was caught by the cat three more times but lived a long life. After saving the mouse, I looked at the snake. It was hard to catch. I sat on the floor and waited. Slowly, the snake calmed down. I picked it up carefully and took it to the garden. I wanted it to go to a tree. But when I let go of its head, the snake moved over my shoulders like a scarf. We stood there, me, my four kids, and the snake. My oldest child, DJ, said, 'Mum, you are warm, and the shed is not.' We gently moved the snake to the tree. It slowly went up the wall and over the roof. As the last part of the snake disappeared, my three-year-old, Clay, said, 'Wow, that was a big snake!'"

There is the excitement when it arrives, the joy of seeing who it is from, and the fun of reading it. I have been writing letters for as long as I can remember. It started with little notes to my mother. She always made me write thank-you letters for Christmas and birthday presents. It didn't matter if they were short or messy, as long as they were letters. When I left home at 18 to study as a doctor in London, I wrote a letter every week, and so did my mother. Sometimes my father wrote too, and his letters were always funny and long. Most letters from home were about everyday things. We also made phone calls, but I remember the letters most. I also got letters from boyfriends. Many of them had to work or study far away, so we stayed in touch by writing. Writing letters made our relationships better. I could say things in writing that were hard to say in person. I love letters that come with birthday or Christmas cards. Notes are nice, but a letter with a year's news is better! It's even better when it's an airmail letter with pretty stamps. I get letters from Mangala in Sri Lanka, a friend I trained with 20 years ago. I have a penfriend in Australia and another in Vancouver. I also write to a lady in France. We met in a restaurant on holiday. My husband took her photo, and I asked for her address. If she hadn't replied, we wouldn't have become friends. Now we write to each other often. I can practice my French because she doesn't speak English. We have visited each other too. My biggest letter-writing success was this summer. My family and I stayed with my American penfriend in Texas. We had been writing for 29 years but never met. Everyone was surprised that we wrote for so long. The local newspaper even wrote about it on the front page. I am happy my children are writing letters too. Like my mother, I make them write thank-you letters. My daughter writes me little letters, just like I did to my mother. She and my son have penfriends in Texas, thanks to my penfriend. I hope people do not let letter writing disappear.'"
FCE_54,"Title: Ancient Rock Art in Danger

In the French Alps, there is a special place called Mont Bego. Here, there are 36,000 old pictures carved into rocks. These pictures are about 4,000 years old. They show cows with horns, fields, and gods. People think this place was used for prayer a long time ago.

Many tourists visit Mont Bego. But some tourists are not careful. They damage the pictures by writing graffiti on them. Jean Clottes, an expert on rock art, says that if this continues, the pictures might be gone in 50 years. He has seen tourists step on the drawings and even take pieces of rock home. Some people rub the drawings to see them better, which also damages them.

Experts have different ideas on how to protect the drawings. Henry de Lumley, from the Museum of Natural History in Paris, thinks the mountain should be closed to the public. People could only visit with a guide. But Jean Clottes thinks this is too strict and might upset local people.

David Lavergne, a regional architect, wants to keep the site open. He says it is hard to stop people from damaging the area because it is so big. He suggests charging a fee to visit, but there is no money from the government to pay for guards.

Annie Echassoux, another researcher, is worried because tourists can now reach the site more easily by car. She thinks the area should be roped off and guides should be provided. She believes money must be found to protect the drawings for future generations."
FCE_32,"**Young Shoppers**

Shopping in a supermarket with children can be very difficult for parents. One mother says, ""They want everything they see. If it's not the newest sugary cereal, it's a Disney video or a comic. Usually all three. I can't buy all this, and I feel bad if I give in and buy unhealthy things. But I also feel bad for saying no all the time, and I get upset before we even leave home. I try not to take them shopping, but then I worry they won't learn how to make choices. I can't win.""

Research shows that children ask to buy something every two minutes in a supermarket. More than £150 million a year is spent on advertising to children, mostly on TV. This number is likely to grow, and supermarkets are where this advertising works best. Children often don't understand why their parents say no to buying things, and they don't believe that sugar is bad for their teeth when they see fun and exciting ads.

Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says, ""Most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, but these ideas are not always right. It's good for parents and children to talk about food because if children only learn from TV ads, they get a one-sided view. Parents don't like competing with ads and having to say no to their children.""

The Independent Television Commission, which controls TV ads, does not allow advertisers to tell children to ask their parents to buy things. But, as Dibb says, ""The goal of advertising is to make people want to buy something. So even if they can't say, 'Tell your mum to buy this,' that's what they want.""

Some parents find it stressful to decide which things to buy and which to refuse. One mother says she talks a lot with her children about food, and now they don't ask for things she doesn't want to buy. Parents also say they are not always fair in how they respond to their children's requests. Mike, a father of two, says, ""We say no to sweets because they're bad, but we buy cream and chocolate for ourselves. It's fun to buy nice things, and it's normal for children to want them too. But I still get annoyed by their demands. It depends on how I feel. If I'm happy, I'm more likely to say yes. It's hard to be fair all the time.""

Supermarkets could help by not putting sweets near the checkout or by having play areas for children. Parents might spend less if their children are not with them, but shopping without a child's demands might bring in more customers."
FCE_65,"Text: 'Climbing Walls In the past, climbers went to mountains. Now, people can climb anywhere, inside or outside. At the World Cup Climbing Championships in Birmingham, a French climber named Francois Lombard is climbing on a wall. The National Indoor Arena, where the event is held, is also known for the TV show Gladiators. Both events have a wall for climbing. This is possible because of new technology. Before the 1960s, climbers practiced on cliffs. In winter, they climbed in cold places like Scotland or used buildings to stay fit. They needed strong fingers and wanted to avoid boredom. Sports centers started building climbing walls with special bricks. Don Robinson, a teacher, built a climbing wall at Leeds University in the 1960s. He used natural rock in concrete blocks for the wall. Many walls like this were built in the 1970s, but they had problems. They were only vertical, unlike real cliffs with different shapes. Also, once built, they couldn't change, so climbers got bored. In 1985, Francois Savigny from France made a new material for climbing holds. These could be put on and taken off walls easily. French companies also made panels with steel frames. Concrete was too heavy for overhangs, but steel frames could be used anywhere. This system gave climbers many new holds to try.'"
FCE_61,"Text: 'Do you want to be an actor? If you tell someone you want to be an actor, they will probably say it is 'risky'. Acting is a risky job because there are more actors than jobs. When you decide to be an actor, some friends might say you are crazy, but others might not. Everyone will give you different advice. It is your choice, and you are responsible for your dream. There are no easy ways to become an actor. There are no exams to pass, and no guarantee that you will succeed after training. It takes luck and talent. But there is always a need for new actors, and acting can be exciting and glamorous. Sometimes, it can also be rewarding. People often ask what talent is. I think it is natural skill and imagination. Imagination is hard to measure. Talent also involves courage and belief in what you do. Why do people want to act? It is hard to explain. In the theatre, the important thing is the connection between the actor and the audience. This connection is important in all acting. It is what makes actors want to act. If you ask actors how they succeed, they might not know. They know about their skills and other actors' skills. But they do not assume they will always be successful. They know they are only as good as their current job, and fame might not last. Disappointment is a big problem for actors. Last month, you might have been out of work, selling clothes or waitressing. Then, you get an audition, but you might not get the job. So, actors do not talk about their chances. They find ways to handle the stress of auditions and rejection. Nobody likes being rejected. Remember, rejection is possible from the start. You are saying you are available, willing, and hopefully talented for the job. It is up to you, because if you do not care, no one else will.'"

FCE_28,"Text: 'We are all getting taller Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his teacher he wanted to join the navy. The teacher joked, 'Do you want to be the flagpole on a ship?' because Chris was already almost two meters tall. Today, at 228 cm, he is the tallest man in Britain. Every ten years, people in Europe get about one centimeter taller. More tall people are being born each year. This does not mean we are becoming a new super race. We are actually going back to how we were as cavemen. We are losing the effects of bad diets from the past. 'We are becoming like Cro-Magnons again,' says Professor Chris Stringer. Cro-Magnons lived 40,000 years ago. Long ago, people got food from many places: women gathered plants, and men hunted animals. They ate about 85 different wild plants. But about 9,000 years ago, farming started. This changed everything. Farmers took over green lands, and now just three plants - wheat, rice, and maize - give us more than half of our food. This poor diet made people less healthy. In Ohio, scientists found that when people started farming corn, they became sick and underweight. Tooth decay and diseases increased. Farming spread because it could support more people than hunting and gathering. But most people were not well-fed. Only recently have richer countries started to eat better again. In the US, the average man is now 179 cm tall, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm. This is good, but it also causes problems. Beds are still 190 cm long, and there is less leg-room in planes and trains. Clothes makers have to change their sizes. We cannot grow forever. There must be a limit. Robert Fogel from University says it could be 193 cm, and we might reach it this century. But scientists say that while individuals are getting taller, as a species, we are shrinking. During the last ice age, 10,000 years ago, people were rounder and taller to keep warm. As the climate got warmer, we became thinner and smaller. If the planet keeps getting hotter, we might shrink more. So, global warming could make us smaller.'"

Dave and Norm Lagasse, two brothers with big beards in their forties, are in their small home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA. They are remembering their childhood. In front of them is a wooden board with round plastic pieces. They are playing the old game of pichenotte, which they say is special. Their grandfather, Lucien Rajotte, was a grocer from Quebec, Canada. He brought the game to the USA and showed it to his family. Soon, the family played the game every weekend and holiday. Dave says they had 'the best time ever'. The family moved to New Mexico, but they still played pichenotte. Grandpa's board was made from old wooden food crates. Visitors were often interested because the game was unknown in southern USA. Three years ago, Dave saw the old board was broken and decided to make a new one. It was very nice. A relative wanted one, then a friend wanted another. The brothers took a new board to a sports bar in Santa Fe. People watched and said, ""No way I'm playing that silly game."" But then they played and didn't want to stop! People asked about the game's history. Dave found out it started in India with a game called 'carroms'. It changed to 'squails' in Britain, and British people took it to Canada. Pichenotte is the French-Canadian version from Quebec. Pichenotte is a game of skill for two to four people. Each player has 12 pieces or 'pucks'. They 'flick' the pucks across a board with their finger. Flicking a puck into a small hole is 20 points. Three rings around the hole are worth 15, 10, and 5 points. Eight small posts are obstacles. The game lasts about two minutes. The game was popular at the Santa Fe bar, so the brothers made more boards and took them to markets and craft fairs. Many people liked it, and the game became more popular. Championships started, and a trophy called the 'Lord Pichenotte Cup' was made. The boards sold quickly, so the brothers started a pichenotte business. They made a workshop in their garage and made over 450 boards. The boards are made of birchwood and mahogany, weigh 12kg, and are 1cm thick. Norm says, 'They're very strong because they need to last a long time.' They sell for $595 each on the brothers' website. There are no professional pichenotte players or TV shows yet. But soon, the brothers hope their garage will have a luxury car instead of wood. Until then, they enjoy playing the game they hope will make them rich.'"
FCE_41,"**WELCOME TO THE MODEL VILLAGE**

When you enter the Model Village, it is hard to believe that a few years ago, this place was just empty land with lots of wild plants. People thought it was useless land. But one man, with help from his wife, changed it into the beautiful place you see today. They moved a lot of soil and clay to make the land look nice. Machines helped, but it was also a lot of hard work. They brought in 1,000 tonnes of good soil to make the grass, flowers, and rocks. 

Many trees and bushes were planted. They had to choose plants that could live near the sea and in strong winter winds. Most plants came from local garden shops, but some came from Canada and New Zealand. 

Colin Sims thought of the Model Village. He made over 100 models in nine years, starting in 1972. The models are made from stone, concrete, wood, and plastic to last in all weather. Colin learned from experts about how to use these materials, and soon he became an expert too. 

The models are all the same size compared to real life, and every small detail is important. The Model Village is very popular because of its high quality. The way Colin made the models is now used in other model villages in England and taught in some schools. 

The buildings in the village show traditional British styles. One of the best is the Manor House, a 13th-century stone building with a brick tower. It looks like manor houses in the West Country. You will also see a Castle, St Mary's Church, a zoo, and a mini golf course, which is new. 

Please stay on the paths and do not touch the models. If you fall, it can take hours to fix the models. You can take photos from the paths. Dogs are welcome if they are on a short lead. 

To enjoy your visit more, you can press buttons in front of some models to make them move. At the end of your visit, we would like to hear your thoughts. We are always planning new models, and your ideas can help us. Tell us if any models are not as good as the others. We often update the models and need to know which ones need fixing. 

We hope you enjoy your visit and come back again. Please tell your friends about the Model Village."
FCE_69,"Text: 'Every week, British tabloid newspapers show pictures that invade people's privacy. These pictures often break the newspaper editors' rules. Sometimes pop stars pose for photographers, but this is not common. Usually, these pictures hurt famous people because they show private moments on the front page. However, few people ask the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) for help. The PCC is an organization that deals with these problems. These pictures are rarely important for the public. Do private photos of pop stars help solve a crime? How did a picture of a famous actress on a hotel balcony protect public health and safety? The actress was upset about these pictures before. She was in a hotel, a place where she should have privacy, so she had a reason to complain, but she didn't. The PCC did not investigate, which is surprising. They should also look into a recent story about a pop star's love life. The pop star, like the actress, did not make a formal complaint. Shouldn't the PCC do something about these attacks? At first, this seems like a good idea. It would lead to many decisions against newspapers. Other newspapers and TV would report these decisions. The public would not support the newspapers, and editors would stop publishing such material. Photographers would also be affected because they could not make money by taking secret pictures of celebrities. If the PCC acted like a 'police officer', there would be problems. How would it decide to start an investigation? Should it ask the victim to complain? And if the person still refused, should it continue? Also, celebrities might expect every story about them to be investigated and be upset if it wasn't. The role is too big. How could the PCC watch all British newspapers and magazines? There is also the embarrassment factor. Even if someone's privacy is invaded, would they want an investigation? Most people just want to forget and move on. Some may have other reasons for staying quiet. A worse story might exist, and they fear it could become public if they complain. Even the PCC might become the enemy. A British comedian was also photographed secretly on his honeymoon in the Caribbean. He didn't complain then or later when his family was photographed on holiday. He feared the newspaper, News of the World, would publish the pictures again with a new story about his anger. They might say it was just a joke and that, as a comedian, he should have a sense of humor. This fear is understandable. People think they will be targeted again if they challenge the tabloids. It is hard to find an easy solution to this serious problem.'"

Someone suggested I take a university course. I was nervous on my first day, but my confidence grew. Working at the school changed my life.

Fear makes you less confident, so I talk to myself to forget those fears. C Lisa People think I'm confident, but when I look calm, I'm really scared. I learned to look confident because it's important in TV. Interviewing people showed me that everyone gets nervous, and we feel better when we talk to friendly people. My mom once said, 'Who's looking at you? Everyone is worried about themselves.' I remember this. You gain confidence by doing things that scare you. I was nervous for my driving test, but I passed. After that, I felt less scared. D Barbara My confidence comes from enjoying my work, but I built it over time. If you keep going and learn from mistakes, you become more confident. I work hard and am liked at the restaurant, but not everyone likes me. I don't let that bother me. You must like yourself, not try to be what others want. My company has training courses that help my confidence. They also encourage setting small goals. It's better to achieve small things than aim too high and get nothing.

All were 120cm wide and long, made of tissue paper and bamboo. We sat next to them under the trees behind the Beach of the Seven Lagoons in Kelantan, and watched Malaysia's biggest kite festival. In the middle of the beach were 10 platforms, where helpers held the kites, and a row of competitors waited for the countdown. When the whistle blew, the crowd cheered and the kites flew up like rockets. More than 500 men and boys joined the competition, which lasts five days every year. Each person entered four different kites, judged on decoration, stability, and flying skill. 'Flying kites isn't hard,' said Adnan, 'but making them is a real skill. Visit me at home and I'll show you how.' I accepted his invitation. At his house, I drank cold milky tea and ate fish crackers. As it got dark, he asked me to come back the next day to help fix his kite, but I couldn't.

A boat was there to take people across. Nearby, a small sign pointed up a path into the forest: 'Jelawang Jungle 3 km.' It would have been good to know that most of this path was uphill, steep, and slippery. When I reached the track, I found a man with a flask of tea. This was Baba, who took care of a tented kitchen and some bamboo huts. I decided to stay there, trying not to think about insects under my mattress. The night was very dark and full of sounds. A waterfall roared nearby, and many creatures moved and made noises. In the morning, there was a great view of green mountains. In the afternoon, it rained. First, the wind blew, then lightning hit the treetops. I got very wet. Sliding downhill, I wondered how the big butterflies avoided the rain. I also worried about my car being washed away and the chance of drowning if I opened my mouth. Luckily, the car was still there, covered in mud, at the bottom of the track.

The teachers make us laugh, especially when we sit down with them to eat the food we've made.' Flora is twelve, and she's having trouble with onions. 'I love cooking. I made a meal for ten friends, and they really liked it. Then my mum said I should find a hobby, instead of doing nothing at weekends. I was happy staying at home, so I wasn't too excited at first. I'm really glad I decided to come, though.' Their teacher, Philippe, says, 'It's great fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, although the kitchen isn't always tidy when they're cooking! As adults, we're always learning more about food. If parents get their children interested in cooking when they are young, they'll know how to make food for themselves when they leave home.''"

A five-pound note can buy a book, a big bag of sweets, or two cinema tickets. But the note is just a piece of paper that is cheap to make. Thousands of years ago, people did not have money like we do now. There were no banks or shops. In those times, Mr. Green the farmer traded the corn he grew for Mr. Hive's honey. This was a trade between two people, each with something the other wanted. But over time, most societies made their own 'currencies' so people could trade more easily.

PET_27,"Text: 'Grass Grass is one of the most successful plants in the world. There are over 9,000 different types of grass, and they are found everywhere on earth. Grass is the only flowering plant that can live in the cold places like the Arctic and the Antarctic. Grasslands are home to many animals, from small insects and birds to big animals like cows and lions. All these animals need grass in some way. Grass grows back quickly after it is cut or damaged. Unlike other plants, new leaves grow from below the soil, not from the top. This is why many animals can live together in one place. When they eat all the grass, new grass starts to grow again, so there is always food.'"

Since she was a child, she liked drawing clothes and making patterns. She didn't tell her parents, who own a supermarket, that she wanted to make fashion her job. She thought they wanted her to have a more traditional job, so she studied management at university. After university, she moved to London and worked in an advertising agency. She had to go to events but couldn't buy the expensive clothes she liked, so she started making skirts and tops for herself. Her friends liked her clothes and asked her to make some for them too. A small shop in London agreed to sell her designs. Her clothes sold well, and nothing was returned. This made her confident to leave her job, take a PS20,000 loan, and start her own women's clothing brand. Kal's parents were not upset about her new career and said they would support her, which made her happy. Her clothes are now sold in over 70 stores, and her business earns over PS500,000. Her designs are in fashion magazines, she creates clothes for pop stars, and she has just won this award. Her business has grown a lot, and she feels very lucky.

The Sunningdale Hotel was built in 1913 and opened by Princess Louise. It has given great service to people from all over the world. Over 50,000 guests from 174 countries have visited Sunningdale in the past 80 years.

The hotel is on a main road to the town centre. It is about 20 minutes by bus from the town centre. Buses to many parts of the town stop outside the hotel. Guests should not take buses with the blue sign ""Express"" because they do not stop near the hotel. An underground station is less than 100 metres away.

The main building has 200 single rooms. Each room has hot and cold water basins. Showers, baths, and toilets are at the end of all corridors. The hotel has a shop, sitting rooms, four TV rooms, a table tennis room, a library, and a laundry. There are also eight pianos for guests to use. There is parking for cars in the hotel drive. Free daily newspapers are provided, and stamps can be bought at the office.

Guests staying for a long time must pay weekly in advance. They must give one week's notice before leaving. Both short and long-term guests are welcome, but long-term guests get rooms first.

Meal times are: breakfast 7 am - 9.30 am; lunch 1 pm - 2 pm; dinner 5.30 pm - 7 pm. During the week, dinner can be requested until 11 pm by writing your name on the late list or calling before 7 pm. There are 10 menu choices for breakfast and dinner.

No animals or fires are allowed. Guests should keep noise down, especially between 11 pm and 8 am. If you have tapes or CDs, please keep the volume low.

Guests should use taxis to get to the hotel if they arrive by train because the hotel is far from the main railway station."

PET_49,"The Ghan Train

Mark Ottaway took a train trip from Darwin, in the north of Australia, to Adelaide, in the south. The Ghan train goes across Australia, from the warm north through a big desert to the colder south. People often call it the 'famous Ghan', but it is known for being late. 

The idea of a train line between Darwin and Adelaide started in the 1920s with a line from Adelaide to Alice Springs. But there was a lot of flooding, which made it hard for trains to pass. A new line was finished a few months before my trip. The train can go up to 115 kph, but it is not a fast city train. There are few stops, and most passengers are on holiday. The Ghan is not as luxurious as the Orient Express, but the food on the train is very good. 

The railway was first built to carry goods, not people. It was thought that sending goods from Europe to the south of Australia through Darwin and the train, instead of by ship around the continent, would save time and money. The Ghan says it is the world's first north-south railway. 

When I waited to get on the Ghan, I saw that everyone was excited about the trip. Most of the other passengers were older Australians. Our first stop was at Katherine, where the train waited for four hours. Some people got off and took a boat trip. I stayed on the train until Alice Springs, where I went on a two-day trip to Uluru (Ayers Rock) with a small group and a guide. Climbing the rock is not encouraged now, so our group just walked around it and watched the sunset. 

From Alice Springs, there are two trains a week going south, so many people stop here. After Alice Springs, the view from the train is not very interesting. There is a lot of flat land with only cattle to see. But on the third day, at dawn, we reached the hills near the Southern Ocean. My journey was over, and even though the train did not do everything the ads promised, it took me to some of the most amazing places in Australia."
PET_31,"Text: 'Climbing to the top of Britain Every year, many people climb Ben Nevis in Scotland. Because it is in the north, the weather can be very cold. Climber Keith Hewitt talks about his first time on Ben Nevis. It was February, my first big winter climb. We went up the north side of the mountain to Tower Ridge. It is six hundred metres high - maybe the longest climb in Britain. We planned to camp for three days in the 'Carries', which are like big bowls in the mountain walls halfway up. We carried tents, sleeping bags, and metal spikes for our boots. You need these spikes because the snow is so hard it feels like ice. Even though some people in our group were very experienced, we took all kinds of safety equipment, like lights to get attention, hard hats, and extra clothes. The weather forecast was good, with no strong winds, but we still felt nervous when we started. Ben Nevis in winter is always difficult. The path soon went up, and my legs felt tired. I was the weakest in the group, so I had to rest more often. The others sometimes stopped to let me catch up, but when I reached them, they started again. I promised myself that next time I would train better before a climb. After 200 metres, we reached the start of Tower Ridge, the path to the top of Ben Nevis. It is only one and a half metres wide, and the mountain drops hundreds of metres on each side. We knew we had to stay calm and focus on every step as we moved slowly. After seven hours of climbing, we reached the top. On a clear day, you can see the sea and the island of Skye, 48 kilometres away. But we were not so lucky because a mist came down. On Ben Nevis, going back down to camp can be as hard as going up. You need to read a map well because a wrong turn could lead to slopes too dangerous to go down in winter. I was happy we decided to take turns reading the map. That first time, I only really enjoyed the experience when I was safe in the tent. But at least I made it to the top.'"
PET_58,"Anna's New School

This week has been very exciting because we moved to our new school building! It is a wonderful place. The builders used wood for the whole building, just like our old school. But this school is special because it is very good for the environment. It took many months to build, so we watched it happen. It was exciting to see the builders clear the land, but it was sad to lose some nice open space. The building machines were very loud, and sometimes the builders had to stop because of the rain. We thought the building might never be finished.

Now, we have five big classrooms, much bigger than in our old school next door, which was very old. We share one room with people in the town for meetings. There is also a nursery, a nice dining room, and big changing rooms. We can't wait to use them when our new sports field is ready.

When you come into the school, you will see there are no heaters! The heat comes from us - the children, the teachers, and the computers. The building keeps all the heat inside, and it keeps the sound inside too. When we sing, it sounds like we are in a concert hall!

Another interesting thing is the tree on the roof! The builders put it there because it is a custom in Austria, where the roof was made. The electricity for lights and computers comes from a wind turbine on a hill behind the school. We visited it with our teacher yesterday. It spins very fast and is so big you can see it from far away! We took pictures to put on the website.

Even though we are using the school now, some parts are not finished yet. For example, we are doing a play for parents, but we have to go back to our old school hall for it. The new hall will be ready next year. We are very happy with our new school, and our teachers say we will learn much faster here!"

The place to stay wasn't great, but we had everything we needed: beds, blankets, and food. We were happy to be out of the city and in the fresh air. On Saturday morning, we met the other ten people in our group. Cameron came with two friends, Kevin and Simon, while sisters Carole and Lynn came with Amanda. We all came from different places and didn't know the area. We knew we would spend the weekend outdoors, but we weren't sure what we would do. Half of us went caving in the morning while the others went rock-climbing, and then we switched at lunchtime. Matt and I went to the caves first.

Now, six months later, everyone is nice to me. My Russian is much better, and I understand my teachers. For the first two weeks, my mum stayed with me. When she left, I was a bit sad. I called home late at night once because I felt lonely. The classes in Russia are harder than in England, and I eat a lot to have energy. This helps me perform well. In the evenings, I watch my favourite films on my computer, but sometimes I fall asleep before the film ends. Now, I feel at home here. I like walking around the city and going to the shops, even in December when it was very cold. I bought a fur hat because it was minus 10°C, but the Russians said it was not very cold for that time of year! At least my room was warm and cosy.

PET_55,"Text: 'THE ICEHOTEL For many years, people visited the Arctic in the summer to see the land of the midnight sun. But in winter, only a few people lived there with the snow and ice. In the late 1980s, people thought the cold winter could be a good thing. In the winter of 1990, a French artist named Jannot Derit had an art show in a special igloo (a building made of snow) in the small town of Jukkasjarvi on the frozen Torne River. This building, called Arctic Hall, brought many visitors. One night, some visitors decided to sleep in the Arctic Hall. The next morning, they were happy with their experience, and the idea of an ice hotel started. Today, it is famous around the world. When winter starts, a team of snow builders, architects, and artists from many countries come to Jukkasjarvi to build the hotel for that year. As each part is finished, it opens to visitors and guests, while other parts are still being built. The first part is ready in December, and new parts open each week until January 7th when the hotel is finished. The ICEHOTEL is built outside with natural winter materials, so the finish date can change because of the weather. In spring, when it gets warmer, the hotel melts. Inside the hotel, the temperature is always between -5°C and -8°C, even if it is colder outside. Warm clothes like overalls, hats, and gloves are included in the price for guests. It is also a good idea for guests to bring sweaters, a scarf, and many wool socks. They should choose shoes that are bigger than normal to fit thick socks. If you plan to visit the hotel, you can buy warm sweaters, wool socks, and more on the ICEHOTEL website. You can order these things when you book your visit, and they will be in your room when you arrive. The hotel is in the village of Jukkasjarvi, 200 km above the Arctic Circle, but only 15 km from Kiruna airport and 17 km from Kiruna train station. You can take a bus from the airport or train station to the ICEHOTEL.'"

The shop's normal hours will be 9 am to 9 pm every day. But Homestyle said it would stay open for 24 hours on the first day. However, it had to close in just half an hour. A police officer said: 'The police knew many people would come, but they were not patient. The shop was full, so the managers closed the doors. People outside got angry because they thought everything would be sold before they could enter. They did not want to wait quietly. Also, there was a long line of cars trying to get to the car park. Many people left their cars in the road and walked to the shop. This blocked the road.' One customer, Jenny Smith, got into the shop. She said: 'I waited for three hours and didn't have time to buy what I wanted. But the staff were calm and explained what was happening. They had no choice because it wasn't safe. I will come back when they reopen, but I don't want to wait in line again.'"

In 2003, Tanya Streeter made history. She was the first person to dive 120 metres into the ocean and come back up without help, all on one breath. She had gone deeper a year before, but she used a balloon to help her come back up. This time, she held her breath for over three and a half minutes. She was the only woman in any sport to break a man's world record. Fourteen safety divers watched her dive. Some people say free-diving is too dangerous because of accidents, but Tanya disagrees. She says safety and training are very important. Most free-divers focus on one or two types of events, but Tanya's training is always the same. She spends two-thirds of her time training on land at the gym. The rest of her time is in the pool and the ocean. She uses an exercise bike to make her heart strong. She does not run because she does not want to hurt her knees. Instead, she walks fast to stay fit. When she practices diving, she often travels. She does fourteen dives in four weeks, with a rest day between each dive. It is important she does not get tired, or it could ruin her training. When Tanya is not training, she appears in public to promote sports products. She also supports environmental groups by doing research or making films. Tanya grew up on the Caribbean island of Grand Cayman. She loved swimming and exploring rock pools to see sea life. Tanya says her life now is like living her childhood dreams. She is famous in some countries, so people listen to her about environmental issues. Tanya is in her thirties now and wants to keep breaking her own world records. She started free-diving at twenty-five and does not plan to stop for many years.'"

New ideas and computer programs make cartoons fun again for everyone. In the late 1970s, people thought cartoons were only for children. But soon, some directors had new ideas. They showed that both adults and children could enjoy cartoon films. However, not every cartoon film was a success. The Black Cauldron, for example, did not do well because it was too scary for children and too childish for adults. Directors learned from this mistake, and film companies started making a lot of money again.'"

I took a year off to travel before university. While I was in Chile, my mother emailed me about plans to make the book into a TV show. I knew I had to try for the part. My mother was surprised but sent my photo to the director and convinced him to meet me. I flew back and got the part. Filming started a week after university began, so I got permission to be away for three weeks. When I returned, I woke up at 6.00am to write the essays I missed. I didn't tell my university friends, but they found out and thought it was great. It was an amazing experience, and I'm so lucky. After university, I want to be an actress. I'm not from an acting family, but my grandfather was an opera singer. I've tried for other TV roles but haven't got any offers yet. I don't know how I did it all because I had a busy social life too. When filming finished, I didn't know what to do. I've been in two college plays since then.

PET_7,"Norwich Norwich is the capital of East Anglia, a part of Britain. People have lived there for more than two thousand years. It started as a small village by the River Wensum. By 1066, during the Norman invasion, it was one of the largest towns in England. Norwich has two cathedrals and a mosque, making it a popular place for different religions. The first cathedral was built in 1095 and recently celebrated its 900th birthday. In 1994, Norwich celebrated 800 years since it got a Royal Charter, which allowed it to be called a city and govern itself.

Today, Norwich is smaller than cities like London or Manchester, with about 150,000 people. But in the 16th century, it was the second biggest city in England. It grew for 300 years and became rich, known for having many churches and pubs. Now, there are fewer churches and pubs, but in 1964, the University of East Anglia was built in Norwich. The city has many students and is a modern business center, especially for insurance services. Norwich offers many entertainment options: theatres, cinemas, nightclubs, cafes, restaurants, and arts and leisure centers. It also has a football team called 'The Canaries', with green and yellow colors.

A new shopping center called 'The Castle Mall' is a big attraction in Norwich. For over two years, people lived with a big hole in the city while builders worked. They moved a lot of earth to make a park on top of the Mall, with water pools and trees. People in Norwich are happy that the old market is still there, next to the new shopping center. Both places are busy, showing that Norwich has a good mix of old and new."
PET_43,"Text: 'The Albuquerque Balloon Festival Every autumn, the sky above Albuquerque, a city in the south-western United States, becomes full of bright colors. This is because of the Albuquerque Balloon Festival, a nine-day event every year. The first festival was in 1972 to celebrate the 50th birthday of a local radio station. There were about twelve hot-air balloons, and they took off from a car park in the middle of Albuquerque. Since then, the festival has grown. This year, at least a thousand balloons from many countries are expected at the festival's current location outside the city. What to see The pilots talk to each other by radio and light up their balloons at the same time. These are called 'balloon glows' and are great for taking photos. You must arrive just after night falls or before 5.30 am to see these 'glows' as the balloons rise into the dark sky. During the day, you can walk around the balloons and talk to the pilots as they get ready to take off. The balloons come in all sizes and colors, some shaped like animals or cartoon characters, and some like famous products such as soft drinks and fast food. Kids will love it. In the afternoon, you can also take a balloon flight over the desert with one of the many companies offering rides. Another option is to take the cable car from the desert to the top of the nearby mountains. This is the longest cable car ride anywhere, and you can enjoy a view of the festival from above. There are many other things to do for visitors of all ages, including balloon races and fireworks on the first and last three nights of the festival. The Albuquerque Box This is a local wind pattern that is perfect for balloonists. The Sandia Mountains protect the balloons from strong winds and create gentle winds at different heights. This means that by going up or down, skilled pilots can control where their balloons go. Practical advice Buy your tickets in advance online to avoid long lines at the festival. Wear several layers of thin clothing. It can be cool at night and in the early morning, but during the day, sunglasses and sunscreen are important. Bring a flashlight for night events and, of course, bring your camera. If you don't use a digital camera, you'll need high-speed film for evening and night pictures.'"

Margaret lives in London and likes to teach children who are three or four years old, but she also teaches some five-year-olds who are very interested. She started teaching the violin in 1972, and her first class was with her children's five-year-old friends. Margaret's students have group lessons. Each group has about twelve students, and each lesson is one hour long, every two weeks. Also, each student has one private lesson with her every week. Parents must come to the classes too. It is important that parents are interested in the lessons. From the first lessons, students learn to play by ear. They do not try to read music until they have been playing for several years. For a long time, there is a big difference between their playing and reading music. Margaret says her method is not to make great violinists. She suggests that students who do very well should leave and study the violin with more traditional methods."

The first song on the CD is a dance tune, showing that the band is not focusing on slow songs anymore. The second song is also a dance tune and is even louder. Most of the later songs are in the band's usual slow style. These two dance songs will surprise many fans. Both songs could become hit singles because they are very good. Singer Rob Letchford sings perfectly on these songs. Fans should be happy he recorded them before he had problems with his throat. Because of this, the band had to cancel their next tour. (Anyone who bought tickets should not worry because all the concerts will be rescheduled when Rob is better.) On this CD, Moonshine shows they can make great music in different styles, from slow songs to ones that make you want to dance.

Even though San Francisco Bay is a great natural harbour, it was found by land, not by sea. In 1849, many people came to San Francisco hoping to find gold. But it was not the gold seekers who became rich. The richest people made money by owning banks and law firms. They built big houses on a hill called Nob Hill.

Only one hundred and fifty years ago, people started wearing a different shoe on each foot. Before that, both shoes were straight and could be worn on either foot.

PET_40,"**THE HISTORY OF THE IDITAROD - THE LAST GREAT RACE ON EARTH**

In the 1880s, people found gold in Alaska, the most northern state of the USA. Many people went there to find gold and become rich. New towns were built quickly. One town was called Iditarod, which means 'far, distant place'. In 1909, Iditarod grew fast and became the largest city in Alaska for a short time. 

In summer, boats could bring important things to these towns. But in winter, the rivers and ocean froze, so boats could not travel. In 1910, a winter path was made for teams of dogs pulling sleds. They carried mail, food, and clothes to the gold miners. This path was called the Iditarod Trail. It took about three weeks for a team of dogs to cross Alaska. They stopped at 'roadhouses' where the drivers and dogs could rest and eat.

The trail was used every winter until the 1920s. Then, airplanes started to replace boats and dog teams. But in 1925, a disease called diphtheria hit the city of Nome. The medicine to cure it was in Anchorage, far away. Airplanes were new, and people were not sure if they could fly in the cold. The best pilot, Carl Eielson, was not there. So, they decided to use dog teams to bring the medicine. 

The trip was over 1,000 kilometers, mostly on the Iditarod Trail. It took twenty teams six days to finish. Leonhard Seppala, a Norwegian who came to Alaska for gold, traveled the first 400 kilometers. He trusted his dog Togo to find the way in the snow. Togo was a good guide. The last part was done by Gunnar Kaasen, who had worked with dog teams in Alaska for 21 years. His lead dog was Balto. Balto saved the team from falling into icy water. The diphtheria was stopped, and Balto became a hero.

Today, a dog sled race happens every year from Anchorage to Nome. It follows the 1925 journey and is called the Iditarod, known as 'The Last Great Race on Earth'."

PET_28,"**Antarctica Sightseeing Flights Website**

Welcome to our website. Here is what you need to know before booking a flight. During the short Antarctic summer, we take tourists in a big plane (Boeing 747) from Sydney, Australia, over Antarctica and back. Flight dates for next year are not set yet, but if you book now, you can change the date if needed.

**Questions**

Here are answers to common questions about our flights.

**How long is the flight?**

The flight is about 12 hours. After four hours, we usually see the first sea ice and icebergs. We spend four hours over Antarctica and the rest of the time flying back. On the way, experts who have lived in Antarctica talk about the environment and history. A camera near the pilot shows you what the pilot sees from take-off to landing.

**Will I get a seat next to a window?**

All passengers get two boarding passes. Halfway through the flight, you change seats. Business and first class passengers have a window seat for half of the flight. Economy passengers have a window seat or a seat next to it for half of the flight. Over Antarctica, you can walk around the plane to see the sights. The pilot flies in 'figure 8s' so everyone can see well.

**What happens if the weather is bad?**

We have 17 different flight plans. The captain checks the weather on the morning of the flight and chooses the best route for clear views.

**Will I see penguins and other wildlife?**

Most wildlife is over 3,000 meters below the plane, so we can't see them well. We do not land in Antarctica to protect the environment. To see wildlife, you need a boat tour.

**Can I take photographs?**

Yes! You can bring your camera. We also have fun photo opportunities where you can try on Antarctic clothes."

Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, although the kitchen isn't always tidy when they're cooking! As adults, we're always learning more about food.

PET_5,"Text: 'Winter Driving Winter can be dangerous because it is hard to know what will happen, and accidents can happen easily. Fog can be at the top of a hill. Ice might be under the melting snow, ready to make you slide off the road. The car coming towards you might suddenly slide across the road. Rule Number One for driving on icy roads is to drive smoothly. Quick movements can make a car hard to control. So when you turn the wheel, touch the brakes, or speed up, do it gently and slowly. Imagine you have a full cup of hot coffee on the seat next to you. Drive so you don't spill it. Rule Number Two is to watch what might happen. The more ice there is, the further ahead you need to look. Test how long it takes to stop by gently braking. Remember, you might be driving faster than you think. In general, allow double your normal stopping distance when the road is wet, three times this distance on snow, and even more on ice. Try to stay in control of your car at all times to avoid trouble.'"
PET_41,"Craigie Aitchison Craigie Aitchison was a painter from Scotland. He moved to London to study law, but he went to art school instead. He found drawing classes hard, but he kept painting. In his late twenties, he got money from the Italian government to study art. He liked early Italian artists, and this shows in his work. He loved the greens and browns of the Italian fields and the clear light there. He wanted to show this light in his paintings. He painted colours thinly, one on top of another, from light to dark. He says he never knows what the final painting will look like. He says, 'It's a secret - because I don't know myself. I don't start by painting yellow, knowing I'm going to put anything on top.' Aitchison makes it sound easy. 'Anyone can do the colours - you can buy them. I simply notice what you put the colours next to.' He never makes drawings before he starts a painting. He thinks if he did, he might get bored and not finish the painting. Aitchison changes his paintings many times before they are done. He likes models who don't ask to see their pictures while he is painting them. 'If I feel they're worried and want to look at the painting, I can't do it.' Since moving to London, he does not feel part of the Scottish painting scene. He says he is not interested in following any tradition, but just paints the way he can. However, his work still influences young British painters."
PET_38,"Text: 'Rock Band Two years ago, our 14-year-old son, Ben, asked us for a set of drums for his birthday. At first, we did not like the idea because of the noise. 'It's better than watching TV or playing computer games in my free time,' Ben said, 'and it will keep me out of trouble.' In the end, we agreed. 'All right,' we said, 'but you must think about the rest of the family and the neighbors when you play.' That was just the start. Because drums are not easy to move, the other members of Ben's band started coming to our home with their guitars and other equipment. So, for several hours a week, the house is full of the sound of their instruments and their singing. At least Ben's hobby has been good for our health: whenever the band starts playing, my husband and I go out for a long walk. And I must say that, although their music sounds a little strange, they are a friendly and polite group of young men. I cannot say if they are good at music - after all, I didn't expect my parents to like the same music as I did when I was a teenager - but they do play regularly in local clubs for young people. Our main worry is that they won't spend enough time on their school work because of their music, though this hasn't happened yet. I always tell Ben how important his studies are. But one thing is certain - Ben was right: it has kept him out of trouble and he is never bored.'"
PET_17,"Text: 'Atlantic College Last week I visited Atlantic College, a private school in Wales. This school is special because it gives young people important experiences outside the classroom, and they can also study for their exams. The students are between 16 and 18 years old and come from all over the world. In the morning, they study. In the afternoon, they do useful activities like helping on a farm, taking care of people with learning difficulties, or checking for pollution in rivers. One great thing about Atlantic College is that students come from different countries and backgrounds. Not many can pay the fees of £20,000 for two years, so there are grants to help. A quarter of the students are British, and many of them can only go because they get help from the government. ""I really admire the college for trying to encourage international understanding among young people,"" said Barbara Molenkamp, a student from the Netherlands. ""You learn to live with people and respect them, even the ones you don't like. During the summer holidays, my mother couldn't believe how much less I argued with my sister."" In conclusion, Atlantic College gives its students a great education with methods that really work.'"
PET_47,"Text: 'Being an older student I am 32 years old and I have just finished my first year at university. I go to lectures, read books quickly, and write long essays. I decided to go to university after being away from school for fourteen years. I worked as a secretary and made good money, but I was bored because I did not have to think much. I felt sad because I thought I would stay in that job forever. I was jealous of the students at the local university. They looked happy and full of hope, and I wanted to be like them. Now that I am a student, it is hard to make friends with younger students. They often think I am a teacher and ask me questions I cannot answer. I also feel different from the teachers because, even though we are the same age, they know much more than I do. But I am happy to study because I need a qualification to get a good job, which is very important to me. Unlike most eighteen-year-olds, I like spending weekends with my books more than going to parties. I also enjoy student benefits like long holidays and discounts at the theatre and cinema. Sometimes I worry about what I will do after university, but I hope going back to school was a good choice.'"

After driving it 1,500 kilometers, he sold it and made two bigger cars. In 1903, he started the Ford Motor Company. He used strong but light steel to make cheap cars for ordinary people. In 1908, he made the first Ford Model 'T', which cost $825. Soon, he was selling 100 cars a day. By 1927, the Ford Motor Company was worth $700 million. Early Ford cars were simple and cheap, but this sometimes meant less choice. 'You can have any color you like,' said Henry Ford of the Model T, 'as long as it's black.' '"

When the cold weather came in autumn, Bill flew to Virginia in the United States, 600 miles south of his home in Canada. The geese followed him all the way. Bill left the geese in Virginia and went back home. This spring, Bill waited for the birds to come back. They didn't come, so Bill flew to Virginia to find them.

Inspector Ian Saunders told our newspaper that house burglaries have increased by more than 30% compared to last year. He also said that 67% of burglaries happen when people go out and forget to close a door or a window. He reported that night-time burglaries are rare because families are usually at home then. But he said that winter afternoons are the best time for burglars because it is dark and they can't be seen easily. Also, many houses are empty at that time because people are often still at work. Inspector Saunders said it is a good idea to leave lights on in living rooms and bedrooms when you go on holiday. This will help to keep burglars away. He also asked neighbours to watch the other houses in the street when people are not at home. They should call the police if they see anything strange. 'We will also tell you how to make your house safe,' Inspector Saunders said. 'This kind of help costs nothing.''"

KET_44,"Text: 'The History of Farming Before people started farming, they went to the forest to find plants or fruit to eat. This meant that people moved all the time to find food. But about 12,000 years ago, in the Middle East, people began to grow food. These people were the first farmers. Farming made it possible for people to stay in one place, and their villages became bigger. Some people in the villages could do other work, like making clothes, because the farmers grew food for everyone. But farming was hard when the weather was bad, and then some people did not have enough food to eat. Today, farmers can grow more food, and it travels thousands of kilometres from where it is grown to our homes.'"

This is more than the USA, making it the biggest film industry in the world. Most Indians like watching films more than any other free-time activity, and ten million people go to the cinema every day. Bollywood films usually tell romantic love stories, and singing and dancing are important in every film. Indian films are also popular outside India. Last year, Bollywood made over $500 million by selling its films to other countries. Indian actors make more films each year than American actors in Hollywood, but they do not earn as much money. This is why most Bollywood films cost about $2 million to make. A Hollywood film usually costs more than $5 million. Most Bollywood actors are young. They work hard but only for a few years. Amitabh Bachchan is different. Some people say he is India's greatest actor. He has been the star of more than 140 films in almost 40 years of acting."

There were many thieves who took money in the streets, so people stayed in their homes a lot. In 1750, Henry Fielding began to pay some people to stop thieves. They were like policemen and were called 'Bow Street Runners' because they worked near Bow Street. Fifty years later, there were 120 Bow Street Runners, but London had become very big and needed more policemen. So, in 1829, the first Metropolitan (or London) Police Force started with 3000 officers. Most of the men walked, but a few rode horses. Until 1920, all the police in London were men. Today, London police are paid well, and for the few police officers who still ride horses, the pay is even better than for the others.'"

The tickets for these shows are not very expensive, and it is usually easier to see your favourite star in Edinburgh than in London. So come to Edinburgh next summer, but remember it can be hard to find a room, so why not book your hotel now!'"

KET_11,"Text: 'Madame Tussaud's A very famous place for tourists in London is Madame Tussaud's museum. Here, people can see figures of famous people made of wax. Madame Tussaud was born in France in 1761. Her uncle was a doctor who made wax figures of people. He opened a museum of these figures in Paris. Marie helped him with his work. In 1789, during the French Revolution, Marie went to prison. There, she had to make copies of the heads of famous people after they died, including Queen Marie Antoinette. In 1795, Marie married Francois Tussaud. In 1802, she came to London with her wax figures. She opened a museum there, and her figures can still be seen today.'"
KET_14,"Text: 'BICYCLES The bicycle is a cheap and clean way to travel. The first bicycle was made about 150 years ago. At first, bicycles were expensive. Only rich people could buy one. These early bicycles looked very different from the ones we have today. Later, when bicycles became cheaper, many people bought one. People started riding bicycles to work and in their free time. Today, people use cars more than bicycles because cars are much faster and you don't get wet when it rains! But some people still like to cycle to work. They say there are too many cars in town centers and you can't find anywhere to park!'"
KET_63,"Text: 'The Elephant Show by Daniel Allsop, age 14 Last summer, I went to Thailand for a beach holiday with my family. One day, we visited a park near our hotel. It had beautiful flower gardens, but we wanted to see the elephant show. We went to a big square with seats on three sides. Three elephants came in with their keepers and stood in front of a big white card. Each elephant got a paintbrush and started to paint on its own card. Sometimes, the keepers gave the elephants a new brush with paint and took the old one away. Slowly, the elephants drew pictures on the cards, following their keepers' instructions. I couldn't believe it! One picture showed a river, one a tree, and the third a bunch of flowers. When the keepers showed the paintings, everyone wanted to buy one. We gave the elephants the bananas we brought for our lunch. Twenty years ago, elephants worked in the forest. Now, they do not work there, but the smartest elephants live in special places where visitors can watch them.'"
KET_56,"Text: 'Big cats There are many different kinds of big cats. They are different in size and they do not look or act the same. Tigers are the biggest cats. From head to tail, they can be 3.7 meters long. Most cats don't like water, but tigers often lie in water when it is hot! Lions are the only cats that live in big family groups. Several lions work together to get food for the group. They usually live in flat, open areas where they can see far and follow other animals easily. All cats need good eyes because they catch smaller animals for food. They also need to be fast and very strong.'"

KET_20,"Text: 'THE OSTRICH The ostrich is the biggest bird in the world. An adult ostrich can weigh more than 90 kilos. Most wild ostriches live in southern Africa, but there are not many left. Ostriches have wings, but they cannot fly. They use their wings to help them turn when running. Ostriches can run very fast, from 65 to 90 kilometres an hour, so it is hard for other animals to catch them. Baby ostriches are the same size as chickens and take about 3 years to grow up. Ostriches eat plants and can live for many days without water.'"
KET_40,"Victoria Jamieson is from Britain. She started snowboarding when she was 20 years old. Now, she is 23 and has won many snowboarding competitions. We talked to her last week at a competition in Switzerland. We asked her why she started snowboarding. She said, ""I have always liked sports, especially skiing, so snowboarding was a natural choice. It is easy to learn, and you can become good in a few months.""

We asked if she practices a lot. She said, ""In winter, I snowboard in the mountains every day from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. I also run and bike. I love doing all of it! I enjoy the competitions and being in the mountains. It's so beautiful. But free-riding, which is snowboarding for fun and not in a competition, is the best for me.""

We asked her what is important when learning snowboarding. She said, ""You can learn quickly, but you need lessons. It's also important to have the right clothes so you don't get wet because, at first, you fall down a lot!"""

KET_64,"Text: 'Mount Kilimanjaro Mount Kilimanjaro is the highest mountain in Africa. Many people have climbed Kilimanjaro, from a seven-year-old boy to an 87-year-old man. There are different paths to the top. People think that the five-kilometre Marangu path is the easiest. It takes about five days and is very popular with tourists. Only half of the climbers who try to climb Kilimanjaro reach the top. This is often because the weather can change quickly. At the start, it can be hot and wet, but when climbers get to the top, they find ice and snow, and the temperature can be below 20 degrees. Climbers need to bring both sunglasses and warm clothes!'"
KET_29,"Text: 'Otters Not many people have seen an otter. These animals live near rivers and make their homes from small pieces of wood. They usually come out of their homes at night. Otters are very good in the water and can swim faster than 10 kilometres an hour. They have thick brown hair that keeps them warm in the water. An otter can close its ears and nose, so it can stay under water for a few minutes. Twenty years ago, there were not many otters in Great Britain. The water in the rivers was very dirty, so many fish and insects died, and the otters couldn't find food. But today there is a lot of food for them because the rivers are clean again.'"

KET_59,"Text: 'Buildings People have always made buildings. We need houses to keep us warm and dry. We build stadiums to watch football games and concerts. We use other buildings, like museums, to keep beautiful things. Many people work together on a building. The architect decides how the building will look and draws pictures of the ideas. Engineers make sure the building will be strong and safe. Then, the workers build it carefully. The Sydney Opera House is a famous modern building with a nice roof. The building is beautiful from every side, not just the top. There is also a famous roof on the Olympic Stadium in Munich. This building looks like a tent made of glass.'"

On one of these hills, there is a picture of a very big man. This man is called the Cerne Giant because the village next to him is called Cerne. Nobody really knows when the Cerne Giant was made, but people think it was a very long time ago. You can walk from Cerne to get closer to the picture. If you go on the first of May when the sun rises, you will see all the people from the village dancing around the man on the hill.'"

Before, Gail was famous for coming second in big races. But she always laughed and smiled, and people in her city love her for this. Everything changed in 2004 when she ran her first half-marathon, a very long road race. She won with the fastest time of the year for any British woman. Gail's manager and husband, Mike Rollins, also ran when he was younger, but he stopped because he hurt his right leg. He can still run a little and sometimes runs with Gail. But it's not fun for Mike when Gail runs faster than him. Gail trains hard. She runs a long distance in the morning and fast runs in the afternoon. But she always rests from running on Sundays. 'I am with her all the time,' says Mike. 'Sometimes I say, ""Are you sure you should eat that?"" It's usually cakes, but she can eat almost everything.' '"
KET_52,"Text: 'Piano players - when they were young Ivan Petrov Ivan was born on a farm in Russia. From age twelve to eighteen, he studied in Poland. His first music teacher couldn't play the piano but taught him and his sister opera songs. His mother started teaching him piano when he was six. At ten, he wanted to write music and soon started his first song. Oleg Gagarin Oleg was the youngest of five children. When he was four, his father, who liked playing the piano, taught him some traditional Russian music. At six, he started piano lessons with a teacher in his city. Oleg soon won prizes for playing the piano. At fourteen, he went to a music college in Austria for two years. Later, he returned to Russia. Josef Heptmann Josef's father was German but taught music in Poland where Josef was born. The family moved to Germany when Josef was two. A year later, he started playing the piano.

You can write a message on the back. Many people send postcards when they are on holiday because postcards are cheap. The pictures on them are often better than people's own photos. Someone sent the first postcard at the end of the 1800s. It had a picture of a town by the sea. Later, postcards had pictures showing something in the news that week, like an accident or an important person's visit. People liked to see them because they did not have pictures in their newspapers then.'"

The closest living relatives of dinosaurs are birds. Dinosaurs did not all look the same. There were more than 5000 kinds. Some were very small, but others were very big. The biggest were larger than any other animals that lived on land. The Brontosaurus, for example, was twenty meters long, and it ate plants. The Tyrannosaurus Rex was not as big, but it was stronger. It had sharp teeth for eating meat. Also, it could run fast because it had long back legs.'"

Like most animals, they find food by using their noses. There are seven kinds of bears. The largest is the white polar bear, which is almost three meters tall. There are two kinds of black bears. One lives in the forests of North America, and the other lives in South-East Asia. But not all black bears are black. They can be dark brown or reddish brown. Everyone loves the black and white panda bear, which comes from China. Not many pandas live in the forest today because it is hard to find food.'"
KET_38,"CROCODILES

We can find crocodiles in warm parts of the world, like Africa, South America, and Northern Australia. They spend most of their time in slow-moving water, but they can move fast in water and on land. You often see crocodiles together in big groups. They eat everything they catch, like fish, birds, and small animals. Sometimes, they eat big animals or even people. There are more than ten types of crocodiles. They all have very sharp teeth. They often lose these teeth, but they grow new ones quickly. Crocodiles are usually about 3.5 meters long, but some are much bigger. Crocodiles live for a long time. The oldest one in a zoo was 66 years old."

One hundred and twenty years later, in 1903, the Wright brothers made the first plane with an engine and flew it. This happened in the United States. Then, in 1918, the US Post Office started the first airmail service. Aeroplanes changed a lot in the next thirty years. In the 1950s, aeroplanes became much faster because they had jet engines. In 1976, Concorde was made in the UK and France. It is the fastest passenger plane in the world and can fly at 2500 kilometres an hour, so the trip from London to New York is only four hours. Today, millions of people travel by aeroplane, and it is hard to think of a world without them.'"

Visitors ate, talked to friends, walked around during the show, and some even threw things at the actors! Today, you can still visit the Globe Theatre.
