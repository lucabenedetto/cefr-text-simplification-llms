CPE_15,"Text: 'Garbage in, garbage out Charging families for each bag of rubbish they produce seems like a good idea for the environment and makes sense economically. But it might not be. In many developed countries, the routine of collecting household waste is similar. Regularly, rubbish bags or bins are collected by a special truck and taken to a landfill. Economists find this process strange because, in most places, it is free. Households pay for this service through local taxes, but a family that fills four bins pays the same as an elderly couple that fills one. However, the cost of disposing of rubbish is not zero. The more rubbish people throw away, the more collectors and trucks are needed, and the more local authorities have to pay for landfill fees. This is a basic economic problem: if rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish. The obvious solution is to make households pay for the extra cost of disposing of their waste. This would encourage them to throw out less and recycle more, assuming local governments provide recycling facilities. But as Don Fullerton and Thomas Kinnaman, two American economists, discovered, this logical approach can have unexpected and sometimes disappointing results. They researched several American towns and cities that started charging households for rubbish. The most common system is to sell stickers or tags that people attach to rubbish bags or cans. Only bags with these labels are collected. In a study, Fullerton and Kinnaman looked at a scheme introduced in July 1992 in Charlottesville, Virginia, a town of about 40,000 people. Residents were charged 80 cents for each tagged bag of rubbish. This might seem like a sensible use of market forces. However, the authors concluded that the scheme's benefits did not cover the costs of printing materials, commissions to sellers, and wages for the people running the scheme. True, the number of bags or cans fell sharply by 37%. But this was mainly due to the 'Seattle stomp', a method where people crammed more garbage into each container by jumping on it. Machines at landfill sites compact waste better than individuals. The weight of rubbish collected, a better measure of disposal costs than volume, fell by only 14% in Charlottesville. In 25 other Virginian cities without a pricing scheme, used as a control group, it fell by 3.5% anyway. Less pleasing, some people resorted to illegal dumping rather than pay for rubbish removal. This is hard to measure directly, but the authors estimate that illegal dumping may account for 30-40% of the reduction in collected rubbish. The one positive outcome was a 15% increase in recycled materials, suggesting people chose to recycle (which is free) rather than pay for rubbish collection. But the fee might not be the main reason for the increase, as many citizens were already recycling voluntarily. In a more recent study, Fullerton and Kinnaman explored the economics of rubbish in more detail. One conclusion is that pricing does reduce the weight of rubbish, but not by much. On average, a 10% increase in sticker prices cuts the quantity by only 0.3%. This figure is lower than in other studies covering fewer towns, but is it surprising? To significantly reduce rubbish, people would have to buy less of almost everything. A small tax on weekly garbage is unlikely to make a big difference. If that's the case, it might be worth considering whether other factors, like income and education, are just as important as price. In richer towns, for example, people throw out more rubbish than in poorer ones and have less time for recycling. Should we conclude that charging households for rubbish is a bad idea? Not at all: free disposal is too cheap. But the effects of simple policies are often complex. Detailed economic models are often needed to understand them. And sometimes, the results are not as expected.'"
CPE_19,"Theodore Zeldin explores how our work life might change. Do you feel respected and appreciated at work? Today, just having a successful career isn't enough. Many professions feel undervalued, and even famous individuals often feel bitter. Loving your job used to be enough to be envied, but now you must consider how your job affects you personally, your mind, character, and relationships. This is important because no matter how skilled you are, if your work makes you boring or unable to talk to others outside your field, or if you're too busy to gain wisdom or use your imagination, then status or money won't make up for your shortcomings as a person.

I am exploring how work can prioritize personal fulfillment, rather than just shaping us for industrial needs. Work should be more than creating wealth; it should be a fulfilling lifestyle, helping us discover hidden talents and meet diverse people. However, this doesn't mean eliminating unemployment, as educated people want jobs that are enriching and meaningful. A career should be like a work of art, with a fulfilled person at its center.

Even middle-class jobs aren't as appealing as they once were. Doctors are often more stressed than their patients, accountants worry about ethics, architects rarely use their creativity, and administrators are stuck in bureaucracy. Middle managers, once proud of their status, are losing confidence. Meanwhile, companies and public institutions are downsizing. Efforts like decentralizing decisions and rewarding performance haven't gained employee commitment. In Britain, only 8% of employees strongly feel their values align with their organization's.

I am investigating various jobs to see how they shape or harm people. I've studied how different cultures expand human potential and create courage. I've looked at happiness, love, friendship, and respect, and now I'm focusing on finding more satisfying ways to work. Many experts focus on extending the life and income of companies, but we also need to evaluate ourselves as people and decide who we want to spend our lives with. How many of us feel truly alive at work? How many are like part-time slaves, theoretically free to leave but actually trapped by our qualifications and careers, working not to improve ourselves but because we see no other choice?

Take hotel workers, for example, as 10% of the workforce is in the 'hospitality industry'. There's a lot of unused potential. Many intelligent and lively people accept low prestige, low pay, and long hours because hotels haven't been rethought since the days of the Ritz. A hotel isn't just a place for travelers to sleep; it's like a mini United Nations. People from around the world meet in hotels but often pass each other silently. Many hotel staff are foreigners eager to learn a new language and culture, but they have only superficial interactions with guests. Hotels could be cultural centers, connecting guests with the city and each other. Hoteliers could use the skills of the students they employ, rather than just giving them basic tasks. If they considered their staff's true ambitions, they'd see many other services hotels could offer. But accountants often limit this by focusing on one main activity to maximize profits. It's time to rethink this from a human perspective, not just a financial one, and move beyond traditional categories.

For me, work is a relationship. Now that many people want more than just obedience and see work as a way to express independence, they should have the chance to design their own jobs and choose their colleagues and even customers, within practical and profitable limits. This means they need to communicate beyond professional jargon, with minds that might seem different at first. Everyone knows communication is important, but it's different from conversation. Traditional conversation is different from the new kind of conversation people miss today. This is a more personal interaction that creates respect and helps understand others, often changing you in the process. It's more than just relaxing; it's a powerful way to create equality. Every time you have such a conversation, the world changes a little bit."
CPE_24,"**BROADCASTING: The Social Shaping of a Technology**

The term 'broadcasting' originally referred to the act of spreading seeds by hand over a large area. This agricultural metaphor suggests planned growth and a rich harvest if conditions are right. It implies a central source of seeds, or resources, meant for wide distribution and reproduction. The question is why a new technology that could send words and pictures electronically was organized in a way that fit this metaphor.

Television, like the telegraph and telephone, is a form of communication. However, from the start, it was seen as a centralised 'mass' medium. Broadcasting to private homes from a central source matched the socio-economic structures and lifestyles of modern societies. Other forms of organization were tried but remained just experiments.

Two lesser-known alternatives show what television could have been in a different social context. In the early 1930s, radio amateurs in Britain experimented with two-way television as a possible replacement for the telephone. Popular science magazines published articles on building TV transmitters and receivers. However, in 1938, the British Radio Manufacturers Association set standards that pushed these grassroots efforts aside. Thus, the chance for a more egalitarian form of television communication was lost.

Broadcasting was linked to strong economic interests and the structures of modern societies. Despite the efforts of TV amateurs, television in the USA in the early 1930s was mainly a medium for public viewing, often seen as a competitor to the film industry. In Britain and Germany, public viewing was how most people experienced television. While grassroots, two-way television was unlikely to succeed, public viewing systems in several countries in the 1930s posed a potential challenge to the domestic use of television. However, this threat did not materialize.

Manufacturers saw the potential for mass sales of home TV sets once prices dropped. With the rise of consumer society from the 1920s, the dream of the home as a center for entertainment became possible for many in Western countries. This trend is now global. There is a link between social modernization and the structure of broadcasting. As societies modernized, centralization of capital and power increased, and traditional communities broke up, leading to new ways of life. People became more mobile and isolated, making centralised broadcasting an effective way for governments to reach citizens and create a sense of national community.

Broadcasting became the dominant form of radio and television due to these structured processes and interests. However, broadcasting also played a role in democracy by providing equal access to information necessary for informed participation in society. Television is changing, and the term 'broadcasting' may become outdated. If so, this metaphor will refer to a specific phase of audio-visual technology during a centralised period of social modernization."
CPE_13,"**Clutter**  
Sometimes it feels like no matter how many things you own, you never feel safe. It's normal to want a home that meets your needs, but sometimes the desire to get more things goes too far. Modern advertising is designed to make us feel insecure. The message is often: if you don't have this, you're not good enough. To see how much you're influenced, try not to read any ads next time you walk down the street. These expensive ads influence us in powerful ways without us noticing. We see them everywhere—on TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, T-shirts, the internet—all telling us to buy more.

**Caves**  
Research centers and universities around the world have spent years studying caves, focusing on their origins, water systems, and biology. Caves are a small but mysterious part of nature, sparking our curiosity and desire to learn. This has led to a lot of research. In places where caves affect our lives, studies have increased. However, exploring caves requires physical skill, so cave research is often done by both scientists and amateurs who enjoy visiting caves for fun. This creates a unique overlap between professional and amateur cave studies.

**Weather Watch**  
Many observant people, using only their senses, laid the foundations of meteorology, which has developed into the advanced science we have today. Satellites and electronic tools send us endless weather information quickly, and computers solve complex math problems faster than humans can. Meteorological theory uses long words that can be confusing to non-professionals. It might seem like there's no room for simple weather knowledge, but that's not true. Human experience is still crucial in turning data into weather forecasts. Human observations can provide unique insights that help professionals understand the atmosphere."
CPE_16,"**MUSIC AND THEATRE**

Until recently, I believed opera was mainly theatre. Now, I think it's more about music. After working at a national opera house, I learned that music is the priority in opera. This makes sense, but I come from the theatre world, where the spoken word and the actor are most important. In theatre, there is no one directing the action once it starts, and the audience usually understands the language spoken on stage.

In musical performances, like concerts or operas, many people, including myself, may not have a deep understanding of music. Some might feel embarrassed by what they don't know, but most are amazed by the performers' skills. A brilliant singer or a perfect orchestra is easy to admire. Even a good musician shows the results of years of hard work. Watching top-class music is like watching a sports event; we see athletes doing something similar to us running for a bus, but they do it much better.

Theatre audiences have different expectations. They often don't understand an actor's skill and aren't as impressed by something that seems close to what they could do. They don't usually applaud when an actor finishes a long speech, although they often ask, ""How do you learn all those lines?"" This doesn't mean theatre audiences are more generous or less demanding than music audiences; many are the same people. It suggests that in theatre, audiences and performers meet on more equal terms, no matter how challenging the material is.

The question is, should music learn from theatre about this relationship? I think yes, because a different approach can change the concert-goer's experience. Live music is naturally theatrical, full of emotion and drama, and it can go wrong, engaging the listener's imagination as part of a group. However, music presentations often emphasize the difference between performers and listeners, which can feel hierarchical. Also, audiences sometimes interrupt performances by clapping at the wrong times, which can disrupt the flow of the music.

Is there a solution? Yes, much is being done to attract new audiences to concerts and operas and to make 'serious' music more accessible. I remember a special event, Jonathan Dove's community opera ""In Search of Angels,"" which moved from place to place in a cathedral and then into the town. It was a high-quality musical experience, where professional musicians played a central role, and it was life-changing for many in the audience, who also participated.

I wish music had more of the risk and boldness that theatre can show. Sometimes, this comes from using unusual locations, which can surprise both performers and audiences. It might be uncomfortable, with poor acoustics or cold temperatures, but theatre audiences have learned to be adventurous in such spaces. I know most plays are performed in a traditional way, similar to concerts. However, I believe something should change in music conventions. My only authority is as an enthusiast: I love theatre and spend as much time and money as I can on music. I want both to succeed and for more people to enjoy them as much as I do."
CPE_21,"**Sand**

While I admire sand's amazing ability to be turned into useful things like glass and concrete, I am not a big fan of it in its natural form. To me, it is mainly an annoying barrier between a seaside car park and the water. It blows in your face, gets into your sandwiches, and hides important things like car keys and coins. When you are wet, it sticks to you like plaster and cannot be removed, even with a strong hose. But, strangely, as soon as you step onto a beach towel, get into a car, or walk across a clean carpet, it falls off you. For days after, you find piles of it on the floor every time you take off your shoes, and more of it spreads around when you remove your socks. Sand stays with you longer than many illnesses. No, you can keep sand, as far as I am concerned.

**Lock and Key**

The search for a safe home, for privacy and security, has existed since humans first built permanent homes. The wooden beam behind the door may have been replaced by an electronic lock activated by a plastic card with more combinations than there are atoms in the universe, but the desire to keep out the 'bad guys' remains. The appeal of a lock and key is partly psychological. Recently, some companies have tried computerized locking systems, where smart cards, swiped through a 'reader', control electronic locks with a digital command. But people don't like them. You might accept it at work, but at home, everyone wants the comfort of turning a physical key in a lock. As a result, when one locksmith company developed a new electronic system, they made sure to include a real metal key in the device.

**Modern Art**

I was nervous about visiting the new Tate Modern gallery because, like many people, I can't understand modern art. I know I quite like some of it, especially furry things, neon light sculptures, and large photographs. Maybe if I knew more about it, I'd have an opinion on more things. Then again, you're not supposed to approach it like a school essay. The point is not to understand art, but to let it communicate with you. This is a great idea, but it never worked for me. However, this new gallery has tried to give visitors a real insight into the reasons behind the works. The first thing I noticed were the labels, proper labels that put a work in context and actually told you what it was trying to say. Instead of staring blankly at the pictures as I used to, these bits of information helped me understand."
CPE_46,"**Every Picture Tells a Story**

Adapting novels into films often means reducing, condensing, and deleting parts of the story. This can be frustrating for writers but also enlightening. When I worked on a script, I realized how much dialogue and description from the novel could be left out while still conveying the same message. This doesn't mean the original text was unnecessary. It's about the different ways each medium engages the audience and uses repetition. In novels, repetition helps readers remember character traits and who is speaking. In stage drama, speech often imitates real conversation, sometimes using language that seems redundant but serves to connect speakers. In some modern plays, this redundancy is extreme, making the dialogue seem like it’s just for show, leaving the audience unsure of the message.

**Watching Movies**

Watching movies can transport you into another world, making you forget reality for a while. During the film, it feels like what you do doesn't matter. But when the lights come back on, you're back in the real world. This feeling of unreality makes it hard to take movies seriously as art. In the past, many people, including our parents and teachers, saw movies as just entertainment, not art.

**The Film Studios**

The Leiper Film Company studios were a mix of different buildings, with a confusing layout. There were a few permanent landmarks like the Script Department, but most rooms looked the same and were hard to find. The studio had no clear main entrance, which made it confusing for newcomers. However, strangers were rare because the studio didn't encourage them. Employees, who knew their way around, worked together to create films that offered audiences an escape from everyday life.

**Film-makers**

Many people dream of making movies. Bookstores are full of guides on scriptwriting and film production, and universities offer courses. Competitions offer cameras like the one Robert Rodriguez used to make El Mariachi, a film that cost $7,000 and made him a famous director. Rodriguez's success story is a dream come true. He recalls thinking he had only a few years to make his breakthrough film, comparing himself to famous directors like Orson Welles and Steven Spielberg. In the past, filmmakers took time to develop their skills, often starting with small projects. Directors like John Huston and Fred Zinnemann only made their mark later in life. Today, without studio support, aspiring filmmakers often have to be independent and resourceful."
CPE_3,"In those days, council houses covered the western side of the city: rows of crowded, dull homes in orange half-brick or pale white stucco. In summer, chemicals from the May and Baker factory, two miles away, filled the air with a strong smell of sulphur. The most common sight in that part of Norwich early in the morning was a paperboy wrinkling his nose in disgust as he walked up to someone's front door. Most of my early life is a blur. But I do remember sitting, or maybe balancing, near an upstairs window, watching the houses fade into the distance. Later, there are other vague memories - faces I can't name, my mother ironing towels in a house that I don't think was ours, snow falling over the turrets of the great mansion at Earlham. It's no surprise that my mother appears in these early memories. I remember her as a small, precise, and often angry woman, though I never understood why she was angry, so I couldn't do anything to make her happy. Even as a child, when I went with her to the small shops in Bunnett Square or on longer trips into the city, I sensed her unusual personality. She was the most solitary person I have ever known, as alone in a room full of people as on a moor. She also had a strict sense of propriety uncommon on the West Earlham estate, which sometimes led to furious cleaning or handwashing and instructions to 'behave properly'. As a moral code, this was beyond my understanding: even now, I'm not sure I get it. Specifically, it meant not walking into neighbors' gardens or damaging their rose bushes; it meant sitting quietly for long periods in the dining room, with your hands folded, listening to radio programs my mother liked; it meant - oh, many rules and restrictions. Over time, other figures appeared in these strict early scenes. Despite her solitude, my mother had friends. There was Mrs. Buddery, who was obsessed with the Royal Family, Mrs. Winall, who said nothing except to agree with the main speaker, and Mrs. Laband - livelier than the others, and somewhat disapproved of by them. It was only later that I realized how poor their company was; they formed a sad and depressing group, talking about bad legs, the cold weather, and ungrateful children, a category I often felt I belonged to. Looking back, it felt like a heavy weight, made up of the West Earlham houses, my mother and her friends, and the need to 'behave properly', was on my shoulders, and that I had to grow up quickly to free myself from it. This was easier said than done. Growing up in West Earlham at this time followed a set pattern. Until you were five, you stayed at home and got in your parents' way (I remember boring days, when I was about four, playing on a rug in the front room while my mother sat coldly in an armchair). Then, the September after your fifth birthday, you went to Avenue Road infants school, half a mile away towards the city. The lucky few had a mother with a rickety bike and a child seat - these were strange contraptions made of cast-iron with makeshift safety straps. As far as I remember, my mother left me in the care of other children in the street for this journey. If I remember anything about these early years, it's the summer holidays, those days when you caught glimpses of the world outside West Earlham: an old man who lived next to Mrs. Buddery and told stories about his time in the Merchant Navy; a charity fete once, at a house far away on Christchurch Road, where a kind woman gave out lemonade and tried to interest me in something called the League of Pity - a kind of junior charity, I think - only for my mother to dismiss it, saying its organizers were 'only after your money'. My mother often talked about people having selfish motives, and she had a deep contempt for politicians. If she thought of the House of Commons - and I'm not sure she could imagine such a thing - it was like a fancy post office where rich people opened letters full of five-pound notes sent by a gullible public. No doubt I exaggerate. No doubt I overlook her good qualities and focus on her flaws. But there was little kindness in my mother; it had all been drained from her. To be fair, my mother wasn't unaware of her role in my education. Occasionally on Sundays, she would take me - in my 'good clothes' - on the 85 bus to the Norwich Castle Museum. Here, hand-in-hand, cautious but aware of the free entry, we would walk through rooms of paintings by the Norwich School of Artists. My mother wasn't entirely against this activity, and eventually, she almost formed opinions on the various subjects. I remember her stopping once in front of a painting of a Roman soldier in full battle gear to say, 'Well, I wouldn't like to meet him on a dark night!' I recall this as the only time my mother tried to make a joke."
CPE_10,"**Philadelphia Avenue**

I walked down Philadelphia Avenue on the side with odd-numbered houses. The evening was getting darker, and the air was thick with a light, prickly drizzle. This made my walk feel secretive and sheltered. I knew this side of the street well since childhood. Our neighbors were the Matzes and the Pritchards, and there was Han Kieffer's grocery store. My first playmates, all girls, lived in the Kring's and the Pottses' houses. Even if I didn't know everyone by name, each house was familiar to me, like the little grooves in the sidewalk that guided rainwater to the street. These grooves marked my path when I used roller skates or my scooter. As the street went downhill, the houses seemed to get simpler, with lower porches and smaller front yards. Over the years, changes happened: wooden porch railings and pillars were replaced with wrought iron in a style that seemed Southern or Spanish. In Shillington, some houses I remembered as homes became stores, and some stores, like Pep Conrad's and Han Kieffer's, became homes again. I wondered how people lived in those spaces that used to be shops, with the lingering smells of merchandise.

**Bachelor Fads**

Furniture designer Rick Gilbert lives in a flat that used to be a curtain warehouse. It has typical loft features like exposed brickwork and large doors, which were used to bring in curtains from trains on the nearby railway. However, Gilbert didn't want an open-plan space for both practical and aesthetic reasons. 'In my last place, living and working spaces were combined. It was hard to relax or start work when everything was in view.' So, he divided the space near the entrance with a large sheet of corrugated plastic. 'It hides the office, creates a hallway, and leads the eye to the kitchen in the middle of the flat. I wanted the kitchen to be a neutral area, where I can either cook for friends or make coffee for clients.' To balance the modern look of the plastic screen and stainless steel kitchen, Gilbert used light wood for the floors. While his flat has futuristic chairs and sofas, it also has sentimental and homely furniture from his parents or bought from markets.

**Bruce Chatwin**

Was Bruce Chatwin trying to escape or explore? His romantic and wandering lifestyle has become a mystery in literature. Chatwin's life and work were full of secrets, subtle connections, and sometimes lies. Despite this, he was a brilliant and unique writer. His first book, ""In Patagonia,"" published in 1977, is a remarkable work of imagination. It is a travel book that changed travel writing, with the excitement of a thriller, the charm of romantic fiction, and the deep insight of extraordinary literature. Even in this book, Chatwin mixed fact with fiction; he would change or even ignore reality to make a story more interesting or to highlight the book's theme—that through travel, one could discover entire histories that seemed to exist just to captivate future explorers.

**Swimming**

Warm rain poured from the gutter during a midsummer storm as I hurried across the lawn behind my house and took shelter in the pool. Swimming back and forth, I kept my eyes just above the water. Each raindrop created a small, bouncing fountain that turned into a bubble and then burst. The best moments were when the storm grew stronger, drowning out the birdsong, and a mist rose from the water as if the pool was reaching up to meet the darkening sky. It was during this heavy rain in the summer of 1996 that I started thinking about a long swim through Britain. I wanted to follow the rain as it traveled across the land to the sea, to escape the monotony of swimming laps, always turning back like a tiger pacing in a cage. Most of us live in a world where more and more places and things are labeled and explained. This is turning reality into something visual. That's why walking, cycling, and swimming are rebellious activities. They help us reconnect with what is old and wild by getting off the beaten path and breaking free from the official version of things. A swimming journey would let me explore parts of our world that, like darkness, misty woods, or high mountains, still hold mystery."
CPE_67,"Text: 'CRYING Charles Darwin thought that humans cry for no clear evolutionary reason. He was probably wrong. More recently, scientists have noted its social importance. Psychiatrist John Bowlby emphasized crying's role in forming bonds between mother and child. Many think that tears, especially in children, show helplessness. But why adults cry is harder to understand. The sound of crying seems less important than the visual signal it sends. In early human groups, crying might have helped build trust and social connections. Tears can also have other reasons. We might cry to show sympathy for those facing injustice. Additionally, tears can come unexpectedly, to our embarrassment, when we hear inspiring music or speeches. We might cry during a sentimental movie, but interestingly, this happens more often with others than when alone. The social role of crying seems clear, but research continues.'"
CPE_27,"**The Heat is On**

We all know about global warming, but how much warmer will the Earth get, and how will it affect us? Many people have an idea of what global warming is, but its consequences are uncertain. A warmer climate will likely change the weather worldwide. Since the atmosphere is connected to everything on our planet, changes in climate will significantly impact plants, animals, water, and soil. Humans rely on these natural resources to produce food, build cities, and support billions of people. Any changes to these resources are serious.

The challenge is understanding how the world will change and what causes these changes. Over the last 100 years, human activities have increased the levels of certain gases in the atmosphere, which are linked to global temperatures. These increased levels are likely affecting the global climate, but our limited understanding of the global heat balance makes the future uncertain. We do know that greenhouse gas levels have changed in line with global temperatures over the past 40,000 years, suggesting a strong connection. Evidence shows that the Earth's surface has warmed by about 0.6°C over the past century. Most scientists believe this warming is not natural and is partly due to human pollution.

Research has focused on predicting the effects of higher global temperatures using computer programs called general circulation models (GCMs). These models use physics and chemistry to analyze climate factors and predict past, present, and future conditions. However, they are simplifications and have limitations. Despite these challenges, most agree that the rate of climate change will be faster than ever before. GCMs suggest that by 2100, the average global temperature could rise by 1°C to 3.5°C, sea levels could rise by 15-95 cm, and precipitation patterns could change. Extreme weather events like heatwaves, floods, and droughts may become more common.

Climate change can affect the locations of ecosystems, like forests and grasslands, and the species they contain. This impacts resources we depend on, such as food, water, and human settlements. Some effects may be irreversible and harmful, but not all. Some impacts could be beneficial. For example, in Australia, warmer temperatures have increased wheat yields by reducing frost damage.

However, many predicted effects of future warming are not beneficial. Small climate changes can affect water availability, especially in dry regions or areas with existing shortages. The Mediterranean Basin has seen less rainfall and changes in seasonal patterns. Glacial changes will affect ice, vegetation, wildlife, and human structures. The Arctic ice cover might melt completely, easing marine transport but increasing iceberg risks.

The most dramatic effect of global warming could be rising sea levels due to ocean expansion and melting ice. With about half the world's population living in coastal areas, the consequences could be severe. Cities like London, New York, and Tokyo might face significant flooding. Many people could lose their homes, creating environmental refugees. Small, low-lying island nations could be most affected, potentially disappearing entirely, which would be devastating for their people and cultures, as well as for countries that would need to accommodate displaced populations."
CPE_66,"Text: 'Mission to Mars Wanted: a middle-aged, married couple for a 501-day round trip to Mars. Applicants must be physically and emotionally strong. This will be the profile of the first astronauts to go to Mars if multi-millionaire Dennis Tito's plans to launch a capsule on 5 January 2018 succeed. The capsule will take the crew to about 160 km above Mars. The spacecraft will use Mars's gravity to return to Earth without using more fuel, as saving fuel is important. The 2018 date is set because the next time Mars and Earth align for a launch is in 2031. It's a normal order, but there is a rush to create systems with new technologies. If these can be ready in time, the spacecraft might succeed. But even if it never leaves Earth, the efforts to reach these goals will still be valuable for future missions.'"
CPE_44,"**Aesthetics**

Sometimes, the very existence of art can make it hard to understand aesthetic theory. This is because art is often seen as just physical objects like buildings, books, paintings, or statues, separate from human experience. However, the true essence of art lies in what it does to our experiences. This misunderstanding can hinder our understanding of art.

Moreover, the perfection and long-standing admiration of some art pieces create conventions that block new insights. Once an art piece becomes a classic, it often gets disconnected from the human conditions that created it and the effects it has on people's lives. When art is separated from its origins and its impact on experience, it becomes difficult to grasp its broader significance, which is what aesthetic theory tries to address. Art is often placed in a separate realm, disconnected from other human efforts and achievements.

A key task for anyone writing about the philosophy of fine arts is to reconnect art with everyday experiences. Just like mountains are part of the earth, art should be seen as part of human experience. Geographers and geologists show how mountains are connected to the earth, and similarly, those who study art should show how it connects to life.

To truly understand art, we need to temporarily set aside the art objects themselves and focus on the ordinary experiences that we don't usually consider aesthetic. We must approach the theory of art indirectly. Just as one can enjoy flowers without knowing plant biology, understanding art requires looking at the basic experiences that capture our attention and bring us joy.

Many people enjoy things like movies, jazz, and comic strips without considering them as art. This is because art is often seen as something that belongs in museums and galleries. However, the desire for enjoyable experiences finds expression in everyday life. Even those who criticize the museum view of art often still separate art from ordinary experiences. The best appreciation of art happens when it is closely connected to everyday life."
CPE_22,"**Observing Lions**

In popular imagination, lions hunting for food are seen as a marvel of teamwork: in the fading light of sunset, a group of stealthy cats emerges from the shadows like trained hunters and surrounds their unsuspecting prey. Lions seem to be the perfect social animals, putting aside disagreements to work together for a common goal - their next meal. However, after many years of observing these animals in the wild, we have a different view. When we began our research in 1978, we wanted to find out why lions hunt together, raise cubs, and scare off rivals with loud roars. If an animal's success is measured by how many surviving offspring it produces, then cooperation might not always be beneficial: if an animal is too generous, its companions gain at its expense. So, why didn't the evolutionary rules of self-interest apply to lions? We thought we could solve this in two to three years. But lions are very good at doing nothing. To the list of inactive noble gases, like krypton, argon, and neon, we would add lions. It has taken various research methods to uncover clues about their behavior. Since wild lions can live up to 18 years, the answers to our questions are only now becoming clear.

**Pop Music Review**

The release of Bedrock's third album was more than just a milestone for a talented but previously unstable band. ""New Life"" started a movement that changed the style of rock music in this country for the rest of the decade. Gone were the serious angst, plain clothes, and loud guitars of the past; in came a lighter mix of melodious local styles. A combination of social observation and strong anger mixed easily with the sound of fairground organs and northern brass bands. Humor and irony were prominent, as were voices that didn't hide their origins. The album showed Bedrock as skilled collectors and observers, and a clever team of songwriters. At their most obvious, they playfully explored traditional English themes like sunbathing and Sunday afternoons. But the album's real strength was in the gentle, sad depths it reached on tracks like 'So Low', a beautiful tune loosely based on weather, and 'To the Brink', a ballad that allowed no joking. The beauty of ""New Life"" is its consistently high quality - 16 tracks with no filler, an unmatched record in the era of long CDs.

**Extract from an Autobiography**

As a child, I was always fascinated by stories of 'The Sibyl', those wise women who had great influence in the ancient world. At first, I only knew of one from a story my mother told me. An old woman from Cumae offered Tarquin, King of Rome, nine books for 300 gold pieces. He refused, and she burned three of them, offering him six for the same price. When he refused again, she burned three more books. He bought the remaining three for the full 300 gold pieces. I realized even then that there was a deep truth in the story - a lesson in salesmanship and life. I was sometimes a lonely only child. I would ask to play with other children and be refused. My mother told me to do something so interesting that all the other kids would want to join me. It worked. It was another lesson I've never forgotten. When I was given the chance to write a travel book, I had to find something I was interested in, something relevant to my life. I'm a reluctant traveler - I sent my editor a long list of places I didn't want to go. In the end, I'm only interested in ruins because I like traveling through time in my mind.

**What Becomes of Your Manuscript?**

When you submit your manuscript, it will likely join a pile waiting for someone to sort through it before it topples over - the so-called slush pile. This person is usually either a junior in the editorial department (under 18) or an experienced person who comes in a few mornings a week and is paid by the hour. Neither has much influence, but they are on your side and want to find something original - the junior to make a name and acquire an author if they are lucky, the experienced person to justify continued freelance work. If they think your novel is promising, they will pass it to a more senior editor, and eventually, it will be discussed at an acquisition meeting. The editor supporting your novel will need to justify accepting it based on its quality and potential sales, and also whether you seem to be a long-term prospect (which you will have assured them of in your letter). Additionally, they will consider how promotable you are - an important factor - when a new novel needs all the help it can get. For this reason, publishers often like to meet a potential author before finalizing the offer."
CPE_39,"**Advertising on Trial**

If you worked in an advertising agency in the early 1990s, you might have faced the toughest time in your career. The recession was severe, lasting longer and hitting harder than expected, especially in industrialized countries. In Britain, 1991 saw a decline in GDP, high interest rates, reduced consumer spending, over half a million job losses, and 75,000 homes repossessed. Every business was affected, with some industries like vehicles and construction seeing a 30% drop.

Advertising professionals were not the only ones losing jobs, but those who remained employed felt significant pressure. They were expected to support company profits while working with smaller budgets. Despite these challenges, the importance of marketing grew. Companies began focusing more on producing what customers wanted rather than what was convenient for them. This shift increased the status of marketing professionals but also added to their responsibilities.

Marketing is often seen as a solution to all problems, and with about half of marketing budgets spent on advertising, the pressure is on advertising professionals. The 1980s were a good time for advertising, but the 1990s brought a downturn. This was partly due to the economic climate, but also because companies started questioning the value of advertising. Without clear evidence of its benefits, many companies doubted the return on their investment.

Client companies demanded better strategies, targeting, creativity, and media placement from advertising agencies. They wanted the best people working hard to produce outstanding work. This meant advertising professionals had to do more with less, facing the same challenges as their clients.

Several factors made creating effective advertising difficult. Some were due to the recession, like debates over production costs and a reluctance to take risks. Other challenges included demographic changes, the growing power of retailers, changing consumer needs, the rise of sponsorship, stricter legal restrictions, and the challenge of advertising abroad.

These issues forced advertisers to reconsider the effectiveness of their work. The pressure to increase the success rate of advertising was higher than ever. However, finding help was difficult. Companies and agencies were too busy managing these challenges to share their strategies, and those who succeeded were reluctant to reveal their secrets. Conferences and seminars offered some insights, but available books on advertising often failed to provide practical guidance. They tended to overestimate the quality and value of advertising work, which did not help those responsible for it."
CPE_18,"**The Lure of the Kitchen**

When I was at university, I decided I wanted to be a chef. Among my peers, this was an unusual choice. Cooking was not one of the popular jobs that most of us wanted. On the surface, it seems like an unattractive profession. Chefs are known to have tough lives: the work is long, stressful, basic, and poorly paid. But these factors didn't discourage me. I was unhappy at university. The work was difficult, and the social scene felt closed and self-important. Being a chef seemed like the perfect escape from intellectual and social pretensions. It promised a seriousness and honesty that I found missing in my college life. However, my desire to cook wasn't just a reaction to being a student. It also represented an artistic ideal. My first glimpse of this ideal came when I ate a meal at a famous London restaurant. It was eye-opening. I still clearly remember my starter. I finished that meal wanting to thank the chef who made it. I felt happy and light for days afterward. After this, I developed a strong desire to learn the secrets of this amazing art. I turned my student life into a long preparation for entering the culinary world. My history degree became a hollow distraction from my true path. I got my real education in a random and incomplete way by reading cookbooks, exploring markets and delicatessens, and making extravagant meals.

**Extract from a novel**

The school's swimming instructor was a former drill sergeant, small and muscular, with tattooed arms. When I asked him to teach me how to dive, he told me to sit on the pool's edge, put my hands above my head, and roll forward, pushing myself off with my feet. I practiced that move until the hour was up. The next visit, he had me standing upright and diving off the edge. The instructor was strict, and every time I surfaced, he looked at me with disapproval: 'Don't look down, look up!' 'Keep your legs straight.' 'Point your toes, I said!' The next week, I went up onto the high board. It was a fixed board, and its front edge bent slightly downward. It seemed very high as I stood there, trying to gather my courage. Gradually, the echoing voices disappeared, and I felt as if I were wrapped in silence. I waved my arms vaguely as I'd been taught, tried to look up, not down, and launched myself into space. For a brief moment, I was flying. When I hit the water, I crumpled awkwardly, and my legs were all over the place. The instructor looked at me with contempt and shook his head. But even he could not lessen my joy. That's what they mean by 'free as a bird,' I thought.

**The Traveller**

For those of us who value a comfortable bed, running water, and the likelihood of living at least until tomorrow, the idea of the traveller seems both puzzling and fascinating. These are people who have given in to the dangerous allure of the unknown, who actually choose to risk their lives by climbing the steep and icy face of a mountain prone to avalanches; who sail alone in fragile boats through towering seas; who will eat maggots and river insects if nothing better is available and who can live, day and night for months, in the shadow and promise of the unknown. It is easy to dismiss such people as oddities - as indeed they are - to be placed among the truly eccentric: hermits, freefall divers, or even writers. Their existence cannot be denied, but the strange, uncomfortable world they inhabit lies far outside our everyday experience and can be dismissed, we tell ourselves, as irrelevant. We can shrug our shoulders and return thankfully to our world of microwave ovens and answering machines, glad that the only risks to our health are predictable ones, like making a dangerous dash across a city street.

**SAILING**

Jonathan Raban is afraid of the sea, saying it is not his natural environment, which is probably why he spends so much time on it. He does not claim to be a world-class sailor, though he is clearly a competent one. His main reason for sailing is that, being a writer, he likes to write about having sailed. Sailing is sure to provide exciting events and achievements for him to write about. Raban's small boat carries an electronic device that instantly gives sailors their position to within a few meters, anywhere on the earth's surface. Although he strongly approves of this instrument, there is more than a hint of old-fashioned thinking in Raban's attitude to other sea-faring aids. He believes the invention of the compass was a disaster, causing a 'fundamental rift in the relationship between man and sea.' Raban argues that since it came into use, perhaps a thousand years ago, it has become the main focus of the steersman's attention, with the result that he no longer has to study the waves and feel the sea. And the ocean, once a place with all sorts of things happening in it, is now reduced to just a space. Since his job is merely to keep steady on a course, the helmsman can be replaced for long periods by an autopilot. This may be why Raban had time to look so carefully at the waves."
CPE_62,"**Holiday Reading**

Summer gives us two great joys: leaving home and reading books. These joys are closely linked. Books help us feel more connected to the world. We can relate our experiences to those in books from long ago or faraway places because there are fewer human types than there are people. In books, we find our own thoughts and feelings. Authors can describe situations we thought were unique to us, or express our thoughts with clarity we can't achieve. What is unclear in us is clearly expressed in their words, especially if the book is from a different place or time. We feel thankful to these authors for helping us understand ourselves. Through reading and travel, we break free from routine. Our eyes are most open during our first days in a new place, or when reading a great book. Books help us notice things we ignored before. We become aware of the sky's colors, a friend's hypocrisy, or a hidden sadness we didn't know we had.

**Author's Note**

These travel reflections were published as articles in the Observer newspaper over seven years. I have restored some small cuts made by the editor, but added little else. I corrected a few mistakes, but only if they were important details. I could have made more changes, but that would never end. For example, in the second article about China, I thought the Hong Kong dollar would stay strong, but it fell a year later. If I changed the article to predict this, it would no longer be a report from that time. Like any traveler, I was there at that moment, unaware of the future, trying to understand what had already happened. This is the story of mass travel: the world opening up to people with no qualifications except the price of a ticket. But I believe my fellow travelers were not blind. Even a postcard can have a purpose.

**Ecotourism**

If there were awards for misused tourism phrases, 'ecotourism' would win. The term appeared in the early 1980s, reflecting a rise in environmental awareness. Tour operators realized travelers wanted to believe their trips wouldn't harm the environment. It became a popular marketing term. Now, 'ecotourism' includes anything from living with remote tribes for two weeks to a one-hour boat trip in Australia. Any tour involving culture, nature, wildlife, or adventure is labeled ecotourism. The original motives were good, helping people make informed choices. But without regulations or a clear definition, travelers are lost in an ecotourism jungle.

**Transylvanian Journey**

I lost my notebook from my Transylvanian journey for 50 years, but found it by luck. It helped me write about that time, but not as much as it should have. In Transylvania, I had an easier time than expected, staying in hospitable country houses for weeks. When I stopped moving, I stopped writing, thinking there was nothing to record. I was slow to start writing again, and sometimes only took notes instead of writing a full story. Worried that details might be out of order, I added many disclaimers. But then I realized this book wasn't a guidebook, so I let the story tell itself without too many warnings."
CPE_49,"**Fashion**

Fashion is often thought of as a modern idea, linked to the capitalism of the 19th and 20th centuries. However, many fashion historians argue that fashion, in terms of style and design, has a long history. They often start with the rise of markets and trade in the 16th and 17th centuries. As societies have become more complex, populations have grown, and new technologies for making different types of clothing and accessories have been discovered, the meanings of clothing have also become more complex. Today, it is hard to say exactly what any piece of clothing or accessory means. For example, a man's suit, which seems to be a symbol of uniformity, can have very different meanings in different situations and to different people.

**Writer**

Reports of publishers fighting over new manuscripts have given a false idea of what life is like for most novelists. For those of us not at the top of the best-seller lists, there are two ways to make a living. The smartest among us write in the evenings and have other full-time jobs that are secure even if the book doesn't become a hit. Others, like me, do various literary jobs, such as teaching, running workshops, and writing articles like this one. I've heard of a writing job at a chocolate factory, but I've never had such luck. Still, by juggling part-time jobs, using credit cards, and often relying on the generosity of people mentioned in Acknowledgements, the novel gets written.

**Sudden Fame**

The small venues we were playing at around the country were starting to sell out, and extra security was needed to manage the growing number of screaming fans. We had to use secret entrances to the places we performed to avoid being mobbed. On the few nights we weren't working, it was hard to leave the house without being chased by fans. In just a few days, we became celebrities. Our fans watched our every move, and our management and others took care of all our needs. Even though I was always shy, this was replaced by a strange over-confidence that only naturally shy people in similar situations can understand. In short, I was emotionally overwhelmed."
CPE_31,"**Music - The Challenge Ahead**

Technological advances are changing our lives at work, home, and during leisure. Susan Hallam talks about their impact on music in Britain. In the late 20th century, there were more ways to listen to music through radio, TV, records, tapes, CDs, videos, and new multimedia methods. However, live music performances and full-time jobs for musicians have decreased. It seems clear that access to music will keep growing because it meets many human needs. National events always include music, and for individuals, it offers many activities, both formal and informal. A society without music is hard to imagine. The question is not if there will be music in the 21st century, but what kind it will be and if people will still want to learn musical instruments.

I believe people will continue to learn instruments. The music industry is a big source of income in Britain, and musical skills will remain important for jobs, especially in media. Besides job opportunities, playing an instrument may help develop skills early on. Research in the USA suggests that listening to or making music can improve spatial reasoning, a part of intelligence. Although these results need more confirmation, studies in Europe show that group music lessons can improve social relationships in school and help young children and those with behavioral issues concentrate better. Further research is exploring if playing an instrument can help develop skills that can be used in other areas. For example, regular practice might help with good study habits and focus, and playing in concerts might teach punctuality and organization. For these reasons, there will likely be a demand for music lessons in the short term.

What about the long-term future? Will there be a change in focus, and if so, in what direction? I think two things are likely. First, the types of music people listen to will become more varied, with new genres mixing different styles. Second, technology will be used more in composing and performing music, making it easier for people to compose without needing technical skills. However, this might further reduce the need for live performances and musicians focused only on them. Alongside this trend, more people of all ages will want to participate in making music. These activities will likely be community-based and reflect local musical traditions.

To prepare for this future, the music profession needs to change. Instrumental teaching must adapt to allow more people to learn different instruments throughout their lives. This will affect the music curriculum and how progress is measured, requiring them to stay relevant for a wider audience and include more musical skills. Training musicians will be crucial. They need to motivate and teach learners of all ages, work with large and diverse groups, and develop communication, social, entrepreneurial, and management skills for community work. This is a big change from traditional methods and will require accountability. Positively, it offers a chance to show the high quality of music education available.

Finally, we need to raise the profile of music. Music is vital in our lives but often taken for granted. Everyone in the music profession should work together to change this."
CPE_58,"**The Actor's Craft**

Actors sometimes face criticism and mockery. This often happens when they talk about their work in interviews, as required by their film or theatre companies. They might benefit from the approach of dancer Pavlova, who, when asked to explain her dance, replied, ""If I could tell you, I wouldn't dance it."" Instead, actors often fall into using clichés or get caught up in gossip. Paul Scofield once wrote to a friend, saying that an actor's work is only alive and interesting when performed. Discussing it makes it seem empty and theoretical. Acting has no strict rules, except perhaps being heard clearly. With each new play, actors start fresh, learning and growing with the characters and the writer's insights. Once a play ends, actors feel empty until the next project. This emptiness is evident in any discussion about theatre work.

**A Review of Hamlet**

Adrian Lester's portrayal of Hamlet is a balance between youth and adulthood, marked by simplicity and confidence. His command of the text and his self-control elevate him to a top-level actor. Lester plays a tense young man, driven by a hidden anger, with a sharp wit and humor that make him both intimidating and endearing. His performance is subtly brilliant. Notice how his body language, like his stiff arms, suggests a character ready to come to life. Handy's portrayal of Horatio gives a similar impression of being moved by an inner force. This raises questions about acting and behavior: Is acting an imitation or a creation of real behavior? What drives these characters, both morally and physically? This is a key question in theatre.

**One Director's Approach to Rehearsal**

This director's rehearsal process begins with ""dropping in."" The stage manager projects the script onto a screen. Actors sit quietly, absorbing the words. When it's their turn, they look at the screen, understand the first phrase, think about its meaning, wait for the impulse to speak, and then speak. For example, with the line, ""Queuing all night, the rain, do you remember?"" actors breathe, let the thought sink in, and visualize a scene, like waiting in line for a concert. They find the impulse to speak, which the director calls ""The pathway to the line."" Impulses can come from outside or within. Actors should look into the eyes of their scene partner and consider their character's situation. The director encourages actors to approach with an open mind and trust that something will happen.

**The Perfect Theatre**

The perfect theatre should make you feel that your presence matters. Attending a live performance is an event, and the staff should recognize this. It's off-putting if the staff treats it as just another job. The theatre should create a connection between the performer and the audience. No audience member should feel they have a poor view of the actor. It's important that they are close enough to hear, see, and feel connected to the stage. The size and shape of the auditorium matter. It should complement the human voice and body. If the auditorium is too large, it can overshadow the actors. Many late nineteenth-century theatres got this right by designing spaces that embrace the stage. I prefer theatres with a sense of history, like worn steps in a church, which suggest layers of human presence. Regarding plays, you can't please everyone. You can't predict what the audience will want. When you go to the theatre, you want to see something unexpected, something you couldn't imagine at home."
CPE_37,"**Paul Simon and Rock and Roll**

In the 1950s, rock and roll was mainly popular among young people. However, its real importance was the big impact it had on middle-class and older people. It also set the stage for the next group of rock stars, who listened to it with amazement, knowing that this new, exciting music would be a big part of their lives. For Paul Simon and other young people in the US, the main way to hear this fresh and exciting music was through Alan Freed's radio show, Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party. Freed's show was a must-listen for many future rock stars. Like young John Lennon, who listened to Radio Luxembourg in Liverpool, Paul Simon was captivated by the music from Freed's show. He was ready to move from just listening to music to creating his own.

**Snow Adventure**

There was no clear path, but I thought I would be safe if I walked carefully. The wind was strong, pushing me as I slipped on the icy ground. Suddenly, the snow beneath me gave way. I fell into a hole about four feet deep. The snow had formed a thin layer over a gap between two rocks, which melted and left a fragile crust that I broke through. I pulled myself out, feeling shaken and worried, thinking about what I would have done if the hole had been much deeper. I leaned against a pine tree sticking out of the snow to assess my situation. In an hour, I had only covered about half a mile. It was clear I needed to change my plan.

**Understanding Qualitative Research**

There are many books now that try to guide researchers on qualitative research. While a lot is written about collecting data, these books often do not explain how to analyze the data. There is a lot of mystery around how researchers analyze their data. So, we asked different social scientists who have done qualitative research to talk about the methods they used. The goal was to share insights into the process of analyzing qualitative data, not to create a guidebook for new researchers. This involves making hidden processes more clear. While this might seem easy, we found it quite challenging. We allowed our contributors to present their work in different styles, including personal stories and more formal approaches."
CPE_2,"**Screen Learning**

A few days ago, I saw my six-year-old eating noodles in a funny way. He was pulling them up with his teeth and trying to look fierce. ""I'm a little dinosaur,"" he said. He was acting out a scene from a TV show, so I asked him what he remembered about dinosaurs. The answer was, not much. Many people are eager to use the internet and computers for learning, but is learning from a screen effective? One writer shared his experience with an interactive program he tried with his son. The father read the words carefully, while the son played with the pictures. ""If he had spent ten minutes with a book, he might have learned something,"" said the father. Television, as my son and his noodles show, is a medium that suggests ideas rather than teaches them directly. Research shows that learning happens best in an environment where there is dialogue with teachers or parents. It needs guidance. Using new technology to teach children is fine, but formal education still plays a big role.

**Hollywood**

By 1918, most of the world's film-making had moved to Hollywood. Locals didn't like it, seeing their area of Los Angeles changed by these newcomers. But eventually, they accepted it because of the success it brought. Success in Hollywood is measured by box-office earnings. Hollywood knows a good film when it sees one: it might make a star, but it must make money. In less than a century, Hollywood grew from a small village to a town as famous as New York, Rome, or Paris. Physically, it has changed a lot: a century ago, you would walk through orange groves to the village store. Yet, in some ways, it is still like a village - small-minded, with limited views - just a part of Los Angeles. For those who live and work there, the main topic is films: how much they have made, who is dating whom, who has been betrayed, who is working on which project. Successful people often try to leave: to work there, but live elsewhere. Yet it is still the place where almost everyone in show-business eventually goes.

**Photography**

Photography was created by nineteenth-century artists as a new art form. These artists wanted a lasting, accurate record of their surroundings, and they found it. The new combination of light, lens, shutter, and a surface with light-sensitive chemicals created images more lasting and detailed than paintings. This worried other artists; after their initial excitement, art critics claimed that photography was not art. They said photography was too tied to the real world and relied too much on machines to be considered a creative act. Despite the critics, photographers knew they had found a new art form. They used their tools like other artists use brushes and pencils - to interpret the world and show a vision of nature and people.

**Book Illustration**

During the black-and-white era of book illustration, it was common for every children's book to have illustrations. This included many novels for older readers, which later had fewer illustrations as print runs became shorter. Children's publishing was active, but often low-budget, leading to some routine and mediocre work. However, the best artists always did their best work. The black-and-white archive is a mix of junk and treasure, a great place for research or browsing. The real treasures are likely to be shown again, either through reissues of books or new publications about the artists. There are signs that interest in this period is returning, and publishers may see the potential for a series of classic children's book illustrations, either as reprints or new editions using the original artwork."
CPE_68,"**Blogging: Sharing with the World**

Some time ago, a website warned about the risks of public check-ins—telling everyone online where you are. The message was clear: you might think you're just saying, ""Hey, I'm here,"" but you're also letting everyone know you're not at home, including people you might not want to meet. This highlighted the potential downsides of sharing too much online. The internet offers many chances to share our lives with a global audience, promising things like wealth and fame. So, we dive into the online world, sharing confessions, photos, and stories. But soon, we realize it's a crowded and risky place, and we might get lost.

Feeling worried? Maybe, but don't lose hope. This future has a guide, created by early internet users. In the early days of the web, they explored these challenges. They lost jobs, made and lost friends, and dealt with the ups and downs of fame—long before social media existed. These early bloggers have already experienced what many of us are now facing. Before we forget their stories, it's worth learning from them. As the saying goes, those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.

In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started posting on the ""WWW,"" as it was called then. The web was mostly used by students, scientists, and a few curious teens like him. It was invented at CERN in Switzerland to help researchers share their work. But Hall saw it as a chance to share his life. He created a detailed online autobiography with words, photos, and art. In January 1996, he started a daily blog, and many people were drawn to his bold use of this new medium. Hall's approach was clear: if you crossed his path, you might appear on his site; no topic was off-limits. While it was the work of an exhibitionist, there was also a beauty to his project that some might call art.

One day, visitors to Hall's site found it replaced with a video titled ""Dark Night."" His story unfolded; he had fallen deeply in love, but when he wrote about it online, he was told, ""either the blog goes, or I do."" Sharing his life online made people not trust him, he argued. The blog ended, but the issue remains. Sharing online is great, but if you expect it to make people like you, you'll be disappointed.

In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a web worker in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job at a software company. One day, a colleague anonymously sent her blog's address to all the company's vice presidents, including those she had mocked, and she lost her job. Experts call this the ""online distribution effect"": the feeling that we can say things online that we wouldn't say in person. But our online and real lives are connected. Ignoring this can lead to serious mistakes.

Armstrong's story ended well. Though upset, she stopped blogging for a while, got married, and restarted her blog, focusing on her family. Now, she's a successful ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing supports her family. Once an example of online mistakes, she has become skilled at sharing wisely. Armstrong learned an important lesson: just because the web lets us say anything, doesn't mean we should."
CPE_23,"**Enough Sleep?**

Many people today feel tired all the time. In busy and wealthy countries, more people are experiencing sleeplessness and anxiety. In the USA, research shows that 40 million Americans have chronic sleep problems. In Britain, some popular novels feature characters who can't sleep or are set in sleep research labs. People are interested in sleep, its patterns, and sleep problems. A main concern is that people need more sleep. A leading sleep researcher says, ""People cut back on sleep when they're busy. They wake up early to avoid traffic.""

A sleep researcher conducted an experiment where he let people sleep up to 14 hours a night for a month. It took them three weeks to settle at about eight-and-a-quarter hours of sleep, showing they needed more sleep than they were getting.

In Europe, a university in the English Midlands has a sleep research lab. They study things like how tiredness affects sailors, how airport noise affects sleep, and the dangers of driving when tired. They find volunteers through student newspapers, pay them £5 an hour, and ask them to change their sleep patterns. Dr. Louise Reyner reassures participants who worry about electrodes on their heads, explaining that the lab is more interested in physical responses.

In a dark room, there is a motorway simulator. Participants come at 2 pm, after a short or no sleep, and are asked to drive while answering questions. The road seems endless, the sun is bright, and the air is warm. Many deny they will fall asleep, but Dr. Reyner has a video of one trying not to. At first, he sits upright, eyes fixed on the road. Then he starts blinking more and more, his head nodding. Each nod gets heavier, and the blinks turn into 10-second blackouts. He wakes up suddenly, but by then, the car has veered off the road. Coffee might help; two cups can make someone a safe driver for over half an hour, even with no sleep. Dr. Reyner suggests using tablets, energy drinks, and caffeinated gum, especially for shift workers.

What do we know for sure about sleep? Humans, like other mammals, sleep in a daily cycle. During sleep, they go through four stages, from light to deep sleep. Dreams usually happen in the lightest sleep, and the brain stops the body from moving to prevent injuries. Beyond this, there are theories. Some say sleep repairs the body, restores muscles, or rests the brain's creative part. But these might also happen when awake and relaxed, so no one is sure. Scientists agree that women sleep about half an hour longer than men and that older people need less sleep, but they don't know why.

When asked about the purpose of sleep, some researchers say, ""Sleep is a way to travel through time without getting hurt."" Sleep patterns may have been different in the past. A history professor found that between 1500 and 1850 in Britain, people had different sleep routines. They went to bed at nine or ten, woke up after midnight for an hour, and then had a ""morning sleep."" This time was used for thinking, remembering dreams, or even stealing. The poorest benefited most from this quiet time, free from daily work. By the 17th century, with more artificial light, the rich started sleeping in one long stretch, which is more efficient. The industrial revolution made most people work longer hours in lit buildings, changing sleep patterns for everyone except some rural people.

Outside Europe and America, the old sleep pattern was common until recently. In some non-western cultures, there are no strict bedtimes. People sleep for a few hours, then get up again. Continuous sleep is not the norm. In some tribal societies, noise, fire supervision, and predator watch make uninterrupted sleep impossible. It seems people everywhere need more sleep."
CPE_60,"**Simplified Text:**

I was wearing very expensive cowboy boots, each costing 800 dollars, standing on the rocks in the Arizona desert. I had the full cowboy outfit, but I knew I wasn't a real cowboy. I looked at the Arizona mountains and realized I didn't belong there. I had flown in from Denver early in the morning, thinking I might look like a cowboy. But when I saw a real cowboy at the Phoenix airport, I knew I didn't fit in. He was wearing a sweaty T-shirt, needed a shave, and was carrying a dirty bag. He looked at my new boots, raised an eyebrow, and walked away.

I used to be a racing driver, and I loved it. But I don't race anymore, and I don't know what to do now. I thought I could be a commentator for racing events, but there are already many former drivers doing that. I also tried to start a business selling classic cars, but it didn't work out because nobody was buying.

Being an ""ex"" anything is hard. People don't want to hear stories about almost being a champion. Even if I had been a champion, people would only listen for a short time. I don't want sympathy because I had a good career and made money. But I miss racing, the thrill of driving fast cars, and the excitement of being famous. Now, I have a lot of free time, and the phone rarely rings.

I looked at the sky and noticed some small birds in a cactus. They seemed to be telling me to leave. I realized I had a lot to learn about life outside of racing."
CPE_1,"**Vancouver**

In the past ten years, hundreds of thousands of people from around the world have moved to Vancouver, in western Canada. In the evenings, residents like to walk down the city streets, and if you join them, you will probably hear a different language every few steps. People come to Vancouver for its mild weather, beautiful location between the ocean and the mountains, clean and safe environment, and educational and job opportunities. Although some people complain about how quickly new buildings have appeared, it's clear that the new residents and growing tourism have helped the city improve. Locals used to call Vancouver 'Terminal City' because it was a gateway to other places. Even though the name is not used as much now, Vancouver is more of a gateway than ever.

**Putting Pen to Paper**

Journalists like me are usually not good at writing letters. Some say this is because we don't like writing something we won't get paid for, but I don't think we are that focused on money. It's more likely that because we always try to make a big impact in our work, we lose the natural flow of a letter. Real creative artists, who don't focus on the impact (even if they rewrite a passage many times), don't have this problem. I think the true test of a real artist is their natural understanding of the effect of their words. When Shakespeare wrote some of his famous lines, he probably didn't think about how the mix of long words made them powerful, but it showed he was a great writer.

**Supermarket Opening**

In the past, the opening of a new supermarket in Britain was a big event. You could expect a soap opera star, a radio DJ, or a minor royal to come and cut the ribbon. Now, new branches open so often that celebrities are no longer needed. Why pay a famous person when anyone can open it for free? Last week, waiting pensioners didn't care who opened the new Superbuy branch, as long as they were at the front. One customer, who knew someone working there, said the first five men would get a bottle of aftershave, and the first five women, a bunch of flowers. This information quickly spread through the crowd, making those at the front feel pleased and the latecomers envious."
CPE_53,"**Citizen Kane**

When the film *Citizen Kane* was finally released in 1941, it faced a lot of controversy. The release was delayed because distributors were worried about the reaction of William Randolph Hearst, who was thought to be the subject of the film. Despite receiving mostly positive reviews, the film was not a commercial hit. It was television that later brought it back to public attention. *Citizen Kane* is perhaps the most influential film, inspiring many to become filmmakers. This is even more impressive because it was Orson Welles's first film. Welles said its success came from not knowing what he could or couldn't do, so he just did what he wanted. He had a great team, including cameraman Gregg Toland, screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, and special-effects expert Linwood Dunn. When Welles and Mankiewicz decided to create a story about a newspaper magnate similar to Hearst, Welles saw it as a perfect opportunity for himself as both director and actor, and he took it with great enthusiasm.

**Dermot and Carmel**

Dermot noticed that Carmel seemed a bit strange that morning. He mentioned twice that he might be late and might stop by the golf club on his way home to chat with someone. Carmel nodded as if she hadn't really heard or understood. ""Will you be all right? What are you going to do today?"" he asked. She smiled and said, ""Funny you should ask that. I was just thinking I had nothing to do all day, so I was going to walk downtown and look at the shops. It feels almost sinful to just idle away the day."" Dermot smiled back. ""You're entitled to enjoy yourself. And as I said, if I'm late, I won't need anything to eat. So don't go to any trouble."" ""No, that's fine,"" she replied.

**Title Race**

Human nature can be quite amusing. A recent study showed that job titles are a major cause of envy and unrest at work. A survey by a top recruitment firm found that 90% of employers and 70% of employees agree that titles create divisions among colleagues. Surprisingly, the survey revealed that 70% of office workers would prefer a more 'motivational' or 'professional' job title over a pay raise. If our desire for impressive titles is so strong that it surpasses even basic greed, we are in a difficult situation. In today's world, no one wants to be seen as subordinate. The titles being discussed focus on skills (like specialist or coordinator) but are really just euphemisms."
CPE_55,"Text: 'The Vienna Assignment I was in Vienna to take photographs. That was usually why I was anywhere at that time. Photographs were more than just my job; they were a big part of my life. The way light fell on a surface always sparked my imagination. A single picture could capture the essence of a time, place, city, or person, and this idea was always in my mind. Any day, any second, I might take the perfect photograph. There was always a chance, as long as I had film in my camera. Finish one roll, load another, and keep looking with open eyes. That was my way of life. It had been for a long time. I almost succeeded once when a photo of a smoke plume from a burning oil well became popular worldwide. It was a brief moment of fame, just luck, really. But they say you make your own luck, both good and bad. I went freelance after that, which seemed like a smart move, but life outside photography took some wrong turns. The mid-nineties weren't as successful as I had hoped when my famous image appeared on the cover of Time magazine. That's why I was in Vienna, instead of somewhere more newsworthy. But I was still taking photographs and getting paid for it. It didn't seem bad to me. The assignment came by chance. I had done the London photos for a coffee-table book: Four Cities in Four Seasons - London, Paris, Rome, Vienna. It was a European project that paid me well to capture my home city in spring, summer, autumn, and winter. I added my own style to daffodils in Hyde Park and the heat haze in Piccadilly. I accepted that the best of my work might be ignored. It was just a picture book, not meant to challenge anyone's views or make them see instead of just look. After a cold snap over Christmas and New Year, I handed in my London-in-winter photos and learned that the Austrian photographer, Rudi Schussner, had left the Vienna job for reasons I didn't need to know. Instead of hiring someone new, they offered me the job. The Austrian publishers liked my work, and I was available, unlike the French and Italian photographers. I was happy to go. Things at home weren't great. A week in snowy Vienna didn't need to be a compliment to my skills for me to accept quickly. They put me up at the Europa, in the heart of the old city. I had last been to Vienna for a weekend with my wife: a busy tour of palaces and museums. It was hot, hectic, and not very memorable. I hadn't taken many photos. Alone, in a cold January, it was going to be different. I knew that as soon as I got off the shuttle bus from the airport and saw the pinky-grey light over the snow-covered roofs. I was going to enjoy myself and take great pictures. The first day, I didn't even try. I rode the trams around the Ringstrasse, getting on and off to feel the city's moods. The weather was set, frozen like the grand baroque buildings of the old empire. I hadn't seen what Schussner had done with the other seasons. I didn't want to. This was going to be my Vienna, not his. And it was going to reveal itself to me. I just had to wait. A photograph is a moment. But you have to wait for the moment to come. So I waited and looked until I could see clearly. Then I was ready. The next morning, I was out at dawn. Snow overnight meant Stephansplatz would be pure white and almost empty. I hadn't figured out how to capture the cathedral in one shot. Its spire stretched like a giraffe's neck into the sky, but at ground level, it was massive, sitting heavily in the city center. Probably there was no way to do it. I'd have to settle for something partial. In that weather, at that time, it could still be magical. But then, there's always been something magical about photography. It seemed that way to the nineteenth-century pioneers before the chemistry was understood. Pictures develop and hold by their own magic. You can watch a blank sheet of paper become a photograph in a dark room. Even when you know why it happens, the mystery remains. That stays with you forever. Perhaps that's why what happened at Stephansplatz that morning didn't really surprise me.'"
CPE_50,"**Kinetic Art Rejoice**

Something amazing has happened: London's serious Hayward Gallery has become a place of wonder. This change wasn't due to a big-budget, flashy show, but rather a unique look into a nearly forgotten part of the last 60 years. A new exhibition explores the history of kinetic art, which is art focused on movement, in the twentieth century. It shows that creating artworks that move by themselves or explore movement has been an ongoing, though often unnoticed, theme in some of the most interesting creative work of this century. The exhibition, curated by Guy Brett, who has studied this subject for a long time, includes a wide range of paintings, drawings, documents, and films on kinetic art. These are presented with little text, allowing visitors to enjoy making their own connections and discoveries.

**David Hockney**

Hockney's art attracts many people who might not usually be interested in art. This could be because his work is figurative and easy to understand, or because it offers an escape from everyday life. Some people might be more interested in Hockney's charming personality and witty comments, which make him popular in the media. Some critics think Hockney is just an overrated minor artist. However, one could argue that he seems minor because being popular is not always accepted today, not because his work lacks depth. Hockney himself knows his limits and believes it's irrelevant to dismiss his work because it doesn't fit an abstract idea of greatness. He doesn't claim to be a great artist and knows that only the future can truly judge his importance.

**Window-shopping - an art exhibition**

In recent years, I've seen many contemporary art exhibitions, some brilliant and some mediocre. What bothers me are shows that push a hidden agenda, suggesting a common attitude among certain artists. Sometimes this works, revealing new trends in seemingly unrelated work. But often, it feels like a forced concept. As a curator, I wanted to create a show that was the opposite of this. With seven artists, I took over a space in an empty warehouse. 'Window-shopping' was meant to be a collection of individual artworks connected only by the fact that they claimed to be art. Sam Cole's knitted cats chased each other on a toy train track, while Matthew Crawley's video camera experiment flickered and disappeared on a monitor. These works didn't fit into a themed exhibition, but why not? They didn't interfere with each other and, through their contrast, added something to each other. I haven't made any big statements about contemporary art, but maybe there aren't any to make about an activity where artists set their own rules.

**Art History**

People who enjoy paintings sometimes hesitate to analyze them, fearing it might spoil their experience. Some say that art historians, who focus on theory, ignore the pleasure of looking and the act of creativity. This idea is like thinking that knowing a recipe's ingredients and cooking method takes away from the taste of a dish. Enjoying something doesn't mean we can't also understand it deeply. In fact, knowing more about what we are viewing might increase our pleasure. Moreover, pleasure is complex. How we experience it can be questioned and is influenced by history. Our preferences are shaped not just by our genes or personalities but by societal values. While no one wants to downplay the importance of instinctive responses to art, the idea that intellectual understanding undermines sensory enjoyment is an outdated belief."
CPE_25,"**Metals**

Stone Age people might have become interested in metals because they wanted to decorate themselves. Imagine sitting by a river, waiting for a fish or just relaxing, when one of our early ancestors found a shiny yellow pebble and picked it up. It didn't feel like a stone, but it was attractive. This is how gold might have become part of their lives. Gold is easy to shape, so it quickly became a popular material. Copper might have been discovered by accident too. Once people realized how useful copper tools were, they eagerly searched for copper ores and ways to extract the metal. This is how metalworking became one of the skills that improved their lives.

**St Ives**

We were silent as we carried our bags down the winding, cobbled lane leading to the town center, struggling against the strong wind and trying to avoid the icy waves crashing over the promenade. The streets were empty, and the shutters on every waterfront cottage were tightly closed against the storm. We had watched the weather get worse as we arrived in St Ives on the small single-track railway. As the dark grey skies closed in, visiting Cornwall in the off-season without a car no longer seemed like a good idea. I had convinced my friend to join me with promises of walks along the beautiful Cornish coast and cozy evenings by open fires.

**Computer Modelling**

The challenge with studying the past is that it is gone. The people who lived through peaceful times and hard times are long dead. The reasons they settled in certain places or moved elsewhere, and how they formed families, villages, and cities, are forgotten. Archaeology gives us some clues, but we can't test our ideas with experiments on past cultures. We can't watch a replay of history. However, maybe we can. Computer modelling lets us recreate ancient landscapes and environments and fill them with virtual communities. These digital creations have some of the needs and abilities of real humans. We can set rules for behavior and create social groups. Then we can change conditions, like reducing rainfall or increasing population, and see how this digital society reacts."
CPE_34,"**Vervet Monkeys**

Cheney and Seyfarth describe a day when the dominant male vervet monkey in their study group noticed a strange male nearby. This stranger wanted to join the group, which could mean the dominant male might lose his position. To prevent this, the dominant male used a clever trick. Whenever the stranger tried to approach, he gave an alarm call that vervets use to warn of a leopard. This scared the stranger back into the trees. This tactic worked until the dominant male made a mistake: he gave the alarm call while casually walking across open ground himself.

**What Cats Catch**

In a survey in the English village of Felmersham, residents collected prey caught by their cats. Over a year, seventy cats caught over 1,000 prey items. An American professor estimated that, based on these figures, cats in Britain might be killing 100 million birds and small mammals each year. However, this calculation is not accurate because most cats live in towns and catch less prey than rural cats. The important question is whether these numbers are sustainable. The answer seems to be yes, as many people feed birds in winter, and gardens provide nesting sites, keeping bird populations above natural levels. The survey showed that cats are significant predators but not devastating to Britain's bird population.

**Buffalo's Day**

Buffaloes are very important to marsh people and are well cared for. Each morning, the buffaloes, who sleep near their owners, slowly move to the reed beds beyond the open water. They stand on the edge, groaning about the day's work, until the leader finally steps into the water. Once in the water, they seem to forget their purpose and wallow for a while. Eventually, they swim away, appearing almost submerged, with only their noses above water. They spend the day among the reeds, grazing on green shoots at eye level.

**PICASSO, Pablo - The Soles, 1940**

In early 1940, while staying in the fishing port of Royan, Picasso painted several fish still lifes. One painting shows a fishmonger's slab with a crab and a pair of scales holding two or three soles. Despite their situation, the sea creatures appear alive. The painting is complex, with overlapping and interlocking transparent planes. The thin, delicately brushed paint and cool colors create a calm, underwater world. However, this calm is disturbed by an impending battle between the fish and the crab. The sharp forms of the fish and crab, along with the scales, suggest a sense of menace and hidden violence, giving the painting a symbolic edge."
CPE_12,"Photography

Over the last 150 years, photography has been used to capture all parts of human life and activity. In this short history, photography has grown in its ability to capture time and space, allowing us to see brief moments and visualize both large and small things. It has shown us images from faraway places on Earth, distant parts of the solar system, and the social issues of modern life. Photography has become one of the most important ways to express the human experience.

However, using images to record events has a much longer history. The earliest examples of pictorial recording date back to the Upper Palaeolithic period, about 35,000 years ago. We are not sure why early cave paintings were made—whether they recorded real hunting events, served as magic to increase animals for hunting, acted as religious symbols, or simply decorated living spaces. But images seem to be deeply connected to human culture.

Throughout history, people have questioned how accurate visual images are and their role in society. The idea that ""seeing is believing"" has always given special importance to images. When photography was invented in the mid-19th century, it promised to provide a truthful visual record automatically. The camera, working like the human eye, was seen as a machine that could capture a fixed image, very close to what we actually see. This chemical fixing of the image was considered a natural phenomenon.

Because of the camera's perceived realism, it was thought that everyone could understand photographs, leading to the idea of photography as a ""universal language."" For example, in 1933, photographer August Sander said that even the most isolated people could understand a photograph of the sky. However, with the rise of global communications in the late 20th century, we need to ask if photography can truly cross cultural differences. Is photography as tied to cultural norms as language is?

Photography is often seen as providing clear evidence, making it seem transparent and blurring the line between our perception of the world and its photographic representations. It is common for someone to show a photograph and say, ""this is my grandson."" Since its invention in 1839, photography and attitudes towards it have changed greatly. Photography has moved from being a simple record-keeper to becoming historical documents that reveal much about the people and society that created them.

I aim to show that the camera is not just a silent recorder of events and that photography does not just reflect culture. It can also inspire social and political change. For example, the cultural changes of the Italian Renaissance were influenced by new visual representation methods. Similarly, photography has played a major role in creating the media culture of today, while also showing the harsh realities of the world."
CPE_26,"**How to Write Poetry**

Teaching someone how to write poetry is like walking through a minefield: you need to be spontaneous, but one wrong move and your certainties can explode. Claiming to know everything is risky, so I suggest that for beginners, no advice can replace reading a lot, writing often, and freeing your imagination and spirit in a productive way, without causing chaos. Some people need a stable life to write a poem; others can write even when they are unhappy. Some follow a schedule; others wait for inspiration. All methods are valid, as long as they are not just copying a set formula. The key is to find your own voice, listen to it, nurture it, and let it grow until it can stand on its own.

**The Short Story**

In a short story, there is no space for too many characters, long narratives, or lengthy flashbacks. Flashbacks should be brief and only used if necessary to clarify an issue. A good way to do this is through a quick memory in the main character's mind, which can help move the story forward. Dialogue is more useful than many new writers realize. Two characters talking can show two sides of a question faster than explaining it from one person's view. It also keeps the story concise and interesting. Overwriting can ruin a short story, but brevity should not make it feel like a summary. Conflict and action must be strong, and every word should matter in a small space.

**Screenplays**

If you know how to play chess, you can understand how to write a screenplay. Most chess players make moves without knowing what will happen next. We might see one or two moves ahead, which feels like an achievement. As we learn more, we realize chess is about long-term strategy, not just short-term tactics. We start to see the whole game, not just individual moves, and patterns emerge, like openings and end games. In chess and screenplay writing, the more you practice, the more you understand its complexities.

**Looking at Writing**

Charles Darwin noted that humans naturally speak, as seen in children's babbling, but no child naturally writes. Language exists in all societies, past and present. Languages change but do not become better: English is not more complex than ancient languages. All healthy children learn their language without formal lessons. When children lack a common language, they create one. Writing, however, has been invented only a few times in history, in complex societies, and has slowly improved over time. Until recently, most children did not learn to read or write; even today, many struggle. A group of children is unlikely to invent an alphabet. Children are naturally inclined to speak, but reading and writing are skills that must be taught. We need to understand how writing works, how children's minds work, and how to connect the two."
CPE_8,"I have never started a novel with more doubt. I call it a novel only because I don't know what else to call it. I have little story to tell and I don't end with a death or a marriage. Instead, I leave my reader uncertain. This book is about my memories of a man I met only occasionally, and I know little about what happened to him in between. I could invent details to fill the gaps and make my story more complete, but I don't want to do that. I only want to share what I know. To protect the privacy of people still alive, I have given them made-up names and taken care to ensure no one can recognize them. The man I am writing about is not famous. He might never be. When his life ends, he might leave no more trace than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the water's surface. Then my book, if read at all, will be read only for its own interest. But maybe his chosen way of life and his unique character will influence others, so that, long after his death, people might realize he was a remarkable person. Then it will be clear who I am writing about, and those who want to know about his early life might find something useful in my book. I think my book, despite its limits, will be a helpful source for my friend's biographers. I don't claim that the conversations I recorded are exact. I never took notes, but I have a good memory for what matters to me, and though I have put these conversations in my own words, they truly represent what was said. I mentioned earlier that I have invented nothing, but I have taken the freedom that historians take to put words into the mouths of people in my story that I did not hear myself. I did this to make the scenes more lively and realistic. I want to be read, and I think I am right to make my book engaging. The smart reader will easily see where I have used this technique, and he is free to ignore it. Another reason I started this work with worry is that the people I write about are from another culture. It is very hard to know people, and I don't think you can really know anyone but your own countrymen. People are not only themselves; they are also the place they were born, the home they grew up in, the games they played, the food they ate, the schools they went to, the sports they played, and the poets they read. These things make them who they are, and you can't know them just by hearing about them; you can only know them if you have lived them. You can only know if you are them. And because you can't truly know people from another country except by observing them, it is hard to make them believable in a book. I have never tried to write about anyone but my own countrymen, and if I have done so in short stories, it is because you can describe characters more briefly in them. You give the reader broad hints and let him fill in the details. In this book, I don't claim that my characters are as they see themselves; they are seen, like my main character, through my own eyes."
CPE_4,"**POETRY RECITALS**

Throughout history, the world of literature often seems confusing to those experiencing it. It is only later that we can see clear patterns and recognize important figures. Today, poetry is especially complex, with many different styles and opinions about how poetry should be presented, criticized, and taught. There is a general debate between two groups: 'literary' poets, who write poems to be read on the page, and 'popular' poets, who prefer performing their poems to an audience. This division is not strict, and public poetry readings have become more common over the past twenty years. These events happen in various places, like small town halls, schools, colleges, and arts festivals.

For 'pop' poets, who write their work to be performed, public readings are beneficial. Their poems are often simple and easy to understand in one hearing, but may seem less impressive when read on the page. On the other hand, poets who focus on crafting their work with deep thought and complex rhythms might not be fully appreciated by an audience hearing their poems for the first time. The risk is that these poets might choose to read only their simpler works to connect quickly with the audience, which might not represent their best work.

Listening to poetry readings cannot replace reading poetry on the page, but it can be a fun and educational experience. Hearing poets read their work can help listeners understand the emphasis and rhythm intended by the poet. It is helpful if the audience can follow along with the text or is already familiar with the poems. The main reason for popular poetry recitals, sometimes mixed with music, is to make poetry enjoyable and accessible to everyone, not just a select few."
CPE_30,"**Oral History**

Historians are increasingly using oral evidence, but this method has challenges. It's unrealistic to think that someone's story is a perfect reflection of the past. During an interview, both the historian and the person being interviewed influence each other. The historian chooses who to interview and what topics to cover. Even if the historian just listens, their presence can change how the person remembers and talks about the past. The final account is shaped by the historian's social position and their way of understanding history, which can affect the informant. Historians must acknowledge their role in creating new evidence. However, the challenges don't end when the historian leaves. The informant's memories might be influenced by other sources, like the media, or by nostalgia and later life experiences. Emotions and attitudes can make a story convincing, but they might not be from the time being discussed.

**Animal Science**

There are two main ways to study animal science: focusing on physiology or on the whole animal. Physiologists study how the body works, like how nerves and muscles create behavior. Those who study the whole animal look at the behavior of the entire animal and what affects it. Within this approach, psychologists and ethologists are different. Psychologists usually work in labs with animals like rats and pigeons to study learning. Ethologists study natural behaviors in animals, often in the wild. Although these fields are merging, physiologists often claim their methods are more basic. However, understanding nerve cells alone isn't enough; we also need to study behavior as a whole. Describing a bird's nest-building by nerve cells is like trying to read a book with a microscope.

**The Social Sciences**

New social science students face a challenge: they must learn both the content and the methods of their subject. They need to understand the knowledge in textbooks and how this knowledge is gathered and organized. These two parts are closely linked. Since we all experience social life, social sciences might seem like common sense. But textbooks show that each social science goes beyond common sense. Each focuses on a specific part of social life, uses specific methods, and has its own concepts. These concepts form the 'logical basis' of the subject, helping social scientists go beyond everyday understanding and distinguishing each discipline.

**Classical Architecture**

In Ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was more than just building structures. The Roman architect Vitruvius said architecture involves order, arrangement, proportion, symmetry, propriety, and distribution. He used Greek terms for some of these, likely from an earlier Greek source. Utility and function aren't part of his definition, though he later discusses the best designs for different purposes. Initially, the focus is on aesthetics, viewing architecture as an art. Classical architecture has complex origins. There was a long history of simple constructions in Greece and Italy that didn't meet Vitruvius' artistic standards. These basic forms contributed to later sophisticated designs. Despite its elaborate appearance, a classical temple is essentially a simple, single-roomed structure."
CPE_7,"The two sisters kept Lily's driving a secret from Chen for a while. Lily would drive around the allotments, the railway line, and the gasworks, even jumping a small bridge with all four wheels off the ground, which was her only mistake. She would finish her drive near the gasworks, surrounded by the smell of sulphur. Surprisingly, Chen found out and was amused by his wife's secret driving. ""So you can really drive, Lily? Well done!"" he said. Mui thought men were strange; Chen should have been upset, but instead, he was excited and started planning a trip with Lily. They decided on a Monday at the start of next month, the quietest day of the week, to leave early and return by midday, so they wouldn't lose any customers. Meanwhile, Lily would practice driving around the allotments. Mui, despite her doubts, bought a road map and got a ten percent discount, which impressed Chen. Lily, however, felt a bit insulted by Mui's lack of trust in her navigation skills.

Within an hour of leaving home, they were looking at the English Channel. Lily drove perfectly. Even Mui, sitting in the back ready to give directions, had to admit this. On the road, Lily overtook a few slow vehicles with great skill, and Mui kept quiet about her concerns. Chen even applauded. After passing through the gasworks of a seaside town, they drove along the empty promenade. Lily parked in a small street with many empty parking spaces. She wasn't sure about the road markings and preferred to pay a fee rather than risk being towed or fined. Maybe this caution would reassure Mui. On the way, Lily noticed her sister's tense face in the mirror, which she used often. It might be best not to mention worries that Mui hadn't thought of. Lily locked all the van doors and checked each one. ""Don't worry,"" Chen joked. ""No one will want that old van."" The sisters were annoyed. Lily accused Chen of being ungrateful, and Mui scolded him for being too easily fooled by appearances. Surprised, Chen took Man Kee ahead to look at the sea. He sat his son on the railing and held him. Man Kee was a warm, responsive child. He put his small hand on his father's sleeve. In that moment, Chen decided to raise his son his way. Man Kee would learn about business and own many restaurants. The sight of the sea made Chen feel thoughtful as he planned his son's future. He saw a ship on the horizon and used a telescope to look at it. At first, he couldn't find it, but then he saw it: a small, rusty tramp steamer. He lifted Man Kee to the eyepiece. ""Do you see the ship, Son?"" he asked. ""It's a special ship for us. It's small and old, but we know it's the ship that will take us home when we're done here. It will take you to your homeland, which you've never seen."" Chen kissed Man Kee's head. Lily and Mui joined them. Lily put her arm around Chen. ""The little old ship,"" Chen said. ""Let your mother see, Son."" Man Kee didn't want to let go of the telescope, and when he finally did, the view was gone. By the time Chen found another coin, the ship had disappeared over the horizon, and Lily only saw seagulls in the ship's wake."
CPE_43,"**THE WELL**

I had read somewhere that if you looked up from a deep hole, you could see the stars during the day. I convinced you to help me test this idea. You watched as I pulled up the well bucket, steadied it on the wall, and climbed in. I asked you to lower me down. I didn't think about how much heavier the bucket would be with me in it, or that you might not be strong enough to hold it. You tried to hold the handle as I pushed the bucket off the well's edge, but I fell immediately. You screamed and tried to stop the handle, but then you let go. I fell into the well and hit my head. At that moment, I didn't realize I had sort of succeeded in my plan. I saw strange lights, like the stars and planets you see in cartoons when a character gets hit. At first, I was dazed, then scared, then relieved, and finally angry at you for letting me fall and worried about what Mother would say. You called down to ask if I was okay. I was about to shout back when you called again, sounding more panicked, which stopped me. I lay still, watching you through my eyelashes. You ran off to get help. I quickly climbed out of the well and hid in the shadows near the moat bridge. I could hear worried voices from the castle. Mother and Father came out with you and old Arthur. Mother was shouting, and Father told Arthur to use the winch. You looked pale and shocked. I felt a mix of excitement and fear. Then I noticed the trail of water drops I had left from the well to where I was hiding. I was horrified that no one had seen them. Father was shining a flashlight into the well. The drops shone in the sunlight. I couldn't believe no one noticed them. Mother was screaming, a sound I had never heard before. It shook me deeply. What should I do? I had gotten back at you, but now things were more serious than I expected. It had gone from a clever idea to a big problem that wouldn't go away without someone, probably me, getting in trouble. I regretted not thinking it through. From a plan to a disaster in minutes. Then I had an idea. I gathered my courage and came out of hiding, pretending to be weak and dizzy. I cried out softly, then louder when no one heard me. I stumbled and fell dramatically on the cobbles. Sitting up, comforted by my crying mother, I pretended to be relieved and said I found a secret tunnel from the well to the moat. I claimed I crawled and swam through it to escape. I think they almost believed me until Father asked me to repeat the story. I hesitated, and his eyes narrowed. Trying to cover up, I said the tunnel collapsed after me, so there was no point in checking it. I said the well was dangerous and I barely escaped. Looking into my father's eyes, it felt like looking into a dark tunnel with no stars. It was like he saw me for the first time, and I saw how my story looked to an adult. My words stopped. ""Don't be ridiculous, boy,"" he said, with more contempt than I thought possible. He walked away. Arthur looked at me, regretful and troubled, shaking his head. Not because I had a scary adventure and wasn't believed, but because he saw through my lie and worried about my character. His pity was as harsh as my father's words, confirming their judgment of my actions. It affected me deeply."
CPE_51,"**REMOVAL DAY**

Susan, a widow, is moving out of her family home now that her children are grown. The moving van had ""Removers of Distinction"" written on it, and Susan noticed that everything special about the house was being packed away. Fred, the removal man, was carefully wrapping fragile items, while his team was less gentle. The house was beautiful, with four floors and a view of a small harbour. Susan remembered the years spent there with her children, Robert and Francesca, who were now adults and helping with the move.

Robert was making sure Susan didn't mention the piano, while Francesca insisted on handling it herself, as she was the only one she trusted with their precious Steinway piano. Fred, the removal man, commented that Susan didn't seem like she was going to cry, which surprised her. Fred explained that many people cry when they see their home being taken apart, but they feel better once they reach the new place.

Susan remembered when they first moved in. The piano was the first thing brought in, but it got stuck on the stairs. Her late husband, Peter, solved the problem by hiring a builder to remove a window and using a crane to lift the piano inside. This process was expensive, and they couldn't afford to tune the piano for months. Peter had said the piano would stay there forever, but now it was time to move.

Susan was worried about the piano getting stuck again, but it was too late to warn the movers. As the piano was carefully carried down the stairs and out the door, Susan, Robert, and Francesca were relieved and started laughing. They laughed so much that they cried tears of joy, not sadness, as they left the house for the last time."
CPE_11,"**Online Literary Criticism for Everyone**

Is do-it-yourself literary criticism just harmless fun? From the beginning, the idea of open access to the Internet was a key principle. In theory, anyone could publish or share content online. In practice, some technical skills were needed, especially in the early days. However, one area that truly opened up to everyone was literary criticism. By visiting Amazon.com, the first popular online bookstore, anyone could write book reviews. Amazon's approach allowed anyone to share their opinion on a book and rate it up to five stars. This seemed like a great idea because it provided free reviews for Amazon and gave potential buyers insights from other readers, not just publishers or professional critics. Other online bookstores also offered similar features, but Amazon, with over 80% of the online market, attracted the most reviews and, therefore, the most issues.

This open review system led to some problems. Thousands of reviews were submitted daily, making it impossible to check them all. Amazon had a team of editors to ensure reviews followed guidelines. Reviews with just one word, personal attacks, obscenities, spoilers, or references to other reviews were not allowed. However, reviewers were anonymous, and inappropriate reviews were only removed if noticed by Amazon's team. This allowed for some mischief. For example, authors could give their own books positive reviews. Lev Grossman, an author, was upset by negative reviews of his first novel and wrote several positive ones himself. His trick worked until he revealed it in an article, and the fake reviews were removed.

Authors could also comment on their books through a special link. Most authors used this to encourage readers to buy and enjoy their books. Some even shared their email addresses for direct communication. However, Amazon did not verify if the comments truly came from the authors, except for famous ones. A lesser-known writer once pretended to be John Updike, calling himself 'talented but over-hyped,' but this was quickly removed as a fake.

The real drama came from reader reviews. When James McElroy's book ""We've Got Spirit"" was published, it was praised by the mainstream press. However, people mentioned in the book felt betrayed and used Amazon's page to express their anger. Many critical reviews appeared but disappeared after a few days. Despite such incidents, Amazon saw the high number of reviews as good for business. Reviews were meant to be a 'forum to talk about a book,' not a chat room, so bestselling books were closely monitored to ensure reviews followed the rules. This meant that silly reviews were more likely to be found on less popular books. For example, ""The Story about Ping,"" a children's book about a duck, inspired humorous reviews because 'ping' is also a term used in Internet technology. One review humorously compared the book's plot to Internet architecture.

Despite some silliness, most reviews on Amazon were serious. They provided a surprisingly accurate indication of whether a book was worth buying. The writer George Orwell once said that reviewing too many books meant inventing reactions to books one didn't care about. This makes the democratization of the review process seem like a positive development."
CPE_14,"**Art in Modern Times**

In the last two hundred years, people have started to think that every artist must rebel against the art of their time. Art is often praised for being unique, revolutionary, or even shocking. We admire artists whose work was not appreciated a hundred years ago. However, when it comes to contemporary art, we often hesitate and say that an artist has gone too far, claiming that what they do is no longer art. The media often express these thoughts for us, and we tend to agree because we expect art to be puzzling and new. This expectation is so strong that we overlook the old themes, methods, and virtues present in modern art. We want artists to be different from the rest of us, with special talents and energy that cannot be contained by conventions. In the past, people would commission art for specific purposes, making it a part of everyday life. Today, we leave artists to their own devices and get annoyed if they try to be more relatable.

**Picture This**

I will describe a situation and then ask an important question about it. I hope it doesn't seem too mysterious. But if it does, that's modern art for you. Here's the situation: An artist chooses a piece of text from an art book. The text talks about the variety of pictures, asking, ""What are they all about?"" and then concludes, ""There is no end to the number of different kinds of pictures."" This might sound childish, but stay with me. The situation gets more complex. The artist asks someone to make a canvas, stretch it, and prime it. Then, he takes it to a sign painter and asks them to write the chosen text on the canvas. He instructs the sign painter not to make the lettering flashy or charming. The sign painter follows these instructions. On a white canvas, in simple black letters, he writes the text. So, my important question is: Is the finished product a painting?

**Underground Encounters**

At the Mercury Gallery, London until 26th June

It is often believed that for commercial success, a painter should stick to one profitable style. Collectors expect artists to continue in the same direction, and trying something new is often met with disappointment. Gallery owners prefer safe choices, and the art-buying public may feel insecure and need consistency. Some artists break this pattern and succeed, like Picasso and Hockney. Eric Rimmington is another artist trying something new, and it remains to be seen if he will succeed. His new show moves away from the still lifes he is known for to paintings of the London Underground. Railways have always fascinated Rimmington. From his drawings in the 1980s of the railway land at London's Kings Cross Station, it was a natural step to explore the underground world. These sketches have inspired ""Underground Encounters,"" an exhibition of 40 paintings and drawings that capture the unique magic of this underground world designed for people on the move.

**Extract from a Novel**

I have come to this island with a few books. I am not sure why I use the word 'escape.' The villagers jokingly say that only a sick person would choose such a remote place to rebuild. So, I have come here to heal myself, if you want to put it that way. Apart from the old peasant woman who comes from the village on her mule each day to clean the house, I am completely alone. I am neither happy nor unhappy; I feel like I am floating in the cloudy mixtures of memory. I spoke about the uselessness of art but did not mention its comforts. The comfort of the work I do with my mind and heart lies in this: only in the silence of the painter or writer can reality be reorganized, reworked, and shown in its true form. Our everyday actions are like a rough covering that hides the beautiful pattern beneath. For us artists, there is a joyful compromise through art with everything that hurt or defeated us in daily life. This way, we do not avoid destiny, as ordinary people try to do, but fulfill it in its true potential—the imagination. Otherwise, why should we hurt one another?"
CPE_63,"**Family Business**

""Look here, it's no good!"" said my Dad. We were driving back to London. My father, with my brother Maurice, had just picked me up from the fancy girls' school I attended. He had also just sat through Parent's Day, where I received the Latin prize and the prize for doing best in my final exams. He had a long talk with my headteacher, and now we were heading home for the holidays.

""What isn't?"" I asked, though I had guessed what he was thinking from his unusual silence. He was usually a talkative man. ""You can't fool me. You'll do what you want now,"" he said. ""With all those certificates, I was told you will get a scholarship to Oxford.""

""So?"" I said, trying to be bold. ""Mightn't that be useful?""

""I also hear,"" he continued, and I knew a confrontation was coming, ""that you want to be a barrister. A barrister of all things!"" My father knew a lot about barristers and the law.

""I just said that,"" I replied. ""I couldn't think of anything else to say!""

""And apparently,"" he went on, ""you have the right personality - you can quickly understand a lot of information, you can talk well, and you enjoy performing.""

""I don't know about that,"" I said. ""All I know is what I see in TV dramas.""

""Be that as it may,"" he continued, ""I feel your heart's never going to be in the business now. Obviously, you'll go to Oxford University, and after that, I can't see you wanting it.""

The problem was that, like many children of family businesses, I felt trapped by family expectations. I could see different careers open to me, and I wanted to explore them. At the same time, I didn't want to upset my father. I wasn't as scared of him as Maurice was - I was the favorite - but I found him intimidating.

""It's too soon to know,"" I said weakly.

""I tell you you're not going to want to join us,"" said my father, who was often right about such things, ""and it's a pity because you've got the gifts - the brains, the nerves, the vision.""

""There's still Maurice,"" I said, sulking. My father snorted. We both knew Maurice hated the business.

""Anyway,"" I continued, ""you could always use me as a sort of consultant.""

My mother wasn't around to help - she had died early in my childhood, and my father had raised me and Maurice. Maurice was two years younger than me, and because he was motherless, I got into the habit of taking care of him. It wasn't a hardship. I loved Maurice. Because the business was successful, we lived in luxury - a big house in London, posh schools, nice clothes, parties, theatres, operas. My father knew all kinds of people - politicians, actors, businessmen - and our house was full of interesting conversations.

""I tell you what,"" my father continued. ""You can help us out during holidays until you leave Oxford, and then if you decide to leave us, you can. It will give you some pocket money and be a real help to me.""

""OK,"" I said, relieved to avoid immediate decisions and especially the depression and sulks my father would fall into if I opposed him. This was how he controlled us.

So it happened. In my last term at school, and then during university vacations, I helped out, never more than twice a year, and always on the safer tasks. I became one of the smarter students, with a little house of my own, a small but powerful white car, designer clothes, and a black dress with a Paris label that I planned to wear for my final exams.

In my last term, my father came to see me and took me to a village for a meal and a chat. There were only a few weeks to go. My tutor predicted I would get a First Class degree (in Law), and I knew that if I stayed focused, he might be right. I felt confident and concentrated.

This was not to be. My father told me that, in about a week, he needed me to do one last task for him, that it was the most important business the family firm had ever attempted, and that he would make it worth my while.

""But Dad,"" I protested, ""I've got my final exams coming up, and I just need to concentrate on that. It's really important that I do well, and I don't want to think about anything else right now.""

I could tell that such pressures were beyond my father's imagination (or was he somehow jealous of my life away from him?) and that he would see a refusal from me as a betrayal in his time of need.

That was not all. As he described the task, I saw more clearly than ever before the determination of my father - the clarity and resourcefulness with which he approached his work, the energy, the perfect self-control. In his way, he was a sort of genius, and I respected that in him. It made my own plans and hopes seem less important.

""All right,"" I said. ""I'll do it."""
CPE_56,"Simon Costello realized that buying the house in Pembroke Square was a mistake within a year of moving in with his wife, Lois. They could only afford it by being very careful with money, which made it a bad decision. At first, it seemed like a good idea because Simon had many successful cases, and Lois had returned to her job at the advertising agency shortly after their twins were born. She even got a raise, bringing her salary to thirty-five thousand. Lois was the one who pushed for the move, arguing that their flat wasn't suitable for a family, and they needed more space, a garden, and a place for an au pair. These needs could have been met in a less expensive area, but Lois wanted more than just space. She felt that their old address, Mornington Mansions, wasn't suitable for a rising barrister and a successful businesswoman. 

To save money, Lois decided that one of them should use public transport. Since her job was on the other side of London, Simon had to be the one to do it. The crowded tube ride made him resentful, and he often thought about his grandfather's house in Hampstead, where he had stayed as a boy. His grandmother believed in giving the tired breadwinner peace and comfort after a long day. But times had changed. Lois made it clear before they married that her career was as important as his. Their lifestyle depended on both of their salaries.

Now, their situation was threatened by Venetia, who had come to their office in a bad mood. She accused Simon of knowing that a client, Brian Cartwright, had bribed jurors in a case four years ago and that Cartwright had given shares to Simon's fiancée before the trial. Simon denied it, but his denial sounded unconvincing even to himself. He felt guilty and remembered the fear of punishment from his school days. Venetia didn't believe him, and he wondered why she was so angry. He questioned her right to judge him and worried that if the rumor spread, his career would be ruined."
CPE_36,"I chose this place to live, thinking I would be anonymous among people who didn't mind if the rented houses were falling apart or if the gardens were overgrown. But I was wrong. People in the shops soon start to recognize you. The roses next door remind me that the gardens were once loved. Usually, I stay inside trying to forget that it's summer, but tonight, I'm watching the birds fly between the treetops and roofs. I cleared some space in the garden for a chair, and my arms are scratched from the plants. It's a small London garden where plants must grow tall to survive. 

My upstairs neighbor, Jaz, leans out of the window. She's written several unpublished books, and as an English teacher, I sometimes have to pretend to like them. I have her latest one now. 'How's the work going, Jaz?' I ask. 'In no other job do you have to explain yourself so often,' she replies. Then she offers to bring a drink down. I don't want Jaz in the garden, and I realize it looks messy. The only way to the garden is through my flat, and Jaz is knocking on my door. 'You're on holiday now,' she says, sitting in the chair. 'I should've been a teacher - writers don't get holidays. They say those who can, do, and those who can't, teach.' And some can't do either. 'What plans for the holidays?' she asks. 

I feel anxious about the school year ending. Empty days. Hot pavements. The walk to the shops. The park with its fountain, and loneliness beside me on the bench. 'Actually, I'm going to Stonebridge tomorrow. Can you feed the cats?' I ask, my heart racing. 'Of course,' Jaz says, knowing she would be around. 'Where will you stay? A nice B and B?' 'No, I'll stay with my oldest friend, Ruby, at the Rising Sun. We've known each other since we were eight.' It's not true, but I often deal with fiction. 'Going back to your roots. So what do you think of my book?' Jaz asks about her manuscript, The Cruelty of Red Vans, which is half-read on my desk. I like the title and tell her so. I decide to be honest. 'Let me give you a tip,' I say. 'What?' she asks, offended. 'Try writing about nice people for a change, people who try to be good.' 'Teachers!' Jaz responds like a rebellious student. 'I keep a journal where I write something good about each day,' I say. 'Keep a journal! Nice people! Get a life, Ann.' 

Oh, I've got a life. I have my work, and I go out sometimes, reading on the tube. When we go inside, my calm kitchen reassures me. Then I remember my school geography teacher, Miss Tarrantine, who was about my age now, winking as she said, 'I've had my moments.' We nearly died laughing."
CPE_6,"**Heritage**

Heritage is important because it connects people and communities to the past. We often feel connected to our personal heritage, knowing about our grandparents and their lives. Beyond personal stories, there is a need to learn about our past to understand our future, both individually and nationally. Heritage gives us a sense of continuity, helping us find our place in history. Just like inheriting genes, we inherit culture passed down through generations. Even if there are parts of our national heritage we don't like, it is still ours, and it feels good to belong to something. Heritage teaches us a lot and is essential for our well-being, influencing everything from customs to material culture. In the past, we connected with our heritage through stories from our ancestors. However, Western industrial society disrupted communities, causing much of this oral tradition to be lost. Now, places and buildings help us learn about our past. It is crucial to preserve these links to honor our ancestors' identity.

**The Fens**

I started writing a novel called ""Waterland,"" where the landscape of the Fens in England became important. People often ask why I, a Londoner with no personal connection to the Fens, chose to write about it. The simple answer is that I picked the Fens because they seemed plain and empty, a perfect setting for my story. However, I learned that the Fens are neither flat nor empty. They are as English as any other part of England but also strangely unique. It's surprising that in the middle of England, there is a region that feels foreign to many English people, even though other unique areas of Britain have become part of the nation's cultural heritage. The Fens are both empty and full, cultivated yet wild, open yet mysterious. My research for the novel wasn't extensive; I haven't visited places like Wisbech or Prickwillow. As a fiction writer, I prefer imagining worlds rather than seeking documentary proof. Imagining the Fens has its own logic because, as Edward Storey's book shows, the Fens are not just a landscape but a state of mind.

**Museums**

Museums need to make their collections accessible. In the past, this meant putting items in display cases with long labels that were hard to understand. Today, accessibility means more. Displays should be lively and interesting, using techniques to capture visitors' attention and emotions. Museums should also reach out to the community. For example, they can provide loan boxes of objects for teachers or use similar materials to help elderly people with memory loss. Museums focus on real artefacts and specimens, not replicas. They offer encounters with authentic items that existed and had meaning in history. This is their strength and what sets them apart from heritage centers, theme parks, books, and digital media. Museums that embrace this challenge and offer exciting displays, catalogues, and outreach programs will find that virtual history can actually help them by increasing interest in the real items that only museums can provide.

**Architecture and Environment**

The desire to preserve things is not new, but changes in our towns happen quickly and affect us all. This makes some people want to preserve everything, while others think more about the nature and future of towns. It can be argued that people who have lived through events like world wars are more inclined to preserve things because stability becomes important. If there is a psychological need for preservation, planners should consider it. Change is not bad if we learn to manage it. Physical changes in our towns reflect social changes, like changes in population, welfare, and demands."
CPE_33,"**Einstein**

If you ask someone on the street to name a scientist, they will probably say Albert Einstein. His face is often used in ads for smart products, like computers and encyclopedias. Most people don't know much about what Einstein did, except that he created theories called 'relativity'. These theories are famous for being hard to understand and for making strange predictions that seem to go against everyday experiences. Einstein was part of a big change in scientific thinking, which started modern science in the 20th century. Scientists were trying to describe the universe better by studying how matter and natural forces interact. Einstein made important contributions by rethinking the basics: time, space, matter, and energy. Before him, scientists followed Isaac Newton's idea that stars and planets moved in a fixed space and time. Einstein changed this idea, saying that time and space are not fixed but relative.

**Young Readers**

When we were children, Lydia and I didn't trust books that won prizes because we thought they would be 'worthy', which to us meant 'boring'. Our mother didn't like our attitude and often hinted at her disapproval, but our father would happily give us small amounts of money to encourage us to read these books. He would also sneak in a few good books among our Christmas and birthday gifts, marking them with 'This Book is NOT Literature'. Although we ignored most of his choices as 'boys' books', he did manage to introduce us to some good short stories and, once, a famous collection of poems.

**Language**

In 1851, Jacob Grimm wrote that 'The origin of human language is truly secret and marvellous'. This mystery has led to many strange ideas. In 1928, Charles Caller claimed that early humans might have made sounds like ""meuh"" when they sensed danger. ""Meuh"" sounds sad. Humans in dangerous lands with scary animals made desperate noises, and languages have kept some of these sounds, like malaria meaning ""fever"" or the Latin mors meaning ""death"". Because of such odd ideas, many people avoided the topic, thinking it was for eccentrics. But recently, the origin and evolution of language have become important research areas. Language likely developed in East Africa about 100,000 years ago. It was mainly used for friendly communication and was important in power struggles. Sharing information was probably not its original purpose, contrary to philosopher John Locke's idea of language as a 'great conduit' for sharing knowledge."
CPE_20,"Text: 'Writing Reviews Frank Kermode explores the art of writing reviews from a writer's perspective. Most reviews are created and shared under conditions that make them have a very short lifespan. There are deadlines and strict limits on their length. Once published, they last only as long as the newspaper or magazine they appear in—maybe a day, a week, or at most a month. The temporary nature of reviews often defines their literary value. Many people, including the writers themselves, often think that reviewing is a job done out of necessity, like needing extra money, or because they can't spend all day working on a novel or a serious book. However, reviewing is a skilled and complex task. It's one thing to be concise and fair in a short newspaper review, and quite another to manage a longer piece in an international journal without losing focus. The fifteen hundred words of a leading article in weekly magazines present challenges of both short and long reviews. Length isn't the only factor. Reviewers must consider their audience, from casual weekend readers to those deeply interested in the subject. A reviewer needs to know a lot about many topics and must write in a way that intelligent readers can understand and enjoy. This often means that reviewers also write other things besides reviews. The American novelist John Updike, who isn't very fond of criticism—calling it 'hugging the shore'—still enjoys writing reviews between his major novels. He collects all his reviews, even the short ones, into books with modest titles. Some might think that less famous writers should accept the temporary nature of their reviews, but if they can, they should be allowed to enjoy some permanence and recognition, especially if they believe some of their best writing is in their reviews. I feel this way about my own work. My main job has been academic, and most of my serious books are academic, the kind professors like and are expected to write. However, in the English-speaking world, there isn't a strict separation between reviewing and literary study, so it's common for the same people to do both. The days are gone when academics criticized professors for writing reviews, or for wasting time, or for not respecting their institutions. Complaints from non-professors that professors are taking their jobs are also less common now, partly because there is much more reviewing work available, and partly because the pay is often low. I believe these arrangements benefit both readers, who can trust that the reviewer knows what they're talking about, and professors, as it helps keep them grounded. It also reminds them to communicate clearly with non-professors. When talking among themselves, they might use complex language, but when addressing intelligent non-professors, they need to be clear. Finally, despite its importance, reviewing must be a secondary job. You can only do it well if you are also doing something else well.'"
CPE_40,"Ralph unlocked the door to his apartment and, as he entered the dark, still hallway, he felt a brief moment of doubt about owning it. Even after three years, this feeling sometimes came over him when he returned home alone at the end of the day. When he first bought the flat, he would come home eagerly, often as early as possible, wondering what the flat had been like while he was away. It felt like a welcoming place to him, where he was in control. He thought he should worry about things like intruders or leaks, but the flat always seemed to be waiting for him, either tidy or messy, depending on how he left it. Over time, he started to see it as just another part of himself, a space filled with his thoughts and feelings. He became frustrated that it couldn't change. Sometimes, there would be a small pile of letters by the door or the answering machine would be blinking with messages. He was thankful that the windows hadn't been broken or the flat damaged, but he wondered what it would look like if it were. From his dull office on Holloway Road, Ralph often looked forward to his evenings alone at home. Once he left the office and started his bus ride home, he felt more like himself and didn't need to be alone anymore, though he often forgot this when planning his social life. At his desk, he longed for time alone with his things, but once he got home, he felt empty and waited for a sense of self to return. Instead, he felt a deep emptiness, making him think that doing work he didn't like had changed him, moving him away from who he thought he was. He would read or listen to music at night, but now he questioned why he did these things. His sense of direction was unclear, and his thoughts and feelings seemed lost. There was a time, he thought, when he didn't feel so powerless, when he might have escaped if he had realized his own value. But he had been eager to settle into something and followed the first path that seemed right. After university, he tried to make a plan for his future, but he found he only wanted to survive quietly. He applied for jobs he heard about from friends, following their paths without imagining a job that would make him happy. He went to his only job interview gratefully and didn't think to question the position—a vague editorial role at a free local newspaper. He was relieved to have a pleasant conversation with Neil, his boss, and didn't think about the long meetings he would face daily. Neil offered him the job on the spot, saying Ralph was the only graduate who applied, which Ralph took as a compliment at the time."
CPE_45,"**Goat Racing**

I was about to see goat racing on Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. I pushed through ice-cream vans, crowds of people, food stalls, and loud music. Everyone was moving towards the racecourse, and I tried to find a good spot. A section was set up as a course for the race. It wasn't like big racecourses, but people stood on either side of the track where the goats would run. It was hard to keep the goats in order because they are known to eat almost anything.

**Canoe Trip**

As the day ended, I started to worry about the night. The canoe was too wet to sleep in, and we hadn't seen any villages or huts since morning. In the dim moonlight, we used our torch to see the cliffs, but the batteries were dying. We put in new ones, but they didn't work. We couldn't find a place to camp. A few miles later, Lesley thought she saw a light, and we got hopeful, but it was just moonlight on the waves. Soon, we heard the loud noise of fast water, but we couldn't see what was happening. Time seemed to stop as we continued.

**How to be Presentation Perfect - we answer your questions**

I am not good at making presentations, but as a managing director, I have to present to my colleagues and major shareholders. How can I improve my presentation skills and confidence? You are not alone. Presenting is a different skill from running a company, but many senior executives need to be good at it. To convince your audience, you must believe in what you are saying. Show your belief with passion and enthusiasm. This means you need to prepare well. Test your ideas in advance and ask colleagues to think of tough questions the audience might ask. Start with something everyone agrees on and build towards your conclusion."
CPE_64,"Some activities cannot be rushed; they take the time they need. If you're late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you rush making mayonnaise by adding oil too quickly, it will curdle. If you pull too hard on a tangled fishing line, the knot will get tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some tasks are done very quickly, while others take longer—seconds, minutes, hours, days, or even years. Some mental tasks can be sped up, like solving puzzles or doing math in your head. But others cannot be rushed, or they will fail, like the mayonnaise, or get tangled, like the fishing line. Saying 'Think fast; we need the results' can be as unwise as trying to sleep in half the time. We learn, think, and understand in different ways, and these ways work at different speeds, suitable for different tasks. 'He who hesitates is lost,' says one proverb. 'Look before you leap,' says another. Both are true. Generally, the mind has three processing speeds. The first is faster than thought. Some situations need an immediate reaction. When my motorbike skidded on a wet road in London, my brain and body quickly reacted to keep me safe, and only afterward did my conscious mind catch up. A concert pianist or an Olympic fencer doesn't have time to think about their next move. This fast physical intelligence can be called our 'wits'. Then there is thought itself: the kind of intelligence that involves figuring things out, weighing pros and cons, building arguments, and solving problems. A mechanic fixing an engine, a scientist interpreting results, or a student working on an assignment all use this type of thinking, which relies on reason and logic. We often call this intelligence 'intellect'. Someone good at solving these problems is called 'bright' or 'clever'. But there is another, slower mental process. It is often less clear, more playful, or dreamy. In this mode, we are thinking deeply or being contemplative. Sitting by the sea, lost in the sound of the waves, or just before sleep, we are in a different mental state than when planning a meal or writing a letter. This slow, seemingly aimless way of thinking is just as intelligent as the faster ones. Allowing the mind time to wander is not a luxury to cut back on when life gets busy. On the contrary, slow thinking is an important part of our mental abilities. We need the slow mind as much as the fast one. Some problems are better solved with a slow mind. Some mysteries can only be understood with a relaxed, open mental attitude. Recent studies show that slower, less deliberate thinking is good for understanding complex or unclear situations. Deliberate thinking works well when the problem is clear. When deciding where to go on holiday, the options may be obvious. But when we don't know what to consider or which questions to ask, or when the issue is too subtle for conscious thought, we need the slow mind. If the problem is how to manage a difficult team at work, or whether to change careers, it might be better to sit and think than to search frantically for answers. This type of intelligence is linked to creativity or even 'wisdom'. Poets have long known the limits of conscious thinking and have tried to develop these slower ways of knowing. Philosophers have written about the parts of the mind beyond conscious thought. Only recently have scientists begun to study these slower ways of knowing. The field of 'cognitive science' is showing that the unconscious mind can do many interesting and important tasks if given time. It can learn patterns too subtle for normal consciousness, understand complex situations, and solve difficult issues better than the conscious mind."
CPE_29,"**Surviving in a Foreign Land**

I have been warmly welcomed. It's a friendly and well-equipped base camp in a very isolated place. At any time, there are about forty people - scientists, students, weather experts, satellite trackers - in a close community where everyone helps out. My basic French is just enough to communicate, but not to have casual conversations. I miss the subtle meanings, and my phrasebook is useless at breakfast. This isn't a practical problem for me, but at first, it affected my self-confidence. I found myself slightly dreading mealtimes. I would hesitate, worried about which table to choose, scared of the silence when I spoke, anxious like I haven't been since my first weeks of school. I still smile awkwardly or panic when people talk to me. I think the reason for this occasional sadness isn't about losing company or communication; it's because I've lost the social advantage that my ability to talk has always given me.

**Elliot**

When I first met Elliot, I was just a young author like any other, and he didn't pay much attention to me. He never forgot a face though, and when I saw him here or there, he shook hands with me warmly, but didn't try to get to know me better. If I saw him at the opera, for example, and he was with someone important, he tended not to notice me. But then I had a surprising success as a playwright, and soon I noticed that Elliot was more interested in me. One day, I got a note from him inviting me to lunch, and I thought he was testing me. But after that, since my success brought me many new friends, I started to see him more often.

**Alfred Hitchcock**

The film director Alfred Hitchcock always said he didn't care about the story of his films or the acting, but he did care about the photography, the soundtrack, and all the technical parts. For Hitchcock, it wasn't a message or a great performance that moved the audience; he believed people are excited by pure film, no matter their cultural background. So, if a film is made correctly, in terms of its emotional impact, the Japanese audience should scream at the same moment as the Indian audience. Hitchcock's view of himself was always clear, logical, and hard to argue with. He was a man of reason and a genius craftsman who liked to hear an audience scream. He didn't deal with speculation, abstract ideas, or intellectual hints, and his view of his own film characters was not deep. He focused on film, pure film, and the most precise, calculated beauty of what a strip of film can do to an audience."
CPE_57,"**Amateur Astronomy**

Astronomy has changed a lot in the last 50 years. About 30 years ago, there were not many charts or catalogues. Telescopes were basic, and there were few books on how to do astronomy. Today, you can buy many types of telescopes and equipment. Electronic calculators and computers have changed how we make charts and analyze observations. This might be the best time for amateur astronomy. However, some things have been lost. Now, you might need to travel 80 km to find a sky as clear as it was in cities 50 years ago. During the day, airplane trails can turn into clouds, making it hard to observe the sun and stars.

**Too Much Choice**

Today, society has too many choices. There are too many things to do and too many options. People always want the newest product or service, and technology makes changes happen faster. New products come out quickly, making it hard to keep up. This can cause stress and make life feel disconnected. More choices mean more stress and less time. People are now looking for 'simplexity'—simple things that bring meaning in a complex world. But simplifying life is hard when there are so many products and services. There are more types of detergent and breakfast cereals than we need, and more software updates and phone plans than we can follow.

**McAndrews Hotel**

Every summer, we spend two weeks at McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. It is a family tradition started by my grandmother, and it is very important to us. Nothing can interrupt this ritual. The guests at McAndrews are similar: old-fashioned and maybe a bit snobbish. I do not like the rude behavior of shop assistants today, which is seen as being equal. I dislike overly friendly waiters who seem like they might slap you on the back. I know most of the other guests' names because they have been coming here since they were children, like me. But I can be sure that when I see them in the hotel, we will only exchange polite greetings. Such respect for privacy is rare in hotels today."
CPE_9,"**Othello**

The move of an outstanding production of Shakespeare's play *Othello* from Stratford to London gives me a chance to correct a harsh review I wrote when the show first opened last spring. At that time, I said Ray Fearon was too young for the main role and criticized his acting. I still believe that changing the age difference between Othello and Desdemona alters the tragedy, but I take back my criticism of Mr. Fearon's excellent performance. In fact, the entire cast is excellent. Unforgettable scenes include Cassio's competitive games with other young officers, which become dangerously intense, and the moment when Iago starts to lose control and struggles to regain it. I dare anyone not to be moved to tears during the scene where Emilia helps Desdemona get ready for bed. The pace and tension throughout the play are amazing. Don't miss this production.

**Lake Vostok**

In the center of Antarctica, nothing moves. On the edges of the continent, there are many penguins, seals, and birds. But on the large white plateau inside, life cannot survive. Except, that is, in a huge hidden area of freshwater called Lake Vostok, which is under nearly 4 kilometers of ice, right below the coldest place on earth. The water has been cut off from air and sunlight for up to 25 million years. Biologists are eager to explore its mysterious depths and find out what strange organisms live there. Geologists and glaciologists are also very interested. For two years, researchers from around the world have been planning how to uncover the lake's secrets, and if they succeed, the next few years will be known as the decade of Lake Vostok.

**Scientists**

There was an interesting discussion on the radio last week. It seems that a group of scientists are getting very excited about what motivates them to be scientists; the phrase ""because it's there"" comes to mind. We all know it's the age-old search for knowledge, the desire to understand everything from atoms to black holes. But these scientists want to know why we want to know all of this in the first place and why science can't explain our curiosity. Surely, it's more important to know whether what we scientists are doing is right, rather than getting stuck in debates about the purpose of it all. I would have thought that the key issue here is not why we pursue it, but to recognize that science is a tool, and we are the ones who should decide how, where, when, and why to use it."
CPE_42,"**Food**

Our connection with food is very basic and fulfilling. Many people who love cooking buy cookbooks like this one. Often, we think that cooking is only worth it for special occasions or complex dishes. But that's not true. You can make a delicious soup by simply putting some chopped carrots, a leek, celery, and a few herbs into water. This is much more satisfying than buying a packet or opening a can. Instead of buying a chocolate mousse with too many preservatives and additives, you can make a delicious dessert in five minutes that both adults and children will enjoy. Cooking is also a way to show care and love by bringing your own creation, no matter how simple, to the table. Sharing food is full of symbolism and meets our deep human needs, which is why all our celebrations, like birthdays, anniversaries, and engagements, happen around tables. No one would have a takeaway for a wedding or anniversary party! And few people would want to discuss a business deal over canned soup.

**In the Elevator**

This morning, Alistair tried to tidy up his office, but papers were still everywhere. Tax forms were overflowing from desk drawers and boxes, waiting for a day when he felt like filing them. He also had extra paperwork from owning an apartment building. Books and journals were near the new bookshelves but not organized. As the elevator took him to his floor, he knew Mallory would be on time for their meeting. She would knock on his office door exactly on the hour. She was very precise about time and neatness. How would she react to the mess? She might think his office had been vandalized. He could pretend to be shocked when he walked in behind her. Mrs. Wilson, his cleaning lady, arrived while he was trying to clear some space on the carpet. He smiled at her hopefully as she unlocked his apartment door. Her eyes showed she had no intention of cleaning his office. She believed he was from somewhere far away, not from her world in Brooklyn.

**Karen**

Karen wanted to be different from her mother, which led her to create her own story of strength. In her story, there were important moments, like when she was twelve and her brother accidentally hit her in the eye with a golf club. At first, she thought she was blind, but the bone protected her, as the doctor later told her. The club missed her eye, and she only needed a few stitches. When she opened her eyes in the doctor's office and saw her mother talking about miracles and small mercies, she felt she was saved for a reason.

**Miss Fogerty**

Miss Fogerty was walking quickly across the wet grass of the village green, feeling both excited and sad about what she had just seen. It's exciting to be the first to know something important, especially in a small community, and Miss Fogerty's life was usually quiet. But she was very sad about Dr. Bailey's condition. He had been her doctor for many years, and she appreciated his care for her yearly laryngitis, which was her only health issue. His best quality, she thought, was making people feel he had plenty of time and truly wanted to hear about their worries. This quality made him very loved by the village. He always gave his time, knowledge, and humor, and in return, he received great loyalty and affection."
CPE_59,"**Joanna's Lessons**

Joanna MacGregor is a busy concert pianist. So why has she decided to write books for young children learning the piano? Even someone who is completely tone deaf would be moved by a Joanna MacGregor performance. Watching her play complex pieces is like seeing a pianist push human limits. But even her amazing skill wasn't enough to impress one small boy at a recent concert for kids. Like the rest of the audience, he heard pieces in every style from her wide range of classical, jazz, ragtime, blues, techno, African, and more. He watched her play inside the piano, a trick that usually amazes kids. Then, when she invited questions, he asked, ""Can you play Match of the Day?"" Many experienced pianists might be stumped by such a request, but for Joanna, it was fun. ""In his eyes, until I played that, I wasn't a proper pianist."" Of course, she played it and probably remembered the experience for her next children's concert.

MacGregor is unusual among top concert pianists because she is interested in how young children learn the piano. She has just published her own beginner piano book for children: *Joanna MacGregor's Piano World*. She managed this despite her very busy schedule. She seems to be at almost every festival this summer. Tomorrow, she will be part of an all-day event with young composers and artists. She also runs her own recording label, Sound Circus. She admits she often wants to start new projects with other artists. So why take on the extra work of writing a book? ""People who know me are surprised. But I think the first lessons are very important. The music profession often focuses on the top level, on the idea of a child prodigy. Most people's interest in music is more ordinary. I find that more interesting!""

In creating her books, MacGregor uses her own experiences. Between ages 18 and 25, before she had concert engagements, she taught beginners the piano. But most importantly, she grew up with many children coming to her home for piano lessons from her mother. ""I was playing around on the keyboard, and there were all these other children wanting to play all kinds of music - classical, jazz, pop, improvisation. I wasn't part of a system that forced exceptional talent. I grew up with the idea of making music available to everyone.""

Just as everyone should learn to swim or speak a little French, she believes everyone should try learning the piano. Some kids have a natural talent and learn quickly. She is interested in the others: those who progress at different speeds, enjoy it for a while, but often give up. This can happen at any stage. Some kids find the beginning too hard. Others quit later when the pressure to succeed increases. ""I worry that some people use music, like sport, to make their children achieve things, rather than just enjoy it. Children stop because they feel they can't meet their parents' expectations.""

Her own training manual raises a question. Does she think poorly of existing piano books or teaching quality? ""I'm reluctant to criticize others' teaching or books,"" she says. She admits her books, though colorful and attractive, are not the only ones designed to make learning fun. Her special idea for engaging young beginners is to include a storyline in the books and CDs. The challenge is to make learning interesting. From the first lesson, there are accompaniments in different styles for a teacher or parent to play with the child. For kids whose parents aren't pianists, the accompaniments are on the CDs. Learning should be pure fun, MacGregor insists. ""You have to let them improvise and give them a reason to play at both ends of the keyboard and use the pedals.""

As children progress, bigger challenges appear. They need encouragement to read music instead of relying on their ear. MacGregor, who relied on her ear as a child, understands this. But she believes practice is the most important factor. How can children be encouraged to play a passage again and again? She admits she didn't practice seriously until she went to the Royal Academy of Music, where she needed to practice for difficult contemporary pieces. Now she loves it. The eight hours a day she practices are the core of her musical life, more important than performances. ""I have great sympathy for people who find it hard. I don't think people talk about it enough."" The secret, whether you practice for twenty minutes or five hours, is to know what you want to achieve, she says. Other tips: reward yourself - play the whole piece, even with mistakes. And mix hard with easy."""
CPE_54,"**Writing by Hand and on Screen**

Dr. Johnson once said, ""What is written without effort is in general read without pleasure."" This means that good writing is often difficult to create. When I look back at my handwritten school essays, I notice there were very few mistakes. Today, I would rewrite them many times. I think this is because writing by hand was physically hard. Writing slowly made me think more carefully. Since it was hard to change or erase, I wrote with care. On the other hand, using a computer can lead to careless writing. Many writers find that the time spent fixing early drafts on a computer is about the same as the time spent writing by hand. Also, emails, unlike handwritten letters, can be emotionally heavy. Some say that emails have brought back the art of love letters. Many of these messages are now sent online, where before there was only casual talk. That's a good thing. At least these emails are written in some form of English and grammar. But words on a screen can feel dull. Writers often don't realize the power of written words and may exaggerate. Words typed quickly lack the care and personality of handwriting.

**The CD**

I put down my cup and looked at the CD. The case was not impressive, but the shiny disc inside was interesting. ""Wonderful little things, aren't they?"" Mr. Warriston said, coming back into the room. I agreed and carefully handed the disc to him. ""It's amazing they can hold seventy minutes of music,"" he said, turning on the hi-fi device. He pressed a button, and a small drawer came out. He put the disc in, pressed the button again, and the tray went back in. ""Some people say they sound sterile, but I think they..."" ""Do you have to turn them over, like records?"" I asked. ""What? No,"" Mr. Warriston said, standing up straight. ""No, you only play one side."" ""Why?"" I asked. He looked confused, then thoughtful. ""You know,"" he said, ""I have no idea. I don't see why you couldn't make both sides playable and double the capacity..."" He looked at the machine. ""You could have two lasers, or just turn it over by hand... hmm."" He smiled at me. ""Yes, good point."" He nodded at my wooden chair. ""Anyway. Come on, let's get you sitting in the best place for the stereo effect, eh?"" I smiled, happy to have asked a technical question Mr. Warriston couldn't answer.

**Books versus Electronic Text**

When comparing books and electronic text, author Malcolm Bradbury was right when he said that if matches had been invented after lighters, we'd be amazed at the improvement. Many people, excited by new technology, say that electronic text is a change as big as the invention of printing and that it is almost complete. They forget that changes in how we think take a long time. This kind of talk falls into the trap of thinking our generation is the most important in history. For example, a book from 1979 said, ""The 1980s will see the book as we know it begin a slow and steady slide to oblivion."" So far, this prediction is wrong. Reading long texts on a screen is so unpleasant that most people don't do it. Also, the way information is organized on computers encourages people to read only small parts. Some people say this leads to new ways of storytelling, but there's nothing new about reading non-linearly. Many books, like religious texts, dictionaries, and poetry collections, are not read from start to finish. What's new is that computers don't encourage reading a whole text. 

**The Office**

Charles walked into the office and saw a perfectly organized space. The carpet was clear of the papers that had covered it since it was put down, and the desk was dark wood, just as he remembered from the auction five weeks ago. Neat file-holders were being placed in drawers. Twelve years of trade journals filled the shelves on one wall. Kathleen struggled to close the filing cabinet and then turned to him. ""You have to switch to computers, Charles. This is too much."" ""Hello, Kathleen. Oh, this is amazing."" He admired the room and its antique furniture. He wasn't thinking about a computer or any other machine in it, not even a pencil sharpener. ""Simply amazing,"" he said, avoiding the topic of computers. Over the two years he had known her, they had this conversation many times. She couldn't understand why he resisted technology when he was so good with computers and had even published an important paper on computer skills. She had inspired that paper. With a keyboard, she could change any software into something new and exciting."
CPE_32,"Text: ""You don't take sugar, do you?"" shouted his secretary. She wasn't really asking, since she had been making Lancelot coffee for many months. Her excuse for forgetting was that he wasn't usually supposed to be there. But now, he was there all the time. He realized that staying away would lead to chaos. He thought about how he had gone from being a valued advisor, meeting authors and playwrights over lunch, to a stressed worker with no parking space at work. ""This came,"" she yelled, waving a manila folder before putting it in front of him. ""From that guy in Los Angeles. You said you wanted to see it."" A typed label read: ""A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert."" Below it, it said ""An Expanded Synopsis."" Lancelot did not want to see the word ""synopsis."" He wanted to see ""A First Draft."" He had already seen a synopsis of this book and didn't want to see another, even if it was revised. Ian Cuthbert had been given a large advance for this book when Lancelot bought the company. Ian was one of several old friends Lancelot had made the mistake of commissioning books from. Ian was proof that a person with a difficult personality would become even more unpredictable. Lancelot skipped the introduction, which he had read many times, and looked at the synopsis. He recognized almost every phrase. He closed the folder and put it aside. Clearly, Ian's manuscript would never come. The synopsis lacked the brilliance Ian was supposed to have, and it had a tone of lost conviction. Lancelot remembered stories of a famous author whose last book was published incomplete after his death, coaxed from him chapter by chapter. But in that case, the payments were small parts of an advance that was never given. Ian's advance had been huge, a reversal of the business principle that authors must deliver a manuscript to be paid later. Lancelot, who studied modern languages at Oxford, remembered when Ian was the most promising talent in a Cambridge full of promise. Ian's peers had taken over British theatre quickly. But Ian's energy made theirs look lazy. He wore his coat like a cape and talked about famous writers as if he knew them. Yet, Ian's creative talent stayed hidden. While others succeeded, Ian withdrew. At his peak, he was difficult to work with. Appointed to edit an arts magazine, he was overwhelmed by opportunities. The magazine used up its budget without publishing. His contract with a fashion magazine produced little except stories about his high salary, which increased to make him produce more, then anything. At editorial meetings, Ian was witty but harsh, criticizing others' ideas. Ten years later, he was unreliable. Lancelot was close to admitting that ""A World History of the Short"" was a mistake from the start."
CPE_65,"Text: 'England's breakfast revolution The importance of a good breakfast is clear according to health experts, but historically, breakfast is a relatively new concept in England. In medieval times, breakfast is rarely mentioned in literature. There are some references to travelers eating at dawn before long journeys, and to the sick having breakfast for health reasons, but most people did not eat breakfast unless they were royalty or nobles. However, in the sixteenth century, breakfast gradually became common. Some writers say this was because food was more available. However, they may not have considered other important social changes. For example, new work patterns might explain why breakfast became more important, as people started working set hours, often very early. So, having a meal in the morning became necessary and was no longer just for the wealthy.'"
CPE_61,"**Photography**

When a photographer takes a picture, they choose what to show based on their skills, personal views, and cultural norms. In this book, we will explore how these factors influence the style, content, and expression of a photo, and how viewers perceive and react to these images. For instance, a newspaper reader might think they understand the photos they see. But instead of just accepting the photo as it is, we might ask if it truly shows the scene as it was. Or does it reflect the photographer's perspective? Is the exact moment captured important, or should the photo be seen as a symbol of a situation in the world?

**More than a Game**

For me, sport is more than just a game. The most successful athletes have complete self-confidence. You need to focus completely if you want to succeed in sports. There's only one way to be the best, and you have to ignore everything else. Sport is tough, and no one will do it for you. It's either succeed or fail. Sport has taught me discipline and determination, but it also shows the value of teamwork. My sport lets you shine individually, but it's also a team game, so you must balance both. It's like life - you can succeed alone, but you must remember others around you. Sport has given me a lot - not just money. It has opened opportunities and shown me things around the world that others might never see. But you also have to give up a lot for these benefits.

**Tuning In**

Some experiences are so vivid that they stay clear in our memory. For me, one such moment happened one night in California years ago. I was awake, listening to a mockingbird singing beautifully from a hidden spot in a tall tree in the neighborhood. I don't usually have trouble sleeping, but the bird's amazing singing kept me awake. As I listened to its complex melodies, I felt drawn into a new artistic world. To follow the bird's patterns, I used my knowledge of jazz and Indian classical music. The bird made me feel like I was hearing an incredible, spontaneous musical performance. I reacted with amazement as each surprising musical variation came through the open window where I lay listening, until I finally fell asleep."
CPE_52,"Text: 'People have always had strong feelings about birds. But what do these feelings say about us? Paul Evans explores this idea. There's a noise coming from the greenhouse as a small brown bird hits the glass. It's a wren, a bird often seen as a sign or message. Is it trying to tell me something, or is it just trapped? Both could be true, depending on how you see it. Wrens have been part of British culture for a long time. In medieval times, people believed the direction a wren flew could predict their luck. Today, wrens are still popular in British art and homes. Even if old beliefs have faded, wrens still hold a place in our hearts. A forest without wrens feels empty. This is because folklore about birds has been important to people for a long time. In the past, people depended on nature for survival and developed stories to explain the world around them. These stories can change over time. For example, the red kite was once a common bird in London, seen as helpful because it cleaned the streets. But later, it was seen as a pest and almost disappeared, except in Wales. Now, red kites are protected and have become symbols of conservation in Britain. Our connection to birds goes back to early human history. Early humans watched birds closely because they could warn of danger or changes in weather. Birds also connected people to their dreams and the supernatural. When we think about why birds matter to us, we also think about what it means to be human. Birds represent flight, song, and freedom, which we admire and envy. Some people might say these feelings are outdated, but they are still part of us. That's why birds are now seen as indicators of environmental health. In Britain, 30 bird species are endangered, which is sad not only because we lose these birds but also because we lose part of our culture. Birds like the skylark, turtle dove, and lapwing have deep cultural meanings, representing love and magic. Losing them is a cultural loss. However, birds not mentioned in stories or literature are often ignored. Folklore is important because it keeps stories alive and connects us to the past. These stories have a power that scientific terms can't match. They bring out feelings and memories buried under modern life. Whether we watch birds on TV or in our gardens, the joy we feel can't be fully explained by science. Birds are fascinating in ways we don't completely understand, and the stories we tell about them help us interpret their messages. The wren in the greenhouse creates a link between the present and a distant past, holding a mystery that keeps us curious.'"
CPE_28,"**Maps**

A map's main purpose is to show the relationships between points and features on the earth's surface using distance and direction. In the past, distance was often described in terms of time, like ""a day's journey by river,"" which told more about how easy it was to travel through the area than the actual distance. Direction was less important for travelers who mainly wanted to know ""Where do I go from here?"" and ""How far is it?"" Because of this, written travel guides were popular for a long time. Even today, some maps, like those of railway systems, might not show true directions. Early maps used signs to show important landmarks, and these signs varied in size to show their importance. The symbols used depended on the map's purpose and location, so understanding these symbols is key when studying old maps.

The history of map-making, or cartography, is about improving the accuracy of distance and direction and adding more details to maps. Cartography has used other sciences to help with this. For example, instead of using shadows or stars to find direction, people used the magnetic compass, which allowed for more precise measurements. As knowledge of the world grew through exploration, attempts were made to map it more accurately. Astronomers found that the earth is slightly flattened at the poles, which led to more precise mapping of large areas.

Over time, the needs of map users changed. Travelers and merchants were no longer the only users. Soldiers, especially with the use of artillery, needed accurate maps to understand the terrain. This led to the invention of contour lines. Archaeologists, historians, and modern geographers also had specific needs, leading to maps showing things like geological layers and land use. The recognition of maps' value in many sciences has led to a modern revival of cartography.

The development of maps has not been a smooth or continuous process. There have been times of slow progress and times of rapid development, with old ideas sometimes existing alongside new ones. Cartographers often knew what was needed for progress but had to wait for better tools to apply their ideas. Since it was easier to copy old maps, and because of the investment in printing, map publishers were often slow to adopt new ideas. Therefore, maps should not be taken as perfect evidence of the knowledge and techniques of their time.

The many maps we have today are the result of much human effort and thought. They are a valuable record for studying human history. This makes the study of historical cartography both fascinating and educational."
CPE_35,"**Simplified Text:**

I was invited into a young man's drawing room, a calm and cultured space surrounded by a messy cluster of rooms where the less active family members stayed. Moving from the kitchen to his parlour felt like going from economy to business class. This room had the largest collection of records I had ever seen, the first stereo record player and tuner I had come across, and surprising evidence that a teenager had spent money on Georgian wine glasses, pictures, and furniture. His name was Andrew Lloyd Webber. He had won a scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford, to study history, and he had nine months before starting. During this time, he wanted to become England's answer to the composer Richard Rodgers. My own dreams were just as wild; I wanted to be a pop star for reasons like women, money, and fame. The difference between Andrew and me was that my dreams were not life or death to me, though it's easy to say that now. They might have become so if I had failed. So, when Andrew suggested a new crazy ambition for me, to become as famous a lyricist as Oscar Hammerstein, I had no problem trying it. This was partly because within ten minutes of meeting, he was at the piano playing three tunes he had composed—I could tell he was very good. As he confidently played selections from shows he had written and produced at school, I was reminded of the best show albums from my parents' LP collection. He needed a new lyricist for the outside world. I had little to impress him with, other than instant praise for his music and a real, released seven-inch single of a song I had written (both words and music) that an unknown pop group had recorded three months earlier. We parted, promising to meet again and write something together. I was still more interested in the music charts than in West End theatre, but on the bus back to my flat, I told myself I had just met someone with rare talent and determination, and I would be crazy to miss out on being his partner, as he was clearly going to take the musical theatre by storm, probably soon. And even if we failed to challenge the top musical composers, we could try to compete with the Beatles and Rolling Stones later. The Everly Brothers had just made a comeback and would need new material. The next day, back at my desk in the office where I was training to become a lawyer, the certainty I had felt about a life in show business with Andrew Lloyd Webber had faded a bit. I would continue to look at small ads in Melody Maker for groups needing a vocalist and write a few more simple songs that wouldn't show my voice's limitations, but it was still likely that I would eventually pass my exams and become a respectable lawyer by the time I was twenty-five. By then, I would have surely grown out of pop music, as my father had confidently predicted I would by the time I was twenty-one. This was worrying—if he was right, I only had a few more months of enjoying it. But in the meantime, I felt I had nothing to lose by seeing Andrew again. It would be fun to see a musical with him and write lyrics that imitated musical lyricists rather than pop stars. Andrew was a fascinating person who talked about Good Food Guides and Victorian architecture, besides supporting Leyton Orient football team. I wasn't convinced by the idea for a musical he had been working on for the past year, but in 1965, I was rarely convinced about anything. His talent was unquestionable, and he claimed to have all the contacts. I was soon back in his drawing room. The idea was the life of Dr. Thomas Barnardo, the nineteenth-century philanthropist who founded the orphanages that bear his name. His story was worthy, but it didn't truly inspire me. The hero was too perfect, at least in Andrew's version, and the project was unoriginal, owing too much to Lionel Bart's hit show, Oliver. On the other hand, Andrew's belief in his score's brilliance was infectious and not totally unjustified. What did I know about musicals? As David Land, who later became my agent for over twenty-five years, memorably said, if there's a demand for one hamburger bar on the block, there is room for two. We could be the second hamburger joint. I started working with great enthusiasm, especially for the songs meant to be funny. Andrew outlined the plot, played me the tunes, and often gave me the title, most of which had probably been thought up by his previous lyricist friend. I skipped a day at the solicitor's office, pretending to be sick, to write my first batch of theatrical lyrics. I didn't know it that day, but I had changed careers."
CPE_5,"**Language**

Humans have a special ability: we can communicate with each other using language. Language is so important to us that it's hard to imagine life without it. If you see two or more people together anywhere in the world, they will probably start talking. Even when alone, people often talk to themselves, their pets, or even their plants. I like to think of language as an 'instinct'. This means that people know how to speak naturally, just like spiders know how to spin webs. Spiders didn't learn web-spinning from a genius spider or need special training; it's something they just do.

**Climate and Weather**

Climate and weather, created by the air around us, have a big impact on where animals and plants live. Climate can shape the look of landscapes. For example, warm and wet climates all year allow tropical jungles to grow, which have a huge variety of species. On the other hand, cold and windy areas have fewer living things. Weather patterns, which together form the climate, are caused by large masses of air moving and mixing. The atmosphere is always in motion. Some of this movement is because the air is on a spinning Earth, and since air is light, it doesn't move as fast as the Earth. The sun is an even more important cause of air movement.

**Coffee**

As a bar-person, I had to serve drinks and, more importantly, make coffee. In Lygon Street, Melbourne, a restaurant's success can depend on its coffee. I went through several days of intense coffee-making training, learning a lot about cleaning and maintaining the restaurant's shiny espresso machine. I also learned the key steps to making a perfect cup of rich, frothy cappuccino. By the end of the first week, I realized that making good coffee was harder than it seemed, and I thought I might be moved to simpler tasks like cleaning ashtrays. Fortunately, my boss was patient. ""Making coffee is both an art and a science,"" he said, ""and you need time to learn how to do it well."""
CPE_41,"**Art on TV**

Why does television often fail with programs about visual arts? Painting and sculpture seem perfect for TV because the camera can show a whole artwork and then zoom in on details. However, few TV series successfully show both the enjoyment and complexity of viewing art. A good example of this issue is Robert Hughes's series, ""American Visions,"" about American art. Hughes is a trustworthy critic with a strong personality, and he had almost eight hours to introduce British viewers to American art, which is often ignored by British galleries. I expected the series to focus on great artworks, but instead, it was about how American history and culture are shown in its art and architecture.

**Dealing in Metals**

For 20 years, I worked as an international metals dealer and became known as a speculator. Metals markets are less regulated than others. With some luck, a willingness to take risks, and a good understanding of the market, it's possible to make a lot of money. Risk-taking is a key part of the industry. This adventurous culture fits well with a free-market global economy. However, free-trade economists who thought the market would keep the price of scarce metals stable have found the opposite. More minerals are being extracted, and the cost of raw materials is decreasing. Considering inflation, the prices of most metals are about half of what they were 20 years ago. Recently, I was asked to investigate claims against a multinational company that benefits from these cheap raw materials.

**Extract from a Holiday Brochure**

Abaco and its offshore cays are part of the 700 islands of the Bahamas, stretching from Florida past the Tropic of Cancer to Cuba. Each island has its own character and offers something unique. To get around the islands and cays of Abaco, a boat is essential. If your accommodation doesn't include one, don't worry. There are many ferries and water-taxis. You can also rent a boat if you prefer to travel independently. Sailing is the most popular way to get around here. Abaco is called 'The Sailing Capital of the World' for a good reason. The calm, naturally protected waters are perfect for fishing, diving, snorkeling, and swimming. The cays and their beaches stretch for 200 miles like a string of pearls. It's not only at sea that treasures can be found. At night, the lights of the restaurants and cafes of Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay sparkle."
CPE_69,"**Build Your Own Bamboo Bike at the UK's First Workshop**

The Bamboo Bike Club, run by engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan, offers a unique experience: a weekend course where you can build your own custom bamboo bike frame. Located in Hackney Wick, east London, this is the only bamboo bike-building course in the UK. 

Bamboo is becoming a popular material for bike construction, with companies like Calfee Design in California and Bamboo Bikes in Yorkshire leading the way. However, their ready-made frames can be expensive, costing around $2,995 or £1,868. James and Ian wanted to make bamboo bikes more affordable and accessible, so they spent years developing their idea in a shed in Brecon, Wales. They realized they didn't just want to sell frames; they wanted to share the joy of making something unique and sustainable. 

The Bamboo Bike Club is more of a community project than a business. James works with wind turbines, and Ian is a civil engineer, so they run the club alongside their full-time jobs. Their courses are popular, offering a computer-designed custom bike frame and a fun weekend of bike-building at a competitive price.

On the first day of the course, participants learn how to select bamboo for strength and form strong joints. The process involves gluing bamboo tubes in place to create the bike's frame. Alloy tubes are used for parts that need extra strength, like the handlebars and wheel forks. James and Ian guide participants through the process, ensuring quality and offering help when needed. 

Most participants enjoy the challenge of building their own bike, and many are engineers. For those less experienced, Ian reassures that mistakes are part of the process, and it's easy to try again with a new piece of bamboo. Each piece is pre-checked for quality, allowing participants to focus on the aesthetics of their frame.

On Sunday, the focus is on building the lugs, or wraps, using hemp bindings and epoxy resin to create strong joints. A final polymer coating makes the bike waterproof, and it's ready for wheels, brakes, gears, and other personal touches. The finished bike is strong and durable, comparable to metal bikes. Ian and James have tested their bikes extensively, proving their durability.

While bamboo bikes may look a bit rough compared to professional frames, they have a unique charm. James and Ian believe that the individuality of each bike is what makes them special. The ride quality is impressive, with bamboo's natural ability to absorb vibrations providing a smooth experience. 

The cost of building your own bamboo bike at the workshop is less than £500, making it an affordable and rewarding project."
CPE_38,"**Self-help Books**

Dione Reverend was just an editor at Random House in New York when she first saw a manuscript by an unknown pop psychologist, Dr. John Gray. ""I took one look at the title and knew it would be a number one bestseller,"" she says, laughing, and she was right. Dr. Gray is now a multimillionaire, and Dione Reverend has her own company. Dr. Gray's book on how to improve communication between men and women is a key part of the growing self-help industry. This industry claims to help Americans improve their lives, but it also benefits from their desires for self-improvement. It supports the New York publishing world. In Britain, the genre is also popular, with many books that are dramatic and exaggerated. However, many self-help books are rejected for being too similar to others or too specific. Editors focus on marketability, asking questions like, ""How promotable is the author? What's the 'hook'? Is it universal enough?"" Dione Reverend says that a catchy title is crucial, as it helps reach people.

**Autobiographies**

There is an unspoken agreement between an autobiographer and the reader that the truth is being told. However, this agreement is often not fully kept. Writers may leave out shameful actions or thoughts, or things they consider unimportant. Some writers believe that inventing stories can better capture the truth about themselves than sticking strictly to the facts. Others may call their book an autobiography to make readers believe it is true, even if it is fiction. This can be done without any intention to deceive.

**Dashiell Hammett's Detective Stories**

Detective stories have been explained as a reflection of the conflicts in late nineteenth and early twentieth-century society. These stories are like allegories. The crime represents human impulses like lust or greed, and solving it symbolizes restoring order in society. In Hammett's stories, society is shown to be corrupt even after order is restored. The detective and the criminal understand each other and are comfortable with each other. The private detective is both a crook and a competitor. His mission is sometimes affected by his understanding of the criminal, and sometimes his desire to punish is increased by his own doubts.

**Science Writing**

Stephen Jay Gould is considered today's greatest scientific essayist. To discuss his writing, I met him at the Grand Hotel, where he was staying while promoting his new book. Neither of us felt comfortable there. Gould said he couldn't write about such a place because he didn't know the culture. Understanding the culture is important for a successful writer. Science is like its own civilization, and only scientists can effectively present it. If you don't understand the community and its rules, you will struggle. Gould advises never to write down to the reader. ""You can simplify the language but must never simplify the argument. Once readers feel patronized, your piece is dead."""
CPE_17,"**Air-conditioning**

At Cannons Gym, a popular spot for City of London workers during lunch, the air feels very cold. To cope with this summer's unusually high temperatures, the gym has used a lot of air-conditioning. In fact, when it's not busy, the gym feels as cold as the Arctic. This is an example of how modern society often misuses air-conditioning. It has become a key part of work and leisure, showing how humans can control or change the climate. However, many air-conditioned buildings could use other ways to stay cool. They could use natural light and ventilation and have thicker walls that absorb less heat during the day and release it at night. These ideas might seem simple, but they can be very effective and would greatly reduce the need for air-conditioning.

**Sundials**

It is probably not a coincidence that the start of a new millennium has brought renewed interest in sundials. Sundials are tools used to tell time based on the sun's position. A hundred years ago, they were important for keeping time accurately. As clocks and watches became more advanced and reliable, sundials became garden decorations—romantic and interesting, but outdated in a modern technological age. Now, interest in them is growing again. David Harber, a maker of sundials, believes their charm comes from their connection to the planets. He says there is a magical moment when a sundial starts working. They are calm, romantic objects that remind us of our place in the universe.

**Paint Your Own China**

My idea of china-painting came from a visit long ago to an arts and crafts show where serious-looking older women showed how to paint delicate flowers on a teacup with skillful brushstrokes. It was fascinating because each stroke created a perfect petal or leaf. Their hands were steady, the paint never smeared, and it seemed these women had either practiced for years or had a natural talent for precision. Remembering this, I wondered what kind of people would join a china-painting class. Would even beginners show natural artistic skill? In reality, the atmosphere was not intimidating at all. The students were there to have fun, and even the teacher did not want to paint petals on teacups with the quick precision I had seen before."
CPE_47,"**The Wrong Country**

Uncle chose a package holiday for Keith and Dawne at a good price: a flight from Gatwick Airport and twelve nights in Venice, the beautiful city, staying at the Pensione Concordia. When they went to the travel agency to book, the clerk told them that the other people in their package were a school group from the south coast, all learning Italian. But something went wrong. Either at the travel agency, the check-in desk, or in a computer, a small mistake happened. Dawne and Keith ended up in a hotel called the Edelweiss, in Room 212, somewhere in Switzerland.

At Gatwick, they gave their tickets to a girl in the yellow-and-red Your-Kind-of-Holiday uniform. She checked their details and said everything was fine. An hour later, they were surprised to hear elderly people on the plane speaking with North of England accents. Keith thought there might have been a cancellation, or maybe the Italian class was on another plane. They ordered drinks and relaxed.

When they landed, a stout woman with glasses told everyone to stay together. There was no mention of an overnight stop in the brochure, but when the coach reached its destination, Keith thought it was just a stopover. It was almost midnight, and they were too tired to question their right to the beds they were offered. But the next morning, when they realized they were staying there for the whole holiday, they were worried.

""We have the lake and the water birds,"" the receptionist explained with a smile. ""And we can take the steamer to Interlaken."" ""There's been a mistake,"" Keith said calmly, trying to stay composed. He could feel Dawne's nervous breathing beside him. ""We were supposed to be in Venice, at the Pensione Concordia."" ""I don't know that name, sir. This is Switzerland."" ""A coach is supposed to take us on. An official said so on the plane. She was here last night, that woman."" ""Your group is booked for twelve nights at the Edelweiss Hotel. To change now, sir, if you've changed your minds—"" ""We haven't changed our minds. There's been a mistake.""

The receptionist shook his head. He didn't know about any mistake. ""The man who made the booking,"" Dawne said, ""was bald, with glasses and a moustache."" She gave the name of the travel agency in London. ""Is there a problem?"" a woman asked, smiling at Keith. She was the stout woman he had thought was an official. They had seen her talking to the girl at Gatwick. On the plane, she had walked up and down the aisle, smiling at people. ""My name is Franks,"" she said. ""I'm married to the man with the bad leg.""

""Are you in charge, Mrs. Franks?"" Dawne asked. ""We're in the wrong hotel."" She repeated the name of the travel agency and described the bald-headed clerk. Keith interrupted her. ""It seems we joined the wrong group. We reported to the Your-Kind-of-Holiday girl and left it to her."" ""We should have known when they weren't from Dover,"" Dawne added. ""We heard them talking about Darlington."" Keith made an impatient sound. He wished she would let him do the talking.

""We noticed you at Gatwick,"" Keith said. ""We knew you were in charge."" ""And I noticed you. I counted you, although you probably didn't see me doing that. Now, let me explain. Your-Kind-of-Holiday sends people to many places, with different holidays at different prices. There are villa holidays for adventurous under-thirty-fives, treks to Turkey, and treks for singles to the Himalayas.""

""What I'm trying to say is that all tickets and labels look similar, the yellow with the two red bands."" Mrs. Franks laughed. ""So if you just followed others with the yellow-and-red label, you might end up in a wildlife park! But of course,"" she added kindly, ""that couldn't happen in a million years."" ""We're not meant to be in Switzerland,"" Keith insisted. ""Well, let's see, shall we?"" Mrs. Franks suddenly walked away, leaving them standing. The receptionist was no longer at the desk. They could hear typing.

""She seems kind,"" Dawne whispered. Keith wasn't listening. He tried to remember everything that had happened: giving the girl the tickets, sitting down to wait, the girl leading them to the plane, the pilot's voice welcoming them, and the air hostess checking seat belts. ""Nice to have some young people along,"" an elderly man's voice interrupted Keith's thoughts. ""Nottage is the name."" The old man's wife was with him, both looking like they were in their eighties. They had slept well, she said, the best night's sleep in years, thanks to the lakeside air. ""That's nice,"" Dawne said.

Keith walked out of the reception area, and Dawne followed him. Outside the hotel, they didn't mention the irony of the situation. On their first holiday since their honeymoon, they ended up on a package tour with elderly people, when the whole point was to escape the needs and demands of the elderly. Uncle had said so himself when they tried to persuade him to join them."
CPE_48,"Text: 'HE WAS A PEOPLE PERSON American executives are adopting the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton as a model of good management. Eluned Price reports. Many people in Britain know who Sir Ernest Shackleton was and have a general idea of what he did. In America, however, he has only recently become well-known. The Wall Street Journal described Shackleton earlier this year as 'an Antarctic explorer whose achievements went largely unnoticed for most of the 20th century,' which might be an exaggeration. But now Americans are showing great interest in him. Biographies and accounts of the voyage of the Endurance are being produced and are expected to sell quickly; the American Museum of Natural History is organizing a large exhibition, and Columbia Tristar is making a film about Shackleton's life. Some American managers have also adopted Shackleton as a role model. His admirers share stories of his achievements with admiration; they find lessons in leadership and communication from his life, and they refer to each other as 'speaking Shackleton'. The determined and resourceful Shackleton, with his reindeer sleeping bag (fur inside) and blubber-stove, has become a model for modern management consultants. Jim MacGregor, the managing partner of Abernathy MacGregor Frank in New York, chose Shackleton as a role model years ago. His firm specializes in 'communication aspects of mergers and acquisitions and corporate crises'. For example, 'this firm's plant blew up' or 'half the workforce has to go'. While Shackleton did work in public relations for a Glasgow steel company, it might be hard to see the connection between surviving on the last bit of albatross in freezing temperatures and managing a crisis in a company. 'Even if a company handles its crises well, it can still cause problems by communicating poorly about what it's doing,' says MacGregor. 'Shackleton is a model for management because of his qualities as a leader and communicator. He had his values in order. He was at his best when he and those dependent on him had a lot to lose -- like their lives. One of the most interesting decisions Shackleton made was to turn back when only 97 miles from the South Pole. That decision explained his credibility for the next expedition: the lives of his men were most important.' This refers to Shackleton's expedition to reach the South Pole in 1908 when, 97 miles short of their goal, with unexpected delays using up their supplies and limited time to return to their ship, Shackleton made the brave and difficult decision to turn back. In a crisis, says MacGregor, people want to know someone is in charge. While today managers often avoid responsibility, Shackleton was ready to take it. His 1914 expedition became legendary. His ship, the Endurance, was trapped for nine months in the ice and was finally crushed by ice floes. When it sank, Shackleton told his men, 'we should all eventually reach safety provided that you continue to do your utmost and to trust me'. From all the accounts and diaries they kept, it is clear that there was never a time that the Boss was not in charge. 'Shackleton thought everything through, planned for every possibility, kept his men informed, and asked for their opinions,' says MacGregor. 'He was adaptable, willing to let go when something was lost and start anew. We've built an effective set of principles here that Shackleton illustrates. Clients can relate to his story without feeling they're being criticized.' Shackleton believed that an explorer needs optimism, physical endurance, and patience. 'One of the hardest things to do in desperate situations is to do nothing, especially in America, a culture that is strongly against letting time solve problems,' says MacGregor. 'If you buy bonds and guess wrong on the interest rates, you hang in there and eventually you'll get your money back. To ""fix it"" and sell would mean a huge loss. Similarly, don't be afraid to change your plans if they're not working. If a new product is a failure, don't keep selling it.' Shackleton led by example. On the voyage back from the Endurance, he noticed Hurley, the expedition photographer, without gloves. He forced his own gloves on Hurley, saying if he didn't put them on he would throw them overboard. Someone else remembered him doing the same thing with a biscuit when they were near starving on the 1905 expedition: 'He said he'd leave it in the snow. Millions of pounds couldn't have bought that biscuit.' As Caroline Alexander, author of Endurance, the human account of that expedition, says: 'The public appetite for heroic endeavor is increasing. Shackleton shows that there is nothing heroic happening now. Everything else falls away and he is left standing, the true embodiment of the ideals that we long for nowadays.'"
CAE_15,"Text: 'Finding Food in Madagascar's Forests In the forests of Madagascar, there is a primate called the aye-aye that lives like a woodpecker. Both the woodpecker and the aye-aye search for insect larvae by making holes in wood. The woodpecker uses its beak to chisel and its long tongue to get the insects. The aye-aye uses its sharp teeth to gnaw into the wood and its long, thin third finger to scoop out the insects. Although scientists described the aye-aye's feeding habits over a hundred years ago, they have only recently learned how it finds insects inside the wood. Dr. Carl Erickson from Duke University studied the hunting skills of two male aye-ayes, Nosferatu and Poe, a female named Samantha, and her baby, Annabelle. He tested if they found insects by looking for visual signs, like holes on the wood's surface. Dr. Erickson gave the aye-ayes logs with several drilled holes. Some holes led to cavities with mealworms, while others were empty. The aye-ayes went directly to the cavities with food, showing they didn't need visual clues. Dr. Erickson also tested if they used smell or sound to find the insects. The aye-ayes could find mealworms even when the smell was blocked, and they also found dead, silent mealworms. If they weren't using sight, smell, or sound, how did they find the insects? Dr. Erickson found that aye-ayes could sense empty cavities as well as those with mealworms. When looking for food, an aye-aye taps the wood with its middle finger and focuses its large ears forward. Dr. Erickson suggests that the aye-aye uses echo-location, listening for echoes from the taps that show a hollow space below. It might also hear insects moving when disturbed by the tapping. The idea that the aye-aye takes the place of woodpeckers in Madagascar is interesting. However, there are birds like the Sickle-billed and Nuthatch Vangas that also search for insects in wood, so the woodpecker role might not be empty. The aye-aye can be seen as a mix of a woodpecker and an echo-locating bat. It also acts like a squirrel, as its teeth grow continuously like a squirrel's. In the wild, it has been seen gnawing through nut shells and using its long finger to get the nut meat.'"
CAE_19,"Text: 'Ordinary people, ordinary lives Most of us have photos of our grandparents, but how many of us know what their lives were like when they were young? Diaries give us only small glimpses, and family stories are often forgotten. What will our grandchildren know about us? We often plan to write things down but never do. We might leave videos instead of photos, but they are still just images. Hannah Renier has a solution: she writes autobiographies for other people, creating a hardback book of at least 20,000 words, with pictures if wanted. These books are not about famous people, but about ordinary ones. The idea came to her when she talked to her family and realized how much of the past was disappearing. ""When I started, I didn't take it as seriously as I do now,"" she says. ""People say they do it for their children or for the future, but they also enjoy it themselves."" The promise of privacy helps people be honest. ""I had the confidence to be honest,"" says a 62-year-old man who lost and then made a fortune. ""I was surprised at what came out. There were painful things, like my divorce."" ""I did it for my family, so they might learn something, but I haven't let my children read it yet. They were hurt by things in my life, and there are details I don't want them to know now. If they insist, I'll let them. But I'd rather they read it after I'm gone."" He also saw patterns from his childhood that led to repeated mistakes. Ms. Renier has noticed this in others too. ""It's amazing how many people are influenced by their parents,"" she says. ""Things taught in childhood affect them for life. They repeat behaviors, marry people their parents would like, or rebel."" ""Many disappointments come out. Even sixty years later, people regret or resent things with their parents. There is no age of reason. If people had issues in their youth, they still have them in middle age. They try to impress a parent who wasn't impressed, and some seek permission to say 'I can't stand my mother.'"" Ms. Renier is more of a recorder than an investigator. ""It's not for the public, and I'm not there to be nosy. People sometimes tell me things and then say, 'I'm not sure if that should go in.' I include it anyway—they can remove it when they see the draft. But generally, people want to be honest, warts and all."" ""It's not vanity publishing. It's not people saying, 'I've had such an interesting life the world needs to know.' Things are changing faster than ever, and we're losing sight of the past. It's a way to connect with our ancestors because families don't sit together as much anymore. People want a little immortality."" Each book involves up to 30 hours of recorded interviews, which Ms. Renier uses to write the life story, rearranging and interpreting it. Modern technology allows her to produce everything except the binding with gold lettering: you can choose your own color and title. Fascinating to the private audience for whom each book is made, the results are not about revealing secrets at any cost. Ms. Renier organizes her material logically and writes well; the final content is as good as its subject. The book looks high-quality and costs nearly £3,000, with extra copies at £25 each. She gets about 10 inquiries a week, but the cost, due to the time involved, deters many people. ""I thought it would be a more affordable product,"" she says. ""But the people I've worked with are often from wealthy backgrounds, readers of Harpers & Queen, where I advertise. They're the kind of people who would have had their portraits painted for their descendants.""'"

The Museum of Classical Archaeology has one of the few remaining collections of Greek and Roman sculpture casts in the world, with over six hundred pieces. Remember, none of the sculptures here are original. They are all accurate copies made from the originals, mostly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Museum is in a special gallery with great natural light. Plaster casts have many benefits: sculptures that were originally displayed together but are now in different museums across Europe can be seen together as they were meant to be. You can see almost all the famous Greek and Roman sculptures in one afternoon.

Cambridge Darkroom is a photography center with community darkrooms and a gallery that shows different photography exhibitions. We often run courses and workshops for all ages and skill levels, including a popular Beginner's Course, a shorter Induction Course, and Master Classes with guest photographers. We have a membership program that allows members to use our darkrooms. We also support young photographers (aged 12 to 16) to improve their skills with our Young Members scheme, led by our resident photographer. We sell photographic books, magazines, and a full range of photographic materials.

**C. Sedgwick Museum of Geology**

The Sedgwick Museum has a wonderful collection of fossil animals and plants, rocks, and minerals from all geological ages and from all over the world. It also has Britain's oldest complete geological collection, belonging to Dr. John Woodward (1665-1728). This includes nearly 10,000 rare and interesting specimens kept in their original early 18th-century cabinets. Adam Sedgwick, a Professor of Geology, greatly expanded the collections, creating an outstanding museum. The collection is organized by geological age, showing the major changes in life on Earth over time. The new Whewell Gallery displays beautiful minerals and gems, with detailed labels explaining their nature and modern uses.

This collection has over 400,000 oblique and vertical air photographs taken by university staff over the past 45 years. The University has its own aircraft at Cambridge Airport and does photographic work throughout Great Britain. The photographs are interesting as they provide a detailed, year-by-year record of the landscape, showing both the natural environment and human activity from prehistoric times to today. There is a small display in the entrance hall, and the knowledgeable library staff can help with inquiries. The photographs cannot be borrowed, but copies can usually be purchased. These are made to order and typically take about a month.

**E. Cambridge Medieval Brass Rubbing Centre**

The Cambridge Brass Rubbing Centre is the second oldest and longest-running center of its kind in the world, and it is a unique tourist attraction. Visitors can enjoy creating wall hangings by rubbing one of over a hundred different brass plates from the tombs of medieval knights and ladies. By making resin copies, known as facsimiles, the center has preserved the originals while making brass rubbing accessible to everyone. Brass plates, used as an alternative to tomb statues, spread from Germany across medieval Europe and Scandinavia. Many beautiful brasses were destroyed during various revolutions, but most of the remaining ones are in Britain, and the widest range can be seen at the Cambridge Centre."

**A. The Theatre Director**

Due to my unusual personal life, which I can't really be proud of, I've had 35 years of being around small children, and I've loved every moment. I fed the baby this morning, and for me, that's what being a father is all about. I'm very lucky with my children. We all enjoy the same things: opera, theatre, books, and music. This creates a strong bond, especially now that they are mostly grown up, and I've become more of a friend than a father. I don't believe in physical punishment. I've slapped my children in anger, but I don't support it. I may not have been a very attentive father, but I've always tried to be available. I'm here if they need me, but I let them call me. If you start chasing them to ask why they haven't been in touch, you make them feel guilty. My parents did that to me, and I would never do it to my children.

**B. The Advertising Executive**

I was young when my children were born, only about 25, and I admit I found the responsibilities and limitations quite annoying. It made me feel older quickly, but it also kept me young, which I value. As they became teenagers, they introduced me to things I might have lost touch with: music, youth culture, clothes. This has been very helpful for running the agency. I have never felt out of touch. When they were young, I was busy building my business, so I missed some things like their first concerts and sports days. I'm sad about that, but now there are benefits, like taking them on holidays to the south of France. They get along well with our friends and come to parties and advertising award ceremonies with us without feeling shy. I think it's an advantage that I do something they find glamorous and interesting.

**C. The Politician**

My first child was born just as I was about to be elected to the Greater London Council, and the others came soon after. My wife and I promised to make time for them, but as I became more politically active, time became a real issue. I insist on only accepting weekend meetings and public events where my kids can come with me. If I didn't, they would be left out. This way, they understand what I do when I'm not with them, and there's no feeling of Daddy disappearing. I've noticed more MPs bringing their kids to the House. Maybe we're all becoming more aware of the need to involve our children in our lives.

**D. The Writer**

My first marriage ended when Kate and Bonnie were quite young, so I had to think a lot about fatherhood. I made great efforts to stay in touch with the children. My ex-wife and I even tried living next door to each other for a while, so they could come and go as they wanted, but I think Kate and Bonnie found that confusing. Kate has said in interviews that I was always there for her, but I'm not sure I was a very good father. I was around a lot, but like many parents in the Seventies, I think I treated the kids as adults too soon. Kate was complaining recently that we were too liberal. I think I could have introduced more structure and order. Instead, I took a very relaxed approach. I regret that now. I still worry about my older daughters as much as I do about my youngest. In that way, your kids never leave you.

**E. The TV Presenter**

I was ready for kids. I had turned 30, met my wife, and we had a lovely house, so we thought, ""Why keep spending our money on new sofas every Saturday when we could have a child instead?"" Having my daughter Betty has made me understand who I am. You feel you're doing something special when you have a child, and you are. But you're also becoming just one more parent in a long line of parents. It's a great equalizer. I do get annoyed sometimes, but if ever there is a moment of irritation, it goes away with just one look at her. A baby's smile is the greatest way to make you feel better. It can melt a grown man."

CAE_46,"**Science Defying Gravity**

Journalist Tom Mumford joins students testing their theories in weightlessness. From the outside, it looked like a regular aircraft. The pilot informed the young passengers that it was a Boeing KC-135 refueling tanker, built in 1964, based on the Boeing 707. However, the 13 students from Europe and America who boarded were in for an extraordinary experience. Inside, the plane was a long white tunnel with few windows, lit by lights along the padded walls. Most seats were removed, except for a few at the back, where the nervous students sat.

For a year, these students competed with others across the continent to join this flight. The European Space Agency challenged them to propose creative experiments to conduct in weightless conditions. Those with the best ideas won a spot on this unique flight, which was like an incredible roller-coaster ride. For two hours, the Boeing's flight path would mimic a giant bird's erratic movements, soaring upwards and then diving towards Earth. The goal was to achieve weightlessness at the top of each curve. At 3,000 meters, the pilot cut the engines, and the plane continued to rise due to its momentum before gravity pulled it back down. In those few silent seconds between rising and falling, the aircraft and everything inside became weightless, making the students feel closer to the moon than Earth.

The aircraft took off smoothly, but any illusions of a normal flight vanished when the pilot put the Boeing into a steep 45-degree climb for about 20 seconds. The engines roared, blood rushed from our heads, and bodies were scattered across the cabin floor. Then the engines cut out, and weightlessness was almost immediate. For 20 seconds, we floated in silence: the floor felt like a trampoline, and a single step sent us towards the ceiling. We drifted aimlessly; directions like left or right, up or down, lost their meaning. Only gravity, by anchoring us, allows us to understand movement.

After ten seconds of freefall, the pilot pulled the aircraft out of its dive. Gravity's return was less sudden than its loss, but still abrupt enough to make some students land with a thud. With the first curve done, some turned green at the thought of 29 more. Thirty curves meant ten minutes of 'space time' for experiments. The Dutch students quickly studied their robotic cat, Leonardo, to learn how cats always land on their feet. They released their device, and one student managed to turn it belly-down using radio controls. However, during the next curve, another student accidentally landed on it.

Nearby, a German team from the University of Aachen studied how gravity absence affects metal joins, important for future space stations. Another team from Utah State University explored creating solar sails from thin liquid films hardened by ultraviolet sunlight. They spent the flight trying to produce these films in microgravity. They believe that once perfected, satellites could use solar sails to harness the sun's radiation like a yacht uses the wind.

After two hours of swinging between heaven and Earth, breakfast felt unstable, but the main feeling was excitement, not nausea. This sensation would last a long time. ""It was an unforgettable experience,"" said one student. ""I already wanted to become an astronaut, but now I want to even more."""
CAE_3,"**With the Trees, I Planted My Stake in New Zealand**

**Jonathon Porritt Talks to Danny Danziger**

Jonathon Porritt is the author of *Seeing Green - The Politics of Ecology*.

I had a unique time in my life when I didn't experience any summers. I traveled to New Zealand every summer from here, which is winter in New Zealand, so I had nine winters in a row. I enjoyed it because I like winter. My parents had an idea to buy a small piece of land for my brother, sister, and me to take care of. My mother said, ""If you plant trees on it, you can have it."" This way, we would always have a connection to New Zealand, which was nice since my father grew up there. They found a plot about 20 miles north of Auckland in a place called Rangitoupuni. The land wasn't very fertile, but it was good for planting trees.

I've always been interested in land. I spent a year in Australia working on sheep farms and doing various farming jobs, so the idea of planting trees appealed to me. I was eager to start, and my family became enthusiastic as we progressed. We began planting in 1968, and by the end of 1972, we had planted the entire 70 acres.

In 1968, it was a very rainy winter in New Zealand. It rained almost every day we were planting, and I don't think I've ever been wetter or colder for such a long time. Every morning was a challenge: getting ready for another day of planting. Coming out of the Land Rover warm and dry, with rain pouring down, wearing a damp anorak from the day before, and struggling with wet boots and slippery laces.

In the first year, I worked with an experienced tree-planter, which was helpful since I had never planted trees seriously before. You carry a planting bag around your neck filled with as many trees as possible. When the bag is full, it's difficult, but it gets easier as it empties. The hardest part was getting the lines straight. You decide the spacing for the trees, line up three poles across a long distance, and those poles guide your lines. Once aligned, you plant down the line, turn around, and come back.

I enjoy hard physical work, and it made me fit. After a while, you can plant trees almost automatically, finding a rhythm and using the fewest spade strokes needed to dig a hole. This rhythm is common in many farming jobs, where you train your body to perform standard moves, making the process easy: taking a tree from the bag, digging a hole, planting it, stamping it in, and moving on.

Mentally, it's fascinating. Your mind starts to wander, and you think about life and the natural world. Many ideas that have influenced my life began during those days. I've returned to New Zealand four times since then to see the trees grow, which is satisfying because I planted them and feel connected to their success. I worry when I read about storms or droughts in New Zealand, but the trees are now 20 years old and doing well.

In 1984, I took a break from teaching and returned alone for three months. I wrote my first book, *Seeing Green*, there. There's a simple cabin on the tree farm with just a bed, table, and chair. I wrote in the mornings, pruned trees in the afternoons, and did research in the evenings. My connection to that area is still very strong. It's the place where I feel most connected to the earth, a powerful bond."
CAE_10,"**BRINGING UP BADGERS**

""What now?"" I thought as a helper handed me a cardboard box. My husband Derek and I turned our dairy farm in Somerset into an ""open farm"" six years ago, and we are known for caring for orphaned animals. The noise from the box—a mix of a cackle and a bark—was unfamiliar. Inside, I found three small grey badger cubs, each about eight inches long. Their coats were like velvet, and their milky eyes looked up at me from their black-and-white striped heads. I had never seen badger cubs before. Most are born between mid-January and mid-March and spend their early life underground. If orphaned, they usually die of starvation and are never found. These three were brought in by builders who accidentally dug into their sett while laying drain pipes. The mother was found dead with her babies still suckling her. The cubs were healthy but cold and whimpering. After removing their fleas, I took them into the farmhouse kitchen and placed them by the stove for warmth. There were two females, Primrose and Bluebell, and a male, Willow. At first, I fed them with a syringe, but I had to wipe each cub with a warm cloth to mimic the mother licking them. This helped them empty their bowels and bladder. For the first few days, they were fed every four hours. Within a week, they were drinking from a bottle and moving around, though shakily. With each other for company and a heated pad as a substitute ""mum,"" they seemed content. 

Three weeks later, I noticed Willow was lethargic, though he was still eating normally. It was a warning sign. I should have acted immediately; the next morning, I found him dead. The vet's post-mortem showed Willow died from a lung infection. When bottle-feeding, it's important not to let an animal drink too fast, as liquid can enter the lungs. In Willow's case, this caused an infection that was hard to treat, even with antibiotics, in such a small animal. Disheartened, I continued caring for the others. Six days later, a local farmer brought me another male cub, abandoned by its mother. He knew she wouldn't return because the area had been disturbed too much. Willow II joined us. At six weeks, he was about two weeks younger than the females. I soon discovered why his mother left him. He was very difficult to feed. To get him to drink, I had to move the bottle's teat around and squeeze it. After 10 minutes, he would finally latch on as if he hadn't drunk all day. By the end of April, the females were eating creamed rice and then anything. Willow was different. He gave up the bottle but couldn't eat without walking through his food or sitting in it. Eventually, I offered him a sausage, which he slowly ate. After a week of sausages, he was ready for other foods. At nearly five months old, they were all eating cereals for breakfast, a meat and vegetable meal for lunch, and fruit, nuts, cheese, hard-boiled eggs, and sunflower seeds in the evening. Badgers usually eat 60% earthworms, plus beetles, bugs, baby rabbits, mice, voles, and plant shoots or roots. My badgers were better off than others that year; the summer was very hot, making it hard to dig for earthworms.

By August, my badgers became nocturnal and went for walks only at dusk or night. We often walked through the cider orchard, where they played and chased each other's tails. As ""human badgers,"" we joined in. I learned to avoid their playful nips, but Derek, who joined us less often, didn't. His reactions to being nipped were as colorful as his bruises. During these walks, I saw other badgers in our field. They were likely extending their territories to find food, as badgers are territorial and can kill intruders. We were warned they might enter our badger pen and harm the cubs, so we covered the gate with sheet metal. The local press took pictures of me walking the badgers, and the response led us to start an appeal to build a sett on the farm for them. With advice, we designed their new home. Our son Daniel drew up the plans, and we built a sett with tunnels, an enclosure, and a badger gate facing their usual walk direction. It had three chambers, one larger than the others, with a glass side for viewing from a darkened enclosure. As the sett took shape, the badgers explored it before their walks. Eventually, they forgot the walks, excited by the tunnels and bedding. The building cost more than expected, but a local bus company, Badgerline, sponsored part of the appeal, and local firms donated materials. Everyone wanted to see the badgers with a home. One evening, they finally moved in. After watching them for a while, we left them to settle. Half an hour later, I returned to find them asleep in their chambers. These days, I don't walk with them as often, especially since they wake up at midnight. We see Primrose occasionally (she joined a neighboring sett), but Bluebell and Willow II still greet us before rushing off into the night. This is their territory now, a place they know well and a home they have accepted."
CAE_67,"**In search of true north - and the man behind Halley's comet**

Dr. Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, wants to follow in the footsteps of Sir Edmund Halley to study compass variations. Anjana Ahuja reports.

Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) is famous for the comet named after him. However, one of his major achievements was mapping the 'variations of the compass', now called 'declination'. Declination is the angle between magnetic north and true north. Without knowing this, sailors couldn't accurately use their compasses to find their way across the oceans. Halley, one of the few people paid to do scientific research at the time, set out to map declination in the North and South Atlantic. His first trip to the Cape Verde Islands was cut short due to crew problems, but he tried again. This time, he traveled to Rio de Janeiro, South Georgia, Newfoundland, and back to England. In 1701, Halley published a map showing compass variations in the Western and Southern Oceans. This map was very useful to sailors for over a century until changes in Earth's magnetic field made it outdated.

Dr. Clark, who enjoys sailing, plans to celebrate the 300th anniversary of Halley's journey by retracing the route of the ship Paramore. He needs to raise £70,000 for the trip, and Sir Vivian Fuchs, known for leading the first expedition across Antarctica, is supporting him. Dr. Clark became interested in Halley while working at Halley Station in Antarctica, where he read about the scientist's life. Halley was not only an astronomer but also did research in geophysics and helped Sir Isaac Newton with his famous work, Principia Mathematica.

Dr. Clark believes recreating the voyage will honor Halley's achievements. The new expedition, called 'In the Wake of the Paramore', will also have scientific value. It will involve taking measurements similar to Halley's, but with more accurate tools. These measurements are important because Earth's magnetic field is always changing. The data collected will help improve the current model of Earth's magnetic field, known as the international geomagnetic reference field. Dr. Clark explains that it's common to measure the size of the magnetic field but not its direction, which requires knowing true north. They will use global positioning satellites to find true north. The British Geological Survey and the United States Navy will provide instruments for the expedition. A Danish satellite will also be taking similar measurements, and Dr. Clark hopes his data will fill any gaps in the satellite's coverage of the Atlantic Ocean.

Halley's journey was the first scientific expedition at sea, and he was the first civilian made a naval captain for this purpose. Dr. Clark has the experience needed for this journey, having spent two years in Antarctica and worked in the geomagnetic group at the British Geological Survey. He has also sailed from Rio de Janeiro to England. The expedition will be done in four stages with different crews. Dr. Clark is committed to the project, saying, 'I am prepared to give up my life for eight months to do this, so I suppose some people might think I'm obsessed. But I wouldn't want to sail across the Atlantic again without a good reason. Halley, and his fascinating life, have given me a real sense of purpose.'"
CAE_27,"**Power Dressing in Peacocks**

Every summer, peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire show off their beautiful tails to the female peahens. This display raises a question that puzzled Charles Darwin: in a world where survival is tough, why do peacocks have such extravagant tails? How do they manage to survive with them?

Zoologist Marion Petrie and her team from the Open University are studying these peacocks to find answers, a century after Darwin's death. Darwin believed that animals evolved through natural selection, meaning the fittest survive and reproduce. However, he also suggested a different idea called 'sexual selection' to explain the peacock's tail. He thought females chose mates based on beauty alone.

Darwin's friend, Alfred Russel Wallace, disagreed. He believed that if peahens chose the most beautiful males, there must be a reason beyond just looks. The tails might signal some hidden quality that helps survival.

Today, the debate continues because studying peafowl behavior is challenging. At Whipsnade, 200 peacocks live in conditions similar to the wild, providing a unique chance to study them. Petrie and her team focus on two main questions: Do peahens really prefer males with the showiest tails? And do these males have other advantages, as Wallace suggested?

Observations show that peahens do prefer males with more eye-spots on their tails, which are linked to tail length. These males attract more mates. However, it's still unclear if these males are better in other ways.

William Hamilton from Oxford University proposed that showy male birds might be healthier and free of parasites, which their plumage might indicate. While this is true for some birds, Petrie's team hasn't been able to test this in Whipsnade peacocks yet. This year, they are comparing the offspring of attractive and less attractive males to see if the former grow faster or are healthier. If so, it would support Wallace's idea that female choice is practical.

There's another theory by R.A. Fisher called 'Fisher's Runaway.' It suggests that if a female chooses a male with a slightly better tail, their offspring will inherit these traits. Over generations, this preference could lead to increasingly extravagant tails, supporting Darwin's idea of 'beauty for beauty's sake.'"
CAE_66,"**THE BOAT OF MY DREAMS**

Tom Cunliffe believes the best boat design should mix old and new ideas. He did this with his own boat, 'The Westerman'. This week, the Summer Boat Show in London is full of modern yachts with the latest technology. Most of these yachts are based on a design change from 25 years ago. In contrast, my boat is quietly anchored on a tidal creek on the south coast. It was designed last year, but it looks like it could be 100 years old. Some might think I'm a romantic dreamer, and maybe I am, but this boat uses both traditional design and modern technology. 

Modern technology is essential in boat design and building today, but it often separates sailors from the real experiences of being at sea. These are the experiences they wanted to find by sailing. I'm not saying sailors should suffer, but I believe boats should have basic comforts like a coal stove for warmth and comfortable beds. However, if every sail operates automatically, why go sailing? Handling sails is part of a sailor's life. Also, why move the steering from the safe back of the boat to a risky spot in the middle? This change is often made to create more space inside, like a big cabin on a cruise ship. For me, a boat should be a boat, not a floating house.

When I bought my previous boat, Hirta, for a TV race around Britain, the former owner said it had comfort but no luxury. During my time with Hirta, I learned he was right. Her sails were heavy, and she had no running water, little electricity, no fridge, no central heating, no winches, and no electronics, especially for navigation. Yet, she was the easiest and kindest boat I ever sailed. However, classic boats need a lot of care. After a back injury, I realized I had to let her go. I couldn't find a suitable new boat, so I decided to build one from scratch.

The Westerman has never let me down. Designer Nigel Irens and his assistant Ed Burnett are skilled with computer design, but Irens first sketched the boat on a napkin and later used a computer. After creating a design, he carved a model, like in the old days. We reviewed the model and made changes on the computer. The final design was perfect. The finished boat has crossed the North Atlantic and won four out of six races. She looks timeless, sails smoothly, and her interior, made from reclaimed wood, feels peaceful. This is because she was designed as a sailing boat first, without focusing on interior furniture. This traditional method proves that you don't need to follow trends to be satisfied and that history can teach us valuable lessons. Built with wood treated with a special glue, she is completely waterproof. She has all the advantages of a fiberglass boat but looks, feels, and sails like a classic wooden boat."
CAE_44,"**RETREAT, RELAX, RECHARGE**

Health farms and country house hotels with spa facilities are doing very well. We asked five journalists to visit some of these places.

**A. HENLOW GRANGE**

I was excited to visit Henlow Grange for six days because I was tired and needed to relax. My room in the large 18th-century house was very comfortable, and I felt calm right away. On the first day, I did nothing and slept a lot. From the second day, I joined body conditioning classes like stretch and tone, yoga, and body alignment. The instructors are very skilled, and I felt more flexible as the week went on. They offer many treatments, including aromatherapy, seaweed baths, manicures, and pedicures. The one-hour facial made me feel like a new person. The staff in the treatment rooms were friendly and professional. The atmosphere is full of energy and enthusiasm. Henlow is planning a big renovation this year, adding a half-size Olympic swimming pool and a Light Diet Room. You can also ride bicycles around the grounds. If you prefer to relax, you can read a magazine or take a peaceful walk in the garden. During my stay, my mood and appetite improved. I left feeling wonderful and full of energy, which lasted a long time. I definitely want to visit again. This is the perfect break for a stressed working woman. Save Room 5 for me! Marcella D'Argy Smith

**B. SHRUBLAND HALL**

The calm and relaxing atmosphere of this stately home was clear from the moment I climbed the large staircase to the reception area. The Hall has a beautifully decorated library, a charming conservatory, and lots of space, so you don't have to talk to anyone if you don't want to. On arrival, everyone gets a medical check, including weight and blood pressure. We were all called patients, which felt strange since I'm healthy. However, I was impressed that a shoulder problem found during the check was immediately shared with the fitness instructor, and we worked on it in group workshops and an extra individual session. Each patient gets a specific diet. I lost weight without fasting, but I was hungry enough to get a headache on the second day. My typical daily menu was grapefruit and honey for breakfast, a choice of salads for lunch, and exotic fruit, yogurt, and hot broth for supper. If you're not fasting or on a light diet, you eat in the main dining hall, where the food is tasty and nicely presented, so you don't suffer too much! You have a massage or water therapy on alternate days. All extra treatments are reasonably priced. Liz Gregory

**C. CAREYS MANOR**

Careys is not a health farm and doesn't claim to be. It's a lovely old manor with inviting log fires and a spacious lounge. If you're counting calories, you'll have to skip the gourmet food. The French chef creates rich sauces and delightful creamy desserts. Luckily, the hotel has a fully-equipped gym and soft-water pool to work off some of the tempting treats. (You can choose a 'health-conscious' diet if you want to lose weight.) There is a spa bath, steam room, Swiss shower, sauna, and treatment rooms. A big attraction is the sports injury clinic. I got expert advice on an old shoulder injury. The physiotherapist recommended good posture, exercises, and massage. Careys is comfortable and luxurious, relaxed and calm. If you want to explore, there is beautiful countryside around. Beverly D'Silva

**D. CLIVEDEN**

Cliveden is a grand country home and a five-star hotel that treats guests like royalty. It offers health and beauty treatments, a well-equipped gym, saunas, swimming pool, tennis, horse riding, and more. There are beautiful woodland walks and gardens on the 376-acre National Trust estate. Waldo's, a highly-acclaimed restaurant, offers dishes that are hard to resist. It took me half an hour to read the dinner menu; the choice was amazing. The meal was wonderful, especially the sticky-toffee pudding with banana ice-cream. I went to bed a happy woman! The next morning, I spent a few hours in the gym to burn off some calories before my next meal. In the Pavilion, I enjoyed a facial with gentle heat and essential oils, followed by an aromatherapy massage. I thought of all the other reports my fellow journalists would make about fitness assessments, workouts, and beauty treatments to tone and firm the body. Cliveden has all these if you want to use them—before enjoying yourself at Waldo's. Kay Letch

**E. SPRINGS HYDRO**

The best and worst thing about Springs Hydro is the carrot cake. The best because it's the most delicious I've ever tasted. The worst because it's a large piece with 360 calories, which is not good if you want to lose weight. You have been warned! The second best thing is the fabulous aromatherapy massage. I chose relaxing oils, fell asleep twice during the massage, and had my most refreshing night's sleep in years. The premises are modern and purpose-built, efficiently run, with up-to-date facilities and luxurious bedrooms. There are plenty of therapists and beauty rooms, so it's easy to schedule appointments.

CAE_22,"**NATURAL TALENTS**

In the seven million years since humans split from chimpanzees, we haven't changed much genetically. We are still more than 98% identical to chimps. On an evolutionary scale, what makes humans different from animals is a recent development. Our ability to make art and other uniquely human traits must come from a small part of our genes. This means that the differences between us and animals are mostly small. For example, both humans and animals use tools: chimpanzees use sticks, and sea otters use rocks. Monkeys have simple language with different sounds for 'leopard', 'eagle', and 'snake'. These findings show that there are few absolute differences between us and animals, except for art.

If human art comes from a unique genetic trait, it's interesting that our ancestors didn't create art for most of the time since they split from chimps. Early art forms might have been wood carvings or body painting, but these don't last over time. Clear evidence of human art appears with the Cro-Magnons around 35,000 years ago, with cave paintings, statues, necklaces, and musical instruments.

If we say our recent creativity sets us apart, how is our art different from animal creations? Three main differences are often suggested: human art is non-utilitarian, made for aesthetic pleasure, and learned rather than instinctive.

First, as Oscar Wilde said, ""All art is quite useless."" This means human art doesn't help us survive or reproduce, unlike most animal behaviors. While human art can communicate thoughts or feelings, it doesn't pass on genes. In contrast, birdsong helps defend territory or attract mates, which does pass on genes. By this measure, human art seems different.

The second claim is that only human art is motivated by aesthetic pleasure. We can't ask birds if they enjoy their songs, but they mostly sing during breeding season, suggesting they sing for reasons other than pleasure. Again, human art seems unique here.

The third distinction is that human art is learned, not instinctive. Each human group has its own art styles that are learned. For example, songs in Tokyo and Paris are different, but people can learn each other's songs. Some birds, however, inherit their songs and would sing them even without hearing them. It's like a French baby raised in Japan singing the French national anthem without learning it.

The role of learning in human art is clear in how quickly styles change. Geese honked 2,000 years ago as they do today, but human art changes rapidly. Even a casual museum-goer can tell a twentieth-century painting from the Mona Lisa. Experts can often identify when and who painted a work. However, they might mistake the works of two mid-twentieth-century artists, Congo and Betsy, who were actually chimpanzees. Congo made up to 33 paintings in one day and got upset when his pencil was taken away. Their paintings were shown in a 1957 exhibition in London, and most were sold, which many human artists can't claim.

These paintings by chimps blur the lines between human art and animal activities. Like human art, the ape paintings had no practical purpose and were made for the painter's satisfaction. You might argue that human art is different because it's meant to communicate, but even some famous human art was created for the artist's personal satisfaction."
CAE_39,"**An Exciting Adventure**

The Taklamakan Desert in western China is one of the last unexplored places on earth. It is also one of the most dangerous. Charles Blackmore crossed it and lived to tell the tale. There are very few big adventures left and very few heroes. Children's stories used to be about them—brave explorers with sunburnt skin and eyes narrowed from looking into the distance on their journeys into the unknown. These days, you don't find such people in stories, let alone in real life. Or so I thought until I met Charles Blackmore.

Blackmore's great adventure was leading an expedition across the Taklamakan Desert in western China. Its name means 'once entered you never come out', but local people call it the Desert of Death. He remembered the dangers and excitement of that amazing journey while sitting calmly at home. The team he led included four Britons (one was the medical officer), an American photographer, four Chinese experts on the area, 30 camels, and six camel handlers. It turned out that the camel handlers had never worked with camels before; they were long-distance truck drivers. This misunderstanding could have been very dangerous and put the expedition at risk.

This group set out to cross 1,200 kilometers of the world's least hospitable desert, and Charles Blackmore has written a fascinating account of their journey. At the time, he was about to leave the Army after 14 happy years. He started the expedition for fun, to fill a gap in his life, to prove something. 'I had always thought I'd spend my whole life in the Army. I had been offered a promotion, but suddenly I felt I wanted to see who Charles Blackmore really was, outside all that. It was a big risk. Tina, my wife, was very worried that I wouldn't come back as nobody had ever done that route; we went into it blind. In the end, it took 59 days to cross from west to east, and the desert was very kind to us.'

Anyone reading his extraordinary account of that crossing will wonder at the use of the word 'kind'. The team suffered terrible hardships: dysentery; extreme temperatures; severe thirst and dehydration; the loss of part of their precious water supply. 'But', Blackmore explains, 'when we were at the limits of our endurance and the camels had gone without water for seven days, we managed to find some. We didn't experience the Taklamakan's legendary sandstorms. And we never faced the raw, biting desert cold that would have totally stopped us. That's not to say that we weren't fighting against challenges the whole time. The fine sand got into everything, especially blisters and wounds. The high dunes were torture to climb, for us and for the heavily loaded camels, which often rolled over onto us.

'What drove me on more than anything else was the need to survive. We had no backup plan. Neither our budget nor time allowed one. No aircraft ever flew over us. Once we got into the sandhills, we were completely on our own. 'I knew I had the mental strength for the trip, but I was very scared of my physical ability to do it. I remember day one—we sat at the edge of the desert, and it was so hot that you couldn't breathe. I thought, ""We've got to do it now!"" At that moment, I was a very scared man.'

If it was like that at the beginning, how did they feel towards the end? 'When you've walked for 1,000 kilometers, you're not going to give up. You've endured so much; you've got so much behind you. We were very thin, but very muscular and strong despite our physical exhaustion. My body was well-toned, and my legs were like pistons. I could walk over anything.'

Midway through the book, Blackmore describes lying in the desert, looking up at a full moon, thinking of his family. How aware was he of the ordeal it must have been for them? 'Inside me, there's someone trying to find peace with himself. When I have doubts about myself now, I go back to the image of the desert and think, well, we managed to pull that together. As a personal achievement, I feel prouder of that expedition than of anything else I've done. Yet in terms of a lifetime's achievement, I think of my family and the happiness we share—against that measure, the desert does not compare.'

Has Charles Blackmore found peace? 'I yearn for the challenge—for the open spaces—the resolve of it all. We were lifted by the sense of purpose. I find it difficult now to be part of the uniformity of modern life.'"
CAE_18,"Life was becoming overwhelming for Susan Harr, so she decided to unplug her gadgets and enjoy manual work again. Everyone loves technology because it gives us gadgets that make life easier and give us more free time. However, we've been subtly convinced that technology is essential, which might not be true. Using our hands doesn't harm the environment, unlike machines. A recent problem with my word processor, which cost a lot to fix, made me question if gadgets are worth the trouble. Are we as dependent on technology as we think? Gradually, I've been letting go of household gadgets as they break down. This makes me wonder what 'extra time' technology really gives us. Is it just time to buy more gadgets? If so, the marketers have tricked us. When my machine started making strange noises, even when unplugged, I left it in the backyard. Now, I'm not tied to a noisy machine and can take my time sewing by hand. I was always a bit scared of electric machines that move quickly towards your fingers. Plus, I can easily take my sewing with me anywhere. Of course, there are some gadgets I wouldn't want to live without. A year without a washing machine showed me how useful it is. But losing some gadgets has been surprisingly nice. We were watching too much TV, so I returned the rented color TV and went back to a small black-and-white one. It's hard on the eyes but makes us focus on what's worth watching. Now, we spend more time walking the dog, reading, talking, or doing other hobbies. One of my hobbies is sewing, and I stopped using my old sewing machine, which is now a plant stand. I can't afford a new one, so I sew by hand. We've come to believe we can't live without technology, but we don't want to give it up. We feel sorry for past generations who worked hard without machines. Computers now do amazing calculations and entertain us. But sewing by hand is not boring; it's relaxing. I can sew and listen to the radio or talk with family and friends. If it's a simple task, I can watch TV and feel less guilty about sitting in front of it. It's nice to sit by the fire and sew with a cup of tea. I used to think sewing by hand was hard work, but it's actually soothing and satisfying. I find things get done quickly, and life slows down to my own pace. I'm also free from the rush of modern life. I've taken back control of my sink, where I enjoy washing dishes and daydreaming. Now, I look around the house and wonder if we really need the freezer, microwave, or lawnmower. We could save a lot of money by doing without electric lights!"
CAE_62,"Charles Hurst is a cabinet-maker who earns his living by creating beautifully crafted furniture. When I meet him at his workshop in East London, he seems to be in a hurry. He greets me quickly and says, ""Well, fire away then!"" It's not clear if he's naturally brusque or just shy. His workshop is busy, filled with half-made furniture and colorful planks of wood. Hurst has been in this business for ten years and has a great reputation. His schedule is always full months in advance, even though he doesn't advertise. People know that if they want quality furniture like cupboards, tables, or bookcases, Hurst is the person to go to.

Finding a furniture-maker isn't hard, but finding one like Hurst, who focuses on clean, simple designs, is rare. ""There are few real cabinet-makers now,"" Hurst says. He is disappointed by some modern furniture and criticizes mass-produced, low-quality pieces. His quest for perfection and his talent are keys to his success. Hurst is confident in his skills, saying, ""I have a huge natural ability."" He is self-taught and learned by asking the right questions.

Most of his work comes from private clients, and some return for more. ""You end up doing the whole of their house. That is very satisfying,"" he says. However, he admits that not all client relationships are smooth. He prefers clients who know exactly what they want.

Hurst is also willing to praise others when deserved. He acknowledges that some people are better than him and admires their work. However, he criticizes craftsmen who take too long to make a single piece and students who try to make fashion statements with their furniture. For Hurst, furniture should be practical and usable.

Despite his confidence, Hurst is humble about his work. As I leave, he says, ""After all, I am only making furniture."""
CAE_49,"Text: 'Three theories about sleep People spend about one-third of their lives asleep. It seems clear, therefore, that sleep has an important role. However, what that role might be is still debated. Scientists do not fully agree on why we spend so much time sleeping. There are three main theories. The most popular theory says that the main reasons for sleep are related to our body. It suggests that we sleep to keep our body healthy. In other words, while we sleep, biological processes work to fix any damage done during the day and to restore our full efficiency. However, a second theory focuses more on the learning benefits of sleep. This theory suggests that sleep helps us process the information we learn during the day, and claims that, without sleep, learning would not happen. A third popular theory is about energy, saying that we need sleep to recharge our energy, so we have enough for the next day.'"
CAE_31,"**ECCENTRICS**

An eccentric is someone whose behavior is unusual and who does not follow the accepted norms of society. This raises the question, ""What is normal?"" Most of us have our own quirks and oddities. It could be a passion for entering newspaper competitions, collecting beer mats, or writing letters to the press about various topics. Eccentricity is about expressing our individuality. Inside us, there is a constant conflict between wanting to be unique and wanting to fit in. It's like having two trains on the same track, one called individualism and the other conformity. For most people, conformity is stronger. We want to be accepted, loved, and feel connected with others more than we want to stand out.

People with unusual hobbies or behaviors often gather together. They form clubs and hold meetings to share their interests, which others might see as odd. Being part of a group, even a small one, is comforting. We all feel a tension between individualism and conformity. While we often follow the crowd, we don't like to admit it. We want to show our individuality, like when someone at a bar says, ""I say what I think,"" or when a new acquaintance says, ""You must take me as you find me.""

At any time, we can choose to express our individuality. Many successful people have done this. For example, Bob Dylan, the American singer, said, ""When you feel in your gut what you are doing and then pursue it without backing down, you'll mystify people."" However, this self-conscious assertion of individuality is not eccentricity, at least not at first. When a pop singer wears strange clothes for publicity or a society hostess makes shocking comments to get noticed, that is not eccentricity. But if they continue these actions until they become a natural part of who they are, then they might be considered eccentric.

The key to eccentricity is its naturalness. Eccentrics do not try to be odd; they simply are. They are not concerned with public opinion and are barely aware of it. This makes them different from enthusiasts, practical jokers, criminals, exhibitionists, and recluses, who are all very aware of society. Eccentrics go their own way, regardless of what others think."
CAE_58,"**Natural Books**

We asked four well-known naturalists to share the wildlife book that has influenced them the most.

**A Geoffrey Lean**

Choosing the author was easy for me. As an environmental journalist, I've been lucky to meet some of the great thinkers in this field. Among them, Barbara Ward stands out. She was deeply involved in environmental issues in post-war Europe and developed her own powerful philosophy from her experiences. As a young journalist, she helped me understand the field better than anyone else. Choosing the book was harder. It could have been ""Only One Earth"" or ""Progress for a Small Planet."" But for me, ""The Home of Man"" is her most important work. It focuses on the rapid growth of cities and the major themes she dedicated her life to. It's a passionate call for what we now call 'sustainable human development.' I've read many books since, but none have matched it.

**B Linda Bennett**

When I read ""Signals for Survival"" by Niko Tinbergen, I can almost hear the calls of herring gulls and remember the smell of the colony. This book wonderfully explains animal communication through words and pictures. After reading it, watching a gull colony changes from chaos to a well-organized social structure. You can see which birds are partners and recognize families later in the season. Niko Tinbergen was a respected behaviorist who wanted to share his findings with everyone. His work with wildlife artist Eric Ennion in this book was inspiring. Ennion's art, based on years of observing birds, shows how one gull is aggressive and another is peaceful with just a few lines and colors. This is the work of a true field naturalist.

**C Lee Durrell**

""My Family and Other Animals"" by Gerald Durrell is the book that has most influenced my life. It led me to a wonderful husband and a career in conservation. This book confirmed my love for the natural world. I first read it while researching animal sounds in Madagascar. I was facing many challenges, but reading this book made everything seem brighter. It beautifully combines animals, people, joy, and beauty, showing a world worth saving. Some say humans are the worst species because of the harm we've done. But I remember Gerald as a boy in the book, seeing the world as a family, with all its good and bad parts connected. This is a concept we all need to understand.

**D Bruce Pearson**

I found ""The Shell Bird Book"" by James Fisher in my school library soon after it was published in 1966. I was immediately drawn to the 48 color plates of birds by Eric Ennion. These images captured my attention. I already had other bird books and had spent holidays learning to identify birds, which encouraged me to start sketching them. But ""The Shell Bird Book"" offered much more. It included chapters on bird migration, the history of birds in Britain, and even birds in music, literature, and art. This wide range of information and the exciting images led me to appreciate birds and nature more broadly. The book showed me that my emotional and creative response to nature was as valid as a scientific one. Since art was a stronger subject for me than math or physics, I saw new opportunities opening up."
CAE_37,"**DO REVIEWS SELL BOOKS?**

We asked five top British publishers about how book reviews affect a book's success. Here is what they said:

**Publisher A**  
Reviews are crucial for publishers; they are the first part of the newspaper we look at. The Book Marketing Council found that when people were asked why they bought a book, more mentioned reviews than any other reason (like ads, word of mouth, or bookshop displays). Authors and publishers react differently to reviews. Both dislike getting no reviews, but publishers are usually calmer about bad reviews. They believe that any mention, whether good or bad, can boost sales as readers decide to see for themselves. Publishers enjoy reviews that match their own opinion of a book since they are often the first to read it.

**Publisher B**  
Publishers and the press both care about book review pages, but their needs are different. Newspapers and magazines want to entertain their readers, while publishers want their books reviewed positively. Book reviewing is better now than 40 years ago, being more diverse and less elitist. However, there is still a tendency to overlook paperbacks, which are read by most people. Weekly roundups aren't enough, even if done well. Publishers shouldn't complain too much, though. Like readers and writers, they need reviews, which are a cost-effective way to make a book and author known. A lively review by a trusted name can boost sales, especially if there are several reviews. Fame helps get a book into readers' hands.

**Publisher C**  
Reviews are vital for literary publishing; without them, we would lose an essential source of life. We publish books by authors who are not well-known, so we rely on literary editors to give space to our books. Good reviews are worth more than any advertisement because readers trust that they are not influenced by the publisher's marketing budget. Good reviews can launch a book and a career, but they need to be combined with other factors like word-of-mouth recommendations, support from the book trade, and smart marketing.

**Publisher D**  
The relationship between publishing and reviewing in Britain is unclear. In the US, the New York Times can make or break a book with one review. Here, bookshops often don't seem to pay much attention to reviews. It can take 20 years of great reviews for people to start reading a good writer's work. Yet, some poorly reviewed books or books not reviewed at all are the biggest sellers. It's unpredictable, though non-fiction reviews often focus more on what the reviewer knows about the subject than the book itself.

**Publisher E**  
All publishers and writers dream of long, positive reviews. But do they sell books? I once published a biography that got great reviews, but it didn't sell because people felt they didn't need to buy the book after reading the reviews. Does the reviewer's name matter? Thirty years ago, if certain reviewers praised a book, the public listened. Now, it's more about the choice of an unexpected reviewer or the power, wit, or originality of the review that encourages people to buy the book."
CAE_2,"**WEATHERVANE MAKER**

The making of weathervanes is an ancient skill, dating back to early Egyptian times. Today, this craft is still alive in the workshop of Graham Smith. He is one of the few people in the country who make hand-cut weathervanes. Graham's designs are individually created and tailored to his customers' specific needs. ""That way I can produce a unique personalized item,"" he explains. ""Many of my customers are women buying presents for their husbands. They want a special gift that represents the man's business or hobbies.""

This is very different from the traditional cockerel, the most common weathervane design. Graham's first weathervane was not a cockerel but a witch on a broomstick, which he made as a surprise present for his wife. Friends admired it and began asking him to make weathervanes for them. ""I realized that the possibilities for designs were limitless,"" he says. Graham decided to focus on a weathervane business. He had trained as a precision engineer and worked in that field for 15 years. Then he and his wife, Liz, decided to swap roles—she went to work as an architectural assistant, and he stayed home to look after the children and build the business. That was five years ago, and he has no regrets about his new path. ""My previous work didn't have an artistic element, but this is exciting and creative,"" he says. ""I really enjoy the design side.""

Graham has now perfected over 100 original designs. He works with very fine detail, always getting approval for the silhouette design from the customer before hand-cutting it. Graham also keeps many traditional designs in stock, as they are as popular as the custom ones. ""It seems that people are attracted to hand-crafting,"" Graham says. ""They like the chance to get something a little bit different.""

Graham has no plans to expand, as he wants to keep the business as a rural craft. ""I have found my place in the market. People love the individuality, and I get a lot of satisfaction from seeing a simple shape turn into something almost lifelike,"" he says. ""For centuries, weathervanes have helped communities stay in touch with the weather by showing changes in wind direction,"" he explains. ""Nowadays, with more people moving to the country, they want to add a unique touch to their homes. This has helped crafts like mine.""

Graham has become increasingly busy, supplying flat-packed weathervanes to clients worldwide. American and Danish buyers, in particular, are interested. ""Pricing,"" he explains, ""depends on the complexity of the design."" His most recent request was for a curly-coated dog. Whatever the occasion, Graham can create a gift with a difference."
CAE_68,"**Beginner Takes All**

Before it was even published, *The Horse Whisperer* was the most talked-about book of the year. This first novel by British screenwriter Nicholas Evans earned him record-breaking amounts of money. Here, he shares his inspiration and success story.

The start of the year was tough for Nicholas Evans, who was a screenwriter, producer, and aspiring director. Things went wrong when *Life and Limb*, a film he had been working on for months, suddenly fell apart. He was worried because it had been two years since he last earned any money, and this film was his only hope to keep the bank happy. A sensible person might have found a job, perhaps returning to television work. Instead, Evans made a bold decision. He bought a ticket to America to research his first novel for three months.

The idea for the story had been with him for a while, inspired by a farrier he met on Dartmoor. The farrier told him about a calm horse that suddenly became wild. Its owners were desperate until they found a gypsy who calmed the horse just by talking to it. Such people were called 'horse whisperers'. Evans was fascinated and started researching the topic, initially thinking of writing a screenplay. But after *Life and Limb* failed, he decided to write a book instead.

In the spring, he traveled across the US, visiting ranches and learning about horses and the people who work with them. ""It was a strange time,"" he recalls. ""I was observing people, but I felt alone and as if my life was falling apart. I had tried for ten years to succeed as a filmmaker, and now I was in debt, worried about feeding my children, and wondering if it was all a mistake.""

By August, he had returned home and written half of the book. The bank was pressuring him, and he needed to know if it was worth continuing. He showed the draft to a friend who was a literary agent. The agent thought it was ""fine"" and estimated Evans might get $30,000 as an advance. Evans needed more than that to pay off some debt and keep going. He had already spent seven months on the book and needed at least two more. He was also advised to write a 12-page summary of the rest of the book.

In October, the first 200 pages and the summary were sent to seven UK publishers just before the Frankfurt Book Fair. Within days, his agent called to say he had turned down an offer of $75,000. ""I said, 'You what?' And he said, 'It's OK, I just sense something is happening.'""

What happened next was remarkable. Within a week, the novel was sold to Transworld Publications in the UK for $550,000 and to Delacorte in the US for $3.15 million, both record-breaking advances for a first novel. ""We couldn't believe it; we were shocked. We never sent the manuscript to New York, and we still don't know how it got there,"" Evans says. It wasn't sent to Hollywood either, but soon major studios were competing for it. ""My UK agent wisely involved an agent there, and when he called to say, 'I think we can get $3 million outright,' we laughed in disbelief.""

The studios agreed to this amount, and they each made their case to Evans. One night in October, he sat in his study while four top filmmakers called, one after the other, to offer $3 million for an unfinished novel.

Evans shared this story while we drank coffee on the verandah of his home. He mentioned that he had turned down an offer to write the screenplay for *The Horse Whisperer*. ""It's been such a fairy tale so far. I don't want to ruin it. Writing at that level is tough, and I don't want to become an employee of people I like and who have paid me so much. I'd hate to write a draft or two and then have them say, 'Thanks, Nick, but now we'll bring in someone else.'""

He planned to stay involved but from a distance. The success of his novel also brought new interest in *Life and Limb*, but he wasn't sure he wanted to make it anymore. ""I think it would be wise to write another novel,"" he said."
CAE_23,"Text: 'Young Masters Age is a challenge for Bobby Fischer as he tries to make a comeback. Chess is now more than ever a game for young people. After 20 years away from the game, Bobby Fischer has returned to chess and is playing against his old rival Boris Spassky. Fischer's win in the first game was impressive, simple yet deep. However, as the following games have shown, this older, bearded chess player is not the same as he was in 1972. He is 49 years old, out of practice, and not in the best shape. Spassky is even older. Chess has changed a lot in the last 20 years. A new era of professionalism started because of Fischer's influence on the game. The rise of professional chess has made winning more important than the scientific and artistic aspects of the game. In international chess, a player's nerves and stamina are as important as their intellect and wisdom. The pressure of the game has always been high: a chess clock is used to make sure each player finishes the required number of moves in the given time - failing to do so means losing the game immediately. Now, the playing sessions are longer, and many games are played without breaks. This increased pressure benefits younger players. In the last 30 years, each new world champion has been younger than the one before. It is notable that, of the world's top ten players, eight are under 30. The way the game is played has also changed. Much of modern chess happens off the board - not just the psychological battles that Fischer is known for. Every professional must prepare seriously before a match, especially because computer databases have greatly impacted chess. A small portable computer can store one million chess games and provide instant access to hundreds of games of a potential opponent. In a recent match, each player had large teams of assistants working non-stop to find weaknesses in the other's strategy. The opening moves of a chess game are now analyzed in great detail. Being better prepared in the opening can decide the game. Today, there are more top-level players than ever before. Hundreds of grandmasters compete for modest prize money worldwide. Success requires both physical and mental effort. A single game can last up to eight hours. For the chess master, this time is a constant struggle. A moment of lost focus can lead to disaster. The players are always under nervous tension. The chess clock adds to this tension. The end of the game often involves a frantic 'time scramble'. In these moments, each player has only seconds to make several moves or lose instantly. With minds racing and hands moving quickly, the masters make their moves and press their clocks with coordination that any athlete would admire. These moments are not for calm thinkers. The game becomes a basic struggle where nerves, determination, and a strong will to win decide the winner. At the top level of chess, losing is very painful. Winning brings great satisfaction and a chance to recover from the stress and tiredness. But one win is not enough to win a tournament. The chess master must be ready to compete the next day. Most chess competitions last 9-11 days, with games every day, and there is a year-round tournament circuit. World championship matches are even more demanding. The 1984 match between Anatoli Karpov and Gary Kasparov in Moscow had to be stopped after several months because both players were exhausted. Karpov lost about two stone (10kg) in weight. Can Fischer overcome these challenges? He once said, ""All I want to do, ever, is play chess."" This made his departure from the chess world after 1972 seem even more puzzling. But in some ways, it was a fitting end to his story. It made Bobby Fischer a legend. If he has returned for the money, he will do well. Whatever happens in his match with Spassky, both will end up much richer. But if Fischer has come back truly believing he can prove he is still the best player in the world, the final result could be very disappointing.'"

Imogen Edwards-Jones talks to some of the new British talents, from poets to pop stars, who are on their way to success.

**A** Nick Grosso, in his early 30s, has written three plays that critics love. He is now turning his first play, ""Peaches,"" into a movie script. ""It's low budget, but we don't know how low,"" he says. ""It won't be over £30 million, but it could be as low as £30."" The most surprising thing about Nick is that before writing ""Peaches,"" he had never seen or read a play. ""When I wrote the play, I never thought it would be performed,"" he says. ""It's set in a car. I probably wouldn't do that now because I know the problems it causes. I knew nothing back then."" He left school at 16 but returned a year later. After finishing his A-levels, he joined the Young People's Theatre. ""I realized I wanted to write for actors. I wanted my writing to be heard, not just read, because of the rhythm and rhyme,"" he says. ""It was the first time I enjoyed being in an educational environment. It was very stimulating.""

**B** Comedian Simon Pegg, 28, has progressed a lot since studying drama at Bristol University. He is currently writing a TV comedy series and has just finished a demanding tour with comedy star Steve Coogan. He has always worked hard. Even at Bristol, he was improving his skills in comedy clubs. ""University was very theoretical,"" Simon remembers. ""It made me realize I didn't want to be a serious actor and that I was more interested in comedy. People think comedy is the hardest job in the world, but it really isn't. If you have courage and good material, it's wonderful to make people laugh."" He has performed with the comic group Funny Business, but his work with Steve Coogan has been the most successful. ""He saw my show, and since I was a big fan of his, he probably saw me copying him,"" Simon admits.

**C** Ciaran McMenamin, 24, became well-known when he starred in the series ""The Young Person's Guide To Becoming A Rock Star."" The critics loved it, and his career has taken off quickly. ""It's been a great opportunity for me,"" he says with a smile. ""I'm now in a position where I can choose what I do, which is what I've always wanted."" This is a rare situation, especially since he just graduated. Looking at Ciaran's early career, it's clear he was always going to be successful. Encouraged by his mother, he went from playing lead roles at school to the Ulster Youth Theatre, where he stayed for four years. ""I was using acting as an excuse not to do homework,"" Ciaran laughs. ""But I decided to take it seriously because I was good at it and loved it."" Now he is waiting for the praise to come in, but when asked about fame, he becomes thoughtful. ""When you're 18, you think you'll love the photos and interviews, but you soon realize that's not why you're acting. It's about getting respect for doing good work.""

**D** Neil Taylor, 25, is the lead singer of the pop band Matrix, which has just signed a three-album deal with Domino Records. Neil and his bandmate Rick Brown are expected to be very successful when their single ""Chimera"" is released soon. ""The record company's idea of good sales is different from mine,"" he says. ""They're talking about a big hit, but I have no idea. For me, if two people buy it, I'll be happy."" Unlike many new pop stars, Neil has worked hard for his success. He left school at 16 and has been trying to break into the music business ever since. ""It's funny how things happen,"" he says. ""I had been playing student gigs for eight years and was getting tired. I was about to give up when this happened."" By ""this,"" he means meeting Rick Brown, who had contacts at Domino, and forming Matrix. It couldn't have happened at a better time. ""There were times when I was very depressed, and I've been in some terrible bands. But hopefully, it will all have been worth it.""

**E** Poet and author Stephen Richards, 27, has won more prizes, awards, and academic honors than many people twice his age. He is well-known on the poetry circuit, where he has been touring and giving readings for the past six years. Now his first novel, ""Hidden,"" will be published in March. ""It's a story of obsessive love. It was a strong idea that I couldn't express as a poem."" Stephen loved creative writing at school but became disillusioned with education later. ""I decided not to go to university, but when I got bored with stuffing envelopes at a theater, I decided I should."" After university, he published his first work, a children's book, in 1992. ""I don't think my parents expected me to be a writer. They thought I'd be a reader because that's all I did as a child."" With his poetry receiving such praise, moving into novels is brave. ""There's a structure with my poetry and less chance to make big mistakes,"" he explains. ""Because a novel can be any length, there are more chances for bad words. My main goal is not to fall into a pattern of producing work without caring about the quality."""
CAE_1,"Text: A. Isabel, the main character in this funny novel, thinks she looks good in jeans but rarely wears them because she doesn't want to be associated with the wrong people. She is a 31-year-old art student who loves historical romances and is looking for Mr. Right. She worries that her knobbly knees might ruin her chances. However, she remains hopeful, which helps her and others in the story. The author writes with great energy, using a fast-paced style similar to early silent films, with chapter titles like 'Our Hero Feels Inspired'. B. This story is about the beginning and near-end of a local radio station in America. It is told from the perspective of Francis With, a smart but weak child. Francis works for WLT (With Lettuce and Tomato) Radio, a station started by Roy and Ray Soderbjerg to promote their sandwich shop. The station soon broadcasts a mix of singers, preachers, soap-opera stars, and announcers. The small-town American setting allows the author to use dry humor and simple writing. He takes the reader back to the 1940s and 1950s, a time of dime stores, old cars, and the radio. C. In the author's world, it's normal for a second husband to talk with his wife's first husband. So, when professor Richard Vaisey falls for a Russian poetess, he talks to his wife's ex. The poetess writes bad poetry, which bothers Richard, and she wants his help for her brother, who is in prison unfairly. The author skillfully untangles these issues with humor and insight into relationships, making it a fun and smart read. D. Two pairs of best friends—two women and two men—meet in 1960s London and stay connected for 25 years. At the start of this long novel, one of them, James Hudson, an American businessman, is starting a newspaper, which his friend Richard Blake is editing. The newspaper launch is important, but so is the fact that the woman they both loved (and one married) was killed years ago. The story includes murder, ambition, love, and jealousy, and the writing is good. It's a book where you can really get to know the characters. E. Written by a top American fiction writer, this funny and caring story is about Ian Bedloe, who feels guilty for a past mistake and becomes a 'father' to his brother's three orphaned children. At 40, he is slowly becoming an eccentric bachelor surrounded by the mess of family life. The story explores many emotions and focuses on the touching relationship Ian develops with the youngest child, Daphne. It's a warm book with a perfect mix of sadness and laughter."
CAE_53,"**Volunteer Tourism: Perspectives from Four Writers**

**A.** The direct impact of volunteer tourism on development is often questioned. Volunteers, especially those on gap years, may help build homes or schools, but they usually pay a large fee to participate. This money, if given directly to local communities, could hire more workers than the volunteer could replace. Many studies question whether gap year volunteering is truly altruistic or if young people do it to gain 'cultural capital' for their careers. However, these projects might help volunteers become more ethical and considerate of less fortunate people in their future lives.

**B.** Volunteering can improve international understanding, conflict resolution, and participation in global issues. It can also create international social networks. Ideally, both volunteers and host communities benefit, contributing to the global good. However, if only wealthy individuals from richer countries volunteer, they gain international experience and career advantages, while communities without access to such opportunities see little benefit. Volunteers may use these experiences for personal gain, treating host communities as steps in their career ladder.

**C.** At its worst, international volunteering can be seen as imperialistic or self-serving, benefiting mainly the volunteers from wealthy Western countries. At its best, it provides mutual benefits, allowing for the exchange of skills and cultural experiences. Importantly, volunteering can increase awareness and commitment to fighting inequality, poverty, and unsustainable development.

**D.** Volunteer tourism aligns with the trend of life strategies focused on helping others. These strategies, which aim to 'make a difference,' can seem positive in an anti-political climate. They avoid big government and business but also bypass democratic processes, reducing development to individual charity acts. While volunteering is commendable, when marketed as sustainable development, it can degrade the true meaning of development. This approach shifts away from understanding global inequalities and the poverty experienced by many in developing countries."
CAE_55,"**Sound the Alarm: Stuart Harris Reports**

Many of us listen to the radio when we wake up and need something to help us get out of bed. That's where the clock radio comes in. But how do you choose a good one? Our panel, which included me, inventor Tom Granger, and broadcaster Paul Bridges, tested five models currently available.

The 'dual alarm function' on one model doesn't work as expected. Instead of waking you with a buzzer and then letting you snooze, it allows you to set two different wake-up times, one for weekdays and one for weekends. This model is priced similarly to the second model we tested, but it includes a cassette player, which is a good deal. You can fall asleep to your own tapes and wake up without news. We all thought the radio quality was excellent, but the size was a downside—it's as big as a rugby ball. Paul Bridges said, ""Any clock radio I buy has to leave enough space on the bedside table for my keys, wallet, glasses, and phone. I'm paranoid and always book a wake-up call in case the alarm doesn't go off.""

This model was voted the best-looking and overall winner. Paul Bridges said he was ""in love with it,"" although the clock on his test model ""kept getting stuck at 16.00."" I liked the digital display with its grey numbers on a green background. The wide snooze bar is easy to tap with your eyes closed. However, the smooth buttons made me want to touch them like piano keys, which was a problem when I finally looked at the 50-page instruction booklet. The clock has a self-power backup, so you don't have to reset it if someone unplugs it to use a hairdryer or vacuum cleaner; this was a big plus. However, we all found it hard to set up, though learning how made us feel ""cool"" and sophisticated.

Tom Granger called the model with an extra built-in lamp ""unbelievably tacky."" ""You have to pull the light out of its socket to make it work, which makes me question the quality of the rest of it."" He had to read the instruction booklet twice to get it to work; the clock kept jumping from 12.00 to 02.00. The light was hard to position; you couldn't read by it—it only shines on the clock, which is already lit. Paul Bridges liked the lamp idea but agreed the radio was hard to tune. The buzzer sounded like a submarine alarm and made me want to throw it across the room. Interestingly, this model is the third most popular on the market.

Aimed at young people, with its bright colors and matching strap, this model appealed to Tom Granger and me. ""I would choose this one because it stands out,"" he said. The traditional controls made it the only one we set up without reading the instructions. Unfortunately, the alarm has a 20-minute margin for error; the manual says, ""the alarm may sound about 10 minutes earlier or later than the set time."" Paul Bridges found this unacceptable, calling the model ""terribly fiddly"" and ""completely useless.""

The simplest and cheapest model scored points with Tom Granger because it ""seemed very standard and took up little space,"" and it has old-fashioned dial tuning. ""It's more intuitive to set up. With modern push-button tuning, you're never sure if you've pressed all the buttons in the right order, so you can't trust it will work."" He admitted that manufacturers had to improve radio quality because of button-tuning. I thought the tuning was crude, as did Paul Bridges, but we agreed the radio quality was fine. The buzzer on this model certainly works; it got me out of bed in just two beeps!"
CAE_50,"Text: 'Hedgehogs A hedgehog is a small mammal known for the sharp spines covering its body. Hedgehogs are found in many parts of the world, but none are native to America or Australia. All hedgehog species can roll into a tight ball when threatened, making their spines point outwards. This defense mechanism's effectiveness depends on how many spines the hedgehog has. Some desert hedgehogs have evolved to be lighter, so they have fewer spines and are more likely to try to run from an attacker, using their ball-rolling ability only as a last option. Hedgehogs are mainly active at night and sleep most of the day, either under bushes or in a hole in the ground. Although all hedgehogs can hibernate, not all do; in the right conditions, some stay awake all year.'"
CAE_25,"**Great Sportswomen on a Winning Streak**

Excelling in any sport is challenging, even for men, but women often have to work twice as hard. Training and competition leave little time for a normal life, so sacrifices are necessary. Despite these challenges, women are overcoming prejudice and breaking records. Here, we talk to a few brilliant British sportswomen who are achieving their goals.

**A. Jill, 27, Skier**
""It's an amazing feeling to fly through the air and land cleanly, but it can be scary. Sometimes you don't feel well, or it's windy and you can't see, but you just keep going. It's not easy to have a career outside skiing because we train for ten months a year. You give up a lot of your social life and friends. But it was my choice. There are six men and three women in the British team. We all compete on the same courses at the same competitions and get treated the same - it's a young sport.""

**B. Caroline, 22, Cyclist**
""Two years ago, I borrowed a bike to take part in a charity race. I won overall just because I cycled faster than everyone else, which was amazing because I'd never cycled before! I'm well paid as a professional, and cycling has lots of potential for endorsements. However, I know I'm not ugly, and it worries me that people may think I've succeeded because of my looks, not because I'm the best cyclist. So I focus on cycling at the moment, rather than earning money. I do at least four hours of training every day on the bike, plus some stretching exercises, swimming, and running. My boyfriend is a cyclist too, so he understands the time you have to put into it -- it would be impossible otherwise.""

**C. Annabel, 26, Rower**
""Rowing is hard for girls to get into because very few girls' schools offer it. So most don't start until they're 19 or 20, which makes it harder to succeed at an international level. Also, you usually have coaches who only stay a year or so. There's no continuity, so the women's squad is basically a mess. But it's great fun, and I love being fit, plus there's a good social life.""

**D. Ffyona, 24, Long Distance Walker**
""At 13, I dreamed of walking around the world -- I didn't know just how big it was then! But Britain was too claustrophobic, too safe. I was very headstrong; I hated anyone having control over me. Now I am more tactful. Each walk has been different. The walk across Australia was the worst experience I've ever had in terms of pain. I was doing 50 miles and 21 hours each day with three hours of sleep in high temperatures and walking with 15 blisters on each foot. But I got the record! I had to because my sponsorship money was going to run out after 95 days. Men think that women are more likely to fail, so sponsoring them is always seen as a higher risk.""

**E. Lisa, 26, Saloon Car Racer**
""Some men have huge egos when they're driving - you see it on motorways. When I'm doing well, they don't talk to me. Being a woman has its disadvantages. When I get to a corner, the men think 'I've got to beat her', so I've had a lot of knocks! You have to be naturally competitive and aggressive. It's very difficult to earn any money, and what I do make goes back into the sport. Women have been racing since the twenties and have always been seen as eccentrics. It's great that there are now more and more women taking up racing every year. For me, the appeal of saloon car racing is aiming for perfection, always trying to get around with a perfect lap.""

**F. Alison, 28, Triathlete**
""I get up at 5.30 three mornings a week to swim. I need Tuesday and Thursday mornings to catch up on my sleep. In the evening, I just cycle or run. Yes, I do fall asleep at my desk sometimes! There is a lot of nervous build-up beforehand, and when you're racing, you really push yourself - you don't feel good if you don't. Several times I've asked myself why I do it. The answer is a) I'm happier when I keep fit, b) I'm a slob at heart, and if I didn't make myself do this, I'd really be one, c) racing is very social. Men and women usually compete together, but when an event is covered in the press, 90 percent of the article will explain the men's event, and 10 percent will say, 'Oh, by the way, so-and-so won the women's event'. The prize money isn't as good either, of course. But now we've formed an International Triathlon Women's Commission, so we're working on it."""
CAE_34,"**The Day I Drew Picasso**

Richard Cork remembers the day he met one of the most famous artists of the century, Pablo Picasso. At 18 years old, Richard was traveling around Europe and Morocco before starting university. He was low on money and found a job painting boats in Cannes. One day, while carrying his sketchbook, he saw Picasso having lunch at a restaurant in the harbor. Picasso was known to be a private person, so Richard was surprised to see him there with his wife, Jacqueline, and three friends.

Encouraged by a friend, Richard nervously approached Picasso to ask for his autograph. To his surprise, Picasso agreed and signed his sketchbook. Then, Picasso added a lively drawing on the page. Richard was thrilled and started a conversation with Picasso, though they needed an American woman at the table to translate because Picasso's English was not good.

After showing his friend the autograph, Richard was encouraged to go back and draw Picasso's portrait. Without asking for permission, Richard started sketching Picasso, who playfully made funny faces to make it difficult. Despite this, Richard continued drawing, feeling challenged by Picasso's antics. Eventually, Picasso stopped moving and allowed Richard to study him closely. Richard noticed how youthful and intense Picasso's eyes were, despite his age.

When Richard finished, Picasso wanted to see the portrait. Although Richard was embarrassed, Picasso looked at it and nodded approvingly. Then, Picasso took the crayon and quickly drew a playful version of Richard's face, moving one eye onto his nose and capturing his smile with a single line. Richard was amazed by Picasso's skill and humor.

Richard asked Picasso to sign the drawing, but Picasso declined, saying Richard already had his signature. Despite this, Richard felt incredibly lucky to have met Picasso and received his attention. This encounter meant a lot to him."
CAE_12,"**Talking Shop: How Stores Make You Spend More**

Have you ever gone into a store and bought more than you planned? We explain the tricks shops use to make you spend more money.

**A. The Image of Freshness**

Supermarkets know that customers value fresh produce. They often place fruits and vegetables at the store entrance or have displays of house plants to create a fresh image. An in-store bakery might spread the smell of fresh bread throughout the store. The store's colors, like green, can also enhance this fresh image. However, most of what supermarkets sell, like frozen foods and cleaning products, doesn't match this fresh image.

**B. Displaying to Advantage**

The placement of products in a store is crucial for sales, especially in supermarkets. With computerized stock control, supermarkets know which areas attract the most shoppers. High-profit items or fast-selling products are placed in these spots. The saying ""eye-level is buy-level"" means that shelves at eye height are prime spots for products. Special offers in ""dump bins"" attract bargain hunters. ""Complementation"" is also popular, like placing salad dressings near salads or desserts near ice creams.

**C. Spreading Staples Around the Store**

Supermarkets often place low-cost essentials like bread and sugar far from the entrance. This forces shoppers to pass by more tempting, higher-profit items. Similarly, chain stores might place popular products far from the entrance, relying on customer loyalty to lead shoppers past other items that might catch their interest.

**D. Less Sells More**

Chain stores have changed how they display products. The Next chain, for example, moved away from the ""pile them high, sell them cheap"" method. Their stores have a ""boutique"" feel, displaying fewer items to give an exclusive impression. However, Next's clothes are just as mass-produced as their competitors'. Their success is due to good store design and well-designed clothing.

**E. Tempting Totals**

Food shoppers often focus on the total cost of their shopping trip rather than individual item prices. Supermarkets use this by offering a mix of low and high mark-up items. Not everything in a supermarket is cheap. Some items, called ""loss leaders,"" are sold at a loss to attract customers. More often, low prices come from buying in bulk, offering manufacturers prime display spots, or meeting sales targets, which earn discounts from manufacturers.

**F. The All-Important Price Tag**

In chain stores, shoppers buy fewer items and notice individual prices more. Pricing a blouse at £14.99 instead of £15 is still effective. This pricing also helps reduce theft, as staff must record the sale to give the penny change.

**G. Lighting to Effect**

Both supermarkets and chain stores carefully consider lighting. Chain stores aim for lighting that resembles natural light, so clothes look the same as they would in daylight. Supermarkets use special lighting and mirrors to enhance the appearance of fresh produce.

**H. Walk This Way**

Many chain stores use different carpeting to guide shoppers. One pattern marks the main routes, and another defines sales areas. These routes, known as the ""Yellow Brick Road,"" guide shoppers through the store. However, some shoppers hesitate to leave the main path. Marks and Spencer, for example, use wood or marble for routes, encouraging shoppers to step onto the more inviting carpet in sales areas.

**I. In-Store Promotion**

As you enter a supermarket, large photos of delicious foods greet you, tempting you if you're hungry. In the U.S., some supermarkets are testing ""video trolleys."" These trolleys have screens that show ads as you shop. Sensors trigger ads relevant to the products nearby, like an ad for ready-made meals near the cook-chill section. These trolleys target impulse shoppers, and makers claim they boost sales by about 30%."
CAE_26,"Text: 'Sea, Ice & Rock Mountaineer Chris Bonnington, who is 58 years old, is famous for climbing Everest in 1985. He has also created new climbing routes in Britain and the Alps and written many books, like Quest for Adventure and Everest the Hard Way. Robin Knox-Johnston, who is 53, started his sea career in the Merchant Navy. In 1968-9, he was the first person to sail around the world alone in his yacht, Sunhaili. He also set a record for crossing the Atlantic, taking 10 days to sail from New York to the Lizard. The two teamed up to sail and climb in Greenland, and they wrote about the trip in their new book: Sea, Ice and Rock. In 1979, I was working on Quest for Adventure, a study of post-war adventure. I called Robin to ask for an interview, and he invited me to join him for a sail. I could teach him some climbing techniques, and he could teach me the basics of sailing. It was my first time on a yacht. We sailed for a while and then anchored. Robin's wife and daughter stayed on the boat, and we paddled to the shore to practice climbing. The route was quite difficult, and I was impressed by how steady Robin was in tricky conditions. He moved quietly and confidently. After a bit, we reached a huge drop. I asked Robin if he had ever climbed before. He hadn't, so I showed him how. When I finished, Robin politely asked if he could go down the way he climbed down ropes on his boat. He was used to using his arms, but I wanted him to use his legs. I wasn't too happy about it, but he lowered himself down safely. During that trip to Skye, Robin and I built a strong friendship. His idea to combine our skills on a trip to Greenland was just a bigger version of our Skye trip. Robin impressed me as a leader. Usually, the skipper makes all the decisions, but Robin asked everyone for their opinions first. Most of the time, nobody dared to advise him, but it was nice to feel included in the decision-making process. To be honest, I found the sailing difficult and boring. The moments of crisis on the way back were easy to handle: the adrenaline kicks in, and you get all worked up. The hard part was spending day after day in the middle of the sea. I love the land and am not really a do-it-yourself person. Robin, on the other hand, is a natural sailor and enjoyed fixing the engine or mending the toilet. I knew Robin didn't really need me. To be honest, I felt a bit useless at times, and I found that hard. The crew was also very close together: six people on a 32ft yacht, designed to sleep four. At least on a mountain expedition, you can get away from each other. When we reached Greenland, and it was my turn to 'lead' the expedition, I found it hard to be responsible for Robin's life. There were many times when, if Robin had fallen, he could have pulled me down with him. I had to watch for that constantly. I underestimated how difficult the Cathedral -- Greenland's highest mountain - would be. Robin isn't a natural climber, which made his efforts even more impressive. The first time we tried to reach the top, we were on the move for 24 hours. On the way down, we were falling asleep on steep slopes, 1,500 feet above the ground. Robin went through a tough time, but he completely trusted me. He just followed. When it got too difficult, and I realized we had to turn back, he accepted it. I also knew that Robin was worried about the boat: whether we'd be able to get it through the ice, whether it was in one piece. Yet he was all in favor of us trying to climb the mountain again. The only time there was a near-crisis in our relationship was on the yacht on the way home. We were taking turns to be on watch. I was supposed to get up at 4 am for my shift, but Robin decided not to wake me. He felt he could do it himself. The previous night I'd almost fallen asleep. I felt that he didn't trust me - I felt insecure, and I said so. Robin immediately reassured me that I'd misunderstood. While we enjoyed the Skye trip, we didn't really know each other until the end of the Greenland expedition. I found that underneath his tough exterior, Robin was a kind-hearted, sensitive person.'"
CAE_8,"**A History of the Apple**

Apples have been with us since ancient times, in many colors, shapes, and sizes. However, the late 20th century risks losing this heritage.

**Prehistoric Wild Apples (8,000 BC)**

Humans have been eating apples since prehistoric times. In Neolithic Britain, people spat out apple seeds. Around 10,000 years ago, they left apple remains near their homes in Switzerland and Italy. In Switzerland and near the Caucasus mountains, ancient people stored dried apple halves for winter. These were wild crab apples, small and shriveled, known in Ancient Britain as 'windings'. They were quite different from the apples we know today.

**Norman Knowledge (1000 AD)**

The French learned fruit-growing skills from the Romans, which were developed in monasteries. This knowledge, including cider-making, was brought to Britain, along with the dessert apple, Decio, introduced by the Roman general, Etio. However, most Roman apple varieties did not suit the British climate, and Norman varieties became more popular. British monks continued to experiment and develop new apples, and many Western apples today come from these varieties.

**Medieval Favorites (1200)**

Several apple types became popular in Britain during the 13th century. The Old English Pearmain, recorded in 1204, was the main dessert apple until the 18th century. Its cooking partner was the Costard, sold in Oxford markets from 1296 until the 17th century, giving us the word 'costermonger' for a street fruit and vegetable seller. However, apple production declined due to droughts, the Black Death, and the Wars of the Roses. More apples were imported until the 16th century when Henry VIII sent Richard Harris to France to learn about apple cultivation. Harris returned with many grafts, including the famous Pippins, and created the first modern-style orchard in Kent.

**Settler Treasure (1750)**

By the 17th century, apples were so popular in Britain that settlers took them to Canada, Australia, the US, South Africa, and New Zealand. Captain Bligh took the first apples to Australia; Jan van Riebeeck took them to South Africa, and the Pilgrim Fathers carried them to America. In North America, the most famous apple-planter was John Chapman, or 'Johnny Appleseed'. Born in 1774, he planted apple nurseries from Pennsylvania to Indiana. The Indians saw him as a medicine man, and his love for apple trees, unusual clothing, and religious devotion inspired many folktales. He was said to be so kind to animals that he even slept with bears.

**Modern Delicious (1850)**

Around this time in Iowa, a Quaker farmer named Jesse Hiatt found a shoot growing from a dead tree's roots. It became an apple tree with a new apple, which Hiatt called 'Hawkey'. At a fruit show, a judge tasted it and exclaimed 'Delicious, delicious!'. In 1895, it was introduced to the market as 'Delicious' and became one of the most widely grown apples in the world.

**Granny Smith (1850)**

Another famous modern apple was discovered in Australia by Maria Anne Smith. The daughter of convicts, Maria was independent and worked as a midwife in Eastwood, New South Wales. Known as 'Granny Smith', she managed the family farm and orchard. In 1868, she found a small tree growing from discarded fruit. She transplanted it and soon harvested the first major crop of green apples, which became famous worldwide. When asked about the tree, she said, 'Well, it's just like God to make something useful out of what we think is rubbish', referring to both the fruit and her convict origins.

**Uniformity (1950)**

Apples are now grown worldwide, from India to Africa. Most are grown commercially and come from just a few varieties, chosen for their red skin or ability to travel well, rather than taste. This uniformity is reducing the variety and gene pool of apples. While UK gardeners have preserved many old apple varieties, the US has lost most of its apples from 100 years ago. Consumers are starting to demand more variety. We cannot rely on amateur gardeners to save apple diversity. We must value and protect natural diversity for everyone's benefit."

CAE_30,"Richard Nerurkar, a top British 10,000-metre runner, visits a high-altitude training camp in Kenya. Located ten miles south of the equator, a mountain track leads from a quiet road from Nairobi to Mount Kenya, the country's highest peak. This beautiful but isolated place is Nanyuki, where I have trained for the past three winters. However, I had never trained with Kenyan runners on their home ground until my fourth trip. During this visit, I competed in my first race in Kenya's thin air and stayed at the national team training camp. I was invited by Kenya's national team coach after finishing fifth in the World Championship 10,000 meters race, behind three Kenyans and a Moroccan. It was an opportunity I couldn't miss. Training at high altitude increases red blood cells, improving oxygen capacity, which has helped many Kenyan runners succeed. My first race in Africa, held in Nairobi, was also the continent's first international cross-country race. It was a humbling experience, as 41 runners finished ahead of me, all but three were Kenyan. Despite this, I felt I had a good race. I don't think Kenyan success is only due to altitude. Kenyan runners have a simple approach to the sport. Their running style is effortless, their diet simple, and they love competing. The least discussed aspect of their success is their training. My stay at the Kenyan team training camp provided answers. The camp is at St Mark's College, 6,200 feet up Mt Kenya, surrounded by playing fields and tropical vegetation. It's basic, with few comforts. Athletes live with regular students, six to a room in dormitories. Their days include three workouts: an easy morning run, interval training mid-morning, and a steady run in the late afternoon. The daily routine starts at six. We got up and were briefed by the coaches for the morning run. ""Run easy, you have a hard job today,"" the coach who invited me said. We covered about 40 kilometres each day, just short of a marathon. Sunday was an exception, with only one 20-kilometre run, a welcome break from the three daily workouts. Life outside running was simple. A splash of water and brushing teeth were enough before breakfast. Breakfast was tea, bread, and boiled eggs in a small dining area. Lunch and dinner were similar: ugali (a maize dish), stew, cabbage or spinach, and tea. After running, we drove to bathe in streams from Mt Kenya's glaciers. By the time I left the camp, I appreciated Kenyan success even more. It can't be just genetics, upbringing, or altitude. I thought about another explanation: the simple lifestyle, tough workouts, and passion for success might be the real reasons behind Kenya's rise in world distance running."
CAE_7,"**Hit and Miss of Mass Marketing**

Almost everyone knows that advertising is struggling. It's not just because of the recession. Advertising started to decline in early 1989, even before the recession hit hard. The problems with advertising are more basic, and the decline is happening worldwide. The truth is that advertising hasn't kept up with economic changes. Advertisers think about mass markets and mass media, but as more brands and media options have appeared, target markets have become more divided. Even big brand campaigns should focus on smaller audiences, but they often don't. This is where advertising has gone wrong.

Think about your own shopping habits. When you go to a supermarket, you might buy 30, 40, or 50 items. Many of these won't be advertised brands; some will be multiple purchases of the same brand. You might buy only a few advertised brands from the 15,000 products available in the store. Over a year, you probably won't buy more than a few hundred brands. Consumer durables? Maybe a dozen a year. Cars? If you have a new car, it's likely provided by your employer. If not, you might buy one every three years. You don't buy many clothes either, and most aren't advertised brands. Even when you include sweets, medicines, hardware, and services, you probably don't buy more than 400 different brands a year.

Compare that to the 32,500 branded goods and services advertised, according to Media Register. Let's focus on the 9,500 brands that Media Register lists and analyzes. The average person buys 400 of those 9,500, and not all because of advertising. That's about 4 percent. So, you can forget the saying often linked to Lord Leverhulme: ""Half of my advertising is wasted, but I don't know which half."" You could say that 96 percent of all advertising is wasted, but nobody knows which 96 percent.

When you watch TV tonight, count how many commercials are for brands you buy or might buy in the future. For most people, it's about one in 16 (6 percent), so the commercials for the other 15 (94 percent) seem wasted. You might think you're not influenced by advertising, but almost everyone thinks that. The truth is, nobody buys most of the brands they see advertised. Waste is part of using media for advertising. The idea that everyone who sees an ad will buy the product is unrealistic. People notice only a few ads and ignore the rest, so waste can't be avoided.

That doesn't mean advertising isn't cost-effective. Many ads have shown it is. Advertising needs to reach many people to find the right audience because advertisers can't know in advance who will respond. Media advertising works because it's a cheap way to communicate with many people. However, all waste is unpleasant. With smart targeting, advertisers can reduce waste by increasing the percentage of people who respond, but they can never know exactly who will respond. Even the best direct mail campaign never gets a 100 percent response.

This is a key difference between media advertising and face-to-face selling. A salesperson might succeed with every client they talk to, but this can't happen with media. If advertisers knew exactly who would respond, they wouldn't need media at all. They could contact those people directly. This is true for all types of ads, from personal announcements to soft drink commercials. Any advertiser who gains one million new customers (2 percent of the adult population) is doing well. For soap powder, the top brands would be thrilled with a million extra customers. So, any advertising campaign that wins over 2 percent of the population would be very successful. As I said at the start, this is a small part of the population. The most cost-effective way to reach them might be through mass media, but for advertising to succeed again, its message needs to be more focused than ever before."
CAE_43,"Text: 'Solar Survivor Charles Clover explores Britain's most environmentally-friendly home. Southwell in Nottinghamshire has some surprises. One is Southwell Minster, an ancient cathedral with 'green' men figures carved by medieval craftsmen. Another is the 'autonomous house', Britain's greenest home, designed by Robert and Brenda Vale. The Vales use rainwater for washing and drinking, recycle sewage into garden compost, and heat their house with waste heat from appliances and body heat from themselves, their children, and their cats, Edison and Faraday. The house looks traditional, with a clay tile roof, and blends with the town's old buildings. It was approved by planners even though it's in a conservation area. The solar-powered doorbell is silent, and the house is super-insulated with triple-glazed windows, making it very quiet inside. Once inside, you must take off your shoes. The house is very still, and on a sunny day, the conservatory warms the air before it ventilates the house. Vale opens ventilation shafts and windows to create airflow because the house is very draught-proof. Even the cats have an air-locked door. The Vales, who teach architecture at Nottingham University, have been focused on the environment since the 1970s. They wrote a book called The Autonomous House. They designed a building that emits no carbon dioxide and decided to do without mains water. They use composting toilets, rainwater tanks, and copper gutters to protect drinking water, which is filtered before use. Water from washing goes into the garden, and they don't use a dishwasher to avoid strong detergents. Most features are designed to be environmentally friendly. 'We wanted to show that you can design a house that is less harmful to the environment without living in the dark,' says Robert. The house's only medieval aspect is its aesthetic: the hall, with a hearth and staircase, is the full height of the building. The Vales pay no water bills, and last winter, the house used only nine units of electricity a day, costing about 70p. Soon, solar panels will be installed, reducing electricity use further. The house will generate more electricity than it uses, enough to charge an electric car. The only heating is a small wood-burning stove, rarely used. Is it warm in winter? One February night, Robert was reading and said it was too warm to light the fire. The room temperature was 18C, comfortable because there are no draughts or heat loss. Perceived temperature depends on these factors. An Edwardian lady was comfortable at 12.5C due to her clothing's insulation. Robert suggests people in old houses should live like they did in the past, but this idea may not catch on. The house is low-tech, with little to go wrong. Most materials were from a builder's merchant and installed by local craftsmen, making it cheap to build, costing the same per square metre as low-cost housing. Commercial builders resist this idea.'"

CAE_11,"**Blacksmiths**

Throughout history, iron has fascinated people, and those who work with it, blacksmiths, have been seen as more than just skilled workers. Before the Industrial Revolution, blacksmiths were as respected as doctors and astrologers because they made weapons, armor, and farming tools. They were also celebrated as artists. In the 18th century, blacksmiths created the intricate ironwork for St Paul's Cathedral. The flowing metal designs of French and Belgian Art Nouveau buildings were also crafted by talented blacksmiths. However, by the late 1960s in Britain, blacksmiths were almost extinct because heavy industry no longer needed them, and modern architects rarely used elegant wrought-iron designs.

In the past 10 years, there has been a revival of interest in blacksmithing, thanks to a renewed interest in decorative architecture and more creative interior design. Despite this, much of the work still looks old-fashioned, with manufacturers promoting 'classical' or 'Victorian-style' gates and balconies. Trendy design stores often feature rusty candlesticks with decorative elements. Fortunately, there are new alternatives, and a series of events in the coming weeks aims to promote the blacksmith's craft. The first event, an exhibition of forged ironwork by members of the British Artist Blacksmiths Association (BABA), opened last week at the Fire & Iron gallery in Leatherhead, Surrey.

Alan Dawson, the secretary of BABA, says, ""We could be at the start of a new Iron Age because both the public and blacksmiths are seeing things differently."" Power tools have made it easier for blacksmiths to work with metal, allowing them to bend, split, twist, and weld it with ease. ""In short,"" says Dawson, ""these artists now have a material that lets them express themselves."" About 250 pieces are on display at the show, ranging from bookends to a spiral staircase. Prices start at £90 and go up to several thousand pounds. Most of the money will go to the individual makers, but a percentage will be kept by the Association to promote good ironwork, says Dawson. His own contributions include an eight-foot gate and a lamp with a glass shade. ""My style comes from letting steel bend and flow into shape when it's hot. It's like drawing with metal in space,"" he says.

Many artists are fascinated by iron. Unlike most metals, which are easy to shape when cold, iron and steel are tougher and more challenging. Susan May, a jeweler by training, says, ""It's magical because it's incredibly soft when hot, but as soon as it cools, it becomes rigid and immovable again."" Ann Catrin Evans' steel door-knockers and handles seem inspired by the castles seen in horror films. One of her designs looks like a ball and chain, another like a Celtic cross. ""I love that steel is cold and hard,"" she says. ""And it feels like it's there forever."" No other base metal has given people as much visual pleasure or a greater feeling of security. The chances of iron being used decoratively for the next thousand years are good, as long as we don't have to see any more rusty candlesticks."
CAE_14,"**THE DAY I GAVE UP SMOKING**

I thought everyone would be happy, but one of my colleagues was very angry. ""What do you mean?"" she shouted. ""If it was that easy, why didn't you stop years ago?"" I guess my inability to explain how I went from being a pack-a-day smoker to a non-smoker in just four hours was a bit annoying. I find it strange myself. The stop-smoking session was a mix of group therapy and hypnotherapy, and it happened exactly two months and three weeks ago. I hadn't planned to stop, and I didn't even really want to. For one thing, I was annoyed by the constant pressure from anti-smoking groups—and I still am. Also, I had low blood pressure and a healthy family. I didn't cough or feel sick and seemed to recover from colds more easily than friends who had healthier lifestyles.

On that ordinary Thursday afternoon, I went to the Birmingham session of The Easy Way to Stop Smoking to write an article about other people trying to quit. ""I won't be trying to stop myself, it wouldn't be fair,"" I said firmly. ""Since my reason for being here is writing, not stopping, it wouldn't be right to expect your method to work on me."" I thought I was being very reasonable. After all, I really enjoyed smoking. It gave me real pleasure. I thought the counselor looked at me knowingly. We were encouraged to smoke as much as we wanted, and most of the afternoon was spent in a room so full of smoke that we had to open the windows. I noticed with interest that when I was told to smoke, I was reluctant to do so—and so were the others.

I suppose what happened was that the stop-smoking messages made sense. Just as smoking had become a challenge against opposition, the idea of stopping started to feel appealing. The possibility of not being a smoker began to make me feel powerful. It was a secret feeling that had nothing to do with anyone except myself. Could I also conquer the world? In many ways, it was easy. The physical craving, the desire for nicotine, in the same place where you feel hunger, faded after a minute or two, and I experienced them for only four or five days. The one activity—my work—that I thought would be the hardest to do without cigarettes didn't cause a single problem. I had really believed that I wouldn't be able to work to deadlines without nicotine and that for the first time ever, I would fail to write a story on time. Surprisingly, spending time at home on weekend mornings was the hardest thing—and it still is. I am increasingly coming to the view that for me, smoking had a lot to do with avoiding boredom; having a cigarette was an activity in itself. Yes, I do miss my cigarettes, but not too much. Each ""new"" experience as a non-smoker has to be faced—eating out, waiting for a plane, checking into a hotel, a theater break. All are key moments when I would have previously smoked cigarettes."
CAE_63,"**Dorothy Who?**

Dorothy Hodgkin is the only British woman scientist to win a Nobel Prize, yet she is not well-known in her own country. Georgina Ferry, who is writing Hodgkin's first biography, has noticed that many people in Britain are unaware of Hodgkin's achievements. If Hodgkin had won a Nobel Prize in literature, she would likely be a household name. Hodgkin, who passed away in 1994, was an extraordinary person. Her life mirrored significant changes in the 20th century, such as the progress of women's education and the globalization of science.

When Ferry started her research, she read scientific biographies. A friend of Hodgkin's suggested a biography of Linus Pauling, a close friend and fellow scientist who also opposed nuclear weapons. However, Ferry found no biographies of Pauling in her local bookshop, which surprised her. Pauling was a highly influential chemist and a Nobel Prize winner in both chemistry and peace, yet he was not well-known to British readers.

Even scientists have questioned the value of scientific biographies. Peter Medawar, another Nobel laureate, once said that scientists' lives are often dull to read about. This negative view might explain why publishers and booksellers are not eager to promote scientific biographies. The idea that scientists' lives are less interesting than those of artists or politicians is part of the 'two cultures' mentality, which sees a divide between the arts and sciences.

However, this view is changing. Scientists are now more visible in the media. For example, Professor Richard Dawkins presents TV quiz prizes, and geneticist Steve Jones appears in car advertisements. These activities help make scientists more relatable to the public.

The publishing world is also changing. Scientific biographies used to be scholarly and dull, often ignoring the personal lives of scientists. This changed with Richard Feynman's memoir, ""Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman?"", which showed the personal side of a great physicist. Now, even famous scientists like Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein are portrayed with their personal flaws.

Dorothy Hodgkin was dedicated to her scientific work. She solved the structures of penicillin and vitamin B12, winning the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1964, and later solved the structure of insulin in 1969. She also had three children and was married to a historian. Her personal life may not seem directly related to her scientific work, but it shows how she balanced different aspects of her life.

Hodgkin's passion for scientific inquiry was central to her life. Communicating this passion is a challenge for biographers because many readers lack the scientific background to understand complex ideas. However, understanding science is not harder than reading Shakespeare or learning a new language; it just requires effort. It is unfortunate that many educated people are unaware of the contributions of scientists like Dorothy Hodgkin."
CAE_56,"Margaret and Her Water-Finding Skills

Margaret Wilkins is known for having a 'sixth sense'. She can use a forked hazel rod to find water underground. Many farmers, whose wells have dried up, ask for her help. Margaret and her husband run a well-drilling business, using equipment like drilling rigs and air-compressed hammers. However, to find water, Margaret only needs a forked hazel stick. Their success rate is over 90%.

Dowsing is the ability to find water, minerals, and lost objects underground. It is considered a 'sixth sense'. There are many ideas about how it works, from physical explanations like magnetism to spiritual ones. One believable theory is that everything on Earth vibrates, and water vibrates more than other things. Dowsers might have a special ability to sense these vibrations. Some say they can 'sense' water, while others claim they can smell it, as smell is a very strong sense.

The Wilkins have been very busy during recent droughts, with a waiting list of almost six weeks at one point. Most of Margaret's clients are farmers with dry wells. She says, 'We usually see customers only once because wells last a long time.' Other clients have remote cottages or barns, now used as holiday homes, where installing water pipes is too expensive. Some are golf-course developers needing water for clubhouse facilities.

Margaret tries to find water 50 to 70 meters deep. 'You can't drill a well where farm or other waste might contaminate the water. The water we find flows in cracks of solid rock, and if we bring it straight up, it should be clean. But in Cornwall, you have to watch out for iron because the area is rich in minerals.' Another important factor is electricity to power the pump; it's too costly to run power lines over long distances, so the well should be near existing power sources. After considering all this, Margaret starts looking for water.

On large areas like golf courses, she begins with a map and a pendulum. 'I hold the pendulum still and move it over the map. It swings when it is over an area with water.' After the map shows possible spots, Margaret walks over the fields with a hazel stick. 'Once I'm above water, I feel something strange; I sway a bit. When it stops, I use the stick to find the exact spot to drill.' She holds the two forks of the stick with both hands and pulls them slightly outward. 'When water is right below, the straight part of the stick rises. It's crucial to drill exactly where the stick indicates. If you're off by a little, you can miss the water completely. My husband also dowses the same area; usually, we agree on where to drill. If we don't agree, we keep looking until we do.'

Margaret Wilkins is not alone in practicing this unusual skill in the west of England. Anthropologists and writers have long been interested in this mysterious ability. Margaret calls it an 'intuitive perception of the environment', which is the closest explanation for her accurate water-finding. Without this 'sixth sense', how else could her family successfully run their well-drilling business year after year?"

Have you ever thought about swapping lives with someone else for a day? Maybe you think it would be fun to try something different? We arranged this for four people - read about their experiences.

**Amanda's Story**

Amanda, a 23-year-old mother with two daughters, swapped lives with her friend Cindy, a 30-year-old waitress at a busy London restaurant. Amanda had never been in such a lively place before. It was dark, noisy, and full of people. She was unsure if she could handle it. Being a mother is busy, but this was different! She had only fifteen minutes to learn how to carry a tray of drinks with one hand. The other waitresses made it look easy, but Amanda struggled, and the drinks fell, making a mess. She was embarrassed, but the other waitresses laughed and said everyone makes mistakes at first.

By 11:30 am, a line had formed outside, and Amanda felt nervous. She worried about remembering orders, but everything was automated. After a few hours, her feet hurt, and she couldn't get used to the loud music. She had to keep asking customers to repeat themselves, which was embarrassing. By the end of her shift at 5 pm, she was exhausted and wanted to soak her feet. She was surprised when a waitress said it had been a 'quiet' day. Amanda realized waitressing was tiring and not for shy people. She wasn't impressed with the pay either, as she didn't get any tips. She was glad to return to her children, which seemed easier after waitressing.

**Cindy's Story**

Cindy was nervous but excited to be a 'mum' for the day. She was warned the girls were cheeky, but she thought she could handle it. She was wrong! After Amanda left for work, Cindy had to dress and feed the girls. After dropping Sophie at school and Katie at nursery, she thought she would have some peace. But Amanda left a note with chores like making beds, cleaning, and doing laundry. At 1 pm, Cindy picked up Katie, went to the supermarket, and then home for lunch. When Sophie came home, the real challenge began. The girls turned the sofa into a trampoline and screamed loudly. Cindy thought they would tire out, but they didn't. She managed to get them to bed by 8 pm, but they kept asking for water to stay up and watch TV. Cindy found it exhausting to negotiate with them all evening. She didn't realize how tiring it was to look after two small children. Despite the challenges, she enjoyed the day.

**Rosemary's Story**

Rosemary, a 42-year-old dairy farmer, swapped with Hilary, a 30-year-old primary school teacher. On the farm, Rosemary wakes up at 5:30 am, so sleeping until 7 was a treat. She worried about what to wear and hoped she blended in at the school assembly with 400 pupils. In the maths class, children worked in groups, which was different from her school days. She helped with a nature project and was exhausted by lunchtime, but teachers only have a short break. She attended a staff meeting and helped with athletics trials. After lunch, there was a silent reading lesson and a French lesson, where the children practiced on her. Finally, there was Physical Education, and Rosemary was drained, but the children were full of energy. She found speaking in front of the class daunting. Despite teachers having more holidays, she preferred farming.

**Hilary's Story**

Hilary arrived at White House Farm at 8:30 am, surprised that Rosemary had been up for three hours. The farm has 100 Jersey cows, 15 calves, and about 800 ewes. Rosemary also makes ice-cream, yoghurt, and cream. Hilary spent the morning in the ice-cream parlour, bottling milk and packaging ice-cream. It was hard not to taste the treats! At lunchtime, she checked the sheep and helped a fallen ewe. Sheep need to be checked daily, especially in winter. After feeding the calves, she started milking, which took two-and-a-half hours. Rosemary does this twice a day, every day of the year. Hilary found the day lonely and missed the children. The hardest part was not being able to take time off, as the cows need milking daily. Farming seems romantic, but it's tough, with irregular income and dependence on the weather."
CAE_6,"Text: 'A trumpet isn't just for Christmas... It's interesting how many musicians, even famous ones, come from homes without music. Hakan Hardenberger, the only son of parents who didn't play music, grew up in a rural area of southern Sweden. At 30, he is now a unique trumpet player in the world. His recordings introduce new music, including concertos by lesser-known composers from the baroque and classical periods, as well as new works. When you meet him, he looks young and is friendly, much like the sound of the trumpet. Recently, he played the Hummel Trumpet Concerto in one of London's top concert halls, and a TV feature focused on his work and growth, filmed in both the UK and Sweden. Born near Malmo, his career began with a Christmas gift when he was eight. His father, who liked Louis Armstrong, decided to give him a real trumpet, not a toy. The gift was a success, and the boy played constantly. His mother found a teacher for him, the second trumpet player in the Malmo Symphony Orchestra, Bo Nilsson, who noticed his talent right away. Hardenberger is grateful for having such a dedicated teacher who loved the trumpet and was always looking for new ways to improve. Hardenberger explains that the trumpet is a simple instrument with imperfections, and he learned to work with them. From the start, he had a special sound, which he developed as a child. Unlike John Wallace, a great British trumpet player who started in brass bands and orchestras, Hardenberger always saw himself as a solo artist. He admired the French trumpeter Maurice Andre, who also focused on solo performances. His parents supported his dream of becoming a professional trumpet player. At 15, he needed to decide where to study. America was considered too far and dangerous, so at 16, he went to Paris to study with Pierre Thibaud. Thibaud advised against joining an orchestra, comparing it to gardening. Hardenberger knew he played better than others his age, but during his first competition at 17 in Paris, he realized he had a special ability to connect with audiences. Thibaud suggested he enter the competition for experience. Hardenberger learned the pieces for the first round and advanced to the second. He knew most of the pieces in that round too, but in the final, he faced a difficult concerto. He didn't win first prize, but he enjoyed performing and realized that even if he didn't play perfectly, people listened to him. Hardenberger's honesty about his work might seem arrogant, but that's not true. He thoughtfully avoids analyzing his gift for communication, believing that trying to explain it might ruin it. The power of music, he says, is in its ability to move people.'"

**ANNE'S DAY**  
""I wake up at 6:30 am, go to the gym at 7 am, and start work by 8 am. I begin operating at 8:30 am. I perform surgeries all day on Monday and Wednesday, and sometimes on Friday afternoons. Most surgeries take about three hours, but some can last all day. I've worked ten hours straight without eating or taking a break. Deciding when and how to operate can be stressful. I don't feel stressed while operating, but I do worry about the next day's plans. Brain surgery is usually a last option for patients, but when it succeeds, it's very rewarding. From 10 am to 1 pm, I have an out-patients' clinic where I explain the operations. I enjoy talking to patients, but time pressure can make it hard to comfort them if they get upset. I leave work between 6 pm and 8 pm. Some nights and weekends, I'm on call and always carry my pager. On holidays, I worry for the first few days about my patients, and I often dream about operating. I find it hard to switch off.""

**Age:** 31  

**MARITA'S DAY**  
""I get up at 7:45 am, leave home by 8:20 am, take the train, and arrive at work by 9:15 am. On Mondays at 10:30 am, we have a meeting to discuss our projects and any issues. My team includes three senior designers, a company partner, and a junior designer. Only 10-15% of the work is design; the rest is production. I get a brief from the client, and then spend three to four weeks designing and developing the project. After presenting my ideas to the client and getting approval, we set budgets and I start hiring photographers and illustrators. I coordinate with printers to ensure everything is on track. Managing people is a big part of my job, and clear communication is essential. I assemble everything and send it to the printers. Juggling multiple projects can be very stressful, with deadlines always approaching. Lunch is at 1 pm for an hour, and we try to go out. If not, I have sandwiches and work through. It's great when a client likes your work, but disappointing if it's rejected. I get home at 7:30 pm at the earliest, often later. It's hard to relax when I'm busy.""

""I usually get up at 7 am, but two or three times a week, I meet early flights and get up between 4:30 am and 5 am. Around 10:30 or 11 am, I might go for a bike ride or swim. Since driving is a sedentary job, I watch my diet and exercise. I have a big breakfast and snack during the day. People often ask for restaurant or shop recommendations, so I need to know the area well. Many jobs are pre-booked, so I can plan routes in advance. Not everyone is polite; some passengers are rude, but most are well-behaved, and I have good relationships with regular clients. Sometimes I overhear conversations and have to focus on driving. The press has tried to get me to talk about clients, but I don't. I work seven days a week, up to fifteen hours a day, and try not to get too tired. I aim to be in bed by 11 pm.""

In summer, I may work until 10 pm; in winter, until 4:30 pm. The business office is at home, so I check messages and return calls when I get back. If someone wants their garden landscaped, I arrange an evening consultation. We use old materials to make gardens look aged, but sometimes clients have specific ideas that aren't great. It's satisfying to see a garden completed and blooming. It's hard to relax in the evenings because I can hear the business phone. I sleep well because the work is so physical. I'm not very strong, but I'm fit. It's a tough job, but it allows creativity.""

**E. THE CIVIL ENGINEER**

**Name:** Zena  
**Age:** 27  

**ZENA'S DAY**  
""I arrive at the site by 8:30 am. I'm the assistant resident engineer, overseeing the building of bridges and a retaining wall. I ensure contractors follow the schedule and safety standards with minimal environmental impact. I coordinate site professionals and solve problems. Contractors start at 6 am, so I first check with the clerk of works about what's happened since I left. My day depends on this information. I review paperwork and answer design questions. Lunch is usually half an hour between 2 pm and 2:30 pm, but I often eat on the go. It's easier to check the site when contractors are on break. Our relationship with contractors must be open to avoid conflicts. I see the duty resident engineer daily, but act immediately if something urgent arises. I usually leave the site around 6 pm and am always on call."""
CAE_40,"**Careers: Six People Talk About Their Typical Working Day**

**A. Credit Card Executive**

I wake up at 6 am and get to the office by 7.30 am. I handle customer development programs for our regular credit card users. My job includes launching and managing the Membership Rewards scheme in major European markets. I keep in touch with current card users, find new ones, and build relationships with partner companies. I spend the first 45 minutes organizing my day and then reply to emails. I manage all advertising for the membership program across Europe, so I meet with our marketing team and advertising agencies to plan strategies and future developments. I have meetings most of the day, but I keep my door open for questions. There are nine customer service units in Europe, and I travel to different markets once or twice a week to discuss issues. When I'm in London, I leave work between 6.30 pm and 7.00 pm.

**B. Record Company Executive**

I start work at 10.00 am and go through the mail, which includes 10 to 20 demo tapes, letters from producers, concert information, and invoices. The phone starts ringing at 10.30 am with calls from producers and publishers. I have meetings throughout the day about campaigns or projects for artists, involving the press, marketing, and the managing director. When I listen to demo tapes, I try to be constructive because it's important to the artists. I know if the sound fits our label. After signing a band, we work on the first album, choosing songs, producers, and musicians. I share my vision of the album with the company for marketing and sales. I also manage budgets and spending. I leave work at 7.00 pm at the earliest and often go to gigs, sometimes seeing up to five new groups a night. After gigs, I might visit an artist in the studio. My social life is mostly work-related, and I often get home at 1.00 am, when I listen to a record to relax.

**C. Sales Director**

I get up at 8.00 am and drive to work, arriving at 9.30 am. I open the mail, check the diary for client visits, and wait to see who comes in. I enjoy showing people around the showrooms and making sales, knowing the furniture is going to a good home. We sell antiques from £1,000 to £6,000 and buy from London salerooms, country house sales, private clients, and overseas. Many items need restoration, so I work with gilders, picture framers, and paper repairers. I read the Antiques Trade Gazette while having coffee to stay updated on the business, and I visit the Victoria and Albert Museum to compare furniture. I do the accounts monthly and tax returns every three months. I go home at 5.30 pm, and it takes about an hour to unwind.

**D. Air Traffic Controller**

I work a set shift pattern, leaving home at 6.00 am for an early shift. At 7.00 am, I take over from the night shift at one of the four control positions in the tower. We rotate stations, working for about an hour and a half, then taking a half-hour break before switching stations. The team includes air traffic controllers, a supervisor, and a watch manager, and we work together to control aircraft movements. In winter, we handle about 1,000 movements a day, and even more in summer. Night shifts are quieter, allowing me to read up on new air traffic requirements between 12 and 4.00 am. It's crucial to be alert in this job, so I don't hesitate to call in sick if I'm unwell. The work is stressful, and it takes time to relax after a shift. I hope to become a watch manager and eventually a general manager of the airport.

**E. Shop Manager**

If I'm on an early shift, I leave home by 8.00 am. I start by setting up the electronic point-of-sale system. I ensure someone is at the till and coordinate staff lunches and breaks. I spend the morning helping customers and ordering books for them. I enjoy serving customers, though it can be frustrating when they expect me to gather a pile of books based on reviews. Between 2.00 pm and 4.00 pm, publishers' reps visit the shop, and I discuss new titles for the coming months. I decide how many copies of a title the shop might sell. When featuring a new title, I ensure it's delivered on time. The early shift ends at 5.45 pm. I work late shifts twice a week, closing the computer system, locking up, and going home.

**F. Financial Analyst**

I listen to the news at 7.00 am, then get up and take a taxi to work, arriving at 8.45 am. I contact our freelance reporters to learn about events in my region. I assess financial risks for multinational companies abroad, warning clients of potential issues. I provide three services: an online executive preview, a security forecast, and a travel information security guide. From 9.15 am to 9.30 am, I meet with editors to discuss stories. My first executive preview is due online by 10.00 am, and the second by 11.00 am, so I quickly gather stories. I type them, send them to my editor for approval, then make any changes before they go online. I travel to Africa about three times a year to report on events or stay updated. I leave work around 6.00 pm. It's hard to switch off, and I'm often awake at 1.00 am."
CAE_45,"**Career Power: Take Control at Work**

**A. What Makes a Good Leader?**

A good leader inspires others and brings about change. Leadership isn't about physical traits like height or just intelligence. Pat Dixon, author of ""Making the Difference: Women and Men in the Workplace,"" says leadership is about ""making things happen through people who are as enthusiastic and interested as you are."" Enthusiasm is crucial, and a good leader should speak clearly and confidently. Dixon says it's about having the confidence to say ""I believe"" instead of ""I think.""

**B. Discovering Leadership Potential**

John van Maurik, director of a Leadership in Management course, believes most people have more leadership potential than they realize. Becoming a leader involves recognizing and developing these hidden talents. We all have the potential to be leaders; we just need the right environment. While it's easy to see leadership in famous figures like Emmeline Pankhurst or Mahatma Gandhi, it can be harder to see it in our own workplaces. Yet, leadership is essential for effective management.

**C. Reflecting on Leadership Styles**

Think about the best and worst bosses you've had. They might have been equally good at setting goals and meeting deadlines. But how did they achieve these? The best leader motivated and supported you. The worst made you feel unimportant and withheld information, blaming you when things went wrong. The first led well; the second managed poorly.

**D. Leaders vs. Managers**

Leaders and managers are different. Managers work within set boundaries, while leaders create new paths. Michael Shea, author of ""Leadership Rules,"" writes that a good manager can keep a company running, but a good leader can transform a struggling organization, whether it's a company, a sports team, or a nation.

**E. Improving Your Leadership Skills**

Whether you're a boss or a middle manager, you can improve your leadership skills. Here are some lessons:

- Leadership is best when chosen. Find your passions and act on them when you feel inspired.
- Think of yourself as a leader. Recognize your ability to lead.
- While collaboration is good, sometimes firm leadership is needed. Try different styles and see how outcomes change.
- Set goals and exceed them. Identify areas in your job where leadership can enhance your effectiveness and career.

**F. Developing Leadership**

- Leadership develops from taking the lead, taking risks, and learning from mistakes. Learn to delegate, motivate, organize, and praise.
- Your leadership style might not immediately win over colleagues. Keep improving your communication skills. You don't need to be liked, but your ideas and achievements should be.
- Be visible and accessible to those who matter. Remember, you don't have to lead all the time. Know where your contribution is vital and help others develop as leaders."
CAE_64,"**Films on Video: Reviews by Nick James**

**A. Abyss**  
Before Titanic, director James Cameron made this intense Cold War thriller about oil rig workers and navy experts trying to save a nuclear submarine deep underwater. The foreman Bud and his team remind us of the cool heroes in Howard Hawks' movies. The production design and special effects are very impressive, but the dialogue and characters are not as strong. Despite the skilled filmmaking, the story feels like a B-movie.

**B. The Thin Red Line**  
This video release of the James Jones novel about the battle for Guadalcanal, directed by Andrew Marton, is interesting compared to Terrence Malick's new film. While Malick's version is mystical and poetic, Marton's is a more traditional war movie, often closer to the book. It focuses on one soldier and his tough sergeant. Malick's film is richer and more complex, but Marton's has its highlights. The flashback of the soldier dreaming of his wife is more intense than Malick's softer imagery.

**C. On Guard**  
Loosely based on Paul Feval's 1875 novel, this entertaining swashbuckler is better than most musketeer adventures. Fabrice Luchini plays a great villain, a sneaky politician causing chaos. Vincent Perez is a lively hero, though his role is short, and Daniel Auteuil, while a bit too serious, shines as an acrobat-turned-swordsman. The film uses costume-drama clichés with such wit and energy that it remains enjoyable.

**D. Character**  
A visually striking but gloomy story set in early 1900s Rotterdam. The detailed production and costumes make the film look like a museum piece. Jan Decleir is very serious as the harsh bailiff Dreverhaven, who is ruthless when evicting tenants. The tense relationship with his son is central to the story, but the filmmakers focus too much on period details, missing the dark and intense nature of the tale.

**E. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly**  
This digitally re-mastered video highlights director Leone's skill. The sound editing is excellent, making every sound clear. The story is harsh, and whenever it slows down, Morricone's great music brings excitement. Morally, there's little difference between the good (Clint Eastwood), the bad (Lee van Cleef), and the ugly (Eli Wallach), as they all act ruthlessly in the post-Civil War West.

**F. The Longest Day**  
This three-hour war epic, boasting ""forty-eight international stars,"" is directed by four directors and features 23,000 extras. The early scenes, where soldiers wait for the invasion, feel long for both them and the audience. Logistically impressive, it needs a big screen to be fully appreciated. On video, it loses some of its impact."
CAE_29,"**BOOK A**  
Steve Martin's *Compelling Evidence* is truly engaging. The story follows a lawyer trying to start a new practice after leaving a big law firm. He ends up defending his boss's wife, who is accused of murdering her husband. The trial scenes are exciting, with the outcome uncertain until the end, and there's a surprising twist in the final pages. This is a great debut in a busy genre.

**BOOK B**  
*Curtains for the Cardinal* starts with excitement and throws Sigismondo, a problem-solver for the Italian Renaissance aristocracy, into a mix of politics, church intrigue, and murder. We are confident he will solve the mystery. The plot is complex and the book is a bit long, but it's still very enjoyable.

**BOOK C**  
*File Under: Deceased* introduces a new detective, Leah Hunter, created by first-time author Sarah Lacey. Leah is a tax inspector who starts investigating when a strange man dies at her feet. Despite facing challenges and the disapproval of a local detective sergeant, Leah is determined and successful.

**BOOK D**  
In *Double Deuce* by Robert B. Parker, private investigator Spenser helps his friend Hawk clear drug dealers from a poor area in Boston. The dialogue is quick and clever, with more philosophy than violence. As always, Parker delivers high-quality entertainment.

**BOOK E**  
*False Prophet* by Faye Kellermann features detectives Pete Decker and Marge Dunn. They investigate an attack and burglary at the home of a famous film star's daughter. The author's easy writing style and insight into human behavior make this an entertaining mystery.

**BOOK F**  
*Blood Red, Snow White* is written by Diane Henry and Nicholas Horrock. It features a lawyer and a female client, but the action happens outside the courtroom. The lawyer becomes a victim as the plot unfolds. The story mixes romance, money, and violence to create a gripping suspense novel.

**BOOK G**  
*Dead for a Ducat* by Simon Shaw features actor Philip Fletcher as a potential victim. A funny group of characters gathers to film a Robin Hood story, but Philip feels this isn't the right direction for his career. While entertaining, this book doesn't meet Shaw's usual high standards.

**BOOK H**  
*Fall Down Easy* is Lawrence Gough's best book in a while. Canadian police chase a clever bank robber who targets female bank tellers. The slow, well-paced build-up of tension and the portrayal of the smart, troubled robber make this a standout detective novel."
CAE_57,"Text: ""I might be too old for this adventure, but here goes! At 34, Tim Pozzi has left a good job to go backpacking. He thinks about why he and others his age decide to take this big step. This summer, I quit my job, decided to rent out my apartment, and travel in Southeast Asia for a year. You might think I'm lucky, but I'm 34 years old, and I'm nervous. It's not like I haven't traveled before. After university, I spent two years backpacking around North and South America, and when I returned, I was determined to do it again someday. But you know how it is... I fell in love, started a career, bought an apartment, and got used to earning a salary. But I slowly realized I was giving up my own happiness for my salary. When I handed in my resignation letter, it felt like I was taking control of my life again. I now have no ties. Many of my friends are married with children, and while they wouldn't trade places with me, they envy my lack of responsibilities. I'm no longer in a relationship, and I have no strong career ambitions. I feel almost obliged to make the most of that freedom - if only for my friends' sake! Why am I so nervous? First, it's about making the necessary arrangements. How could I let someone else live in my home? And how would I organize the rental? And besides, I had to decide where to go. I'm a terrible procrastinator and am already several weeks behind my planned schedule. 'Might as well enjoy the summer in England,' I told myself. Then, 'Why not stay for the start of the football season?' Cutting emotional ties makes it even harder. I'm delaying because, deep down, I wonder if I can still handle backpacking. Will I be able to adjust to a simpler way of life? Will I feel out of place among young backpackers fresh out of school and university? Maybe not. I've found it's becoming more common for Britons in their late twenties and thirties to want to leave the lives they've built and travel to foreign places. Jennifer Cox, from Lonely Planet guidebook publishers, says there's a growing awareness that adventure is there for the taking: 'People are realizing they can have the opportunity anytime they want. They just need to be brave, organized, and confident enough to do it.' For Danny, a 30-year-old accountant, and his girlfriend Tammy, a 28-year-old teacher, it's a chance to have one last adventure before settling down. They have bought a round-the-world ticket for a year. 'I'm ready to give up job security for the trip,' says Danny. 'There's always a thought in your mind that, ""OK, I'm not moving up the career ladder, I'll be in the same position when I come back,"" but I think it's a risk you have to take. When I left the office, I threw my calculator into the river as a symbolic act of defiance!' For Matt, who just left the Army, the year he spent traveling was a time of change. 'In the military, there's a set way of doing things, a pattern to how you solve problems. I went away because I needed to change this and get rid of this approach in some cases, to have a reasonable life as a civilian.' While there are many reasons to go traveling at my age, there seem to be common factors. 'We have a much more flexible workforce today,' says Angela Baron of the Institute of Personnel Development. 'There are more people working on short-term contracts, so if your contract ends, you've got nothing to lose.' Larger companies are even adopting career-break policies. 'If you've spent a lot of time and money training someone, it's nice to know they're coming back at some point rather than going to work for a competitor.' For Dan Hiscocks, managing director of Travellerseye, a publishing company that specializes in the stories of 'ordinary' travelers, more people in their thirties are rethinking their lives. 'If you're not happy with what you're doing - and many people aren't - it's no longer about just sticking with it. Now people know that opportunities exist and that a job isn't ""for life"" anymore. Travel offers a chance to reassess, to step back and think about your life.' Is giving in to wanderlust just another example of my generation's struggle with adulthood? Jennifer Cox thinks not. 'It's a sign of a better-educated, more stable society when we're less worried about paying the bills and more about living a balanced life. We're actually taking the time to ask ""Is this what I want?"" Ben, a 32-year-old picture researcher heading to Central America for a year, doesn't believe he's running away. 'It's more about running towards something. It's trying to grab some things that I want for myself.' But he does feel some fear. 'It's the thought of what I'm leaving behind, that comfortable routine - just going into the office every day, saying ""hi"" to everyone, and sitting down with a cup of coffee.' I share Ben's worries about leaving behind an ordered life with few challenges, and I'm not sure I'd be making this journey if I hadn't found my boss so unbearable. As Jennifer Cox points out: 'This is fairly typical. There's often a catalyst, like the end of a relationship or the loss of a job. Such an event can push people to go and do it.' It may have taken a helpful push to get me moving, but I'm now looking forward to the next 12 months with growing excitement. Whatever happens, I'll be able to take satisfaction in having taken control of my life. And in that, I'm sure I speak for all of us older backpackers."""
CAE_42,"**Plugging in the Home**

Georgina McGuiness had taken a long break from her journalism career and felt disconnected from the technological changes. She shares how she turned her family home into an efficient workplace.

The Christmas before last, I turned 37 and realized I needed to restart my journalism career, which I thought was lost due to technology. My resume showed I was stuck in the 1980s, when typewriters were the latest technology. It seemed unlikely anyone would hire me to use a computer in a newsroom. Many job ads asked for desktop publishing experience, which I didn't have. I felt more likely to teach nuclear physics than to design a page on a computer. I was the family technophobe; even pocket calculators confused me, and I couldn't use the video timer. Clearly, I needed to act quickly to save my career.

I thought leaving home before the children did would be difficult until I entered a competition in a local newspaper. Like a success story that only happens to others, my family and I won a computer package. We received a laptop for my husband and a personal computer for the family. We quickly adapted to this new world, and terms like cyberspace, Internet, and surfing became part of our vocabulary. We started chatting with strangers worldwide via the Internet. The children stopped watching TV, and I set up a mini-office in the kitchen with a phone-answering machine, a fax, a CD-ROM, and a modem connecting me to the Internet. I had everything I needed to work from home and still take the children to school.

The children were confident with computers from school, but I was hesitant, worried I would lose my work by pressing the wrong button. I was wrong. Although not an expert, I learned the basic skills I needed. It was logical, easy, and foolproof. With perseverance, you learn a little more each day. I recently started freelancing for a magazine, writing about two articles a month, and I feel proud to have the best of both worlds.

How has the computer helped me? Since school, my desk was always a chaotic mess, and I often lost important notes. The computer has made me organized, especially with office tasks. Spreadsheets help track income and expenses, and pre-formatted invoices and letterheads save time and effort. For a journalist, being online means I can research stories, ask for more information in journalism forums, and discuss working from home with people worldwide.

If this sounds too good to be true, there are downsides to working from home. You can feel isolated from people. There are distractions from urgent house chores, and when the children are home, we argue over who gets to use the computer. However, more people are buying multimedia PCs, not just for education, leisure, and entertainment. In my street, a new type of home-based industry is growing because people don't have to commute to the city daily.

So, what characterizes home workers as we move into the next century? A report called ""PC Usage in UK Homes"" describes the typical computer user as 38 years old and well-educated; 93% own a personal computer, and 32% have a CD-ROM device; 38% have a laser printer, and 50% have a modem. Considering this, I seem to be ahead of schedule. Who knows, one day I might email a column to a newspaper in Melbourne or, better yet, publish my own magazine from home. It seems the sky, or should I say cyberspace, is the limit."
CAE_59,"**The Tartan Museum**

The modern buildings of Scotland's national museum stand out in historic Edinburgh. But are its contents as impressive? Sally Varlow visited just before it opened.

You can't miss it. The Museum of Scotland is noticeable on Chambers Street in Edinburgh, with its large, yellow sandstone tower and unique buildings, topped by a hanging garden. Last winter, the building received mixed reactions: some praised it as a 'masterpiece', others were cautious, and some disliked it. Now, as the museum prepares to open, the exhibitions might receive similar reactions.

The museum tells Scotland's story through various historic objects, with a timeline to guide visitors. It showcases national treasures like Mary Queen of Scots' jewels without overwhelming them with national pride. The main question is whether people will find the museum interesting enough to return.

Dr. David Clarke, head of exhibitions, wants the museum to be enjoyable for everyone, not just experts. He avoids using imaginative recreations of the past, believing the public deserves the truth. The museum shows what experts know, but the challenge is to make the objects' stories engaging with explanation panels, captions, and limited multimedia.

Inside, the museum's spaces are impressive. Galleries connect in different sizes and shapes, with pale walls and deep display cases. Daylight streams through windows, creating a pleasant atmosphere to explore each item.

Thanks to a Junior board of 9- to 12-year-olds from across Scotland, the museum has a Discovery Centre for children. Although they couldn't ride through the displays, they have a hands-on center instead. The Twentieth Century gallery, on the top floor, is the only temporary exhibition. It features objects chosen by Scottish people and others that impacted life in Scotland during the twentieth century, like an electric guitar and televisions. While the idea is fun, it might seem less serious until the computerised bank of personal stories is available next week.

Overall, Dr. Clarke believes that 'objects open windows on the past more vividly than anything else'. The modern architecture works well inside, but whether it fits the location is another question."
CAE_54,"Text: 'The end of print may take some time Peter Preston Transition. It's a nice word and a calming idea. Change can scare some people and challenge others. But transition means moving smoothly from the present to the future. Unless, that is, it is newspapers' 'transition' to the online world, which is uncertain and uncomfortable - because it might not be a process at all. But surely (you say) it will happen eventually. Everyone knows that print newspaper sales are dropping while visits to their websites are increasing. Just look at the latest print circulation numbers. The Daily Telegraph, The Guardian, and many others are down between 8% and 10% year-on-year, but their websites are growing. This might be true, depending on timing, age groups, location, and more. After all, everyone - from web experts to print analysts - says so. Yet pause for a moment and notice a few things that don't quite fit. If sales in that area have fallen so little, maybe the crisis mostly affects newspapers? Yet again, the messages are mixed. The latest survey by the World Association of Newspapers shows that global circulation rose 1.1% last year (to 512 million copies a day). Sales in the West dropped, but Asia more than made up the difference. As for news and current affairs magazines - which you'd expect to be hit hard by digital - they had a 5.4% increase. In short, on both sides of the Atlantic, although some magazine areas went down, many showed rapid growth. You can see a similar trend with books. Kindle and similar e-readers are booming, with sales up a lot this year. The first step of transition seems clear. Yet, when booksellers looked at the value of the physical books they sold over the last six months, they found it just 0.4% down. Screen or paper, then? It wasn't one or the other: it was both. Stories about young people abandoning newspaper-reading are exaggerated. Look at the latest National Readership Survey figures and you'll find nearly 5,000,000 people aged between 15 and 35 reading the main national dailies. And even within Europe, different countries have different stories. There's Britain, with a 10.8% drop in recent years (and a 19.6% fall for quality papers), but in Germany, the decline has only been 7% overall - with just 0.8% lost to quality titles. And France shows only a 3.1% fall (0.8% at the quality end of the market). These different national trends may show a situation more complicated than digital revolution experts think. America's media analysts used to say that growing online advertising revenues would pay for change and, along with lower production costs, make online newspapers a success. But now, with digital ads on newspaper sites actually dropping, such ideas seem outdated. Already 360 US papers - including most of the biggest and best - have built paywalls around their products. However, the best way to attract paying readers seems to be a deal that offers the print copy and digital access together. In other words, print is also important in selling internet subscriptions. And its advertising rates bring in nine to ten times more money than online. Of course, this big difference isn't good news for newspaper companies, as maintaining both an active website and an active print edition is difficult, complex, and expensive. But newspaper brands still have much of their high profile in print; on the web, just being noticed is much harder.'"
CAE_32,"**Photographing People**

People are the most interesting subjects to photograph. A photo with a person in it is usually more engaging than one without. However, photographing people well is challenging. Besides technical and artistic aspects, photographers must pay attention to actions, gestures, and expressions. Sometimes, the camera can make people act unnaturally.

**A. GROUPING PEOPLE**

Avoid straight lines in group photos. Ask people to stand at different angles and distances, or on different levels. You can also have some people sitting or kneeling in front so all faces are visible, or raise your viewpoint.

**B. POSING FOR PICTURES**

People often act unnaturally in front of a camera. They might become stiff. Help them relax by suggesting they find a comfortable position, like folding their hands or putting them in their pockets.

**C. THE RIGHT APPROACH**

Don't pretend you are not taking a picture when you clearly are, as this can create tension. Most people will agree to be photographed, though they might protest at first. They may become self-conscious, so you might need to guide them. A photo can be ruined if the subject looks aimlessly out of the frame.

**D. EYE CONTACT**

A photo has more impact if the subject looks at the viewer. Ask them to look into the lens, but not necessarily to smile. They might not be able to do this for long, so remind them just before you take the picture. You can also say something funny to get a genuine reaction.

**E. CANDID CONCENTRATION**

Instead of direct eye contact, the subject can focus on something within the picture. This might be easier for them, and the viewer can follow their gaze. Candid shots are fascinating, and the subject's expression is important.

**F. EXPRESSIONS AND GESTURES**

Expressions and gestures reveal a lot about the subject. A laughing child can make the viewer smile, while a sad expression can evoke sympathy. Look for familiar expressions like shrugs, winks, or thumbs-up. They are a universal visual language.

**G. SITUATION INTEREST**

While close-up shots have impact, the background can add interest and information. When using a background, exclude irrelevant details or blur them. Ensure the subject is not overshadowed by the background. A wide-angle lens can make the subject appear larger compared to the background.

**H. INTERACTION**

When people are interacting, there are opportunities for great photos. Couples, mothers and babies, or teams working together make appealing shots. Look for eye contact or physical contact, like a handshake. Capture reactions with animated expressions or gestures.

**I. PEOPLE AND PLACES**

Many photos of people are taken on holiday to show the places they visit. To improve these photos, use a standard or wide-angle lens and step back to include the whole scene. Ask your subjects to come close to the camera, forming a foreground without blocking the background. An elevated camera position can help. A good photo balances the subjects and the place, so both are equally interesting.

**J. TO POSE OR NOT TO POSE?**

Decide why you want to take the picture. If it's to remember someone you met briefly, ask them to pose against a nice background. Family photos can be boring if they are all formal poses. Candid shots of events are more lively, especially when you know the subject well. A spontaneous picture can bring back memories better than a posed one."
CAE_65,"**Under Sarah's Spell**

Sarah Janson is a trompe-l'oeil artist. Her paintings trick the eye by creating the illusion of reality. In this interview with Joanna Watt, we learn more about her. Unlike most artists, Sarah doesn't sign her work unless asked. She believes the work is more important than the artist. Sarah is very modest and almost makes it seem like her paintings create themselves. This attitude makes her a challenging interview subject. She admits, ""I just don't like to talk about myself,"" and is embarrassed when asked to be photographed.

Later, in her living room, which is a beautiful space in a block of artists' studios in London, the interview becomes lively and fun. Sarah has been a trompe-l'oeil artist for sixteen years. She studied drawing for two years at art school, earned a degree in graphic illustration, and worked at a publishing house. However, illustration didn't satisfy her, so she joined a specialist decorator, Jim Smart. He asked her to create a trompe-l'oeil piece, and she was hooked. She left to start her own business, feeling she was on the right path.

Sarah's skills in observation and detail, developed through illustration, are crucial for trompe-l'oeil. She says, ""People often ask me where they can learn trompe-l'oeil. But no one can teach you. It's all about observation."" She insists she is still learning and believes that thinking you've mastered a field means it's time to quit. She is honest about her weaknesses, like her struggle to paint bread, which she says looks like grey concrete. She also admits to difficulties with math, especially when working on a large project like the domed chapel ceiling at Lulworth Castle.

Sarah often talks about her work in the third person, saying things like, ""When I finished that ceiling, I thought, 'Well, I didn't do it, she did.'"" Her trompe-l'oeil work is exceptional, far above others who have tried to imitate the style. She has completed many major corporate and private commissions. Her work is often inspired by architecture, like a dining room based on a Venetian palazzo or a painting that makes a corridor look like it leads to more rooms.

Trompe-l'oeil must do two things: trick the viewer and engage their imagination. Sarah believes it should also be personal to the client. She enjoys working with clients, saying, ""That's where the ideas are born."" Some clients have clear ideas, while others do not, so she listens carefully to understand their imagination. Many clients become friends because she spends so much time with them during projects. Sarah appreciates her clients, especially the adventurous ones who trust her with their walls.

Despite her modesty, Sarah is always busy. She repeats, ""I really don't like to talk about myself. Like my work, I am very restrained. I don't want it to shout."" While she may not like to boast, her work deserves recognition."
CAE_61,"**Emotional Intelligence - The Key to Success**

Daniel Goleman explores the 'people skills' that are crucial for success in your career.

**A** The way we are evaluated at work is changing. We are not only judged by our intelligence or skills but also by how we manage ourselves and interact with others. This new way of judging is important for deciding who gets hired or promoted. It helps identify who might excel and who might not. These skills are important for future job opportunities, regardless of the field. They are different from what we learned in school, where exams were the focus. Now, it is assumed that we have the necessary intelligence and technical skills. The focus is on social skills and personal qualities like initiative, empathy, adaptability, and persuasiveness. These are known as emotional intelligence.

**B** In today's world, job security is uncertain, and the idea of a 'job' is changing to 'portable skills'. Personal qualities are becoming more important at work. These have been called 'character', 'personality', or 'soft skills' in the past. Now, they are better understood and called 'emotional intelligence'. This means being aware of and managing our own and others' emotions to guide our actions. At work, it includes self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills. Emotional intelligence is not just about 'being nice'. Sometimes it means being honest, even if it's uncomfortable. It also doesn't mean expressing all feelings freely. It means managing emotions so they are expressed appropriately, helping people work together towards a common goal.

**C** More businesses are recognizing that emotional intelligence is important for management. The more complex the job, the more emotional intelligence matters. A lack of these skills can limit the use of technical skills or intelligence. Some people succeed despite weaknesses in emotional intelligence, but as work becomes more complex and team-oriented, companies that foster good teamwork have an advantage. In today's workplace, with a focus on teamwork and customer service, emotional intelligence is essential for success in any job worldwide.

**D** Unlike IQ, which changes little, emotional intelligence can grow as we learn from life experiences. Studies show that people often become better at managing their emotions, motivating themselves, and improving their empathy and social skills over time. This growth in emotional intelligence is often called maturity. Emotional intelligence can be learned, and we can develop these skills to help us succeed, especially when job stability is uncertain. While emotional intelligence is not a magic solution for struggling organizations, ignoring it can prevent other efforts from being as effective as they could be."
CAE_52,"Text: 'Should the media make money from content they don't own? Digital cameras and camera phones have made it easier to capture important events, but social media has changed citizen photography even more. News often breaks on social networks, so some journalists now use them to find images during fast-moving events. Unfortunately, some reporters have used user-generated content (UGC) without asking for permission. Even though there is official advice that images on social media can be used without permission in special cases or if there is a strong public interest, there is still a debate about whether this is right. Research shows that about one in ten people would film or photograph a news event, showing that UGC is important for the future of the media. However, to keep a good relationship with the public, the media must make sure people are properly rewarded for their work and always ask for permission.'"
CAE_28,"**Ancient Chinese Medicine in the West: Acupuncture**

Acupuncture is a practice that is 2,000 years old. It is part of traditional Chinese medicine, which also includes herbal remedies, massage, diet, and exercise. Acupuncture is used to treat many conditions, but it is most known in the West for helping with pain. Some general practitioners, midwives, and physiotherapists use it regularly for pain relief.

**A. What is Acupuncture?**

Traditional Chinese medicine believes that health is when the energy of the mind, body, and spirit are balanced. This energy, called Qi (pronounced ""chee""), flows through the body along paths called meridians. There are twelve main meridians, each connected to an internal organ, and many smaller ones that carry Qi to every cell. If the flow of Qi is blocked or weak, the body is out of balance, leading to weakness or illness. A traditional acupuncturist will try to find where the Qi is imbalanced by feeling your wrist pulses, looking at your tongue, and assessing your overall appearance. They will also ask about your medical history, current health, and lifestyle. Acupuncture involves inserting fine needles into the skin, sometimes with added warmth or pressure, to stimulate the flow of Qi.

**B. Over Three Hundred Points**

The points used in acupuncture are related to meridians and may not be near the area of pain. People often feel a dull ache or tingling when the needle is moved. This can be done by hand or with an electro-acupuncture machine. Acupuncturists say this feeling shows the needle has reached the Qi. There are over 300 points on the main meridians, with many more used less often.

**C. Scientific Explanations**

Even without accepting traditional Chinese medicine principles, Western doctors recognize that acupuncture can relieve pain. Scientific explanations include:
- Stimulating certain nerves may block pain signals from reaching the brain.
- Acupuncture might release natural pain-relieving substances called endorphins.

**D. Types of Pain Treated**

Many people with chronic pain try acupuncture as a last resort. It is commonly used for back pain, sports injuries, arthritis, headaches, migraines, and post-surgery pain. Acupuncturists also claim to treat menstrual pain, facial nerve pain, and pain in terminally ill patients.

**E. Modern Use of an Ancient Treatment**

Although acupuncture has been used in China for over 2,000 years, using it instead of anesthesia during surgery began in the 1950s. This convinced some doctors outside China of its effectiveness. In China, acupuncture is used in various surgeries, including heart surgery. It can be used alone, with electrical stimulation, or with drugs. It is said to eliminate pain, but this varies by person. Acupuncture anesthesia has no side effects like nausea, and recovery is quicker.

**F. Effectiveness**

Clinical trials for acupuncture are hard to conduct, but those done show that 50 to 80 percent of people find it effective for chronic pain. Acupuncturists agree with this success rate but acknowledge it doesn't work for everyone. For chronic pain, relief usually takes six to seven visits, with some improvement after two or three visits.

**G. A Different Approach to Pain**

Western and Chinese medicine view pain differently. Acupuncturists see patients holistically, not just focusing on symptoms. They spend time diagnosing, looking for weaknesses in Qi, and considering external factors like weather. These factors help decide how to treat pain with acupuncture, unlike typical medical doctors.

**H. Traditional or Not?**

Some medical professionals have traditional acupuncture training, while others, including many GPs, prefer scientific explanations. Traditional acupuncturists believe only traditional Chinese medicine can lead to deep, lasting changes, which are hard to measure in trials. It's important to choose an acupuncturist carefully, and they should refer you to a doctor if needed."
CAE_35,"Text: P.D. James Barbara Michaels meets the famous crime writer, whose innocent look hides a complex and brilliant imagination. Best-selling crime writer P.D. James - the initials stand for Phyllis Dorothy - has a quiet authority. You can imagine her as a headmistress of a girls' school if she hadn't become a creator of detective stories with many twists and turns. But soon, you see that her authoritative look hides her shyness. She admits that Adam Dalgliesh, the detective in her novels, 'is, I suppose, modeled on myself - or rather, the way I would have turned out if I had been a man'. Dalgliesh likes to solve crimes alone, just like his creator. 'I need time on my own, especially when I am writing. I can write almost anywhere as long as I have total privacy.' She is too modest to agree that she is Britain's best-known crime writer, even though her books - 12 major detective novels - are read by millions worldwide. She is a big fan of her close friend Ruth Rendell's works. 'I particularly enjoy her psychological works, written under the name of Barbara Vine.' Books beside her bed are usually by women writers like Iris Murdoch, Anita Brookner, and Penelope Lively, but she also reads male authors like Graham Greene and Evelyn Waugh, whom she thinks were the greatest novelists of their generation. Success came to P.D. James later in life. Now in her seventies, she was 42 when her first crime novel, Cover Her Face, was published. Born in Oxford, the eldest of three children, Phyllis grew up mainly in Cambridge, where her family moved when she was 11 years old. 'I met my husband there - he was a student at the university, and I have always loved the place. That is why I chose it as the setting for An Unsuitable Job For A Woman.' She reluctantly shares that life has been hard, even tragic at times. Her Irish doctor husband, Connor Bantry White, returned from the Second World War, during which he served with the Royal Army Medical Corps, very sick. 'I had to work long hours to support him and our two young daughters, Clare and Jane. The ideas were in my head, but I could do almost nothing about it - I simply didn't have the time. My husband's parents, however, were wonderful, and took my daughters under their wing, giving them a sense of security during those difficult years.' While working full-time in administration for the National Health Service, she used her excellent organizational skills. At one point, five psychiatric outpatient clinics were under her control. Then she spent 11 years at the Home Office, first in the Police Department, doing administration for forensic science research, and then in the Criminal Law section, in the juvenile crime division. It was while working in forensic science that she became 'quite accustomed' to the sight of corpses. But it was not fascination with death itself that inspired her. 'It was, rather, the shape and construction involved in the writing of a crime novel that appealed. I have always enjoyed reading detective stories, and I always knew that I wanted to be a writer.' 'I didn't want to use the traumatic events of my own life in a work of fiction. Writing a detective story appealed as a wonderful training for someone wanting to be a serious novelist, and it was suitably removed from my own experience. As I went on, I became increasingly aware that one could stay within the constraints and indeed within the so-called formula of the classic detective story and still write a good, serious, and revealing novel about human beings. Writing detective stories', she says, 'is a way of bringing order out of disorder. The solution of a crime confirms the sanctity of life - even if that life is unlovable. Nobody really likes violence.'"
CAE_5,"**The Pen is Mightier than the Psychoanalyst**

The study of handwriting to understand a person's character is becoming more popular. In some countries, if you apply for a job, you might be asked for a handwriting sample. This sample could help decide if you are right for the job. Handwriting analysis, or graphology, is seen as a real science in many places. Researchers say it can help identify certain illnesses, like heart disease and cancer, and can show psychological states and emotional issues. Handwriting analysis is being used more for career guidance and during job interviews. Many large companies hire graphologists to study the handwriting of candidates for important positions. However, most doctors and psychiatrists are skeptical about graphology's value.

Patricia Marne, a graphologist with over 20 years of experience, believes that doctors should take it more seriously. She thinks handwriting can show psychological traits and some medical conditions. She says, ""Handwriting is a strong indicator of social class and intelligence. It can also assess mental ability and potential, whether a person should focus on arts or sciences, and whether they have a devious or open character.""

According to Ms. Marne, graphology can be useful in identifying possible criminal tendencies: ""Criminals often have disturbed handwriting, which is mostly illiterate and poorly-shaped. Many criminals come from deprived backgrounds and have arrested emotional development. This often appears in unusually childish handwriting and in going over letters several times.""

Ms. Marne can analyze handwriting to determine if people are honest, manipulative, or reliable employees. ""Young male offenders often have very high ascenders, showing they live in a world of fantasy and dream of success. Graphologists can tell if violence is about to happen, if the writer is under extreme pressure, and if there are psychopathic tendencies. Handwriting can also predict potential suicides.""

Heart and lung problems can also be detected, she says. ""You can't diagnose from one sample unless the writing is clearly shaky or disturbed. But if it changes over time or becomes disjointed, or if there's a break in the signature that wasn't there before, it could mean something serious has happened."" A severe emotional upset can also show in a temporarily changed signature, she claims.

Ms. Marne says handwriting can reveal other psychological traits. People whose letters form 'threads' instead of being individually formed are, apparently, devious and clever. Those who write mainly in capitals are trying to hide their true selves. Very light pressure indicates sensitivity and lack of energy. Originality in handwriting—how much the writer has deviated from standard script—shows confidence and artistic ability. Disconnected writing is a sign of a loner. Very small signatures indicate inhibition and an inferiority complex; circles over the 'i' are a bid for attention, and crossing the 't' heavily over the whole word shows intolerance and a patronizing attitude.

Ms. Marne says it takes six years of study and experience to analyze handwriting accurately, and this must be combined with empathy and intuition. She believes more research is needed to make graphology a proper science. She thinks this will happen soon. ""It's actually more accurate than psychoanalysis because you can tell the whole history of a person, including all their emotional crises, without asking them questions they might answer incorrectly.""

Although this sounds interesting, there is little solid evidence to support these claims. Some psychiatrists are very critical. They say handwriting is a result of education, artistic ability, and the type of writing taught, and it has no other significance."
CAE_41,"Text: 'Is your office working well? Fresh air and the right chairs are important for a happy, healthy workforce, according to a new survey. We visited four different offices to find out how healthy and happy they were as working environments. Our expert panel included a building health consultant, an ergonomist who studies people's working conditions, and an occupational psychologist. Here are their opinions. Office A. Advertising Agency Building Health Consultant: This office is very simple; no central heating, no mechanical ventilation, windows open directly onto the street. It is hard to see why this space works, but the people, who are part of a small, dynamic team, seem to have few complaints. They adapt to the changing seasons by opening doors and roof panels or using electric heaters, much like they do at home. This might be the key: a team of seven people have created a happy, homely working environment without any external rules. Ergonomist: The furniture here has developed over time; no two pieces match. Much of it actually causes bad working postures. Chairs are old, most aren't adjustable, and many are broken. Although this environment is poor in that way, the staff have a varied work schedule, which they control -- office work, meeting clients, making presentations, and so on. This variety reduces the risk of fatigue, boredom, and muscle problems. Occupational Psychologist: Staff are happy with the variety of work and the flexible office space. They said their office was 'just the right size' -- small enough to know what colleagues are doing, large enough to be alone and focus on personal work. I found the office attractive and fun, showing both efficiency and creativity. Office B. News Service Building Health Consultant: While the office may not be very exciting, it seems comfortable and is not disliked by the staff. The air quality and general maintenance standards seem to be good. This is helped by a No Smoking policy. Ergonomist: I was not surprised to learn that the company had already used the services of an ergonomist. Chairs are excellent, lighting and computer equipment are good. Space is good, although the layout could be improved. But the environment is impersonal and unstimulating, with grey, bare walls. Occupational Psychologist: Walls are bare except for year planners and a poster about maternity rights. Most staff have been there for at least five years, and relationships are satisfactory. The office could be improved if the desks were arranged to make sharing information easier. Success stories or information on upcoming projects could be displayed on the walls. Office C. Bank Building Health Consultant: An office that produces mixed reactions from those working in it. The feeling inside is like being in a glass case, viewed by, and viewing, many similar exhibits. Despite a mix of smokers and non-smokers in a relatively small space, the air did not seem stale. Even standing only 1.5 meters away from a smoker, it was not possible to smell his cigarette. Ergonomist: The office area is, unfortunately, very standard and uninspiring. The desks are adequate, but only just. Not all the chairs used for computer work meet requirements, but this is user choice. Computer screens are often on small desk units with lowered keyboard shelves; this is no longer considered suitable for modern equipment. Occupational Psychologist: Staff are supportive of each other and well served by technology. Many communications awards are on display. The wood-colored paneling and brown carpet give a slightly serious effect. The office is full of activity. Office D. Newspaper Building Health Consultant: It is hard to say anything good about this building. The air-conditioning control is very basic, causing large temperature changes. The space is cluttered, and most people have inadequate desk space. The office is very dusty -- there are many places for dust to settle. The shed-type roof also collects dust, which, if disturbed, falls on those sitting below. Ergonomist: The furniture would be more suitable in a carpentry workshop than in a high-tech industry. Most of the chairs are of little use to keyboard users, especially those shorter than about 1.75 m. Many chairs are old, lack proper adjustment, and have armrests that prevent the user from getting close enough to the desk. Occupational Psychologist: Old brown chairs, dirty carpets, dust, and dirt everywhere. A lot of room for improvement -- the place needs a good clean-up, individual success could be more recognized, air conditioning needs to be improved immediately -- there are many smokers. Few conversations were happening when we visited; everybody seemed stressed and driven by deadlines. The company needs to adopt a policy of team-working.'"
CAE_38,"Chewing Gum Culture

Chewing gum is popular and classless, with Americans chewing 12 million sticks daily. Learn how this ancient habit became a big business. Each stick of gum has fewer than ten calories, but it is considered a food and must meet the American Food and Drug Administration's standards. Modern gum is mostly synthetic, with added pine resins and softeners to keep the flavor and improve texture. 

In ancient times, Greeks chewed a gum-like resin from the mastic tree, found mainly in Greece and Turkey. Greek women used mastic gum to clean their teeth and freshen their breath. American colonists learned from the Amero-Indians of New England to chew resin from spruce trees. In the early 1800s, spruce gum was sold in the eastern United States, becoming the first commercial chewing gum in the country.

Modern chewing gum began in the late 1860s with the discovery of chicle, a milky substance from the sapodilla tree in Central America. This gum was smoother and more elastic, leading to a new industry. However, attempts to grow sapodilla commercially have failed, so synthetic alternatives were developed as the market grew.

Today, the few remaining chicle gatherers, called chicleros, have a tough and dangerous job. They travel long distances in nearly 100% humidity to tap sapodilla trees. They face poisonous snakes, many insects, and the chicle fly, which lays eggs in their ears and nose. Using only a rope and an axe, an experienced chiclero can climb a tree in minutes to collect the sap. They carry the liquid to a forest camp, where it is boiled into sticky bricks. Life at the camp is hard, with a simple maize-based diet and local alcohol from sugar cane.

Despite these challenges, chicleros worry about their jobs. The U.S. once imported 7,000 tonnes of chicle a year from Central America, but last year only 200 tonnes were tapped in Mexico's Yucatan peninsula. As gum sales have increased, manufacturers use synthetics to cut costs and meet demand.

Gum producers are finding creative ways to market their products. Gum is said to help you relax, boost energy, and reduce tension. Soldiers in both world wars were given gum. Its biggest claim is that it reduces tooth decay. Plaque acid from eating causes decay, but saliva neutralizes the acid and provides minerals like calcium, phosphate, and fluoride. Gum makers say chewing for 20 minutes can increase saliva flow.

Research continues on new textures and flavors. Glycerine and other vegetable oils are used to blend the gum base. Most new flavors are artificial, but some still need natural ingredients. Additionally, 137 square kilometers of America are used to grow mint for the two most popular chewing gums in the world."

The facilities are simple, with hot water provided by bucket, but this simplicity adds to its charm.

**B. NEW ZEALAND - HERMITAGE HOTEL, MOUNT COOK**  
The Hermitage Hotel on New Zealand's South Island is one of my favorite hotels. I discovered it by accident while climbing. After reaching the peak of a glacier, we walked down and found this hotel. It is in a stunningly beautiful and wild area. Arriving tired from the climb and finding luxury, with someone playing Cole Porter on the piano, was amazing.

**C. MAURITIUS - BEACHCOMBER PARADIS HOTEL**  
Located on the south-west of Mauritius, the Paradis Hotel is on its own peninsula in a quiet part of the island. The road to the hotel winds along the coast past empty beaches. The hotel is not small, and many enjoy the free watersports, but you can easily find solitude along nine kilometers of private beach. In the evening, when everyone has left, you can sit on the beach and feel far away from everything.

**D. ST LUCIA - LADERA HOTEL, ST LUCIA**  
The Ladera Hotel in St Lucia is set in one of the Caribbean's most dramatic locations. It is quiet and remote, standing 1,000 feet high, with open rooms offering views between the Pitons to the Caribbean Sea. The style is colonial, with mahogany and greenheart wood furniture, and four-poster beds with muslin netting.

**E. TURKEY - THE SPLENDID HOTEL, ISTANBUL**  
This hotel is on Buyukada in the Princes Islands, a perfect escape from Istanbul's noise. The islands are an hour by boat and are idyllic, with no cars, only horse-drawn carriages and beautiful 1920s wooden architecture. The Splendid is a landmark, all in wood, painted white with red domes, resembling a hotel from the French Riviera. Though a bit run down, it retains its charm.

**F. FRANCE - CHATEAU D'ETOGES, EPERNAY**  
In the small village of Etoges, in the heart of Champagne, is a beautiful 17th-century chateau. Surrounded by a moat with swans, the chateau was a family home until recently. It has 20 unique rooms, some with four-poster beds, and one with a billiard table. There are special weekend rates that include breakfast, dinner, and complimentary champagne.

**G. KENYA - THE FAIRVIEW HOTEL, NAIROBI**  
The Fairview is a rare find in Africa—a comfortable hotel without excessive luxury. It is a key stop for travelers resting from one safari and planning the next. Some guests decide to stay longer after seeing the gardens, rooms, and dining menu. The hotel is on Nairobi Hill, away from the city's hustle. It's a great place to watch the African sunset with a drink and look forward to a hearty dinner.

**H. ITALY - HOTEL SPLENDIDO, PORTOFINO**

CAE_47,"**The Hotel Inspector**

Sue Brown works as a hotel inspector. Christopher Middleton observed her during one of her inspections. Just one minute into her annual check at the Globe Hotel, things start to go wrong. The receptionist is busy quoting room rates over the phone and doesn't notice Sue, the real guest, waiting. Sue whispers, ""Hasn't even acknowledged us. Very poor."" This is a common mistake Sue has seen many times in her 11 years as an inspector. She expects better from the Globe Hotel because it has three red stars, which means it's among the top 130 hotels out of 4,000 in the guide published by her organization.

Even before the cold welcome, Sue noticed problems. The entrance from the car park was through an unmanned door with a buzzer, leading to a long, empty corridor. ""Again, not what I had expected,"" Sue comments. Things get worse when the receptionist says, ""We seem to have no record of your booking,"" even though most rooms are empty that night. Sue's room on the top floor is not to her liking: it's stuffy, and there's a large hole in the wall behind a wardrobe panel.

Sue recalls being known as ""The Woman in Black"" early in her career for her tough reputation, though she insists she was never too harsh. The next morning, after paying her bill, she reveals her identity to the Globe's general manager, Robin Greaves. He looks terrified. Before she says much, he apologizes for a bad smell in the main lounge, suspecting a blocked drain. Sue suggests fixing the plumbing and guiding guests to another lounge. Greaves, who has been at the Globe for only five months, takes notes and listens to Sue's feedback, hoping it will help the hotel improve.

Not everything is negative. Sue praises Emma, the assistant manager, and Trudy, the waitress, for their good service. Dinner was good enough to keep the hotel's two-rosette food rating. Greaves asks what they need to do to earn three rosettes. Sue suggests, ""Not serve a pudding that collapses."" Greaves' brief hope fades.

Sue's job is to voice complaints that other guests might not express. She recalls a time when a woman complained that Sue got her son fired because he served apple pie with his fingers. Sue often receives letters with false accusations, but she says it still hurts.

Sue must give her findings verbally and in a written report to the hotelier, who pays for this service. Being in the guide with red stars is valuable for hotels. Greaves is relieved to hear that Sue won't recommend removing the Globe's red stars. However, another inspector will return in two months to check if improvements have been made. ""Good,"" Greaves says, trying to sound positive. ""We'll look forward to that."""

Mountaineer Doug Scott shares his experiences of climbing the highest peak on each continent, known as the Seven Summits. Here is his journey:

**A. Mt. Everest, Asia (8,848m)**
My journey to climb the Seven Summits began with Mt. Everest. My partner, Dougal Haston, and I were in a snow cave near the summit. Dougal started talking to someone who wasn't there, likely due to lack of oxygen. I also found myself talking to my feet, worried about frostbite. Despite the challenges, Dougal's confidence inspired me, and I managed to reach the summit.

**B. Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)**
Known as one of the most dangerous mountains, Dougal and I arrived at the Kahiltna Glacier in April 1976. We carried our gear and food on our backs, climbing a new route. The low air pressure made it feel like we were at a higher altitude. After a tough climb, we reached the summit, feeling victorious.

**C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,895m)**
In September 1976, Paul Braithwaite and I planned to climb Mt. Kenya but ended up on Kilimanjaro. We got lost in the jungle, struggling to find water. Eventually, we found a trail and reached the summit via the Umbwe route.

**D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)**
In January 1992, my wife Sharu and I joined a group climbing via the Polish Glacier. Due to time constraints, we took the standard route instead. We reached the summit just before dark and camped nearby. Meeting other climbers inspired me to consider climbing all Seven Summits.

**E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)**
Climbing Vinson Massif became possible by guiding others to cover costs. In November 1992, our team traveled to Antarctica. Despite harsh weather, we reached the summit in eight hours, though visibility was poor.

**F. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)**
In summer 1994, our team gathered in St. Petersburg. After acclimatizing, we took a cableway up Elbrus. We thought we reached the summit, only to find another ridge to climb. We returned to the refuge as night fell.

**G. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)**
On this expedition, we aimed to establish a new route and connect with the local Dani people. Despite warnings of danger, we climbed the mountain. On May 12, we reached the summit, completing my Seven Summits mission."

General Manager Peter MacCann wants his staff to know guests by name, but he uses the hotel's computer system to remember guests' preferences. This system, which cost £250,000, helps treat returning guests in a special way, as expected in a five-star hotel. MacCann believes it will pay for itself over time. For example, if a guest requests certain music CDs during their first stay, those CDs will be ready for them on their next visit, thanks to the guest-history feature.

Room temperature is a common complaint among hotel guests worldwide. The Merrion has a high-tech system to control this. Guests can adjust the temperature within three degrees of the normal 18°C, and the front desk can set each room between 14°C and 25°C.

Business travelers, who MacCann expects will make up 65% of his clients, will appreciate the technology in the rooms. Each room has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that also works as a photocopier and printer, and a video-conferencing facility. The hotel has prepared for future technology changes by installing extra cables and renting TVs, so they can be easily updated. DVD recorders can also be upgraded when needed.

Despite all this technology, MacCann ensures that guests feel comfortable and not overwhelmed. The 145 bedrooms are large, well-furnished, and welcoming. The hotel also offers a swimming pool, gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a beautiful garden.

The food at the Merrion must be excellent, as expected in luxury hotels. Chef Patrick Guilbaud, whose Dublin restaurant already had two Michelin stars, moved his restaurant to the Merrion. This move benefits both him and the hotel. He designed a new, modern kitchen and enjoys better parking facilities. The hotel gains a popular and successful restaurant without financial risks.

With advanced technology and a skilled staff, the Merrion Hotel is set to succeed."
FCE_24,"Artist Susan Shepherd is famous for her flower paintings. Her large garden, full of her favorite flowers like tulips and poppies, provides many of her painting subjects. Some plants grow wildly and spread throughout the garden. The garden has a beautiful mix of colors and shapes, especially in the two long flower borders along the path. This beauty is partly thanks to the previous owners, who were passionate gardeners and left plants that Susan liked. She also kept their gardener, Danny. Susan says, ""It was really his garden."" They got along well, and he understood her vision when she explained she wanted to paint certain plants.

Susan usually focuses on detailed studies of single plants rather than the whole garden. Sometimes she paints groups of plants where they grow, but often she picks them and takes them to her studio. She explains, ""I don't set the whole thing up at once. I take one flower out and paint it, which might take a few days, and then I bring in another one and build up the painting that way. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish."" Her busiest time is spring and early summer when tulips and poppies bloom. She finds the way flowers change as they decay fascinating. For example, tulips change shape and open up after being put in water, becoming more interesting over time.

Susan has always been interested in plants. She studied botany in school and collected wildflowers. She didn't like garden flowers back then, thinking they looked artificial. She admired how wildflowers could grow in difficult places like rock cracks or cliff tops. Now, her garden includes plants from distant countries, but they fit in well. She has a relaxed approach to gardening, like an aunt who lets children play freely as long as they don't cause harm.

With two upcoming exhibitions and plenty of subjects to paint, Susan finds it hard to spend time gardening. She has hired an extra gardener but believes that to stay connected to her work, ""you have to get your hands dirty."""
FCE_13,"Many trees in the Brackham area were knocked down during the terrible storms in March. The town lost two big lime trees from the old market square. The loss of these trees changed the look of the town center completely, which upset some of the town's more traditional residents. Normally, Chief Inspector Douglas Pelham, the head of the local police, would have been among those upset. However, during the storm, when the wind even knocked down the mature walnut tree in his garden, Pelham was too sick to notice. A usually healthy man, he was seriously ill for the first time with bronchitis. When he first felt a headache and tightness in his chest, his wife, Molly, tried to get him to see a doctor. Believing the police force needed him, he ignored her and kept working. This only made his memory worse and his temper shorter. Finally, his colleague, Sergeant Lloyd, took him to the doctor. By then, he was too weak to argue. Soon, she took him to the pharmacy to get his antibiotics and then home to his wife, who sent him straight to bed. On Thursday morning, when Molly told him the walnut tree had fallen, Pelham couldn't understand it. On Thursday evening, he weakly asked if the house was damaged, was relieved to hear it wasn't, and went back to sleep. It wasn't until Saturday, when the antibiotics started working, his fever went down, and he got up, that he realized the walnut tree's loss had changed the living-room's look. The Pelhams' large house was in a big garden. It was expensive, but Pelham didn't regret buying it. The leafy garden made it feel private. Now, the storm had changed his view. Before, the living-room view included the beautiful walnut tree. It didn't make the room dark because there was another window on the opposite wall, but it created interesting light and shadow patterns that hid the worn furniture the family brought from their old house. With the tree gone, the room was very bright, showing the shabby furniture. The view from the window was also bad. The tall house next door, once hidden by the tree, was now visible, with its ugly purple bricks and outside pipes. It seemed to have many upstairs windows, all watching the Pelhams. 'Doesn't it look terrible?' Pelham said to his wife. But Molly, standing in the doorway, sounded more happy than upset. 'That's what I've been telling you since we moved here. We need to buy a new sofa, no matter the cost.'"
FCE_16,"**Living in the Valley**

We had been living in our valley for sixteen months when we first realized the dangers in the surrounding hills that could threaten our survival. It was the year when the storms came early, even before November ended. Until then, we felt safe in our valley, protected by the hills. Soon, snow began to fall. Within a day, it was about 15 centimeters deep. It almost blocked our lane and made the path by the stream slippery and dangerous. But on the nearby hills, the snow was much deeper and stayed longer. Up there, the wind blew fiercely. In our valley, we only felt sudden gusts of wind; trees swayed, but the branches held firm. Yet, we knew we had reason to worry. The snow and wind were inconvenient, but they did not trouble us much. It was the river, the Ryburn, which usually flowed gently, that threatened us most. It reminded us of what could have happened if the water from the hills had not been controlled by a series of dams many years ago.

In a short time, the snow started to melt. Day after day, we watched dark clouds gather over the hills to the west. Grey clouds spread over the valleys, warning of what was to come. We had seen enough of the sky; now we began to watch the river, which was becoming fuller and wilder every day. The snow was gradually washed away as more rain fell from the clouds, but high up in the hills, the reservoir was filling and was fast approaching danger level. Then it happened - for the first time in years, the reservoir overflowed. Up in the hills, it was like Niagara Falls, as water surged over the edge of the dam and poured into the stream below. The river seemed wild as the waters rushed down to its lower parts. Just a couple of meters from our cottage, the stream seemed wild beneath the bridge. It was deeper than we'd ever seen it so close to our home, fiercely hitting its banks. For three days, we hoped it would stay below its wall. Fortunately, our hopes were answered as the dam held and the waters began to go down.

In the past, before the dam was built, the river had often flooded the nearby villages in such a rage. Now, the dam controls the river's flow, and usually, all is well; the large amount of water from the hills, from snow and heavy rain, stays behind its barrier with just the occasional overflow. We can now enjoy, rather than fear, the large clouds that hang over the valley, and be amazed by the great power we know the river has. Thanks to this protection, we feel our home in the valley is still secure and safe."
FCE_21,"Film Critic Mark Adams reflects on his last ten years working as a film critic for a newspaper called The Front Page. Writing about films for The Front Page was his first real job. Before that, he had done some reviewing—novels for other newspapers, films for a magazine, and anything he was asked to do for the radio. This is how he met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page, who had also written for radio and TV. Tom hired him, but Tom was not mainly a journalist, or he would have been more careful in choosing his staff. 

At first, Tom's idea was to have a team of critics handle art forms that didn't need specialized knowledge: books, TV, theatre, film, and radio. They would have a weekly lunch to choose from the artistic material Tom decided they should cover, with guests to make it sociable. It all felt like a dream then: a new newspaper, and Mark was part of the team. It seemed unlikely that a new paper could succeed in a crowded market. It seemed just as likely that a millionaire wanted to help him personally and was pretending to employ him. Such was his lack of self-confidence. The first time he saw someone reading the newspaper on the London Underground and turning to a page with one of his reviews, he didn't know where to look.

Tom's original plan for a team of critics never happened. It was a good idea, but they didn't meet as planned, so everything was done by phone. It turned out that the public preferred to link a reviewer with one subject area, so Mark chose film. Without Tom's initial push, they wouldn't have the current setup, where Mark writes a long weekly piece, usually on one film. This way of working suits him well. He wouldn't have been interested in the usual film critic's role, which involves reviewing every film that comes out. That routine would make him bored quickly. He would soon be sinking into his seat on a Monday morning with the sigh, 'What boring rubbish must I sit through now?'—a sigh often heard in screening rooms worldwide.

The space he is given allows him to expand his argument—or forces him, in a dull week, to make something out of nothing. But what is his role in the public arena? He assumes people choose films based on the stars, publicity, or director. There is also loyalty to a 'type' or its opposite. It rarely happens that someone who hates westerns buys a ticket for one after reading a review, or a love story fan avoids a romantic film because of what the papers say. So if a film review isn't really a consumer guide, what is it? He doesn't feel he has to be 'right' about a movie. Nor does he think there should be a certain number of 'great' and 'bad' films each year. All he has to do is present an argument. He's not a judge, and he doesn't want to be."
FCE_46,"Text: Why would a schoolgirl want to swim 1500m, cycle 40km, and then run 10km? Because ""it's fun."" Teenager with a love for endurance sports WANTED: Sports-loving training partner for a triathlete, preferably female. Opportunity to train with a potential Olympic champion. Must be very interested in distance running (regular 15km sessions), distance swimming (enjoys winter training in cold rivers), and distance cycling (likes 100km rides). Ability to do all three without resting is essential. The triathlon is becoming one of the most popular Olympic sports. Recently, it has attracted large crowds who are both fascinated and shocked by athletes swimming 1500m, cycling 40km, and then running 10km without stopping. It might be exciting for spectators, but what makes triathletes want to push their bodies so hard? And why would a 17-year-old girl with excellent academic results give up everything for the challenging experiences it offers? Melanie Sears has not yet learned the usual phrases about personal satisfaction, mental challenge, and higher goals that most athletes use when asked similar questions. ""You swim for 1500m, then run out of the water and jump on your bike, still wet. Of course, then you freeze. When the 40km cycle ride is over, you have to run 10km, which is a long way when you're feeling exhausted. But it's great fun, and all worth it in the end,"" she says. Melanie entered her first triathlon at 14. ""I won the junior section - but then I was the only junior taking part. It seemed so easy that I was waving at my teammates as I went around."" Full of confidence, she entered the National Championships, and although she had the second fastest swim and the fastest run, she didn't place. ""I was following this man and suddenly we came to the sea. We realized then that we had gone wrong. I ended up cycling 20 kilometers too far. I cried all the way through the running."" But she did not give up and is determined that she never will. ""Sometimes I wish I could stop because then the pain would be over, but I am afraid that if I let myself stop just once, I would be tempted to do it again."" Such determination draws admiration from Steve Trew, the sport's director of coaching. ""I've just been testing her fitness,"" he says, ""and she worked so hard on the running machine that it finally threw her off and into a wall. She had given it everything, but whereas most people step off when they realize they can't go any further, she just kept on."" Melanie was the top junior in this year's European Triathlon Championships, finishing 13th. ""I was almost as good as the top three in swimming and running, but much slower at cycling. That's why I'm working very hard at it."" She is trying to convince her supportive parents, who will cover the £1,300 cost of her trip to New Zealand for this year's World Championships, to buy a £2,000 bike (""It's a special deal, with £1,000 off) so she can try national 25 km and 100 km races later this year. But there is another price to pay. Her intense training sessions have made her a bit of a recluse. ""I don't have a social life,"" she says. ""I'm not a party animal anyway. After two hours of hard swimming on Friday nights, I just want to go to sleep. But I phone and write to the other girls in the team."" What does she talk about? Boys? Clothes? ""No, what sort of times they are achieving."" Where will all this focus end? Melanie has tried other events. She has tried the triathlon ""sprint,"" for example, where you only have to swim 750m, cycle 20km, and run 5km. She wants to enter even tougher events than the triathlon. ""The big trouble is, I have no one of my age to train with,"" she says. Funny, that."
FCE_70,"**The Collectors**

Amanda Roy writes about her collections and why many people enjoy this hobby. I have always loved collecting, and one in three adults shares this interest. It is a world full of passion, envy, enthusiasm, and delight. However, if you decide to collect, remember: if you do not love an object, do not collect it.

Since ancient times, people have felt the urge to collect. Primitive humans collected pebbles and wore them as necklaces. Attracted by their shapes and colors, these pebbles were man's first attempt to gather objects for intellectual and spiritual reasons. Over the centuries, not much has changed. Children still collect stones and seashells for their beauty.

I have been collecting all my life, from flowers like tulips to pottery and paintings. My first collection was stones from my parents' garden. At six, I was sent to a school in a remote part of England, a cold and windy place surrounded by hills. When my parents visited, they took me to the local museum, full of objects collected by people in the past. I was fascinated by these objects.

Surprisingly, I am not alone in my interest in collecting. One in three adults shares this passion. The reasons why people collect have become a topic of great interest. Some believe it is the only part of their lives where they have complete control. For me, it's just something I enjoy.

One famous collector was the Duc de Berry in France. He had a 'room of wonders' with natural and artificial curiosities, like cups made from coconut shells and pieces of Oriental china. Another was Catherine the Great of Russia, who collected over 4,000 paintings. However, you do not need to be rich to start a collection. I have collected tulip bulbs and china cups, searching for each type with determination. I remember convincing a fellow tulip collector to give me one I wanted. I planted and watered it until it was stolen by another collector.

I once collected 350 American rag dolls, searching all over the USA for different designs. This collection was destroyed when my house caught fire. The next morning, I saw the remains of my furniture and collection. I am not sure which saddened me more!

I am interested in how collections change hands. A silver spoon that once belonged to a king or poet gives value to items traded in markets. As small objects become popular collector's items, their prices rise. Toys from the 1950s are now investments, provided you kept the original boxes. (I not only threw them away, but I also discarded the contents.)"
FCE_3,"**My Job: Four People Talk About Their Work**

**Lisa - Exhibition Programmes Organiser, Science Museum**

I organize temporary exhibitions. This means I plan and design the exhibition and promote it. I need to learn about the exhibition topic first and then talk to experts to decide the main themes and goals. I plan what objects and pictures to show. I make sure visitors understand the exhibition by planning interactive displays, workshops, and theatre. I also hire engineers and electricians to ensure the display is safe. Before the exhibition opens, I help create brochures and leaflets to inform people about it.

**Janet - Teacher of London Taxi Drivers**

I start my day at 7.30 a.m. by checking the accounts. Then, I see what new maps and documents are needed for learning the routes for the London taxi-driver test. By midday, about 50 students are in school, figuring out the best routes using the correct streets and turns. I help when there's a disagreement, like if a right turn is possible at a junction. When students are close to the test, I challenge them by saying their chosen route is blocked, so they must find another way. This helps them think critically.

**Sarah - Marine Conservationist**

I live by the coast and work from home. My job includes answering phone calls, creating educational materials, and setting up training courses. I sometimes visit the main office but usually work on the coast. I also work with schools and study centers, running courses for coastal managers and decision-makers about the sea. I take them out on a boat to help them understand marine life better. This often changes their views, as it's different from making decisions on a computer. I love my job because conservation is my hobby, but working for a charity means I always need more money and resources.

**Chris - Map and Atlas Publisher**

My job is varied. I ensure our publishing program meets market needs and maintain stocks of about 300 books. We have high standards for information and content. We get many letters from readers about issues like international boundaries, which need careful replies. I discuss future projects and current sales with co-publishers. I work with an enthusiastic team, which makes the job enjoyable. The downside is there is too much administration, leaving less time for interesting tasks like product development and design."
FCE_10,"Text: 'No Title We always went to Ireland in June. Since the four of us started going on holidays together, we spent the first two weeks of the month at Glencorn Lodge in County Antrim. It's a large house by the sea, near the village of Ardbeag. The English couple who bought the house, the Malseeds, have added to the building, but everything has been done very discreetly. It was Strafe who found Glencorn for us. He saw an advertisement when the Malseeds still needed to advertise. 'How about this?' he said one evening and read out the details. We had gone away together the summer before, to a hotel recommended by friends, but it wasn't a success because the food was terrible. The four of us have been playing cards together for a long time: Dekko, Strafe, Cynthia, and myself. They call me Milly, though my real name is Dorothy Milson. Dekko got his nickname at school, as Dekko Deacon sounded good. He and Strafe were at school together, which is why we call Strafe by his surname, like the teachers did. We're all about the same age and live close to the town where the Malseeds were before they moved from England to Ireland. Quite a coincidence, we always think. 'How very nice,' Mrs. Malseed said, smiling her welcome again this year. She seems to know when guests are about to arrive, as she's rarely not waiting in the large, low-ceilinged hall that always smells of flowers. 'Arthur, take the luggage up,' she told the old porter. 'Rose, Tulip, Lily, and Geranium.' She referred to the names of the rooms reserved for us. Mrs. Malseed painted flowers on the doors of the hotel instead of using numbers. In winter, when not many people come to Glencorn Lodge, she takes care of little details like that; her husband handles redecoration and repairs. 'Well, well, well,' Mr. Malseed said, entering the hall through the door that leads to the kitchen. 'A hundred thousand welcomes,' he greeted us in the Irish way. He was smiling broadly with his dark brown eyes twinkling, making us feel like we were more than just another group of hotel guests. Everyone smiled, and I could feel the others thinking that our holiday had truly begun. Nothing had changed at Glencorn, all was well. Kitty from the dining room came out to greet us. 'You look younger every year, all four of you,' she said, making everyone in the hall laugh again. Arthur led the way to the rooms, carrying as much of our luggage as he could and returning for the rest. After dinner, we played cards for a while but didn't play as long as we might have because we were still quite tired from the journey. In the lounge, there was a man on his own and a French couple. There had been other people at dinner, of course, because in June Glencorn Lodge is always full: from where we sat in the window, we could see some of them strolling about the lawns, others taking the cliff path down to the seashore. In the morning, we'd do the same: we'd walk along the sands to Ardbeag and have coffee in the hotel there, back in time for lunch. In the afternoon, we'd drive somewhere. I knew all that because over the years this kind of pattern had developed. Since we first came here, we'd all fallen in love with every variation of its remarkable landscape.'"
FCE_67,"**Keeping the Holiday-Makers Happy**

A chalet girl's work is never done, as Sarah Sutherland-Pilch explains to Veronica Lee, in between making beds and cooking delicious meals. This is Sarah's second year working as a chalet girl. She is 24 years old and comes from West Sussex. Known by her nickname, Pilch, Sarah works for a company in Val d'Isere, France. She cooks and cleans for visitors who come to ski and stay in the wooden houses called chalets, which are typical of the area. Sarah graduated in French and History of Art from Oxford Brookes University last summer. She says being a chalet girl isn't a career, but a fun way to spend a year or two before settling down. 'It's a good way to make contacts. I meet successful people every week.'

Sarah does not live in the chalet. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks about a mile to the chalet, which can host up to 18 guests each week. She has her own breakfast before preparing breakfast for the guests. 'They get everything - porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants.' When the last guest finishes breakfast, around 9:30 a.m., Sarah cleans up and either prepares afternoon tea, which is left for the guests to help themselves, or cleans the rooms - 'the worst part of the job,' she says. By about 11 a.m., she is ready to go skiing. She skis as much as possible. 'On a good day, we can be up there until 4:30 p.m.'

Sarah returns to the chalet in time to prepare dinner and takes a shower before doing so, but she does not sleep. 'It's fatal if you do,' she says. Dinner, a three-course meal, is served at 8 p.m., and coffee is usually on the table by 10 p.m. Sarah clears away the dinner things and fills the dishwasher. 'There's nothing worse than coming into a messy kitchen the next morning.' Sometimes she will stay and chat with the guests; other times, they prefer to be left alone. 'Good guests can make a week brilliant - breakfast this morning was great fun - but some weeks, for whatever reason, don't go quite so well.'

Sarah meets her friends in the chalet where she lives, and they go out at about 11 p.m. 'We usually start off in Bananas, might go to G Jay's, and perhaps Dick's T-Bar at the end of the evening,' she says. But Sarah never stays out too late on Saturday night because Sunday is her busiest day of the week. 'A frightful day,' she says, 'when you certainly don't want to be cooking breakfast with a terrible headache.' Work begins earlier than usual on Sunday, as breakfast for guests who are leaving has to be ready by 7 a.m. As soon as the guests leave, Sarah starts cleaning quickly. 'We just blitz the place - clear the breakfast, strip the beds, get everything ready.' If she hasn't done the week's shopping on Saturday, Sarah does it now. At around 3 p.m., after cleaning, Sarah prepares tea for the new guests. 'They arrive at around 4:30 p.m.' Sometimes they are confused and have many questions. 'I'm sure it's the mountain air that does something to them.'

Between tea and dinner, Sarah takes any guests needing boots or skis to the ski shop and then gets a lift back to the chalet from one of the ski shop staff. It is soon time for dinner duty again and perhaps a drink later, but not always. 'Sometimes I'm so tired I just have an early night,' she says."
FCE_27,"Miss Rita Cohen, a small, pale-skinned girl who looked much younger than Seymour's daughter, Marie, but said she was about six years older, visited his factory one day. She wore overalls and big, unattractive shoes, and her pretty face was surrounded by a bush of wiry hair. She was so small and young-looking that Seymour found it hard to believe she was studying at the University of Pennsylvania, researching the leather industry in New Jersey for her Master's degree. A few times a year, someone would call or write to Seymour asking to see his factory, and sometimes he would help a student by answering questions over the phone or, if they seemed very serious, by giving them a short tour. Rita Cohen seemed almost as small as the children from Marie's third-year class, who had visited the factory years ago to see how Marie's father made gloves. They especially liked the laying-off table, where the men shaped and pressed each glove by pulling it over steam-heated brass hands. These hands were very hot, shiny, and stood straight up from the table, looking thin and flat. As a child, Marie was fascinated by them and called them the 'pancake hands'. Rita asked, 'How many pieces come in a shipment?' Seymour replied, 'Between twenty and twenty-five thousand.' She kept taking notes and asked, 'Do they come directly to your shipping department?' He was pleased that she was interested in every detail. 'They go to the tannery first. The tannery is a contractor. We buy the material, and they prepare it for us to work with. My grandfather and father worked in the tannery here in town. I did too, for six months, when I started in the business. Have you ever been inside a tannery?' 'Not yet.' 'Well, you need to visit a tannery if you're going to write about leather. I can arrange that for you if you want. They're old-fashioned places. Technology has improved things, but what you'll see isn't much different from hundreds of years ago. It's tough work. It's said to be the oldest industry with remains found anywhere. Six-thousand-year-old tanning relics were found in Turkey, I think. The first clothing was just skins tanned by smoking them. I told you it was interesting once you get into it. My father is the leather expert; you should talk to him. Start him on gloves, and he'll talk for two days. That's typical: glove makers love the trade and everything about it. Have you ever seen anything being made, Miss Cohen?' 'I can't say I have.' 'Never seen anything made?' 'I saw my mother make a cake when I was a child.' He laughed. She made him laugh. An eager learner with spirit. His daughter was at least 30 cm taller than Rita Cohen, fair where she was dark, but otherwise, Rita Cohen reminded him of Marie. The good-natured intelligence that filled the house when she came home from school, full of what she'd learned. How she remembered everything. Everything neatly written in her notebook and memorized overnight. 'I'll tell you what we're going to do. We're going to show you the whole process. Come on. We're going to make you a pair of gloves, and you're going to watch them being made from start to finish. What size do you wear?'"

She can't meet me tomorrow because her boss wants her in Los Angeles instead. As a personal assistant to a pop star, she has to travel around the world at a moment's notice. Raquel loves her job and gets along well with her boss. There's just one small issue - she doesn't like flying. 'On a nine-hour flight to California, I usually take sleeping pills to help calm me down,' she admits. Her worst experience was flying on Concorde. 'It felt so closed in with those tiny windows.' When she's not traveling, she works in offices in Manchester and London. She has to do some routine paperwork - organizing the diary, attending meetings with lawyers and accountants, planning schedules, and making more travel arrangements. She didn't apply for the job. A chance meeting with a pop group's manager led to an offer to work behind the scenes, and she took a secretarial course in the evenings at the same time. Five years later, she was in the right place at the right time when her boss needed a PA. B. David Brown David Brown has been both an accountant and a golf caddy, someone who carries a golfer's bags. Overall, he preferred being a caddy. Well, who wouldn't if golf was their passion? There were some downsides, though. A small flat fee is offered, plus a percentage of the winnings. The average earnings are between £25,000 and £35,000, and much of that goes on travel and hotels. He was 31 when he first caddied for the golfer Greg Norman. 'You're not just carrying bags. You're giving advice, using your knowledge against the weather, and trying to understand the course.' His accountancy skills were recently recognized by European Tour Productions when they made him a statistical data administrator. From cards brought in by the caddies, he compiles and analyzes the statistics of each day's play. The results are wanted by TV commentators, golfing magazines, and the golfers themselves. C. Martin Fern Martin Fern is the editor of the 'Food and Drink' pages of a daily newspaper, and one of his easier tasks is to try what's on offer in the best restaurants. What does he think about restaurants that charge very high prices? 'For those who can afford it, it's up to them,' he says. 'I'd rather spend £120 on a meal I'll remember for the rest of my life than buy a microwave.' It was his talent as a cook that led to the offer of a food column from a friend who edited a Saturday Review. For Martin, who was then a creative director of an advertising agency, it was a useful extra income. He was 42 when another newspaper called to offer a full-time job. 'It meant a 50 percent cut in guaranteed income,' he says. 'But it was a chance to turn my passion into a profession.' He still does all the cooking at home and tries to keep his waistline under control by cycling a couple of miles to the nearest tube station. D. Dick Prince 'I started writing children's stories about 20 years ago,' says Dick Prince, one of Britain's most popular children's writers. 'Before that, I had always loved words and enjoyed using them, but my writing had mainly been poetry. Then I had this idea for a story. I had been a farmer and knew the problem of chickens being killed by a fox. So I wrote a kind of role reversal story called The Fox Busters, which became my first published children's story.' Where do his ideas come from? 'Well, it's not easy, I have to work at them,' he says. 'That is what I usually do in the mornings. I'm not up with the dawn, I'm afraid. After lunch, I spend another couple of hours typing out the morning's scribbling - all of which I do with one finger on an old portable typewriter rather than on one of those awful laptops. I get between 50 and a hundred letters a week, and that is the part about being a writer that I enjoy the most. I do try to answer them all, but nowadays I have some secretarial help.'"

In the lumberyard by the lake, where trees were turned into boards for building, there was an old two-story brick building. Around it were big piles of soft sawdust. These golden piles covered the yard all the way to the blue lake. That afternoon, with nothing else to do, all the boys followed Michael up a ladder to the roof of the old building. They sat with their legs hanging over the edge, looking at the lake. Suddenly, Michael said, ""I dare you to jump down,"" and without thinking, he jumped off the roof and landed on the sawdust, laughing. ""I dare you all!"" he shouted. ""You're all cowards,"" he said, trying to get them to follow him. Laughing, he watched them from the roof, looking scared, but one by one they jumped and got up smiling with relief. In the hot afternoon sun, they lay on the sawdust pile telling jokes until one of the boys said, ""Let's go back up and jump again."" They weren't very excited, but they all went up to the roof and started jumping off again until only Michael was left. The others were below, looking up and calling, ""Come on, Mike. What's wrong?"" Michael wanted to jump and join them, but he stayed on the edge, licking his lips with a nervous smile, wondering why it seemed like a longer drop this time. At first, they thought he was joking, but then they saw him clenching his fists. He tried counting to ten and jumping, but it didn't work. He tried taking a deep breath and closing his eyes. After a while, the boys started laughing at him; they were tired of waiting, and it was almost dinnertime. ""Come on, you're a coward. Do you think we'll wait all night?"" they shouted. When he didn't move, they started to leave, still shouting. ""Who started this? What's wrong with you?"" he called. But he stayed on the roof, looking sadly at the ground. He was alone for almost an hour while the sun, like a big orange ball, slowly set beyond the lake. His clothes were wet from nervous sweating. Finally, he closed his eyes, slipped off the roof, fell heavily on the sawdust, and lay there for a long time. The yard was quiet; the workers had gone home. As he lay there, he wondered why he couldn't jump, then got up slowly and walked home, feeling very ashamed and wanting to avoid everyone. He was so late for dinner that his stepmother said coldly, ""You're old enough to come home on time. If you won't come home, you should stay in tonight."" She was a strong woman with fair skin, a little grey in her hair, and a patient smile. She spoke with controlled seriousness, but Michael, with his dark, sad face, hardly heard her; he was still thinking about the boys laughing at him."
FCE_44,"**Careers Advice**

Are you unhappy in your job but unsure how to change it? Kitty Doherty offers some helpful advice. Many people who want to change their job are turning to careers advisers. You will need to write a brief history of yourself and take several tests called 'psychometrics'. Afterward, you receive a summary of the results, which suggests various careers and any retraining you might need.

I decided to try Career Analysts, a large organization that provides career advice. Taking the careers test felt like being back in my science exams. I was in a group of about ten people, answering questions quickly. I had to remember that it wasn't about passing or failing. It was hard to see how the psychometrics would accurately describe me. The tests included finding mistakes in lists of names and numbers and matching similar shapes. Afterward, I had a long chat with an adviser. Using this conversation and the test results, he created a report with his observations and recommendations. I agreed with most of his conclusions, though I was a bit upset to learn I did poorly in the scientific, technical, and practical tests. I'm sure many sick people are glad I never became a nurse. However, it was reassuring to hear that I made the right choice in journalism.

Rethinking your career doesn't have to mean a big change. Last March, after working as a marketing manager for a large insurance company for five years, 25-year-old Donna Laney lost her job. Her friends suggested she go to Career Analysts for help. ""Losing my job was the perfect chance to step back and look at my career so far. I wanted to re-examine my skills and interests,"" says Donna. Some results were surprising. ""I hadn't realized I had a talent for design. But I had to weigh the cost of retraining in design against my financial commitments,"" she says. Other suggestions included taking a year off to work in the Far East. ""I decided to use the skills I already had and move into something more suited to me than insurance. I am now working as a Public Relations officer. I might have reached this point without Career Analysts, but they helped me see, objectively and independently, what I truly wanted to do. I've sent several friends there, and they are all happy with the service.""

Some people feel they wouldn't have reached their goals without help. A visit to Career Counselling Services led 26-year-old Juliet Greene to make life-changing decisions. ""After working for a major bank for six years, I found my job dull and needed a new challenge. I had no idea what I wanted to do, so I went to Career Counselling Services with an open mind. I took the tests, which showed I was interested in sciences,"" she says. ""I had four sessions with an adviser. The third session was recorded, which was very useful because you forget many things you say. After the fourth meeting, I decided to study geology and plan to start a degree course in it later this year. I think the advice from Career Counselling Services was worth the fee. I'm much happier now and more positive.""

However, careers advice doesn't work for everyone. Amanda Margetts, a 24-year-old sales representative, says: ""I reached a point in my career where I didn't know what to do next. I thought a careers adviser might suggest something new. Although I got many new ideas, I rejected them because they required a big salary drop or a lot of retraining. I wasn't told anything about myself that I didn't already know,"" she says. ""You have to give the adviser a lot of personal information, and I felt that if I had told a friend the same things, they would have given me similar advice."""
FCE_22,"**Fun at the Dentist's?**

If you visit W. Lloyd Jerome's dental office in the center of Glasgow, you'll notice bright modern paintings on the walls and a stylish blue couch where patients sit while he checks their teeth. Jerome says, ""Half of the people only go to the dentist when they're in pain instead of going for regular check-ups. That's because they're scared."" To change this, he has tried to create a place where people are not afraid. That's why he decided not to wear a white coat, as he believes people link it with pain. His idea is that dental treatment should happen in a relaxed, interesting, and enjoyable setting.

This is surprising for many of us who think of dental visits as painful or at least formal and clinical. Jerome says, ""If people are relaxed, entertained, and treated well, they will forget their past negative experiences."" One of his new relaxation methods is virtual-reality headsets. ""We were the first practice in Britain to use them, and they're very popular. The headsets are used for the first check-up, where the patient sits comfortably on the blue couch and watches a film about underwater wildlife while I examine their teeth. Then the headset switches to a special camera, giving the patient a visual tour of their mouth."" Surprisingly, most patients seem to enjoy this part of their dental visit.

Another important aspect is that the office smells more like a perfume shop than a dentist's. Today, it smells like orange. Jerome explains, ""When people walk in, I want them to realize with all their senses that it's not like going to the dentist's. Smell is very important. The typical dental smell can make your heart race if you're scared of dentists."" I found the gentle smell in the office very pleasant.

Although he is known as Glasgow's most fashionable dentist, Jerome emphasizes that he takes his work very seriously. The relaxation techniques are important, but the quality of the treatment is the most important thing. For example, Jerome uses a special tool that sprays warm water on the teeth to clean them, instead of scraping them. It feels a bit strange at first, but as long as people are relaxed, it's not painful at all.

Five years ago, Jerome went to the United States to research dental techniques. ""One thing I learned there was that when you make it easier for the patient, you make it easier for yourself,"" he explains. He sees his patient-focused approach as the beginning of a slow change towards less formality in the traditional British dentistry profession.

At that moment, a patient arrives. Jerome quickly goes over, offers him a cup of tea (herbal or regular), asks him what video he'd like to watch, and gently leads him to the chair. The patient seems to enjoy this five-star treatment, and it's no surprise. The office feels more like an elegant beauty salon than a typical dental practice."
FCE_39,"**Bitter Water Hits the Big Time**

Chocolate, which started in South America, is now a huge global business. At Easter, people in Britain spend over £230 million on chocolate. Eight percent of all chocolate is bought during this time. Only at Christmas do people eat more chocolate. Although large-scale chocolate production began in the last century, the cacao plant was first grown by the Aztec, Toltec, and Mayan civilizations in Central America over three thousand years ago. 

The cacao tree is an evergreen, tropical plant found in Africa, South and Central America, the West Indies, and South-East Asia. The fruit of this tree is the size of a melon and contains 20-40 seeds. When dried, they become cacao beans, which are used to make chocolate. In English-speaking countries, they are often called cocoa beans, a misspelling from the 17th century when they were also called cacoa and cocao beans.

The Aztecs used cocoa beans as money and to make a drink called xocoatl, meaning 'bitter water' in their language, Nahuatl. This chocolate drink was flavored with spices and used in ceremonies and to welcome visitors. The Spanish liked the drink better with cinnamon and sugar, but the recipe didn't spread to the rest of Europe for another century. In the late 17th century, chocolate houses were set up in Europe's capital cities, where people gathered to drink chocolate.

Until the last century, chocolate drinks were made from solid blocks of chocolate melted in hot water. But in 1826, CJ van Houten from the Netherlands invented chocolate powder by removing most of the cocoa butter from the crushed beans. The chocolate bar as we know it began in 1847 when Fry and Sons, a company in Bristol, combined cocoa butter with pure chocolate liquor and sugar to make a solid block you could eat. A Swiss company later added milk solids, creating milk chocolate.

At the turn of the century, French companies dominated the British chocolate market. In 1879, the English company Cadbury named their Birmingham factory Bournville (ville is French for town) to add some French style. But then Cadbury's famous Dairy Milk bar, which started as Dairymaid in 1905, became popular. Clever advertising linked it to the healthy qualities of milk from the English countryside, making it a rival to the more luxurious French brands.

Currently, chocolate consumption in Britain has stabilized at about four bars each week. This has led manufacturers to find new ways to attract customers. The latest trend is the 'extended line,' where a chocolate bar becomes an ice cream, soft drink, or dessert to appeal to those tired of regular snacks.

Meanwhile, cacao farmers are still affected by a drop in cocoa bean prices at the end of the 1980s. Since most cacao farmers work on a very small scale, many had to close their businesses. Perhaps you could think of them as you enjoy your next chocolate bar."
FCE_18,"**THE SHELL ARTIST**

At 83, Peter Cooke has become an expert in his art. There are still many things Peter Cooke wants to try, like paper-making and feather-work. For now, he focuses on the skill he has perfected over the past ten years: creating delicate and unique objects from shells. ""Tell me if I am boring you,"" he says, as he shows me around his apartment, displaying his work. There is a fine line between being boring and being enthusiastic, but Cooke is definitely the latter, thanks to his charm and the beauty of his creations.

He points to a pair of shell-covered ornaments above a fireplace. ""I won't mind if people don't buy them because I've grown fond of them, and to me, they're adorable. I never intended to sell my work commercially. Some friends visited me about five years ago and said, 'You must have an exhibition - people should see these. We'll talk to a man who owns an art gallery.'""

The result was an exhibition in London, where 70 percent of the objects were sold. His second exhibition opened at the gallery yesterday. Considering the high prices the pieces fetch - around £2,000 for the ornaments - an empty space above the fireplace seems a small sacrifice for Cooke to make. There are 86 pieces in the exhibition, with prices starting at £225 for a shell-flower in a crystal vase. Cooke insists he has nothing to do with the prices and is openly cheerful about them: he claims no one else in the world creates work like his, and, as the gallery owner told him, ""Well, you're going to stop one day, and everybody will want your pieces because there won't be any more.""

""I do wish, though,"" says Cooke, ""that I'd started this much earlier, because then I could have created really wonderful things - at least the potential would have been there. Although the ideas are still there and I'm doing my best now, I'm more limited physically than I was when I started."" Still, the work he has produced is far from the common shell constructions found in seaside shops. ""I have a miniature mind,"" he says, which has led to boxes covered in thousands of tiny shells, little shaded pictures made from shells, and baskets of incredibly realistic flowers.

Cooke has developed his own method and uses materials as he finds them. He uses the cardboard from laundered shirts for his flower bases, a nameless glue bought in bulk from a sail-maker (""If it runs out, I don't know what I will do!"") and washing-up liquid to clean the shells. ""I have an idea of what I want to do, and it just does itself,"" he says of his working method, yet the attention to detail, color gradations, and symmetry he achieves look far from accidental.

Cooke's search for beautiful, especially tiny, shells has taken him beyond his Norfolk shore: to France, Thailand, Mexico, South Africa, and the Philippines, among other places where he has searched for treasures to bring home. He insists he only collects dead shells and defends himself against people who accuse him of stripping the world's beaches. ""When I am collecting shells, I hear people's big feet crushing them far faster than I can collect them; and the ones that are left, the sea breaks up. I would not dream of collecting shells with living creatures in them or diving for them, but once their occupants have left, why shouldn't I collect them?"" If one considers the amount of luggage that can be carried home by one man, whose work's beauty often surpasses its natural parts, his argument becomes very convincing indeed."
FCE_62,"**The Schoolgirl Model**

When 15-year-old Kira Langer is not traveling to amazing places and appearing on magazine covers, you will probably find her studying for her school exams. Jane Laidlaw finds out more.

""I'm afraid Kira will be a little late,"" the receptionist at the agency told me. ""Oh, fine,"" I said, ""no problem."" I had been trying to convince myself that all the negative things I had read about models were not true, but words like difficult, vain, and unintelligent kept coming to mind. And now she was going to be late. How late? An hour? Three hours? Maybe she wouldn't come at all. What if she decided a visit to the hairdresser's would be more fun than talking to me? If she was late, she would be rushing. She could be in a bad mood and refuse to answer my questions.

But when the winner of the Looks magazine supermodel competition walked in, she was smiling, relaxed, and apologetic, and she was with her mother. Kira was not dressed in expensive designer clothes but in a simple black dress and trainers. There was no sign of a selfish attitude; she was just a very friendly, very tall, very pretty girl. All models under the age of 16 must take an adult with them whenever they work, she explained, and apart from looking incredibly young, her mother was a normal mum - visibly proud of her successful daughter.

Kira seems a bit surprised by her new fame, which makes sense since it was not planned. It was her older sister who decided that she should enter the model competition. ""She saw the competition and said I should go in for it,"" Kira remembers. ""I said no, but she sent some photos in anyway."" When the call came to tell her that she was a finalist, she was at school. Being selected for the final gave Kira the confidence to go through with it, and she performed perfectly. She won easily, and the Select model agency in London immediately offered her work.

Kira now finds that one of the hardest things she has to do is manage her two separate lives. But her friends and teachers have become used to having a star among them. ""They're really proud of me,"" she says. However, a few unkind people at her school are rude about her success. ""They say I have too high an opinion of myself."" This kind of remark must be hard for Kira to deal with, since there can't be many people as successful as her who are less self-important. But she says, ""They assume that because I've suddenly become a model, I can't stay the same. But the only thing that's changed is I've become more confident - not in a horrible way, but I'm able to stand up for myself more.""

As a busy model, though, her social life is obviously affected. The Select agency can call at any time and tell her that she is wanted for a job the next day. ""If my friends are going out together, I can't say I'll come, because I don't know what I'm doing the next day. I can't really make plans, and if I do, they sometimes get broken, but my friends are good about it. They don't say, 'Oh, you're always going off modeling now, you never have time for us.'""

Kira has the looks, ability, and support to have a fabulous career ahead of her. And not many people can say that before they even sit their school-leaving exams. I am about to finish the interview with the girl who has it all, and I ask what she would like to do as a career if she didn't have the outstanding beauty that seems certain to take her to the top of the profession. She pauses and replies, ""I'd like to do what you're doing."""
FCE_49,"Father and Son Start Gold Rush

Terence and Chris Madden have traveled from Canada's cold north to Africa's heat in search of valuable metals. Terence, an explorer, and his son Chris, a mineral expert, believe their mine on a Welsh mountain might have up to 10,000 ounces of gold. After ten years of digging in the Welsh hills, they think they are very close to a gold vein worth five million dollars. Terence, 68, from Liverpool, said, ""As we dig, we are finding high levels of gold; now we just need to dig a few more meters to where it is concentrated.""

The Maddens have dedicated their lives to finding gold. Their search began when Terence read about gold worth millions in the 'Dolgellau gold belt', an area near the Welsh town of Dolgellau. They studied 19th-century mining journals and newspapers at the Welsh National Library in Aberystwyth to choose the best area to explore. After clearing away plants and finding bits of gold in the rocks, they spent ten years getting permission from landowners, taking earth samples, and removing old cars and rubbish. They dug out 150 tonnes of greenstone rock to make a tunnel and a 10-meter shaft. Now, they are running out of money. They need to find someone to invest £50,000 to dig a few more meters to reach the gold. Chris Madden says, ""At the moment, this looks doubtful, although we've got quite a few people we can contact.""

As news spread about the dig, the magic of gold attracted the attention of locals and gold diggers. Dolgellau depends on tourists, and residents are cautiously hopeful. Peter Woolven, manager of the Royal Ship Hotel, said, ""It would encourage more people to come here if they are right, but if these two find gold, I hope millions of people are not going to come and hack away at the hillside.""

The Welsh gold industry has declined since its peak in the late 1880s when thousands worked in hundreds of mines. One of the last mines, Clogau-St David's, which made wedding rings for the Queen and the Princess of Wales, closed a month ago. However, individual gold-diggers are returning. George Hall, another prospector, plans to dig a tunnel on the other side of the ridge from the Maddens. Hall, 70, said, ""Searching for gold is very emotional. It's adventurous and exciting, the wonder of uncovering hidden treasure. Maybe I'll be lucky this time."""
FCE_31,"**IN HOT WATER**

Rachel Mills is a scientist who spends a lot of time at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She is a lecturer at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University and studies marine geochemistry, which means she looks at the chemical processes in the sea. When she isn't teaching, she goes into a small steel vehicle, about the size of a small car, to dive three kilometers down into the Atlantic Ocean to study underwater volcanoes. Inside the vehicle, space is so tight that she can touch the two pilots. They are used to these conditions, which mean they and Rachel can't stand up or move much, and they must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can last for 16 hours: three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours collecting rock and water samples, and then three hours to return to the surface. If there is a problem and they need to get to the top quickly, they can press a panic button. This releases a small escape vessel that quickly rises to the surface, like a ping-pong ball in water. No one has tested it yet, but Rachel thinks it wouldn't be a pleasant trip.

Rachel remembers her first time in the vehicle. It was on a ship's deck, and she got in with an instructor who explained the emergency procedures, including what to do if the pilot had a heart attack. They wanted to see how she would react in such a small space. Now, Rachel has made six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian crew. They went to a site five days' sail west of the Canary Islands in the Atlantic. On the ocean floor, there is a large area of underwater volcanoes with chimneys blowing out black smoke. The Russian team was placing scientific equipment there to study the effects of a program that would make a hole 150 meters through a volcano.

When Rachel isn't at sea, she is in her office at the Oceanography Centre, Southampton. Two-thirds of her salary comes from teaching, which she loves, but she does it so she can continue her research into the ""black smokers."" This is another name for underwater volcanoes, where water comes out of the rock and looks like black smoke. It pours out at a rate of one meter per second and at a temperature of 350 degrees Celsius.

The only time Rachel was frightened was when she first went down with an American team. They were towing equipment on a 50-meter rope when there was an explosion. The shock waves hit their vehicle, and Rachel thought she was going to die. They waited in silence, and when nothing happened, they were incredibly relieved to be alive.

Diving to the deepest part of the ocean is an adventure for Rachel. Every time she looks out of the porthole and sees the chimneys, she feels a sense of wonder. She is at the bottom of the sea, seeing something no one else has seen before. She had studied the black smokers for three years for her PhD, and seeing them in real life was an amazing experience."
FCE_58,"I was dirty, smelly, hungry, and somewhere beneath all that, suntanned. It was the end of my Inter-Rail holiday. My body couldn't take any more punishment. My mind couldn't handle any more foreign timetables, currencies, or languages. ""Never again,"" I said, as I stepped onto home ground. I said exactly the same thing the following year. And the next. All I had to do was buy one train ticket, and because I was under twenty-five years old, I could spend a whole month traveling anywhere I wanted in Europe. Ordinary beds are never the same once you've learned to sleep in the corridor of a train, the rhythm rocking you into a deep sleep. Carrying all your belongings on your back in a rucksack makes you have a very basic approach to travel, and encourages incredible wastefulness that can lead to burning socks that have become too unpleasant, and getting rid of books when finished. On the other hand, this way of looking at life is entirely in the spirit of Inter-Rail, for common sense and reasoning can be thrown out of the window along with the paperback book and the socks. All it takes to achieve this carefree attitude is one of those tickets in your hand. Any system that enables young people to travel through countries at a rate of more than one a day must be pretty special. On that first trip, my friends and I were at first unaware of the possibilities of this type of train ticket, thinking it was just an inexpensive way of getting to and from our chosen campsite in southern France. But the idea of non-stop travel proved too tempting, for there was always just one more country over the border, always that little bit further to go. And what did the extra miles cost us? Nothing. We were not completely uninterested in culture. But this was a first holiday without parents, as it was for most other Inter-Railers, and in organizing our own timetable we left out everything except the most immediately available sights. This was the chance to escape the guided tour, an opportunity to do something different. I took great pride in the fact that, in many places, all I could be bothered to see was the view from the station. We were just there to get by, and to have a good time doing so. In this, we were no different from most of the other Inter-Railers with whom we shared corridor floors, food and water, money, and music. The excitement of travel comes from the sudden reality of somewhere that was previously just a name. It is as if the city in which you arrive never actually existed until the train pulls in at the station and you are able to see it with your own tired eyes for the first time. Only by actually seeing Europe, by watching the changing landscapes and seeing the differences in attitudes and lifestyles, can you really have an accurate picture of the continent in your mind. Everybody knows what is there, but it is meaningless until you view it yourself. This is what makes other people's holiday photos so boring. While the train trip won't allow you to discover anything new in the world sense, it is a valuable personal experience. Europe is a big place, and Inter-Rail gives people the best opportunity to recognize this ... though in our case it didn't happen immediately."
FCE_37,"Text: 'There is nothing more disappointing than arriving at an airport in another country and finding out that your baggage has been left behind. At best, you will have to wear the clothes you are in for hours or days until the airline returns your luggage. At worst, you might be in a different climate, far from home, and have to wear unsuitable clothes. Although airlines rarely say how many bags they lose, it is a common issue that regular travelers will eventually face. Even the best airlines make mistakes sometimes, and no airline can guarantee that a passenger's checked luggage will be on the same flight, especially when the trip involves changing planes. 

Here's how the system works. Airlines require passengers to check in early to give enough time for baggage to go through the airport and be loaded onto the plane. Minimum connecting times (MCTs) are the shortest times needed to transfer between flights, and these are also set to allow for baggage transfers. Normally, the system works well. But extra security checks and air traffic problems can delay flights, causing the baggage system to fail. There is also the chance of human error or an accident where the destination label is torn off. These issues can be serious at large transfer airports, known as 'hubs', because they handle many bags. For example, last year, London's Heathrow airport handled over 41 million passengers, with nine million changing planes. British Airways alone handled two million transfer passengers at Heathrow, with most moving between Terminal 1 (for Domestic and European flights) and Terminal 4 (for long-distance flights). Even efficient transfer airports like Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Singapore, and Zurich have bad days. The risk of losing baggage when changing planes is higher at certain airports. Even the United States has issues - Miami airport is known for luggage going missing when passengers connect to flights to Latin America.

To avoid losing your luggage, choose direct flights when possible and check in well before the official time. If you must change planes or if it makes your flight cheaper, try to fly with the same airline for the whole trip. Allow more time for connections by taking an earlier flight to the transfer airport, and label your luggage inside and out with your home and holiday addresses. Don't forget to include the flight numbers. If your luggage still goes missing, contact the airline official in the baggage hall and fill out a property irregularity report (PIR) before leaving the airport.'"
FCE_2,"Text: 'The Kingfisher Wildlife photographer Charlie James is an expert on the kingfisher, a beautiful blue-green bird that lives near streams and rivers and feeds on fish. Old trees hang over the stream, partly shading the shallow water. Soft greens, mud browns, and the different yellows of sunlight are the main colors, as gentle as the sounds of water in the breeze. The bird moves quickly through the scene, like a flash of light and motion that is so striking you almost feel it. It disappears in a split second, but the image stays in your mind, its impact much larger than its size. Charlie James fell in love with kingfishers when he was young. He cannot explain exactly what attracts him to this little bird, which shows how much he cares for it. The kingfisher is part of legends. In Greek myth, it is a moon goddess who turned into a bird. Another story says the kingfisher flew so high that its upper body became the blue of the sky, while its underside was burned by the sun. There is some scientific truth in this story. Even though their feathers show many different blues, kingfishers have no blue pigment. Instead, the structure of their feathers scatters light and reflects blue strongly. This is why a kingfisher can look bright blue or rich emerald green depending on the angle of the light. It's no surprise that some wildlife photographers are very enthusiastic about them. The colors, along with the fact that kingfishers, though shy of people, can be watched easily from a hideout, create a lifelong passion. Charlie James's first hideout was an old blanket he put over his head while he waited near a kingfisher's favorite spot. The bird returned within minutes and sat only a meter away. But it took him another four years to get his first good picture. Meanwhile, the European kingfisher became a big part of his life. He spent as much time as he could by a stream rich with kingfishers. The problem was that school took away time he could spend with the birds. So he skipped classes, becoming what he calls an 'academic failure'. But his interest in the kingfisher, the only member of its family to breed in Europe, was noticed. At 16, he was hired as an advisor for a nature magazine. He then worked as an assistant to the editor and gradually became a freelance wildlife film cameraman. Now, he wants to make the ultimate kingfisher film. 'No speech, just beautiful images that say it all,' he says. 'I'm drawn to the simple approach. I like to photograph parts of kingfisher wings...' His sentence trails off. He's thinking of the bird's colors that still excite him after so many years. His photographs show some of his feelings, but as Charlie knows, there's much more to his relationship with the kingfisher than his work can ever show.'"
FCE_68,"**Conducting an Orchestra: Insights from Five New Conductors**

**A. ANNE MANSON**

Anne Manson, 30, had an unexpected start in conducting when she asked to watch Claudio Abbado's rehearsals in Vienna. She ended up replacing an absent assistant and was later invited to help with another opera. ""I had to lead the first rehearsal for Abbado. No, I wasn't nervous. I've always been comfortable in front of an orchestra,"" she says. Manson, originally from the US, works with a London opera company focused on modern music. She is also gaining recognition in Europe, supported by the British Arts Council, and has assisted Abbado on several occasions since.

**B. ANDREW CONSTANTINE**

Andrew Constantine, 31, believes the hardest part of conducting is convincing people to give you opportunities. He won a major competition in 1991 after failing in two others. Reflecting on this, he feels the timing was right: ""If it had happened earlier, I might have disappeared."" The competition opened doors for him, including a role as an assistant to a famous conductor. However, he worries about being labeled as just a ""competition winner."" ""If in three years my name is still linked to the competition, I'll be concerned,"" he says. ""But orchestras like the English Chamber Orchestra, who hired me after the competition, are inviting me back. If they don't, your career can fall apart.""

**C. WASFI KANI**

Wasfi Kani, founder of Pimlico Opera, enjoys the long rehearsal periods in opera. ""The music deserves four weeks of focus,"" she says. Kani began conducting seriously in her late twenties. After university, she worked in London's business sector until Pimlico Opera became fully professional two years ago. Starting lessons with Sian Edwards was crucial for her. ""Seeing her conduct, I realized she was my size. I had always been taught by much bigger people, which makes a big difference."" She appreciates the complexity of opera: ""There are many arguments, and you have to consider the singers' personalities.""

**D. ROGER VIGNOLES**

""Conducting came as a surprise, but it's fascinating,"" says Roger Vignoles, 48. It's not a strange move for him, though. He began as a resident musician at an opera house and worked with skilled conductors. Last year, he was asked to direct Handel's Agrippina from the piano at a festival, something new for him. ""It was easier than I thought. I knew the music well and what I wanted it to sound like. I tried to achieve that performance. People respect my musical ability. I'm using all my experience in music and performing. Now, I'll do whatever people ask to find out what I enjoy.""

**E. WAYNE MARSHALL**

In 1986, conductor Simon Rattle noticed Wayne Marshall, then a young assistant, and mentioned him to his agent. Marshall, now 32, soon found himself conducting a musical in London on short notice, a challenging start. He even had to deal with musicians reading newspapers during the show: ""I was firm with them. I always gave a clear beat and got the best result I could. Many musicians don't seem to need much guidance from a conductor. But I'm not afraid to say what I want. If you show worry, it gets worse. I've never formally studied conducting, and no book teaches you how, but people have been supportive. I'm determined and know what I like."""
FCE_23,"**Variations on a Theme**

If you're planning to take children to a theme park, there are many options in Britain. We asked five families to try out some of the best ones.

**Fun Island - The Burns family**

Last year, we visited a large theme park in the US, so we thought Fun Island might not be as exciting. However, we were pleasantly surprised. The park is great for younger children, so our three-year-old felt included. The kids loved the Crocodile Ride and the Giant Wheel. There’s a special dodgems ride for very young kids, which was a big hit. For older children, there are more thrilling rides like Splash Out, where you end up in a pool! After five hours, Steve and I were ready to leave, but the children wanted to stay because they were having so much fun. Our only complaint is that the park lacks a bit of atmosphere, and the scenery could be better. But the staff are very helpful, and the park is clean, well-organized, and safe.

**Wonderland - The McMillan family**

None of us had been to a theme park before, so we didn’t know what to expect. We thought Oscar might be too young, but he loved it. He enjoyed the Mountain Train and Little Land, which has small models of famous buildings at his height! The older children liked the ferris wheel and driving toy cars on a real road layout. We spent six hours there and appreciated the places to rest. The landscaping is beautiful, and the staff are friendly and helpful. There’s something for everyone, including adults.

**Adventure World - The Jeffree family**

After seven hours, we felt there was still a lot to see. The children loved the Big Top Circus, especially the trapeze act, which was thrilling. We went on the Terror Line, and although the girls were scared and kept their eyes shut, they said they enjoyed it. Their favorite ride was Running River, where you think you’ll get wet, but you don’t. For younger children, Toy Land is great fun. The children looked at the new ride, Fear Factor, but we were relieved they were too small for it! The park is well-designed, so even waiting in line isn’t too boring. It’s very clean, and the staff are excellent. On one ride, I couldn’t sit with both girls, so a staff member offered to go with one of them.

**The Great Park - The Langridge family**

We arrived at one o’clock and were disappointed that the park was only open until 5 p.m. This is a great theme park for younger children because the rides aren’t too scary. I’m usually afraid, but even I had fun. We all loved Exotic Travels, a boat ride that starts calmly and then becomes very exciting. We waited for half an hour for Lightning River, and then it was over quickly! I didn’t go on the Big Leap, but it looked great for those who are brave. If the children were older, they might have found it a bit tame, but they were the right age and loved it.

**Fantasy World - The Break-all family**

The park advertises that there is 'No Limit to the Fun', and we agree. Europe’s tallest roller-coaster, the Rocket, is the main attraction, and Ben thought it was the scariest ride, although Jennie said the Hanger, where you hang upside-down 30 meters above the ground, was even scarier! There are about a dozen main rides, which the older children went on several times. Sarah was too small for a few of them, but she enjoyed the Long Slide. We found the staff attitudes varied. Some were great with younger children, but the welcome wasn’t always warm. You need a full day to enjoy Fantasy World. We wouldn’t have dared tell the kids we were leaving early."
FCE_60,"**Running a Business in the Countryside: Five Women's Stories**

**A. Christine Hogan**  
Christine Hogan runs a computer-aided design business with a yearly turnover of over £200,000 and employs four full-time staff. She says, ""My customers are friends."" Christine and her husband moved from London to the countryside when their children were young. She wanted a job she could do from home. Having worked with computers before marriage, her husband suggested starting a computer-aided design business. It required a lot of money, and the beginning was tough. Christine was careful with finances, always informing the bank manager if she might overspend. Working from home saves money, and she can work in the evenings if needed. The business remains small, with local clients often collecting their work.

**B. Maggy Sasanow**  
Maggy Sasanow enjoys being independent and works from home designing greeting cards. She studied art at university and wanted to work in a museum, but after marrying and moving to the countryside, she started her own business. She creates 50 different greeting cards, selling them to museums. Maggy works in a large room upstairs. A downside of working from home is the constant distraction of household chores. Her business grows through word of mouth, without advertising. People send work from London because she is cheaper than other artists. Although she misses exchanging ideas with others, she finds more advantages than disadvantages in her work.

**C. Delia Turner**  
Delia Turner has faced challenges with her curtain-making business. She started eight years ago, and initially, the business grew from £24,000 to £80,000 in two years. She managed six full-time curtain-makers but had to let them go due to economic decline, which was difficult as jobs are scarce in the area. Now, Delia is almost back to where she started, making curtains at home with her husband's help and using women who work from their homes. She must be ready to lower prices when needed and explore new opportunities.

**D. Tessa Strickland**  
Tessa Strickland manages the editorial and production side of her children's book publishing business from her farmhouse. She moved to the countryside three years ago for financial reasons and her love of the country. Tessa enjoys the flexibility of working when she wants. Most of her income comes from deals with Australia, the Far East, and North America, requiring her to take calls at odd hours. The challenge is maintaining discipline to stop working. She publishes children's books from various cultures, collaborating with authors and artists. Initially, she felt lonely, as all her professional experience was in London.

**E. Meg Rivers**  
Meg Rivers runs a cakes-by-post business and a shop with a yearly turnover of £250,000, employing six people, some part-time. She started ten years ago at home, focusing on health by making fruit cakes with quality ingredients. As demand grew from friends and relatives, she began sending cakes nationwide. Seven years ago, she rented a small building where everything is made, employing a baker, assistant, and professional cake-icer. Meg now manages the commercial side and no longer cooks. Her biggest challenge has been the financial aspect, as they didn't have much money to start with."
FCE_1,"**Meet the Amazing Watkins Family**

The Watkins family is unique because not only are the sons talented musicians and composers, but their father, John, also makes musical instruments. When John and Hetty Watkins from South Wales needed a cello for their ten-year-old son, Paul, they found it too expensive to buy one. John decided to learn how to make a cello himself. He attended evening classes at the Welsh School of Instrument Making for about three years. After practicing with violins and violas, he successfully made his first cello for Paul. Paul used this cello until recently, and John now makes up to twelve violins a year. Selling one to the famous American violinist Jaime Laredo was a highlight for him.

Both Paul and his younger brother, Huw, were encouraged to play music from a young age. Paul started with the piano and then moved to the cello, inspired by a cellist in his father's music group. Huw, on the other hand, chose to play the piano and is now making a name for himself as a pianist and composer.

Paul achieved great success with the cello his father made. He won the string final of the BBC Young Musician of the Year competition and became the principal cellist of the BBC Symphony Orchestra at the age of 20. He now plays a Francesco Rugeri cello, which is on loan from the Royal Academy of Music. Paul believes his father's cello will improve with age, just like his Rugeri, which is over 300 years old.

Paul will soon perform Elgar's Cello Concerto on television, but he won't be able to watch it because he will be performing at the Cheltenham Festival the same night. Huw will also be busy, as his String Quartet will premiere in London at the Wigmore Hall. John and Hetty will have to manage their time well to follow their sons' busy musical schedules."
FCE_53,"Text: 'Caring for the Countryside THE NATIONAL TRUST The National Trust is an organization that aims to protect the British countryside. Gill Page visits the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales and talks to Gareth Roberts, a warden employed by the Trust to care for the beautiful areas it owns. According to Gareth, a National Trust Warden needs common sense. 'You also need to be good with people because you deal with farmers, visitors, conservationists, and building companies all the time.' Gareth grew up on the Lleyn Peninsula and worked on his parents' farm until he got married. About 80 people applied for the job of National Trust Warden for the Lleyn Peninsula. In the end, Gareth's local knowledge and farming experience got him the job, even though he didn't have formal training. 'It's helpful that I still farm with my parents and can understand farmers' problems. Also, they can't fool me about anything!' he says. His farming background also helps him handle the physical work of the job - putting up fences, planting trees, building walls. Since joining the Trust, Gareth has learned more about nature conservation. 'When I was young,' he remembers, 'I used to pick and press flowers, collect butterfly larvae, and old birds' nests. I recently thought, where would I find all those flowers, birds' nests, and grasshoppers now? It's clear to me that farming has changed the countryside. It's not the farmers' fault - they were just following government advice.' Gareth says that, when he started, farmers and conservationists were against each other. Both wanted things done their way. Now they talk and understand each other's views. 'We're at a crossroads and just need a small step to bring them together,' says Gareth. Conservation is a main part of Gareth's work, along with public access to the Trust's land, tree planting and maintenance, and meeting the Trust's tenant farmers. 'My role is to make sure jobs get done, with little fuss and as cheaply as possible. What I enjoy most is seeing projects finished, although about half my time is spent on reports, signing bills, and so on.' Gareth is very enthusiastic about his job and, despite never being off duty, he enjoys every minute of it, especially talking to the public. Most of them, anyway. 'It's the attitude of some people I dislike,' he admits. 'They just come into the area, demand everything, then leave as if it's their right. Having to be nice to those people annoys me!' But as Gareth says, it's all about common sense. So if you have plenty of that, and you like the idea of an outdoor job, you might think of applying to become a warden like Gareth - but don't expect a job to be available on the Lleyn Peninsula for many years!'"
FCE_55,"**The Netball Captain**

In our series on women in sport, Suzie Ellis met England's netball captain, Kendra Slowinski. Kendra is preparing for next month's World Championships. Her days are busy: she teaches at a local school and then trains in a supermarket car park. I asked her if people give her strange looks. She said, ""I'm too focused on my movements and my feet to notice. I might see cars slow down, but that's all.""

Kendra's life is all about being her best for the Championships. She follows a strict schedule to get fit. This will be her fourth World Championships, and they will be the biggest ever, with 27 countries participating. ""We'll have home support, which is special,"" she says. ""It's important to improve netball's reputation in our country. Playing here means more pressure. A home crowd will expect us to start well.""

Their first game is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. ""As far as I know, we have always beaten them, but they are exciting to play. They have lots of ability."" England is currently ranked fourth in the world. But the World Championships will be tough. ""You have to play every day, with no rest between games. In a series, you can lose the first game and still win. But in the Championships, there's only one chance.""

In her 15 years at the top level, netball has become harder and faster. Players are more aggressive. ""You don't train so hard not to win,"" says Kendra. ""But after the final whistle, we're all friendlier.""

Netball now uses a more scientific approach to fitness. ""We must think and train like world-class players,"" says Kendra. ""As captain, I need a strong mental attitude and must lead by example. My role is to support and encourage the team.""

Kendra's netball career has been carefully planned. She decided that this competition would be her last as a player. She might coach young players in the future, but now she is focused on her last big event. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she might have a tear in her eye."
FCE_50,"**SPECIALIST MUSIC SCHOOLS**

How should you support a child with exceptional musical talent? It can be challenging to know the best way to nurture their gift. Some parents might not notice their child's needs until the child becomes frustrated and difficult to manage. While most schools can support children who excel in academic subjects, musically gifted children need special attention that regular schools might not provide, especially if music is not a priority there. These children, along with those encouraged by parents or teachers, might benefit from attending a specialist music school.

There are five specialist music schools in Britain, which are relatively new. They offer a supportive environment for gifted children aged seven to eighteen to develop their musical skills with the help of professional musicians. At these schools, children spend one-third to half of their day on musical activities, such as individual lessons (up to three hours a week on their main and secondary instruments), playing in orchestras, chamber groups, voice training, conducting, and learning music theory. They also practice for several hours daily in well-equipped private rooms, sometimes with a teacher. The rest of their time is spent on a limited academic program focusing on essential subjects like English, math, basic sciences, and languages. However, students can study more subjects if they wish.

All five British specialist schools are independent, with small classes and a high teacher-to-student ratio. Most students are boarders, meaning they live at the school full-time, which allows them to grow up with peers who have similar goals and interests.

What are the downsides? One major issue is the cost; boarding fees range from £12,000 to £17,000 a year. However, schools try to help parents of exceptionally gifted children with scholarships and financial aid. Another concern is that not all parents want to send their children to boarding school, especially at a young age. Many school directors question the wisdom of admitting children as young as seven into such a demanding environment. They emphasize that their goal is to develop 'rounded and well-balanced individuals.'

Separating musically gifted children from an early age can be stressful. Musical talent might fade during teenage years, and the pressure to succeed can lead to feelings of failure. However, specialist schools closely monitor each student's progress and provide help and advice when needed. While many former students feel they gained a lot from the high-quality music education, some are concerned about the limited academic program, which is secondary to music activities. Many musically talented young people are also very intelligent and can handle academic challenges, feeling frustrated if their intellectual needs are unmet.

For these reasons, it might be better to wait until the child is old enough to decide for themselves before considering a specialist education. Those who are also academically gifted might thrive in a less specialized environment, such as a school with an excellent music department or by combining regular schooling with musical training at a junior department of a music college. These colleges offer Saturday morning lessons with excellent teachers and opportunities for orchestral and chamber music experience. However, this option may not be feasible for families living far from London or other major cities."
FCE_25,"Artist Susan Shepherd is famous for her flower paintings. Her large garden, full of her favorite flowers like tulips and poppies, provides many of her painting subjects. Some plants grow wildly and spread throughout the garden. The garden has a beautiful mix of colors and shapes, especially in the two long flower borders along the path. This is partly thanks to the previous owners, who were passionate gardeners and left plants that Susan liked. She also kept their gardener, Danny. Susan says, 'It was really his garden.' They got along well, and although Danny sometimes doubted her choices, he understood her vision when she explained she wanted to paint them.

Susan prefers to paint detailed studies of single plants rather than the whole garden. Sometimes she paints groups of plants where they grow, but usually, she picks them and takes them to her studio. 'I don't set everything up at once,' she explains. 'I paint one flower, which might take a few days, then add another one, building the painting over time. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish.' Her busiest time is spring and early summer when tulips and poppies bloom. 'They all bloom together, and you're so busy,' she says. She is also fascinated by how flowers change as they decay. For example, tulips change shape and open up when left in water, becoming more interesting over time.

Susan has always loved plants. 'I studied botany at school and collected wildflowers from the countryside,' she says. 'I wasn't interested in gardening then; I thought garden flowers looked fake, like the silk or plastic ones in some shops. I preferred wildflowers because they grew in tough places like rock cracks or cliff tops.' Now, her garden includes plants from distant countries, but they fit in well. She has a relaxed attitude towards her garden, like an aunt who lets children play freely as long as they don't cause harm. With two upcoming exhibitions and plenty of subjects to paint, she finds it hard to work in the garden. She has hired another gardener, but she knows that to stay connected to her work, 'you have to get your hands dirty.'"
FCE_34,"Title: Keeping the Holiday-Makers Happy

Sarah Sutherland-Pilch, a 24-year-old from West Sussex, shares her experience as a chalet girl in Val d'Isère, France. This is her second year working there, where she cooks and cleans for visitors staying in chalets, which are typical wooden houses in the area. Sarah graduated in French and History of Art from Oxford Brookes University last summer. She says being a chalet girl isn't a long-term career but a fun way to spend a couple of years before settling down. 'It's a good way to make contacts. I meet successful people every week,' she says.

Sarah doesn't live in the chalet. She starts her day at 7 a.m. and walks about a mile to the chalet, which can host up to 18 guests each week. She has her own breakfast before preparing a full breakfast for the guests, including porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants. After breakfast, around 9:30 a.m., she cleans up and either prepares afternoon tea or cleans the rooms, which she finds the hardest part of the job. By 11 a.m., she is ready to ski and enjoys being on the slopes until about 4:30 p.m.

Sarah returns to the chalet to prepare dinner and takes a shower before starting. Dinner is a three-course meal served at 8 p.m., with coffee by 10 p.m. After dinner, she cleans up and loads the dishwasher. Sometimes she chats with the guests, while other times they prefer to be left alone. 'Good guests can make a week brilliant, but some weeks don't go quite so well,' she says.

Sarah meets her friends at the chalet where she lives and they go out around 11 p.m. They visit places like Bananas, G Jay's, and Dick's T-Bar. However, she never stays out too late on Saturday night because Sunday is her busiest day. 'A frightful day,' she calls it, as she starts work earlier than usual to serve breakfast by 7 a.m. After the guests leave, she cleans the chalet thoroughly, strips the beds, and prepares for the new guests. If she hasn't done the week's shopping on Saturday, she does it now. By 3 p.m., she prepares tea for the new guests, who arrive around 4:30 p.m. She helps them with any questions and takes those needing equipment to the ski shop. After that, it's time for dinner again, and sometimes she chats with friends, but not always. 'Sometimes I'm so tired I just have an early night,' she says."
FCE_12,"Text: 'Changing lives with a Stranger Mandie Currie, a zoo-keeper, spent the day at the offices of the magazine Marie Claire. 'Choosing what to wear for my day at Marie Claire was difficult because I usually wear a uniform at work. First, I went to a still-life photo studio, then to press previews, all before lunch. The zoo is a calm, peaceful place - and here I was rushing around when I could be sitting quietly with an animal. Some of the fashion team seemed quite stressed - my job doesn't really get stressful. At a fashion shoot in the afternoon, it made me laugh to think that I'd usually be cleaning cages or handling rats. I'm interested to see how magazines work, but I really enjoy my job at the zoo, so I'll stay there.' Alice Cutler, a fashion assistant at Marie Claire, spent the day at London Zoo. 'I arrived at the zoo in my leather boots and dark blue trousers. The zoo gave me a green polo shirt to work in - which was good because I got very dirty. As I stroked one of the elephants, I thought Mandie would probably be packing up clothes in the cupboard. By five o'clock, I smelled bad, but I'd had such a great day. When I retire from fashion, I could see myself working with elephants - but maybe in Africa.' Karen Hodson, a nurse at Hammersmith Hospital, went on location with the television gardening programme Ground Force. 'I was very excited about meeting the team, and Alan Titchmarsh, the programme presenter, was really nice. One of the things I liked was the chance to be outside. Depending on my shifts, I sometimes never see daylight. Even though it was hard work, it was great fun. I thought I was pretty strong, but I felt weak compared to the rest of the team. My romantic idea of landscape gardening did not include physical hard work or careful planning. I was more enthusiastic than effective as a gardener, so I don't plan to leave my other job.' Charlie Dimmock, a landscape gardener with the TV programme Ground Force, worked a shift at Hammersmith Hospital. 'I made beds and handed out tablets. I expected to faint when I was doing some jobs, but I was surprised to find that it didn't bother me. The friendship among the nurses is great, and it felt very 'girlie' compared to my usual male environment. I feel my job is a real waste of time compared to nursing. My day at the hospital was not exactly pleasant, but it left me with a great sense of satisfaction.' Lucy Harvey, a personal trainer, spent the day with the airline Ryanair as a member of the cabin crew. 'I changed into the uniform, and the moment I put it on I felt completely different - people suddenly look up to you. Before the flight, our supervisor told us about safety, what to do if someone had a heart attack - which I knew about from my fitness training. When the passengers boarded the flight to Paris, I gave out magazines. Everyone stared at me, and I felt very self-conscious. On the return journey, we had 80 schoolchildren on board who wouldn't sit still. I wished I was back in the gym with one sensible adult to look after.' Sonia McDermott, an air hostess with the airline Ryanair, spent the day as a personal trainer in a gym. 'I was worried about doing this swap as I don't do any exercise. I was amazed at how much attention you give to one person. In my job, you meet 130 passengers four times a day. I was very surprised at lunch to see that some of the trainers didn't eat very healthily, but they all drink lots of water. I wouldn't swap my job for this. However, it has inspired me to join a gym and try to be a bit healthier.''"
FCE_26,"**On the Rails: Five Celebrities Share Their Favorite Train Journeys**

**Andrea Thompson - Newsreader**  
I fell in love with the south of France a long time ago and try to visit as often as I can. There's a local train from Cannes along the coast that crosses into Italy. It takes you past some of the most amazing sea views. No matter the weather or time of year, it is always enchanting. Out of the other window, you can see some of the best gardens and homes in France. It feels like peeking into the lives of the rich and famous. The travelers are always lively, with a mix of tourists and locals, all enjoying the breathtaking journey.

**Raj Patel - Explorer**  
I have enjoyed many rail journeys over the years, but my favorite is the Nile Valley Express, which runs across the desert in northern Sudan. Growing up in South Africa, I missed a family train trip from Cape Town to the Kruger National Park because I was considered too young and troublesome. When I moved to England as a teenager, I still hadn't traveled by train. London Waterloo was the first real station I saw, and its great glass dome amazed me.

**Betty Cooper - Novelist**  
I am grateful to one train in particular: the Blue Train, which took my husband and me on our honeymoon across France to catch a boat to Egypt. On the train, my husband gave me a pink dress, which I loved. Someone mentioned that pink is good for the brain, and I've worn the color ever since. What I remember about the journey is how lovely it was to travel through France and then by boat up the Nile to Luxor. It was the perfect way to relax after all the wedding preparations.

**Martin Brown - Journalist**  
We were working on a series of articles about a round-the-world trip and had to cross a desert in an African country. There wasn't a road, so we took the Desert Express. The timetable was unreliable - we were just given a day. We heard that the driver would often wait for days to depart if he knew people were still on their way. When it appeared, there was a rush of people climbing into and onto the carriages - people even traveled on the roof for free. During the night, the train crossed some of the most beautiful landscapes I have ever seen. It was like a dream, like traveling across the moon.

**Arisu Mezuki - Actress**  
Most people form their favorite impressions of trains when they are young, but not me. I grew up in Singapore and Cyprus, where I saw very few trains. It wasn't until I was a teenager that trains became important in my life. I made a film featuring a railway in Yorkshire. Most filming took place on an old, disused line maintained by volunteers. That's where my passion for steam trains began. When we weren't filming, we rode the train whenever we could, and when I went back last year, it was as if time had stood still. Everything was still in place, even the gas lights on the station platform!"
FCE_8,"Text: 'Trying to get published? If you're wondering where to send your story, our expert Margaret Stubbs has the advice you need. Readers often ask, 'I have written this story/book. Who should I send it to?' The first thing to know is that you should research the market and learn about publishers while improving your writing skills. Turning words into something that sells requires knowledge about the 'writing game'. Whatever you write, you need to understand the markets you are targeting. The best way to do this is by reading everything relevant you can find. Use your local library and visit bookshops and newsagents. Reading widely will guide you on what kinds of writing publishers are accepting at any time. This knowledge must be updated regularly as new publications appear, editors change jobs, and magazines change direction. New titles come and go all the time. Publishers are always looking for new talent; as writers, we must give them what they want. At first, you might not be sure what you want to write. Let's say you want to write short love stories. The first thing you must do is find out which magazines publish love stories, a limited market these days, and get as many recent copies as you can. Then, learn about the kind of stories they buy, paying attention to who the readers are. These readers expect different things from their magazine, and the editor focuses on meeting their needs. Writers often send me their stories saying, 'This has been rejected three times - am I wasting my time? Do I stand a chance?' As a former teacher, I would never discourage anyone. But it's unlikely the work is ready for publishing, so I try to give an honest opinion, but always positively. The problem is that most new writers are too eager to send their work out, usually before they are ready for the market. If you have only written one story or article, it's unlikely to be published. That almost never happens. When you hear about 'success', you usually find that the person has been in publishing or journalism for years before their success. When you finally send off your work for the first time, start working on more while you wait for a reply; write ten more stories, even twenty. Each one will be better than the last, and you will start to think of yourself as a writer, and both your fluency and confidence will grow. Don't throw any of them away—improve them instead. Also, I advise not showing your work to anyone else, especially in the early stages. Remember that every successful writer has faced many rejections before succeeding. Do everything you can to advance your writing career. See if there's a creative writing course near you. If not, try joining a local writers' group to gain ideas and confidence from other aspiring writers. Think of yourself as a writer and practice writing—every day if possible.'"
FCE_4,"On the last day of a difficult year, I was leaning against a pillar in the Baltimore railway station, waiting for the 10.10 train to Philadelphia. There were more people than I expected. The station, usually airy and clean, felt crowded. Elderly couples with matching luggage filled the benches, and groups of college students sat on the floor with their bags. A grey-haired man was walking around, talking to strangers. He looked well-off: tanned skin, nice sweater, and a soft, beige coat. He approached a woman sitting alone and asked her something. Then he came to a girl standing near me. She had long blond hair, and I thought I wouldn't mind talking to her. The man asked, ""Are you traveling to Philadelphia?"" ""Well, northbound, yes,"" she replied. ""But to Philadelphia?"" ""No, New York, but I'll be..."" ""Thanks, anyway,"" he said, moving to the next bench. Now he had my full attention. ""Ma'am,"" I heard him ask an old lady, ""are you traveling to Philadelphia?"" When she said, ""Wilmington,"" he just moved on to a couple with matching luggage. I straightened up and moved closer, pretending to look at the platform. I was going to Philadelphia. He could have asked me. I understood why he didn't; I probably seemed unreliable. He glanced at me quickly and then moved to the other end of the waiting area. He looked stressed. ""Please!"" he said to a woman reading a book. ""Tell me you're going to Philadelphia!"" She lowered her book. She was around thirty-five, older than me. A school-teacher type. ""Philadelphia?"" she said. ""Why, yes, I am."" ""Then could I ask you a favor?"" I stopped a few feet away and looked at my left wrist, pretending to check a watch I didn't have. Even without looking, I sensed she was cautious. The man must have sensed it too, because he said, ""Nothing too difficult, I promise!"" They announced my train. People started moving toward Gate E, the older couples pulling their wheeled bags like pets on leashes. I heard the man talking. ""My daughter's flying out this afternoon for a study year abroad, leaving from Philadelphia. I put her on a train this morning, stopped for groceries, and came home to find my wife upset. My daughter forgot her passport and called from the station in Philadelphia, not knowing what to do."" The woman clucked sympathetically. I would have stayed quiet, waiting to see where this was going. ""So I told her to stay put. Stay right there in the station, I said, and I would get someone here to bring her passport."" A likely story! Why didn't he go himself if it was such an emergency? ""Why don't you go yourself?"" the woman asked. ""I can't leave my wife alone for that long. She's in a wheelchair."" This seemed like a poor excuse, in my opinion. It was more bad luck than one family should have. I glanced at them. The man was holding a packet, not a plain envelope, which would have been logical, but a padded envelope the size of a paperback book. Aha! Padded! So you couldn't feel the contents! And from where I stood, it looked stapled shut. Watch yourself, lady, I thought silently."
FCE_30,"**Gary and Me**

John Moore, a restaurant owner, writes about his relationship with his son Gary, who is a famous TV chef. John believes everyone gets a chance in life. Gary's chance was cooking, and John's was running a restaurant. When John found the opportunity to own a restaurant, he quickly went to see it. The place was in bad condition, but it was perfect for his plans. This reminded him of his childhood when his mother worked in a factory, and he felt lonely. He wanted to ensure his family had time together. His wife took care of the children and managed the accounts, while John ran the business. They lived above the restaurant and always made sure to have meals together. This approach benefited their children, Gary and Joe, making them confident. From a young age, they would talk to the regular customers, giving them a good start in life.

Gary was an energetic child. At seven, he once jumped into a corner bath like it was a swimming pool and knocked himself out. As he grew older, he worked for pocket money, starting with small jobs. By ten, he was in the kitchen every weekend, earning a lot of money at school. He was disciplined, often waking up before his father. In a family business, everyone helps, and it was nice to see Gary involved. Although Gary wasn't very academic, he excelled in the kitchen. By 15, he was as skilled as the adults working there and sometimes even took charge, preparing over a hundred meals. John knew Gary would pursue catering because he had a natural talent. When Gary needed work experience for school, John sent him to a friend's restaurant.

Recently, Gary started playing the drums and formed his own band. John wonders what will happen to Gary's cooking if his music career succeeds. John's advice to Gary is to focus on one goal, saying, ""If you chase two hares, you catch neither."" He also told Gary, ""If you want to achieve something, do it by 30. After that, it's too late."" Gary went to catering college at 17. On his first day, he and the other new students, who were usually beginners, were given a morning's work. Gary finished everything in an hour and helped others. John is proud of Gary's success with his TV cookery series. He always taught Gary that hard work is necessary because nothing is given for free. Gary saw his opportunity and took it. John reflects that if children remember even a little of what parents teach them, it's a success. Seeing Gary's actions and words, John feels Gary listened to him sometimes."
FCE_7,"Finding a good flat in Dublin at an affordable price was very difficult, like finding gold during a gold rush. The best way was through personal connections: if you knew someone who knew someone leaving a place, that often worked. But if, like Jo, you had just arrived in Dublin, you had no personal contacts, no one to tell you about a vacant bedsit at the end of the month. So, it meant staying in a hostel and searching. For Jo, Dublin was a big unknown. She felt she was stepping into the unknown when she took the train to work there. She didn't question why she was going. Everyone she knew from school assumed she would go. Who would stay in a small, remote town? That's all she had heard for years. They all wanted to leave, see some life, and have a real existence. Some of her classmates went to towns like Ennis or Limerick, where a relative would help them settle. But from Jo's year, no one else was going to Dublin. She was going alone. Jo's mother thought it would be great if she stayed permanently in the hostel, which was run by nuns, so she would be safe. Her father hoped they kept the place warm, as hostels were known for being cold. Jo's sisters, who worked as waitresses in a hotel, thought she was crazy to stay a whole week in a hostel. But Jo didn't know they were all still thinking and talking about her as she answered an ad for a flat in Ringsend. It said, 'Own room, own television, share kitchen, bathroom.' It was very close to the post office where she worked and seemed too good to be true. Please, please let it be nice, let them like me, let it not be too expensive! There wasn't a queue for this one because it wasn't just 'Flat to Let', it was 'Third Girl Wanted'. The mention of 'own television' made Jo wonder if it might be too fancy for her, but the house didn't look intimidating. It was an ordinary red-brick terraced house with a basement. But the flat wasn't in the basement; it was upstairs. A cheerful-looking girl with a college scarf, obviously a failed applicant, was coming down the stairs. 'Desperate place,' she said to Jo. 'They're both awful. Common as dirt.' 'Oh,' said Jo and continued climbing. 'Hello,' said the girl with 'Nessa' on her T-shirt. 'Did you see that snobby girl leaving? I can't stand that type.' 'What did she do?' asked Jo. 'Do? She didn't have to do anything. She just looked around, made a face, giggled, and said, ""Is this all there is? Oh dear, oh dear,"" in a posh accent. We wouldn't have her here, would we, Pauline?' Pauline wore a very colorful shirt, almost as bright as her hair. Pauline was a punk, Jo noted with surprise. She had seen punks on O'Connell Street but hadn't talked to one before. 'I'm Jo, I work in the post office and I called.' Nessa said they were just about to have a mug of tea. She brought out three mugs; one had 'Nessa', one had 'Pauline', and the other had 'Other' written on it. 'We'll get your name put on if you come to stay,' she said kindly."
FCE_43,"**Behind the Dolphin's Smile**

People love dolphins. We enjoy watching them in marinas, movies, and TV shows. However, the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society says dolphins are in trouble. Mark Simmonds reports on their decline.

Dolphins are special to us. They are very intelligent, understand human emotions, and make us dream of freedom in the wild seas. TV shows like ""Flipper"" and ""Seaquest"" with Darwin have made us love them even more. But these happy images hide the truth about dolphins living in polluted and overfished seas today. The number of North Sea harbour porpoises, a type of dolphin, has dropped by up to 89,000.

You might think such popular animals are protected by law and live in special marine reserves. Unfortunately, this is not true, and the lack of protection could become a major wildlife disaster. There are forty different kinds of dolphins worldwide. In northern Europe, the most common are the striped, common, bottlenose dolphins, and the smaller harbour porpoise. The first two live far out at sea and are seen only in small groups, so we know little about them. The large grey bottlenoses and harbour porpoises used to be common near European coasts. Bottlenoses are very social and were found on the Channel coast and in British rivers like the Thames. Now, they are only found in the Moray Firth in Scotland and Cardigan Bay in Wales, and the few that remain show signs of stress.

Dolphins' complex habits make it hard to know why their numbers are falling. Overfishing, which is reducing fish stocks and threatening local fishing industries, also threatens dolphins. Porpoises need to find food quickly, and if fish are overfished in one area, they may not survive. They can also get caught in fishing nets, which they cannot see. Modern fishing uses large nets that float or are pulled quickly through the sea. Recently, many dead dolphins have washed up on French and Cornish beaches, showing marks and cuts from these nets.

Pollution is another problem. Waste in the sea can build up in dolphins' bodies. For example, pesticides dissolve in fat, so dolphins can absorb them, and they accumulate in their bodies. Female dolphins then produce milk with high pesticide levels, passing the poison to their young. There is a case of a young dolphin dying from its mother's milk.

Perhaps the most debated threat is human disturbance. Dolphins live in groups and use sound to understand their world. In the sea, noise pollution from ships and oil wells travels four times better than in the air. This might disturb dolphins in ways we do not yet understand."
FCE_51,"Title: 'GETTING FIT'

Exercise is important for your mind, body, and spirit. It helps you stay balanced when life feels chaotic. You might be tired of hearing about fitness, but it's truly beneficial. There are many reasons to exercise and very few reasons not to. Exercise improves muscle tone and quickly changes your body shape. It increases muscle strength and helps you maintain good posture, which is how you hold your body when sitting or standing. It prevents muscle imbalances that can cause injuries. Exercise also improves specific areas like thighs, stomach, and upper arms. It benefits your heart, lungs, and blood circulation.

You might have heard these reasons before and feel bored, but here's something to consider: exercise can reduce depression and tiredness, help you sleep better, and manage stress. It can also help with certain medical conditions. These reasons should convince you that exercise is good for you. Common sense also tells us this.

There are many types of exercise you can try, like aerobics, calisthenics, jogging, and weight training. However, be careful not to train too hard or with too much weight, as this can cause injury. Start slowly and consult your doctor if you're unsure about what's best for you.

Good posture is crucial for improving your body shape. A stiff or sagging body not only looks unattractive but also lacks energy and may have minor health issues. If you tend to slouch, imagine a helium balloon pulling the top of your head up. This will help lift your chest for better breathing and make your body look slimmer. When standing with a balanced chest, you should be able to see your ankles.

Stretching improves flexibility and movement, helps maintain correct posture, and prevents muscle injuries. Doing it four or five times a week will make your body more flexible and fit. Stretching should be a key part of your exercise routine and should be done slowly and carefully.

The best exercise routine includes a good warm-up, stretching exercises, an energetic workout, and a cool-down period."

FCE_14,"**The Netball Captain**

In our series on women in sport, Suzie Ellis met with England's netball captain, Kendra Slawinski. Kendra is leading England's netball team. When I met her, she was having a typical day leading up to next month's World Championships: teaching at a local school and then training in a supermarket car park. I was surprised about her training place. 'Don't people look at you strangely?' I asked. 'I'm too focused on my movements and my feet to notice,' she said. 'I might see cars slow down from the corner of my eye, but that's it.'

'My whole life now is about being at my best for the Championships,' says Kendra. She follows a strict schedule to get fit. These are her fourth World Championships, and they will be the biggest ever, with 27 countries participating. 'We'll have home support, which is special,' she says. 'It's important to improve netball's reputation in this country. Playing here means more pressure. A home crowd will have expectations and give more support. People will expect us to start with a good game.'

Their first game is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. 'As far as I know, we have always beaten them, but they'll be exciting to play. They have lots of ability.' The England team is currently ranked fourth in the world. But, as Kendra points out, the World Championships will be tough. 'You have to push yourself to play each day, there's no rest between games like in a series. You can still win a series if you lose the first game, but the Championships are different because there's only one chance.'

In the fifteen years since she has been playing at the top level, the sport has become harder and faster. On court, players are more aggressive. 'You don't do all that training not to come out a winner,' says Kendra. 'But once the final whistle blows, you become a different person. We're all friendlier after the game.'

Netball is also taking a more scientific approach to fitness testing. 'It is essential that we all think and train like world-class players,' says Kendra. 'As captain, I think it's important to have a strong mental attitude and lead by example. I see my role as supporting and encouraging the rest of the team.'

'From the very beginning, my netball career has always been carefully planned,' she says. 'I decided some time ago that this competition would be the end of my playing career.' She will likely coach young players in the future, but right now, she is focused on her last big event. As she leads her team in the opening candlelight ceremony, she might have a tear in her eye. Her loyal supporters will be with her every step of the way."
FCE_63,"**In Hot Water**

Rachel Mills is a scientist who spends a lot of time at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She teaches and researches marine geochemistry, which means she studies the chemical processes in the sea. Rachel is a lecturer at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she isn't teaching, she goes into a steel vehicle, about the size of a small car, to dive three kilometers down into the Atlantic Ocean to study underwater volcanoes.

Inside the vehicle, space is very limited. Rachel can reach out and touch the two pilots. They are used to these conditions, which mean they can't stand up or move much, and they must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can last for 16 hours: three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours gathering rock and water samples, and then three hours to return to the surface.

If there is a problem and they need to get to the top quickly, they can hit a panic button. This releases a small escape vessel that goes rapidly to the surface, like a ping-pong ball in water. No one has tested it yet, but Rachel thinks it wouldn't be a pleasant journey.

Rachel didn't know how she would react the first time she climbed into the vehicle. It was on the deck of a ship, and she got in with an instructor. He explained the emergency procedures, including what to do if the pilot had a heart attack. They were testing her to see how she would react in such a small space. Now, Rachel has made six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian crew. They went to a site five days' sail west of the Canary Islands in the Atlantic. Here, on the ocean floor, is a large area of underwater volcanoes, with chimneys blowing out black smoke. The Russian team was dropping off scientific equipment to study the effect of a program that would make a hole 150 meters through a volcano.

When she isn't at sea, Rachel is in her office at the Oceanography Centre, Southampton. Two-thirds of her salary comes from teaching, which she loves, but she does it so she can continue her research into the ""black smokers."" This is another name for underwater volcanoes, where water comes out of the rock and looks like black smoke. It pours out at a rate of one meter per second and at a temperature of 350 degrees.

The only time Rachel was frightened was when she first went down with the Americans. They were towing equipment on a 50-meter rope when suddenly there was an explosion. There was a loud bang as the shock waves hit their vehicle, and Rachel thought, ""I'm going to die."" They stared at each other in silence, waiting. When nothing happened, they couldn't believe it. The relief was incredible—they were still alive!

Diving to the deepest part of the ocean is such an adventure. Every time Rachel looks out of the porthole and sees those chimneys, she feels a sense of wonder. She is at the bottom of the sea, and no one else on this planet has ever seen them before. Rachel studied the black smokers for three years for her Ph.D. When she finally saw them for real, it was an amazing feeling."
FCE_56,"**Interview Tips**

First impressions are very important. Studies show that people form opinions about us in the first few minutes of meeting. They notice how we dress, our eye contact, body movements, how fast or slow we talk, our volume and tone of voice, and the words we use.

Mary Pearce studied to be a teacher. She says, ""I worked hard to earn my degree. When I graduated, I was very confident."" She applied for a job at a nearby primary school and got an interview with the Head Teacher. ""I noticed a small hole in my jacket that morning,"" she recalls. ""I would have changed, but I knew it would make me late, and I always think it's important to be on time."" Mary didn't get the job. Her friend, who also teaches at the school, told her the Head Teacher said, ""If someone doesn't take the time to present her best image at an interview, what kind of teacher is she going to be?""

Simon Grant, a hotel manager, says, ""Interviewees who look like they care about themselves are more likely to care about their jobs. People think it's what's inside that counts, but in an interview, you should aim to come across in the best possible way."" Many people ignore the importance of having a professional image. For example, Janet Goodwood worked for ten years as an administrative assistant in a large accounting firm. When the office manager retired, she applied for the position but wasn't even given an interview. ""I thought it was a mistake, so I asked the Director of Personnel what had happened,"" she says. ""He told me I didn't fit the image of an office manager. He suggested I improve my wardrobe before I applied again for promotion. I was shocked. I do a very good job, and the way I dress shouldn't make any difference.""

Movement and gestures also influence an interviewer's first impression. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian found that 7% of any message about our feelings and attitudes comes from the words we use, 38% from voice, and a surprising 55% from our facial expressions. When our facial expressions and words send different messages, the listener will believe the non-verbal message more. So make sure your words match your body language. Mixed messages will only confuse the interviewer.

It is also important not to appear too desperate for the job or too eager to please. When Sheila Rice, a marketing specialist, applied for a promotion, her interview went so well she was offered the job on the spot. ""I was delighted,"" she recalls. ""But I reacted with too much enthusiasm. Once the boss sensed how excited I was, he knew I wasn't going to turn him down. Consequently, he offered me a lower salary than I'd hoped for. I'm sure I could have got more if I had managed to control my excitement.""

Finally, what we say and how we say it will contribute to the success of an interview. David Artesio, the manager of an employment agency, suggests that it's a good idea to learn about the company before you go for an interview. ""The annual report, for example, will tell you about areas of company involvement. Mention an area that interests you during the interview. This will give a positive note and show your interest in the company."" Business consultant Marian Woodall suggests you have a few questions ready and avoid speaking in long, confused sentences. As she puts it, ""Poor communicators talk in paragraphs. Successful communicators talk in short sentences and even in highlighted points."""

**The Farmer**

Matt Froggatt used to work as an insurance agent in London, but now he runs a sheep farm. ""After 14 years in business, the City became less exciting and more of a grind. I hadn't planned to leave for another five or ten years, but then I was made redundant unexpectedly. The pay-off wasn't great, but it was enough to start the farm. My big break came when I met the head chef of a local hotel with one of the top 20 hotel restaurants in the country. By supplying them, my reputation grew, and now I also sell meat by mail order. I'm glad I'm not stuck in an office anymore, but it's surprising how little has changed: I still work 80- to 90-hour weeks and sell a product.""

**The Painter**

Ron Ablewhite was a manager in advertising but now earns a living as an artist. ""Painting started as a hobby, but I found it more exciting than my job. Taking redundancy to become an artist seemed logical. The career counsellor I spoke to was surprised because most people in their mid-forties need to return to work quickly for financial reasons. But we married young, and our children didn't need our support. Moving to the north of England was a leap into the unknown. We left our friends, but our friendships have survived the distance, and many visit us now.""

**The Hatmaker**

After working as a company lawyer for five years, Katherine Goodison started her own business making hats in her London flat. ""Being a lawyer was fun and well-paid, but the hours were terrible. I didn't want to become a senior partner and work even more hours, so I left. Some people thought I'd get bored, but that hasn't happened. The secret is having deadlines. In fashion, there are always collections and seasons, so you need a strict schedule. I'm happier and less stressed now. I do miss socializing with colleagues, though. What I love about this job is being fully responsible for the product. If I do a bad job, it's on me. You care more when your name is on the promotional material.""

**The Masseur**

Paul Drinkwater worked in finance for 16 years before becoming a masseur at the Life Centre in London. ""I started in financial markets at 22, setting up deals. I liked the adrenaline but didn't find the work rewarding. I almost got made redundant in 1989, but I resigned and traveled for a year instead. During that year, I explored what I wanted to do. I was interested in health, so I visited top gymnasiums and talked to the owners. I knew I needed qualifications to change careers, so I took various massage courses. Then I got part-time work at the Life Centre. I have no regrets. I used to feel out of control, but now I have peace of mind and control over my future. That's the best part."""
FCE_6,"**Dedicated to Their Sports: Four Young Sports Stars Talk About Their Lives**

**A. Darius (Runner)**  
I've always loved sports. I tried many, but I was best at football and athletics. At 14, I had a chance to join a professional football club, but I chose athletics instead. My proudest moment was competing for my country in the youth team and winning a medal. Unfortunately, it didn't get much media attention, which was disappointing because I hoped for sponsorship to help with training costs. I train at home during winter and then go to Florida for three weeks before the season starts. It's fun because of the great facilities and nightlife, but I have to be disciplined. If friends invite me out before training, I have to say no. I wish I didn't have to, but dedication is important in this sport. My main goal is to reach the next Olympics, which would be amazing.

**B. Gabriel (Surfer)**  
The surfing community is small, so you often meet the same people at competitions. Professional surfers are serious, and the best waves are often at dawn, so you have to avoid late-night parties. I don't mind that much, but I do miss sleeping in. It's worth it, though, because without dedication, I might not have won the National Championships last year. After a win, I make sure to have a big night out, and if there's prize money, I treat myself to a nice trip. The sacrifices are worth it because winning the championship led to me presenting a surfing series on TV. I guess I'm a bit of a celebrity now.

**C. Dieter (Yacht Racer)**  
With five guys on a boat, we have a lot of fun. We're traditional and always celebrate a win in style. Some say we act childishly when we're out, but we don't seek media attention. Reporters often care more about our celebrations than our race results. I'm away for eight months a year, so it's nice to come back and hang out with friends from different backgrounds. You can't focus on the sport all the time—it's not healthy. I'm known in the sailing world, but I've only been recognized in public a few times. I'd hate to be a celebrity. I get nice letters asking for signed pictures, and I reply to each one, even if it takes time.

**D. Tomas (Tennis Player)**  
It's great to feel the crowd's support when I walk on court. At the last tournament, it got a bit crazy with people crowding around. Still, I enjoy being recognized by fans when I'm out shopping. It has downsides, though. My last girlfriend didn't like it when I got too much attention from female fans. Tennis players travel a lot, and that's why we broke up, I think. It was hard, but you have to make sacrifices in any sport; you have to be serious and professional. It doesn't bother me much. I'm happy to focus on my game now and enjoy other things in life after I retire, which happens early in this sport."
FCE_33,"Title: Shopping with Children

Shopping in supermarkets with children can be very challenging for parents. One mother describes it as ""absolute murder"" because her children want everything they see, like sugary cereals, Disney videos, or comics. She can't afford all these things and feels guilty if she gives in to their demands. She also feels bad for saying no all the time and gets stressed even before leaving home. She tries to avoid taking them shopping but worries they won't learn how to make their own choices.

Research shows that children ask for something every two minutes during a supermarket trip. Over £150 million is spent each year on advertising aimed directly at children, mostly on TV. This amount is expected to grow, and supermarkets are where this advertising is most effective. Children often don't understand why their parents can't buy everything they want, and arguments about health don't seem convincing compared to the appealing ads.

Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, though these ideas aren't always correct. It's good for parents and children to talk about food because if children only learn from TV ads, they get a biased view. Parents feel frustrated because they have to compete with advertisers and often end up disappointing their children.

The Independent Television Commission, which oversees TV ads, doesn't allow advertisers to tell children to ask their parents to buy things. However, as Dibb notes, the goal of advertising is to persuade people to buy, so the effect is the same.

Deciding which of their children's requests to agree to or refuse can be stressful for parents. One mother says she talks a lot with her children about food and advertisements, which has helped reduce conflicts in the supermarket. Her son is now critical of ads, and they spend time looking at product labels together.

Parents admit they are sometimes inconsistent in their responses. Mike, a father of two, says he refuses to buy sweets for his son because they are unhealthy, even though he buys treats for himself. He finds it hard to be consistent and says his decisions depend on his mood.

Supermarkets could help reduce conflicts by removing sweets from checkout areas or providing play areas for children. Although parents might spend less without their children, the idea of shopping without their demands could attract more customers."
FCE_20,"**Five-star luxury meets modern technology**

The five-star Merrion Hotel has just opened in Dublin. It took nearly two years to convert four large 18th-century houses into this hotel. This transformation allowed the installation of the latest technology for both staff and guests. General Manager Peter MacCann wants his staff to know guests by name, but he uses the hotel's computer system to remember guests' preferences. This system, which cost £250,000, helps treat returning guests in a special way, as expected in a five-star hotel. MacCann is very pleased with its efficiency. For example, if a guest requests certain music CDs during their first stay, those CDs will be ready for them on their next visit. This is possible because of the guest-history feature that records preferences.

Room temperature is a common complaint among hotel guests worldwide. The Merrion has a high-tech system to control this. Guests can adjust the temperature within three degrees of the normal 18°C, and the front desk can set it between 14°C and 25°C. However, guests are most impressed by the technology in their rooms, especially business travelers. MacCann expects 65% of his business to come from this market. To meet their needs, the hotel has put a business center in each room. Every room has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that also works as a photocopier and printer, and a video-conferencing facility.

Technology changes quickly, so the hotel has prepared for future upgrades. Extra cables are in place for new advancements. TVs are rented, not bought, so they can be easily updated. DVD recorders can also be upgraded when needed. Despite all this modern equipment, MacCann ensures that guests do not feel overwhelmed by technology. The 145 bedrooms are large, well-furnished, comfortable, and welcoming. The hotel also has a swimming pool, gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a beautiful garden.

As with all luxury hotels, the food must be excellent. Chef Patrick Guilbaud, whose Dublin restaurant already had two Michelin stars, moved his restaurant to the Merrion. This move benefits both him and the hotel. He designed a new, modern kitchen and enjoys better parking facilities. The hotel benefits by offering a popular and successful dining option without financial risks. With the help of technology and a skilled staff, the Merrion is set to succeed."

Emma Marsden asked six women who live life to the fullest to share their secrets.

**A. Jeanette Kupfermann, Journalist and Author:**  
""I think it's excitement. I need to be doing something challenging. When I'm learning something new, I feel a lot of energy. Anything with rhythm gives me energy too—right now, I'm learning flamenco dancing. Dance is wonderful, very expressive, and energizing. I think you can feel tired if you're bored or feel life is pointless. Being effective in the world, even in a small way, gives you energy.""

**B. Linda Kelsey, Magazine Editor:**  
""I have a lot of work, but I enjoy it all—I love being at work, it isn't a chore. If you enjoy something, it doesn't make you feel down, even if you're tired. I need a good amount of sleep, so when I get it, I feel great. When I only get six hours of sleep a night, I feel a bit off. I know exercise gives me energy, but it's hard to find the energy to do it! I do a yoga class once a week before work and try to do a workout tape at home. But if I've exercised, my mood improves a lot. I feel low in the office between 3 and 5 in the afternoon, so I think it's good to eat something then.""

**C. Annie Nightingale, Disc Jockey:**  
""I don't eat healthily to get my energy—I think it's natural enthusiasm and being positive. I can't stand people with negative attitudes. I'm quite naive—I think we should all enjoy our lives and seize the moment. Enjoyment comes first. You have to achieve things and set goals. I enjoy what I do, and the last two years have been very exciting. In my job, there are lots of lively young people, and you can't help but be affected by that. I love rushing around for work, having a busy life. I'm very sociable. I enjoy taking photos, but I'm not sure if I'm good at it. I rush to get them developed and can't wait to see them. I've also started writing words for imaginary songs—it's just for fun and a good way to relax my mind when I'm traveling.""

**D. Floella Benjamin, Author and Children's TV Presenter:**  
""My energy comes from the things I do and enjoy. I believe in what I'm doing, both at work and at home with my family, and I think being positive about life helps. That's why I love working with kids—they give so much and have a natural resilience. Energy is like a natural chemical, triggered by communicating with others—just try smiling at people and feel the thrill when they smile back. It's much better than feeling sorry for yourself. Although I try to eat healthily and don't smoke or drink, I don't have an exercise plan. The most energetic I get is running around and playing with the kids.""

**E. Deborah Moggach, Author and Playwright:**  
""What I love doing more than anything is making a garden out of a wasteland. I did that once. The garden was solid concrete—I broke up all the concrete and added lots of soil. It was better than any workout or tennis. Another thing that gives me energy is knowing someone wants to read what I'm writing—I find it hard to write without an audience. I also like sneaking into a farmer's land or a wood. If I'm caught, I say, 'Oh, what a wonderful wood, I didn't know it was private property,' and so on. I like it because it's childlike.""

**F. Katherine Monblot, Therapist:**  
""I believe you must have an interest in and respect for what you do in life. I like to take risks and get bored quickly, which keeps me motivated. Doing things you don't want to do wears you out. I used to be on various committees and resented the demands they made on my time. You only have a certain amount of energy, so direct it into the things that are most important to you."""
FCE_45,"**ICE SKATING**

Ice skating has been around for thousands of years. Archaeologists have found skates made from animal bones. These bone skates were used until iron was introduced in Scandinavia around 200 AD. In Scandinavia, the upper classes considered skating an important skill. In the early 1900s, skating was elegant and reserved. However, at the 1924 Winter Olympics, 11-year-old Sonja Henie brought a more athletic style, making skating more popular. Today, skating combines art and athletics, making it both graceful and physically challenging.

For beginners, balance and control are crucial, and speed comes with practice. Your body position is important for balance. Keep your legs slightly bent and knees bent to center your body weight; this means leaning slightly forward. Relaxation is very important in skating. To start, your heels should almost touch, and your feet should point outwards. Push forward with your back foot and make a small movement with the other foot. It seems simple, right? As you practice, you can slowly make your movements longer.

Learning how to fall is one of the first skills for skaters. Even the best professionals fall. To avoid injury, try to stay relaxed when you fall. This reduces the impact when you hit the ice. To get up, use your hands to kneel, then stand. Once you can move confidently on the ice, you can try different styles like figure skating, freestyle, distance, speed, and pair skating. The best way to start is by learning figure skating and then basic freestyle. Most ice rinks offer guidance to help you learn the basic moves, and soon you can try turns, jumps, and spins.

If you watch good or professional skaters, you will see how relaxed they are and how smoothly they move. To achieve this, you should regularly practice exercises. Skating with a stiff body can be dangerous, so warm-up exercises should include those for the legs, back, and shoulders, focusing on the ankles and knees. After a long or intense session, do the same exercises to prevent stiffness.

Skating improves balance, coordination, relaxation, and movement. It also benefits heart and lung health and strengthens the body. Combined with swimming or jogging, it offers a great program for overall health and fitness."

Seeing a talented child win a medal can be very emotional. Julia Gregson spoke to three young stars and their mothers about the joys and challenges in their lives.

**A. Annika Reeder, 15,** won a gold medal in gymnastics at the Commonwealth Games. She wants to become a physiotherapist and compete in the next Olympics. ""The work is very hard right now. I don't have time to watch TV, hang out with friends, or do much besides gymnastics and school. I try to take each training day as it comes. When I'm extremely tired, my coach sometimes gives me a day off, but usually, I just keep going. You can't take too many days off, or you get stiff.""

**B. Annika's mother** says, ""Annika showed great potential from a young age. I've seen parents try to push their kids, and it doesn't work. To perform at Annika's level, you have to want it yourself. People often say we've given up a lot, but they don't see what the sport has given us. We love it and what it's done for Annika. Before gymnastics, she was a shy girl who sucked her thumb and hid behind me. Now, she's met people from all over the world and gained confidence.""

**C. Sarah Stokes** started show-jumping at ten and has won the British National Championship. ""It's good my parents like show-jumping because they train me and take me everywhere in the horse box. Shows last from one to five days. I never get tired of it—I love the excitement and fun. Even without my parents, I would do it because I'm determined. I'm glad they are happy when I win, but I'm not doing it for them. My goal this year is to qualify for the British young riders (under-18) team. My big dream is to win a gold medal at the Olympics.""

**D. Sarah's mother** says, ""Sarah's passion for horses started when she was 1. At 5, she would get up early to exercise her pony. To qualify for major shows, you have to compete all over England. To save money, we sleep in the horse box. Sarah is well-organized and 100% happy on a horse. Watching your child succeed at something they love is unbeatable.""

**E. Jane McShane, 10,** is Britain's Under-14 Chess Champion. ""Tournaments are really friendly. I know everyone, and it's fun. When I play, I don't concentrate much. I should, but I just look around and don't think too hard. I'm not worried about getting a big head; I don't talk about my success at school. I don't like being embarrassed.""

**F. Jane's mother** says, ""Jane played her first game at 5. My father suggested it, and she loved it from the start. By the end of that day, she knew all the moves, and by 6, she was beating adults. Of course, I'm pleased when she wins, but if she wanted to quit tomorrow, I wouldn't stop her. I don't want to discourage her because she's exceptional. If she has this gift, she should reach her potential."""
FCE_29,"Text: 'It's true - we're all getting taller Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy after school. 'What do you want to be?' asked the teacher. 'The flagpole on a ship?' The teacher had a point because Chris, even at fourteen, was almost two metres tall. Today, at 228 cm, he is Britain's tallest man. Every decade, the average height of people in Europe increases by another centimetre. Each year, more very tall people are born. Interestingly, this doesn't mean we are creating a new super race. Instead, we are returning to our original size from the time of the cavemen. We are now overcoming the effects of generations of poor diet, with significant results. 'We are only now beginning to reach our true potential,' says palaeontologist Professor Chris Stringer. 'We are becoming like the Cro-Magnons again - the people who lived on this planet 40,000 years ago.' For most of human history, our ancestors got their food from many sources: women gathered herbs, fruits, and berries, while men hunted animals occasionally. This lifestyle is still followed by the few remaining tribes of hunter-gatherers. One study found that they based their diet on 85 different wild plants. Then, about 9,000 years ago, agriculture was invented, which had serious consequences. Most of the planet's green areas have been taken over by farmers, and now just three carbohydrate-rich plants - wheat, rice, and maize - provide more than half of the calories consumed by humans today. This poor diet has negatively affected human health and physique. Over the centuries, we have lived on soups, porridges, and breads that have left us underfed and underdeveloped. In one study in Ohio, scientists found that when people started growing corn, healthy hunter-gatherers became sickly, underweight farmers. Tooth decay increased, as did diseases. Far from being a blessing of the New World, corn was a public health disaster, according to some anthropologists. However, agriculture spread because a piece of farmed land could support ten times the number of people who had previously lived off it as hunter-gatherers. The fact that most people relying on this system are poorly nourished and stunted has only recently been addressed, even by the world's wealthier nations. Only in Europe, the US, and Japan are diets now reflecting the richness of our ancestors' diets. As a result, the average man in the US is now 179 cm, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm. It is a positive trend, though not without its own problems. Heights may have increased, but the world has not changed much. A standard bed-length has remained at 190 cm since 1860. Even worse, leg-room in planes and trains seems to have decreased, while clothes manufacturers are constantly having to update their range of products. The question is: where will it all end? We cannot grow forever. We must have some programmed upper limit. But what is it? According to Robert Fogel, of University, it could be as much as 193 cm - and we are likely to reach it sometime this century. However, scientists add one note of caution. Individuals may be growing taller because of better nutrition, but as a species, we are actually shrinking. During the last ice age, 10,000 years ago, humans were slightly rounder and taller - an evolutionary response to the cold. (Large, round bodies are best at keeping in heat.) Since the climate warmed, we appear to have become slightly thinner and smaller, even when properly fed. And as the planet continues to heat up, we may shrink even further. In other words, the growth of human beings could be offset by global warming.'"
FCE_57,"**Studio Audiences: What’s it Like?**

Have you ever wondered what it's like to be in the audience when a TV show is being filmed? Cosmo Landesman explored this experience. Studio audiences are a regular part of TV production, but they remain a mystery to many of us. When we see them excited on game shows, we might wonder: who are these people?

Studio audiences are often seen as the least prestigious of all live entertainment audiences. Some people in the TV industry even look down on them, treating them poorly. I used to think that studio audiences were just people eager for a brief moment of fame. However, there is no typical studio audience. They come from all walks of life, including different classes, jobs, and income levels. TV shows try to attract various types of people for different programs.

For those of us who enjoy watching TV at home, it can be hard to understand why someone would want to watch a show in a studio. Why go through the trouble of getting tickets, traveling, and sitting for hours in an uncomfortable studio when you can watch the same show at home? One idea is that people hope to appear on TV, even if just for a moment. I didn’t believe this until I met Angela, who said she came for the chance to be on TV. Another reason might be curiosity about what happens behind the scenes. But the most common reason I heard was simply that a friend gave them a ticket.

Most of us have never been in a studio audience, but we think we know what it’s like. You imagine sitting tightly packed with strangers, following signs that tell you when to clap or laugh. This might be true for some shows, but not all. A studio manager said, ""We always hope a show is good enough not to need these signs.""

Is there a real difference between watching a show in a studio and watching it at home? For Claire, being in a studio is ""more exciting,"" and Charlotte enjoyed feeling involved with live TV. ""Last year I saw my favorite comedian. Watching him live was different from seeing him on TV at home,"" she said. Personally, I missed seeing the live actors because my view was blocked. The opening scenes were so far away that I ended up watching them on a studio monitor.

Going to a studio might not be the best way to watch TV, but that’s not the main point. For most of the audience, it was simply a fun and free night of entertainment."
FCE_9,"**Favourite Places**

**Bruce**  
I don't like landscapes that are completely wild. I find the human element important. It's the same when I travel abroad. I am attracted to lovely villages with old temples, not empty deserts. When I was eight, I went to school in England. On Saturdays, I would cycle to the village of Lastingham in its beautiful valley. Cycling was a way to escape school. I loved exploring the bleak hilltops, the sheltered valleys, and old villages. Coming from Scotland, I found the landscape familiar yet different, and I still visit today. I used to write about my adventures in my private diary. In a way, that was my first attempt at travel writing, which later became my career.

**Sophia**  
There is a miniature railway that goes from Hythe to Dungeness, run by amateurs. I always travel first class as it doesn't cost much more than the regular fare. The scenery is not spectacular. The train moves across Romney Marsh with its sheep and alongside a canal. But there is one part of the journey I always look forward to - when our miniature world takes a detour through back gardens. For a few moments, we passengers see people at random points in their day, making a cup of tea, doing the washing up, unfolding a deckchair. I see myself in their eyes, a woman in a tiny train carriage, looking into other people's homes. It's the ordinariness of the landscape that attracts me. Just fields, sheep, and a distant grey sea. That makes me look more closely, to search for something that opens my eyes.

**Matthew**  
The Hartland Peninsula is a remote and beautiful coast. The beaches are hard to reach and scattered with rocks, so there are not many crowds here. They attract a few brave surfers, but most visitors prefer to reflect on the majesty of the sea. The coast, which faces the Atlantic, is known for shipwrecks. There are coast walks you can combine with trips inland up beautiful damp valleys, full of oak trees, ferns, and wildflowers. We stay in modest self-catering accommodation with a family who have some property in the village of Southole.

**Annette**  
My favourite place in England is the Trough of Bowland, a landscape of wide-open moorland perfect for hiking. There are not many residents and not many visitors either. It's an unknown corner, empty and remote, and I like the feeling of space. I discovered the area by chance when I was a student, and since then I've made an annual visit, either alone, with my boyfriend, or now with my son. It has changed little since my first visit. Having a child makes these visits more special. It makes me sad that he's growing up in an urban environment.

**James**  
I bought Glenthorne, my favourite house in Britain. It was about finding pure peace and reconnecting with my English roots and coming home. I grew up in what is now known as Sri Lanka, but at the age of twelve, I went to school in Devon, in the west of England. I used to cycle around the moors and village backstreets. We had a story about a place we would never cycle past: if you went down the driveway, you'd never return. That place was Glenthorne. It's the place of my dreams. It's a magical, secluded, romantic house. You can't hear anything except the sea, wind, and birds."
FCE_42,"**HAPPY HUNTING GROUND**

We are a family that loves animals and enjoys being around them. One afternoon, my daughter called me at work to tell me she had found a wonderful pine snake. ""Can we keep him?"" she asked. I agreed, but only for one night. We had a special tank ready for such temporary guests, and one night was enough to admire them and look them up in our natural history book.

I got home late and quickly started boiling a pot of water when I heard screams from my sons' bedroom: ""Oh, Mother! Help! Do something!"" I rushed in to find Domino, our cat, with Bianca, a white mouse given to me as a Mother's Day gift, in his mouth. Domino was running around the room, trying to find a way to enjoy his catch, while avoiding the children’s waving arms. I jumped into the chaos and tripped, landing on the floor. As I thought about stopping Domino, I noticed the snake was escaping from its tank.

The room was a mess of cat, mouse, kids, and snake, with the dog barking loudly. I quickly turned off the boiling pot in the kitchen and returned to the chaos. I managed to grab Domino by the tail and rescued the mouse, which was unharmed. Interestingly, this mouse was caught by the cat three more times but eventually died of old age.

Feeling confident after saving the mouse, I turned my attention to the snake. It was not easy to handle. I sat on the floor like a snake-charmer, trying to calm it down. Slowly, the snake relaxed, and I carefully lifted it. I took it to the end of the garden and pointed it towards a tree, hoping it would choose to live there. But when I let go of its head, it slid over my shoulders like a shawl, seeming comfortable.

We stood there in the evening light, my four children, the snake, and I. My eldest, DJ, broke the silence with a scientific observation: ""You know what it is, Mum? You're nice and warm, and the shed isn't."" We gently encouraged the snake to move on, and it slowly climbed up the wall and disappeared over the roof. As the last bit of its tail vanished, my three-year-old, Clay, summed it up for all of us: ""Boy, that was one big snake!"""
FCE_59,"Text: 'Drop me a line! In our fast world of phones, fax machines, and computers, the old-fashioned art of letter writing is at risk of disappearing. Yet, for me, receiving a letter is special in a way that no other form of communication can match. There is the excitement of its arrival, the pleasure of seeing who it is from, and the enjoyment of reading it. Letter writing has been part of my life for as long as I can remember. It probably started with the little notes I would write to my mother. My mother also always insisted I write my own thank-you letters for Christmas and birthday presents. It didn't matter how short or untidy they were, as long as they were letters. When I left home at 18 to study medicine in London, I would write once a week, and so would my mother. Occasionally, my father would write, and it was always a joy to receive his long, funny letters. Most of the letters from home were about everyday events concerning my parents and their friends. Of course, we also made phone calls, but it is the letters I remember most. There were also letters from my boyfriends. In my youth, I seemed to attract people who had to work or study away, and I could only stay in touch by writing. But instead of harming the relationships, letter writing seemed to improve them. I found that I could often express myself more easily in writing than by talking. I love the letters that come with birthday or Christmas cards. Notes are appreciated, but how much better to have a year's supply of news! And it's even better when it's an airmail envelope with beautiful stamps. My overseas letters arrive from Mangala in Sri Lanka, from someone I trained with over 20 years ago, and I have a penfriend in Australia and another in Vancouver. Then there's the lady who writes to me from France. If we hadn't started talking in a restaurant on the way home from holiday, if my husband hadn't taken her photo, and if I hadn't asked her for her address, I would never have been able to write to her. More importantly, if she hadn't replied, we would be the poorer for it. As it is, we now have a regular correspondence. I can improve my French (she speaks no English); we have stayed at her home twice, and she has stayed with us. My biggest letter-writing success, however, came this summer when my family and I stayed with my American penfriend in Texas. We had been corresponding for 29 years but had never met. Everyone was amazed that a correspondence could last so long. The local press even considered the correspondence worth reporting on the front page. I am pleased that my children are continuing the tradition. Like my mother before me, I insist they write their own thank-you letters. My daughter writes me little letters, just as I did to my mother. She and my son have penfriends of their own in Texas, organized by my penfriend. I strongly urge readers not to let letter writing become another 'lost art'. '"
FCE_54,"**Careless Tourists Damage Ancient Alpine Rock Art**

Tens of thousands of ancient pictures carved into rocks at one of France's most important tourist sites are being gradually destroyed. Scientists and researchers are worried that the 36,000 drawings on rocks in Mont Bego in the French Alps are being damaged so quickly that they might not survive for future generations. The mountain, once a place for prayer and worship, has 4,000-year-old drawings on bare rock. These include pictures of cows with horns, cultivated fields, and various gods and goddesses. However, as more people visit the site, the pictures are being ruined by careless graffiti.

Jean Clottes, the chairman of the International Committee on Rock Art, says, ""People think that because the pictures have been there so long, they will always be there. But if the damage continues at this rate, there will be nothing left in 50 years."" He has seen tourists stepping on the drawings, wearing away the rock and the details of the artwork. Some visitors even break off parts to take home as souvenirs. ""When people can't take a good enough photograph, they rub the drawings to get a clearer picture,"" he said. ""The drawings are polished by the weather, and if the sun is shining and visitors can't see them properly, they simply rub and scrape them to make them look fresher.""

Other researchers describe how people arrive with long sticks with sharp ends to scratch their own drawings or even their names into the rocks. But experts disagree on the best way to protect the drawings. Henry de Lumley, director of the Museum of Natural History in Paris, believes the only way to save the site is to make the whole mountain a 'no-go' area, allowing the public to visit only on guided tours. Otherwise, he says, the site will be completely destroyed, and important research work will be reduced.

Clottes disagrees. ""The measure proposed by Henry de Lumley is the most severe, and while it is the most effective, it is also certain to bring about protests from people who live there,"" he said. ""The site was classified as a historic monument years ago by the Ministry of Culture, and we must do as much as possible to save what is there.""

David Lavergne, the regional architect, also wants to avoid closing the site. ""Henry de Lumley's idea isn't ideal,"" he said. ""Our department feels that the best solution is to let people look at the site, but because the area is very big, it is difficult to prevent visitors from damaging it. I would prefer that everyone was able to look at it, but the main problem is financial. We do not have the funds to employ the necessary number of guards. We may have to consider charging a fee. There seems to be no prospect of government funding.""

In Nice, Annie Echassoux, who also worked on researching the site, is worried that as the mountain becomes easier to reach—tourists can now avoid the three-and-a-half-hour walk by hiring vehicles—the damage will increase quickly. She thinks the only solution is to rope off the area and provide guides. ""You can't say the plan can't go ahead because there is no money,"" she said. ""That is not good enough. Money must be provided because the Ministry of Culture has classified this area as a historic site. If we don't take steps, we will be responsible for losing the drawings for the next generation."""
FCE_32,"Title: Shopping with Children

Shopping in supermarkets with children can be very challenging for parents. One mother describes it as ""absolute murder"" because her children want everything they see, like sugary cereals, Disney videos, or comics. She can't afford all these things and feels guilty if she gives in to their demands. She also feels bad for saying no all the time and gets stressed even before leaving home. She tries to avoid taking them shopping but worries they won't learn how to make their own choices.

Research shows that children ask for something every two minutes during a supermarket trip. Over £150 million is spent each year on advertising aimed directly at children, mostly on TV. This amount is expected to grow, and supermarkets are where this advertising is most effective. Children often don't understand why their parents can't buy everything they want, and arguments about health don't seem convincing compared to the appealing ads.

Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, though these ideas aren't always correct. It's good for parents and children to talk about food because if children only learn from TV ads, they get a biased view. Parents feel frustrated because they have to compete with advertisers and often end up disappointing their children.

The Independent Television Commission, which oversees TV ads, doesn't allow advertisers to tell children to ask their parents to buy things. However, as Dibb notes, the goal of advertising is to persuade people to buy, so the effect is the same.

Deciding which of their children's requests to agree to or refuse is a major source of stress for parents. One mother says she discusses food with her children and has taught her son to be critical of ads. They now have fewer conflicts in the supermarket because her children don't ask for things she won't buy.

Parents admit they are sometimes inconsistent in their responses. Mike, a father of two, says they refuse to buy sweets for their son because they're unhealthy, while they buy treats for themselves. He finds it hard to be consistent and says his decisions depend on his mood.

Supermarkets could help reduce conflicts by removing sweets from checkout areas or providing play areas for children. Although parents might spend less without their children, the idea of shopping without their demands could attract more customers."
FCE_65,"**Going up the wall**

In the past, climbers went to mountains. Now, challenging climbs can happen anywhere, indoors or outdoors. The crowd watches closely. High above them on the climbing wall, hanging upside down by just two fingers, is the French climber Francois Lombard. He is competing in the World Cup Climbing Championships at Birmingham's National Indoor Arena. This arena is more famous for the TV show Gladiators, but both the show and the climbing championships have one thing in common - The Wall. The fact that these events are possible is due to new and fast-developing technology.

Before the mid-1960s, climbers practiced on cliffs where there were many good climbing spots. In winter, they either braved the cold, went walking, or climbed on snow and ice in Scotland. As the sport grew, it became important for top climbers to stay fit. Since cliffs were unusable for much of the year, they used brick edges or stone buildings to train. This helped them keep their fingers strong and avoid boredom from not climbing.

Soon, many sports centers started building walls specifically for climbing, using bricks with special edges to hold onto. Many of these early walls followed the example of Don Robinson, a physical education teacher who, in the mid-1960s, built a climbing wall in a corridor at Leeds University. Robinson had the idea of setting natural rock in concrete blocks, which could be part of a wall. Many climbing walls like this were built in sports halls across the country during the 1970s, but they had design problems. Walls could only be vertical, while real cliffs have features like overhangs and angled rock slabs. Another issue was that once the walls were built, they couldn't be changed, and climbers would get bored with the same holds.

In 1985, a Frenchman named Francois Savigny developed a material that he shaped into forms like those found on cliffs. These could be attached to any wall and removed when climbers wanted a new challenge. French manufacturers also started experimenting with panels on a steel framework. Concrete was too heavy for overhanging walls without major construction, but steel frames could be set up anywhere as free-standing structures. A system of interchangeable fixtures gave climbers endless new holds."
FCE_61,"Text: 'So you want to be an actor? If you tell someone that you want to be an actor, they will probably say it is 'risky' very quickly. And acting is indeed a risky career. There are more actors than there are jobs for them. When you decide to become an actor, some people you thought were your friends might say you're crazy, but others might react differently. Everyone will give you different advice. But it is a personal choice, and only you can be responsible for achieving your dream. There are no easy ways to succeed - no exams to pass, and no guarantee that after your training you will succeed in the profession. It's all about luck and talent. However, there is a need for new faces and talent, and there is always the chance of excitement, glamour, and sometimes big rewards. People often ask me to define talent, which everyone is looking for. I think it is natural skill plus imagination - imagination is the hardest to judge. It also involves courage and belief in what you are doing and how you present it. Why do people want to act? It is often hard to explain why you want to act. In theatre, the important thing is the moment of connection between the actor and the audience. This connection is central to all acting and motivates actors. If you ask actors how they succeeded, they might just shrug. They don't know. They know some things about themselves and their techniques and others' techniques. But they take nothing for granted because they know they are only as good as their current job, and their fame might not last. Disappointment is the biggest enemy of an actor. Last month you might have been out of work, selling clothes or waitressing. Suddenly you are asked to audition for a role, but even if you want the job, you might not get it. So actors often don't talk about their chances. They find ways to protect themselves from the stress of competing for a role and the possibility of rejection. Nobody likes being rejected. And remember, the possibility of rejection is there from the moment you start auditioning professionally. You are saying you are available, willing, and hopefully talented enough for the job. And, in many ways, it's up to you, because if you don't care enough, no one else will care for you.'"

During the last ice age, 10,000 years ago, humans were slightly rounder and taller - an evolutionary response to the cold. (Large, round bodies are best at keeping in heat.) Since the climate warmed, we appear to have become slightly thinner and smaller, even when properly fed. And as the planet continues to heat up, we may shrink even further. In other words, the growth of human beings could be offset by global warming.'"

**The Farmer**

Matt Froggatt used to work as an insurance agent in London, but now he runs a sheep farm. ""After 14 years in business, the City became less exciting and more of a grind. I hadn't planned to leave for another five or ten years, but I was suddenly made redundant. The pay-off wasn't great, but it was enough to start the farm. My big break came when I met the head chef of a local hotel with one of the top 20 hotel restaurants in the country. By supplying them, my reputation grew, and now I also sell meat by mail order. I'm glad I'm not stuck in an office anymore, but it's surprising how little has changed: I still work 80- to 90-hour weeks and sell a product.""

**The Painter**

Ron Ablewhite was a manager in advertising but now earns a living as an artist. ""Painting started as a hobby, but I found it more exciting than my job. Taking redundancy to become an artist seemed logical. The career counsellor I spoke to was surprised because most people in their mid-forties need to get back to work quickly for financial reasons. But we married young, and our children didn't need our support. Moving to the north of England was a leap into the unknown. We left our friends, but our friendships have survived the distance, and many visit us now.""

**The Hatmaker**

Katherine Goodison worked as a company lawyer for five years before starting her own business making hats in her London flat. ""Being a lawyer was fun and well-paid, but the hours were terrible. I didn't want to become a senior partner and work even more hours, so I left. Some people thought I'd get bored, but that hasn't happened. The key is having deadlines. In fashion, there's always something to do, so I keep a strict schedule. I'm happier and less stressed now. I do miss socializing with colleagues, though. What I love about this job is being fully responsible for the product. If I do a bad job, it's on me. You care more when your name is on the promotional material.""

**The Masseur**

Paul Drinkwater worked in finance for 16 years before becoming a masseur at the Life Centre in London. ""I started in financial markets at 22, setting up deals. I liked the adrenaline but didn't find the work rewarding. I almost got made redundant in 1989, but I resigned and traveled for a year to figure out what I wanted to do. I was interested in health, so I visited top gymnasiums and talked to the owners. I knew I needed qualifications to change careers, so I took massage courses. Then I got part-time work at the Life Centre. I have no regrets. I used to feel out of control, but now I have peace of mind and control over my future. That's the best part."""
FCE_5,"**Onto a Winner**

Two brothers are discovering that a childhood game is great for business. Dave and Norm Lagasse, two brothers in their forties with bushy beards, are in their simple home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA, remembering their childhood. In front of them is a wooden board with round plastic pieces. They are playing the old game of pichenotte, which they say is unique. Their grandfather, Lucien Rajotte, a grocer from Quebec, Canada, brought the game to the USA and taught it to his family. Soon, the family played the game almost every weekend and holiday, and as Dave says, they were 'having the best time ever'. Eventually, the family moved to New Mexico. But they didn't forget Grandpa's pichenotte board, made from old wooden food crates, and continued to play often. Visitors were often curious because the game was unknown in southern USA. 

Three years ago, Dave noticed the old pichenotte board was cracked and worn, so he decided to make a new one. It turned out beautifully. A relative saw it and wanted one, then a friend wanted another. To see how much interest there was, the brothers took one of Dave's new boards to a sports bar in Santa Fe. 'People started to watch,' says Dave, 'and said, ""No way I'm playing that silly game."" But then they'd sit down, and soon you couldn't get them up from the table!' When people asked about the game's origins, Dave researched and found its roots were likely in India, with a similar game called 'carroms'. This was adapted into a game called 'squails' played in British pubs, and a century ago, British emigrants brought it to Canada. Pichenotte is the French-Canadian version that developed in Quebec.

Pichenotte, played by two to four people, is a game of skill. Each player gets 12 pieces or 'pucks'. These are 'flicked' across a wheel-like board using one hand's middle or index finger. Flicking a puck into a small hole scores 20 points. Three rings around the hole score 15, 10, and 5 points. Eight tiny posts are obstacles. The game usually lasts just two minutes.

Seeing the game's popularity at the Santa Fe bar, the Lagasses made more boards and took them to markets and craft fairs. Crowds gathered, money was exchanged, and the game's popularity grew. Championships started, and a trophy called the 'Lord Pichenotte Cup' was created. As word spread, the boards sold quickly. The brothers decided to make pichenotte their full-time business. They set up a workshop in their garage and started making boards. Over 450 have been made so far. Made of birchwood and mahogany, each board weighs 12kg and is 1cm thick. Norm explains, 'They're very durable, as they have to stand up to lots of use.' They sell for $595 each on the brothers' website. There are no professional pichenotte players or TV coverage yet, but the brothers hope their garage will one day house a luxury car instead of tools and wood. Until then, they enjoy playing the game they hope will make them successful."
FCE_41,"**WELCOME TO THE MODEL VILLAGE**

When you first enter the Model Village, it's hard to believe that a few years ago, this was just a piece of unused land, flat and covered with wild plants. For a long time, people thought it was worthless. However, one man's careful planning and hard work, with constant support from his wife, transformed this land into the beautiful place you see today. Many thousands of tons of soil and clay were moved to change the flat land into the shaped landscape you see now. Although machines like bulldozers helped, a lot of hard work was also needed. After shaping the land, about 1,000 tonnes of topsoil were added to create the lawns, flower beds, and rock gardens.

Hundreds of trees and shrubs were planted in the Model Village. These plants had to be chosen carefully because they needed to survive the salty air near the sea and the strong winter winds. Most plants came from local garden centers, but some were brought from as far as Canada and New Zealand.

The whole village was the idea of Colin Sims, who made over 100 models by himself over nine years, starting from when the village opened in 1972. The models are made from different materials like stone, concrete, specially treated wood, and plastics to withstand all weather conditions. At first, Colin needed help from experts to understand how different materials would last in changing weather, but he soon became an expert himself.

You will notice that all models are made to a constant scale, with great attention to detail. This was achieved through patience and unique construction techniques. The Model Village is a popular attraction, known for its high-quality workmanship and maintenance. The techniques used here have been applied in other model villages in England and are even taught in some college courses on modeling.

All the model buildings in the village show traditional British architectural styles and are not based on any specific place or structure. One of the most impressive buildings is the Manor House, a typical 13th-century stone structure with a brick tower and stone walls, inspired by manor houses in the West Country. As you walk around, you will also see the Castle, St Mary's Church, a zoo, and a mini golf course, which is the newest addition.

Please stay on the paths during your visit and do not touch the models; a small mistake can mean hours of repair work for us. You can take photos from the paths, and dogs are welcome if they are on a short lead. To enhance your experience, you will find buttons in front of some working models. Press these to see the models in action.

At the end of your visit, we would love to hear your comments. We are always planning new models, and your ideas can help us create a more varied and interesting display. We also want to know if any models did not meet the high standards of the rest of the village. We are constantly updating and replacing models, so your feedback is important.

We hope you enjoy your visit and look forward to seeing you again. Don't forget to tell your friends about us."
FCE_69,"Week after week, British tabloid newspapers publish pictures that invade people's privacy and break the newspaper editors' code of practice. Although pop stars sometimes pose for paparazzi, this is not common. Usually, people in the public eye are harmed when their private moments appear on the front page. However, very few use the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), an organization set up to handle such issues. These pictures are rarely in the public interest. Do intimate photos of pop stars help solve a crime? How did a picture of a famous actress on a hotel balcony protect public health and safety? The actress has complained about long-lens photos before, and since she was in a hotel, where there is a 'reasonable expectation of privacy', she had a good reason to complain, but she didn't take any action. It is shocking that the PCC did not investigate on its own. It should also look into the recent story about a pop star's love life. The pop star, like the actress, has not made a formal complaint. Shouldn't the PCC take action on these and other shameful attacks? At first, this seems like a good idea. It would lead to many decisions against newspapers, which would be reported by their competitors and on TV and radio. The public would not support the newspapers, and editors would have to stop publishing such material. Even photographers would be affected, as it would no longer be profitable to hide and take pictures of unsuspecting celebrities. If the PCC decided to act as a 'police officer', which it technically could, there would be several problems. How would it decide whether to start an inquiry? Should it encourage the victim to make a complaint? And if the person still refused, should it continue anyway? Also, celebrities and royalty might expect every story about them to be investigated and be upset if it wasn't. Above all, the role is too big. How could the PCC realistically monitor all of the British press: national, regional, and magazines? Then there is the embarrassment factor. No matter how seriously someone's privacy has been invaded, would they want the further embarrassment of an investigation? Most people probably just want to move on with their lives. Of course, some may have other reasons for staying quiet. A worse story may exist that they have kept from the press, and they realize it might come out if they complain. In other words, even the PCC might become the enemy. One British comedian also suffered when he and his wife were secretly photographed on their honeymoon in the Caribbean. He didn't complain then, nor more recently, when he and his family were photographed during a holiday. He feared that the newspaper, News of the World, would publish the pictures again with a new story about his 'anger', saying it was just a bit of fun and that, as a comedian, he should have a sense of humor. This fear is understandable. People believe they will become targets again if they challenge the tabloids. It is hard to find an easy solution to this serious problem."
FCE_38,"Text: 'There is a lot of advice for college graduates starting their first job. In this article, we will talk about moving to a second job. We are not talking about those looking for a temporary job while searching for a permanent one, or those leaving a bad job in the first few weeks. Instead, we focus on those taking a real step in their career, choosing a job that matches their goals now that they have some experience, skills, and an idea of their career path. What kind of job should you look for? It depends on your long-term goals. You need to ask yourself if you want to specialize in a certain area, move up to higher responsibility, or switch to a different field. Whatever you decide, choose your second job carefully. Plan to stay in it for two to three years. This job will be important when you apply for your next job. It should show that you are serious about your career. Most importantly, it should help you grow and give you more responsibility. If you want to travel, now is the time to do it. You can do temporary work when you return and then find your second job. Future employers will be glad to see that you have traveled and are not likely to leave again. Juliette Davidson spent her first year after leaving St. Aldate's College working for three lawyers. It was a great first job because 'OK ... they were very supportive. I learned about office work and improved my word processing skills. However, there was no room for growth. One day I quit, bought a plane ticket, and traveled for a year.' Juliette now works as a Personal Assistant to Brenda Cleverdon, the Chief Executive of Business in the Community. 'In two and a half years, I have become more capable and my job has really grown,' she says. 'From the start, my boss wanted to develop me. My job title is the same, but my duties have changed. From mostly typing and phone work, I now handle most of the correspondence and budgets. I also deal with various questions, from chairmen of large companies to people wanting to start their own business. Brenda involves me in all her work and gives me specific projects and events to organize.'"
FCE_17,"Text: 'Confident people: what's their secret? Confident people might seem like they were born that way, but most will say it's a skill they learned because they needed to. Nina Hathway asks five people how they became confident. A Jenny When I left school, I was very shy and thought I would always be that way. When I was about twenty-five, I was asked to help at my daughter's school. I was sure I couldn't handle it, but I surprised myself by doing well. Someone there suggested I take a university course. I was very nervous on my first day, but my confidence grew, and I became more outgoing. Looking back, working at the school was a turning point in my life. B Michaela It started four years ago when my father got sick, and I had to take over the family business. I was scared and became too aggressive and impatient. I thought confident people acted like that, but I learned differently. To be confident, you have to believe in yourself. If work gets too hard, I don't feel guilty about leaving some tasks for the next day. When faced with something difficult, I tell myself I have nothing to lose. Fear makes you lack confidence, so I often talk to myself to overcome those fears. C Lisa People think I'm very confident, but the calmer I look, the more scared I am. I had to learn to look confident because it's important in TV. Interviewing people helped me see that most of us get nervous in important situations, and we feel calmer when we talk to someone friendly. The best advice I got was from my mother when I worried about wearing the right clothes. She said, 'Who's looking at you? Everyone's too busy worrying about themselves.' That's worth remembering. You gain confidence by facing things that scare you. When I took my driving test, I was very nervous, but I passed. After that, I felt I would never be that scared again. D Barbara My confidence comes from enjoying my work, but it's something I've built over the years. If you keep going and learn from mistakes, you're more confident next time. I work hard and am popular in the restaurant, but maybe one out of ten people doesn't like me. I don't let that bother me. You have to like yourself for who you are, not try to be what others expect. My company offers training courses, which have built my self-esteem. They also encourage setting manageable goals. It helps to achieve something real, rather than aiming too high and getting nothing. E Kim After college, I worked as a secretary and would sit in meetings, not always agreeing, but too scared to speak up. Eventually, I found the confidence to start speaking my mind. When I first worked in politics, I had never spoken in public and would shake with nerves. I told myself, 'Don't be silly. People do this every day, so you can too.' I found it helpful to write down a few notes, like a comfort blanket. I don't think anyone isn't a little nervous about public speaking. The real secret of confidence is telling yourself, 'Nothing is impossible.''"
FCE_47,"**Visit to Malaysia**

Paul Forster attends a kite-flying festival and spends a night in the forest. Adnan Ali smiled as I gave him his torn kite. ""You should keep it,"" he said. ""It's a tradition—if the line breaks, finders are keepers. Besides, I have many more."" He pointed to a pile of beautifully decorated kites at his feet. Each kite was exactly 120 cm wide and long, made of tissue paper and split bamboo. We sat next to them under the shade of the trees behind the Beach of the Seven Lagoons in Kelantan, looking at Malaysia's biggest kite festival.

In the center of the beach, there were 10 platforms where helpers held up the kites. A row of competitors, holding their kite lines, waited for the countdown. When the whistle blew, the crowd cheered, and the kites soared into the sky like rockets. Over 500 men and boys had signed up for the competition, which lasts five days every year. Each participant entered four different kite designs, judged on decoration, stability, and flying efficiency.

""Flying kites isn't hard,"" said Adnan, ""but making them takes real skill. Visit me at home, and I'll show you how it's done."" I accepted his invitation, one of five I received that day. At his house, I drank cold milky tea and ate fish crackers in a large room. As it got dark, he invited me to come back the next day to help rebuild his kite, but I couldn't. Instead, I explored the southern part of the state, driving towards Kuala Lumpur into mountains covered with lush rainforest.

I took a wrong turn, and the smooth road ended at a river. A boat was there to ferry people across. Nearby, a small sign caught my eye. It pointed up a path into the forest and read: ""Jelawang Jungle 3 km."" It would have been helpful to know that most of this distance was uphill, steep, and slippery. When I reached the track, I found a man with a flask of tea. This was Baba, who managed a tented kitchen and several bamboo huts. I decided to stay, trying not to think about insects under my thin mattress. The night was completely dark, filled with sounds. A waterfall roared nearby, and many creatures moved and squeaked. In the morning, there was a stunning view over five ranges of green mountains.

In the afternoon, it rained. First, the wind blew, then lightning struck the treetops. Seconds later, I was soaked. Sliding downhill, I wondered how the giant butterflies avoided the huge raindrops. I also worried about my car being swept away (it sometimes happens) and the chance of drowning if I opened my mouth. Luckily, the car was still there, covered in mud, at the bottom of the track.

In Kota Bahru, Kelantan's capital, people asked me questions: ""Where are you from?"" ""How old are you?"" But they were very friendly. Kelantan might be famous for its kites, but I remember it more for its kindness."
FCE_48,"**What kind of shopper are you?**

Everyone goes shopping, whether they like it or not. But there are different types of shoppers. Do you know which type you are? Abby Edwards asked some people ...

**A. Melanie, 22, dancer**

I'm a shopping addict - I can't spend enough money! When I have cash, I'm out shopping, and it keeps me happy. I find it hard to walk past sale signs. My boyfriend is the same, so we often shop together. We're an addicted couple!

**B. Brenda, 40, office manager**

I'm a reluctant shopper. My husband does most of the food shopping because he cooks and knows what he likes. I don't spend much time shopping for clothes. I take my 6-year-old son and 14-year-old daughter to buy clothes, but I don't enjoy it because we all have different tastes. I don't spend money on myself often, so when I do, I feel guilty and rarely tell my husband the real price - I always say it cost less! The real price always sounds too high.

**C. Juliet, 28, personnel manager**

I only shop for essentials. I hate shopping and only go when I really have to. When I do, I know what I want and won't settle for anything else. I find shopping tiring and there's always something I'd rather be doing.

**D. Anita, 35, TV producer**

I like to look around sometimes, but I usually know what I want and where to find it. I don't waste time and get in and out quickly. I do have some mistakes hidden in my wardrobe, so maybe I'm a careful shopper who sometimes gets it wrong!

**E. Lizzie, 41, secretary**

I don't enjoy shopping at all. I really dislike shopping for clothes because I can never find what I want or anyone to help me. The shops are too noisy and disorganized, and I find it a nightmare. Luckily, I rarely have to shop for clothes because most of my clothes are given to me. For food shopping, I go to the local supermarket once a week and finish it quickly!

**F. Lisa, 22, actress**

I'm probably a happy shopper. Sometimes I go out to look around the shops with my friends, and we often end up buying things. I don't usually have a specific item in mind, but if something catches my eye, I'll buy it.

**G. Suki, 26, art gallery assistant**

I'm a careful shopper - I like going, but I don't buy much. I usually know what I want and rarely go overboard. Sometimes I shop to cheer myself up, but I often feel worse because I've spent too much!

**H. Ann-Marie, 29, nursery worker**

I love shopping, but only on certain days and never on a Saturday because it's too busy. I'd say I'm a careful shopper. I always have a good idea of what I want, and I never buy things immediately. I have to check other shops in case I find a better deal - it takes me ages!

**I. Linda, 32, restaurant manager**

I'm an unwilling shopper. Maybe because I work in the city center, the shops have lost their appeal for me. When I have to shop, I drag myself out, but I don't try things on because it's too much trouble. Clothes I buy don't always fit, but I don't mind too much. I'd rather make a few mistakes than put in a lot of effort shopping!"

**Easter Quiz for Children**

During the Easter holidays, young visitors can join a quiz about ""Surprises."" The quiz sheets are free and can be picked up at the Orange Street entrance. Children will be guided to 14 surprising paintings and asked questions about them. The quiz is available during normal gallery hours from 25 March to 9 April.

**New Picture**

The Gallery now has a beautiful still life by the Dutch 18th-century painter Jan van Os. This large painting (89.1 cm x 71 cm) of flowers and fruit is painted in light, bright colors on wood. It is one of the first of its kind in the Gallery. The painting is signed and dated 1777 and 1778. It is common for such paintings to have two dates because the artist waited for different flowers to bloom in their seasons to paint them. This picture was generously donated to the Gallery by Miss Violet Churchman in memory of her sister Ida Nancy. It is now on display in Room 25.

**Special Exhibition**

The exhibition ""Painting in Spain during the late 18th century"" opened in the Sunley Room on 15 March. The Gallery recently bought works by three Spanish painters from this period: Paret, Melendez, and Francisco Bayeu, who are the main focus of the exhibition. These artists are joined by Francisco's brother Ramon, Antonio Gonzalez, and two Italians who worked in Spain during these years - Corrado Giaquinto and Giovanni Battista Tiepolo. The exhibition runs until 31 May.

**Lecture News**

The series of lectures related to the special exhibition continues every Wednesday. On 5 April, Lizzie Barker will discuss the work of Melendez. On 12 April, Sarah Symmons will lecture on Luis Paret. On 19 and 26 April, Juliet Wilson will talk about Francisco Bayeu. On Tuesdays in April, Erika Langmuir will explain how artists often ""tell a story"" through their pictures.

**Gallery Restaurant Improvements**

The Gallery is pleased to announce that the restaurant now offers an improved and expanded service. With new kitchens, the restaurant provides a wide choice of hot and cold dishes at reasonable prices.

**Information for Visitors**

Free guided tours of the Gallery take place every day at 11.00 am and 3.00 pm (except Sundays). These tours introduce some of the Gallery's greatest pictures and show the full range of the Gallery's collection of important European paintings from the 13th to the early 20th centuries."

I was happy staying at home, so I wasn't too interested at first. I'm really glad I decided to come, though.' Their teacher, Philippe, says, 'It's great fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, although the kitchen isn't always as tidy when they're cooking! As adults, we're always learning more about food. If parents interest their children in cooking while they are young, they'll have enough skill to make food for themselves when they leave home.''"

PET_21,"Text: 'MONEY What is money? The pound, the dollar, or the euro are like units of measurement, such as a gram or a kilometre. The difference is that you can use money to buy things. For example, a five-pound note can buy a book, a big bag of sweets, or a couple of cinema tickets. But the note itself is just a piece of paper that costs very little to produce. Thousands of years ago, people didn't have money like we do today. There were no banks or shops. Back then, Mr. Green the farmer would trade the corn he grew for Mr. Hive's honey. This was a trade between two people, each having something the other wanted. Over time, most societies created their own 'currencies' to make trading easier. These different currencies started to connect, which is why today everyone uses a national currency.'"

PET_3,"Text: 'THE FIRST WOMAN SCIENTIST Hypatia was born in Alexandria, Egypt, in 370 A.D. For many centuries, she was the only woman scientist mentioned in history books. Hypatia's father was the director of Alexandria University, and he ensured his daughter received the best education possible. This was unusual because most women at that time had few chances to study. After studying in Athens and Rome, Hypatia returned to Alexandria and began teaching mathematics. She quickly became famous for her knowledge of new ideas. We do not have copies of her books, but we know she wrote several important mathematical works. Hypatia was also interested in technology and invented several scientific tools to help with her work. At that time, many rulers were afraid of science, and anyone connected with it was in danger. One day in March 415, Hypatia was attacked in the street and killed.'"

PET_27,"Grass

Grass is one of the most successful plants in the world. There are over 9,000 different types of grasses, and they are found everywhere on Earth. They are the only flowering plants that can live in the cold environments of the Arctic and Antarctic. Grasslands support many kinds of animals, from small insects and birds to large animals like cows and lions. All these animals depend on grass in some way. Grass grows back quickly after it is cut or damaged. Unlike other plants, new leaves grow from below the soil, not from the top. This is why large groups of animals can live in one area. Once they have eaten all the grass, new grass starts to grow, providing a fresh meal."
PET_44,"Kal Kaur Rai, the Young Achiever of the Year, has always loved fashion. She recently won the Young Achiever of the Year award at the Asian Business Awards. Since she was a child, she has been drawing clothes and creating designs. However, she never told her parents, who own a supermarket, that she wanted to make fashion her career. She thought they wanted her to choose a more traditional job, so she studied management at university. After graduating, she moved to London and worked at an advertising agency. She had to attend industry events but couldn't afford the designer clothes she liked, so she started making her own skirts and tops. Her friends loved her clothes and asked her to make some for them too. A small shop in London agreed to sell her designs on a sale-or-return basis, and they sold very well. This success encouraged her to leave her advertising job, take a £20,000 loan, and start her own womenswear label. Kal's parents were supportive of her career change, which made her happy. Now, her clothes are sold in over 70 stores, and her business earns over £500,000. Her designs are featured in fashion magazines, she creates clothes for pop stars, and she has gained public recognition by winning this award. Kal's business has grown significantly, and she feels very fortunate. ""What I do is my hobby - and I get paid for it! But remember, I've worked hard for this."""

PET_49,"**The Ghan Train**

Mark Ottaway traveled by train from Darwin, in the north of Australia, to Adelaide, in the south. The Ghan train crosses Australia from the warm northern coast through endless desert to the colder Southern Ocean. It is often called the 'famous Ghan', but it is known for being late. The idea of a rail link between Darwin and Adelaide started in the 1920s with a line from Adelaide to Alice Springs, but flooding often made it hard for trains to pass. A new line was finished a few months before my journey. The railway was built for speeds up to 115 kph, but the Ghan is not a high-speed train. There are few stops, and most passengers are on holiday. The Ghan does not offer luxury like the Orient Express, although the food on board is excellent. The railway was originally built to carry goods, not passengers. It was thought that sending goods from Europe to Australia's south via Darwin and the train, instead of by ship around the continent, would save time and money. A transcontinental railway is rare, and the Ghan claims to be the world's first north-south one. As I waited to board the Ghan, I saw that everyone was excited about the journey. Most of my fellow travelers were Australian pensioners, eager to board. Our first stop was at Katherine, where the Ghan waited four hours. Some passengers took a boat trip up the gorge. I left the train at Alice Springs for a two-day trip to Uluru (Ayers Rock) with a small group and a guide. Climbing the rock is not encouraged now, and few people do. Our group walked around the rock and watched the beautiful sunset. From Alice Springs, there are two trains a week going south, so many passengers stop here. The view from the train after Alice Springs is not very interesting. There is a lot of flat land with only cattle to see. But at dawn on the third day, we reached the foothills near the Southern Ocean. My journey was over, and although the train might not have delivered everything the advertisements promised, it took me to some of the most amazing sights in Australia."
PET_31,"Climbing to the Top of Britain

Every year, thousands of people climb Ben Nevis in Scotland. Because it is so far north, the weather can be very cold. Climber Keith Hewitt talks about his first time on Ben Nevis. It was February, and it was my first big winter climb. We planned to climb the north face of the mountain to Tower Ridge. This climb is 600 meters high and is probably the longest climb in Britain. We planned to camp for three days in the 'Carries', which are like big bowls in the mountain walls halfway up. We carried tents, sleeping bags, and metal spikes for our boots. You need these spikes because the snow can be so hard that it feels like walking on ice. Even though some people in our group were very experienced, we packed all kinds of safety equipment, like lights to attract attention, hard hats, and extra clothing. The weather forecast was perfect, with no strong winds, but we still felt nervous when we started. Climbing Ben Nevis in winter is always a challenge. The path soon became steep, and my legs felt tired. I was the weakest in the group, so I had to rest more often. The others sometimes stopped to let me catch up, but as soon as I reached them, they started again. I promised myself that I would always train properly before a climb in the future. After 200 meters, we reached the start of Tower Ridge, the path that would take us to the top of Ben Nevis. It is only one and a half meters wide, and the mountain drops hundreds of meters on each side. We knew we had to stay calm and focus on every step as we moved slowly along it. After seven hours of climbing, we reached the top. On a clear day, you can see the sea and all the way to the island of Skye, 48 kilometers away. However, we weren't so lucky because a mist had come down. On Ben Nevis, getting back down to camp can be as challenging as going up. You need to read a map properly because a wrong turn could lead to slopes that are too dangerous to go down in winter. I was glad we decided to take turns doing that job. That first time, I only really enjoyed the experience when I was safe in the tent. But at least I made it to the top."
PET_58,"Anna's New School

This week has been very exciting because we just moved into our new school building! It's an amazing place. The builders used wood for the whole building, just like in our old school. However, this new school is one of the first in my country to be very environmentally friendly. It took months to build, so we watched the whole process. It was exciting to see the builders clear the space for it, although it meant losing some nice open land. The noise from the building machines was very loud, and the builders often had to stop because of heavy rain. We started to think the building would never be finished.

Now, we have five classrooms, which are huge - much bigger than in our old school next door, which was very old. We share one room with people in the town when they need it for meetings. There's also a nursery, a lovely dining room, and big changing rooms that we can't wait to use once our new sports field is ready.

When you enter the school, one of the first things you notice is that there are no heaters! Instead, the heat comes from all of us inside - the children, the teachers, and the computers. The building is designed so well that it keeps all the heat inside - and all the sound too. If we sing in our classrooms, it feels like we're in a concert hall!

Another interesting thing is that the school roof has a tree on top! The builders put it there after finishing the roof because it's a custom in Austria, where the roof was made. The electricity for lights and computers comes from a wind turbine on a hill behind the school. We visited it with our teacher yesterday, and it spins very fast. It's so big that you can see it from miles away! We took some pictures to put on the website.

Even though we're already using the school building, there are still some parts to be added. For example, we are putting on a play for parents, but we still have to go back to our old school hall to do it. The new hall will be ready by next year. We're so happy with our new school, and our teachers say we'll learn much faster now that we're in it!"

Half of us spent the morning caving, while the others went rock climbing, and then we switched at lunchtime. Matt and I went to the caves first.

PET_60,"Text: 'Sharks Sharks are some of the most frightening creatures in our oceans. They are well equipped for hunting underwater because they have excellent vision and can sense movement through special lines on the sides of their bodies. This makes sharks very dangerous for smaller sea creatures that become their prey. Although sharks are similar to other fish in some ways, their bodies are different. For example, unlike other fish, most sharks need to swim all the time to breathe and stay alive, so they hardly sleep at all. Also, if sharks are turned over on their backs, they can stop moving completely. This is a very useful technique for researchers who often need to handle sharks. It allows them to learn more about these fascinating creatures.'"

At my first ballet class, I was nervous because I didn't know anyone. Everyone gathered around and asked me questions in Russian. I tried to speak Russian, and then they started talking in English, so we could communicate. Now, six months later, everyone is really nice to me, my Russian has improved a lot, and I understand my teachers. For the first two weeks after I arrived, my mum stayed with me, and when she left, I felt a bit sad. I even called home late at night once to talk to her because I felt a little lonely. Compared to my ballet school in England, the classes in Russia are really hard, and I eat a lot to keep up my energy levels. That makes me confident I can perform to the school's high standards. In the evenings, I watch my favourite films on my computer, but sometimes I fall asleep before the DVD finishes. Now that I've settled down, I feel really at home here. I like walking around the city and going to different shops - even in December when I couldn't believe how cold it was.

PET_55,"Text: 'THE ICEHOTEL For many years, the Arctic was a popular place to visit in the summer to see the land of the midnight sun. However, in winter, only a few people lived there, enjoying the snow and ice alone. By the late 1980s, people decided that the dark and cold winter could be a good thing. In the winter of 1990, a French artist named Jannot Derit was invited to open an exhibition in a special igloo (a building made of snow) in the small town of Jukkasjarvi on the frozen Torne River. This building, called Arctic Hall, attracted many visitors. One night, a group of foreign guests thought it would be interesting to sleep in the Arctic Hall. The next morning, they were very happy with their experience, and the idea of an ice hotel was born. Today, it is famous worldwide. When winter starts, a team of snow builders, architects, and artists from around the world come to Jukkasjarvi to build the hotel for that year. As soon as one part is finished, it opens to visitors and overnight guests, while other parts are still being built. The first part is ready in December, and each week a new part opens until January 7th, when the hotel is complete. Since the ICEHOTEL is built outside using natural winter materials, the finishing date depends on nature, so plans can change. In spring, when it gets warmer, the hotel melts. Inside the hotel, the temperature is always between -5°C and -8°C, no matter how cold it is outside. Warm winter clothes like overalls, hats, and gloves are included in the cost of staying at the hotel. Guests should also bring sweaters, a scarf, and plenty of wool socks, and choose shoes that are larger than normal to fit thick socks. If you plan to visit the hotel, you can buy warm sweaters, wool socks, and more on the ICEHOTEL website. You can order these items and the equipment you need when you book your visit. They will be delivered to your room when you check in. The hotel is in the village of Jukkasjarvi, 200 km above the Arctic Circle, but only 15 km from Kiruna airport and 17 km from Kiruna train station. Bus transport can be arranged from the airport or train station to the ICEHOTEL.'"

The store's regular hours will be 9 am to 9 pm every day, but Homestyle had announced it would stay open for the first 24 hours. However, it had to close within half an hour of opening. A police officer who was called to the store said: 'The police knew a large crowd was expected, but people were not patient. The store quickly filled up, and the managers wisely decided to close the doors. The people outside got angry because they thought everything would be sold before they could enter, and they refused to wait quietly until there was space inside. Another problem was the long line of cars trying to reach the parking lot. What surprised me was that many people left their cars in the middle of the road and walked the last few meters to the store. This caused the road to be completely blocked.' One customer, Jenny Smith, who got into the store, said: 'I waited for three hours and didn't have time to buy what I wanted. But the staff were very calm and explained what was happening.

PET_34,"Free-diving in the Caribbean

Tanya Streeter holds four world records in free-diving, a sport where people dive deep into the ocean on just one breath. In 2003, Tanya made history by diving 120 meters deep and returning to the surface without help. She had gone deeper the year before but used a balloon to come back up. This time, she held her breath for over three and a half minutes, becoming the only woman to break a man's world record in any sport. Fourteen safety divers watched her dive at different depths. Some people think free-diving is too dangerous because of serious accidents, but Tanya disagrees. She believes safety and training are most important.

Most free-divers focus on one or two types of events, but Tanya's training routine stays the same. She spends two-thirds of her time training on land at the gym, and the rest in the pool and ocean. She uses an exercise bike to improve her heart fitness but avoids running to protect her knees. Instead, she fast-walks to build fitness. When she starts practice dives, she usually travels away from home. She aims to do fourteen dives over four weeks, resting every other day to avoid getting tired, which could ruin her preparation.

When not preparing for an event, Tanya often appears in public to promote sports products and supports environmental causes by doing research or making films. Growing up on Grand Cayman in the Caribbean, she loved swimming and exploring rock pools. Tanya says her life now is like living her childhood dreams. She is well-known in some countries, so people listen to her about environmental issues. In the future, Tanya, now in her thirties, plans to keep breaking her own records. She started free-diving at twenty-five and doesn't plan to retire anytime soon."

New ideas and advanced computer programs mean that cartoons are becoming exciting again for people of all ages. By the end of the 1970s, the cinema world thought cartoons were only for children. But soon after, a few directors had some original new ideas. They showed that it was possible to make films that both adults and children could enjoy. However, not every cartoon film was successful. The Black Cauldron, for example, failed because it was too scary for children and too childish for adults. Directors learned from this mistake, and film companies began to make a lot of money again.'"

This is not a typical business book, nor is it just about my life. The main idea is that to succeed in business, you need to be different. Business can be enjoyable, it can be run with care, and it can have a positive impact. In business, as in life, I need to have fun, feel a sense of family, and be excited by surprises. I have always wanted the people who work for 'The Body Shop' to feel the same way. Now, this book shares my ideas with the world and makes them public. I like to think there are no limits to our 'family' and no limits to what we can achieve. I find that an exciting thought. I hope you do, too.'"

Bees can travel up to seventy-five thousand kilometers and visit over two million flowers to make just half a kilo of honey. The color and taste of honey depend on the type of flower the bees visit. There are more than three hundred types of honey. Lighter-colored honey usually has a milder taste than darker honey. In ancient times, honey was the main sweet food because sugar was very rare. Honey was very valuable to the ancient Egyptians, who used it as payment. Today, honey is made and eaten all over the world. Research suggests that it can prevent tiredness and improve athletic performance. However, honey is not just food - it can be used for sore throats and is in many skin and hair-care products.'"
PET_7,"Norwich, the capital of East Anglia in Britain, has been a place to live for over two thousand years. It started as a small village by the River Wensum. By the time of the Norman invasion in 1066, it had grown into one of the largest towns in England. Norwich is known for its religious diversity, with two cathedrals and a mosque. The first cathedral was built in 1095 and recently celebrated its 900th anniversary. In 1994, Norwich celebrated the 800th anniversary of receiving a Royal Charter, which allowed it to be called a city and govern itself independently.

Today, Norwich is quite small compared to cities like London or Manchester, with a population of about 150,000. However, in the 16th century, it was the second-largest city in England. It continued to grow and became wealthy, known for having as many churches as there are weeks in the year and as many pubs as there are days in the year. Now, there are fewer churches and pubs, but in 1964, the University of East Anglia was established in Norwich. With a growing student population and success as a commercial center, Norwich offers a wide range of entertainment: theatres, cinemas, nightclubs, busy cafes, excellent restaurants, and arts and leisure centers. The city also has a football team, known as 'The Canaries', with green and yellow colors, though the reason for the name is unclear.

One of the city's attractions is a modern shopping center called 'The Castle Mall'. For over two years, the people of Norwich lived with a large hole in the city center as builders worked on the main car park. Nearly a million tons of earth were moved so that the roof of the Mall could become a city center park, with water pools and trees. The local people are happy that the old open market remains next to the new development. Both areas continue to do well, showing that Norwich has successfully combined the old and the new."
PET_43,"The Albuquerque Balloon Festival Every autumn, the sky above Albuquerque, a city in the southwestern United States, fills with bright colors. This is the Albuquerque Balloon Festival, a nine-day event held every year. The first festival was in 1972 to celebrate the 50th birthday of a local radio station. It started with about a dozen hot-air balloons taking off from a car park in the city. Since then, the festival has grown a lot. This year, at least a thousand balloons from over a third of the countries in the world are expected at its current location outside the city. What to see The pilots stay in radio contact and light up their balloons' burners at the same time. These are called 'balloon glows' and are great for taking photos. To see these 'glows,' you need to arrive just after nightfall or before 5:30 am as the balloons rise into the dark sky. During the day, you can walk among the balloons and talk to the pilots as they get ready for take-off. The balloons come in all sizes and colors, some shaped like animals, cartoon characters, or famous products like soft drinks and fast food. Kids will love it. In the afternoon, you can take a balloon flight over the desert with one of the many companies offering rides. Another option is to take the cable car from the desert floor to the top of the nearby mountains, the longest ride of its kind, and enjoy a view of the festival from above. There are many other attractions for visitors of all ages, including balloon races and fireworks on the opening night and the last three nights of the festival. The Albuquerque Box This is a local wind pattern that is perfect for balloonists. The Sandia Mountains protect the balloons from strong winds and create gentle wind currents at different heights. This allows skilled pilots to control the direction of their balloons by rising or descending. Practical advice Buy your tickets in advance online to avoid long waits at the festival site. Wear several layers of thin clothing. It can be cool at night and in the early morning, but during the day, sunglasses and sunscreen are essential. Bring a flashlight for night events and, of course, your camera. If you use film, you'll need high-speed film for evening and night pictures."

At first glance, the large 'biospheres' on this former industrial site look like something from a science-fiction movie. Each biosphere has a different climate zone, showing visitors how important the relationship between people and plants is. It is amazing to see how many products we use every day come from plants: wood, rubber, fruit, rice, sugar, coffee, and chocolate, for example. Over 135,000 different types of plants are grown here. No matter how cold the weather is outside, computer-controlled electric heaters keep the plants at the right temperature. In the Rainforest Zone, the air is always damp because of a large waterfall. Another zone copies the environment of the Mediterranean, California, and South Africa, and there are plans to build a desert zone soon."

There are enjoyable pieces by famous writers like Candia McWilliam and Rose Tremain. Interestingly, the less well-known writers seem to focus mainly on food. Be careful with Jane Harris's Those Nails - it's best not to read it right after eating, as it has some very unpleasant scenes that might upset your stomach! The book also features excellent work from nineteen poets, including R. S. Thomas and John Burnside. There are excerpts from novels-in-progress by Jim Crace and Jane Rogers.

""It's the time when you are learning about the world."" Margaret, who lives in London, likes to start teaching children at three or four years old, but she sometimes makes exceptions for eager five-year-olds. When she began teaching the violin in 1972, her first class was made up of her children's five-year-old school friends. Margaret's students have group lessons. Each group has about twelve students, and each lesson lasts an hour, once every two weeks. Additionally, each student has one individual lesson a week with her. Parents must also attend the classes. It is important that parents show interest in the lessons. From the first lessons, students learn to play by ear. They do not try to read music until they have been playing for several years, and for a long time, there is a big difference between their playing and reading of music. Margaret says her method is not meant to create great violinists, and she often suggests that students who do very well should leave and study the violin using more traditional methods.'"

Tom Wilcott is now playing bass guitar, replacing Simon McVee who left the band last year, and Tom Simpson has joined as the drummer. From the first song, which is a dance tune, it is clear that the band is not focusing on slow songs anymore. The second song is also a dance tune and is even louder and heavier. Most of the later tracks are in the band's usual slow style. These two tracks will surprise many fans. Either of them could easily become a hit single because they are excellent. Singer Rob Letchford shows his talent by hitting each note perfectly. Fans should be thankful he recorded the songs before he had throat problems. This has caused the band to cancel their next tour. (Anyone who has bought tickets should not worry as all the concerts will be rescheduled once Rob has recovered.) On this CD, Moonshine shows they can create perfect music in different styles, from the slow ones we know to the ones that make you want to dance. I felt that the best songs were at the beginning, and the last few tracks were not as good. Despite this, 'Here Again' is sure to be a big hit and bring more success to the band.'"

Early shoes were likely made from animal skins, which people wrapped around their ankles in cold weather. We still use leather today, but other materials like silk, plastic, or cotton are also popular, depending on fashion trends. It was only 150 years ago that people started wearing different shoes on each foot. Before that, both shoes were straight and could be worn on either foot.

They complain about the lack of women in the sport but use this as an excuse not to provide separate changing rooms. I put up posters, and 40 women, both young and old, fit and unfit, joined. They were interested in losing weight, but I don't think they had really thought about running before. When they did think about it, they imagined difficult training. They didn't think about chatting and smiling while running in beautiful places, like by a river. At first, they ran for only a minute - now they can run for thirty minutes. They've also learned from other runners about diet and staying fit in general. I wanted to do something for women's running, and I've enjoyed watching their progress - almost as much as they have.'"
PET_40,"**THE HISTORY OF THE IDITAROD - THE LAST GREAT RACE ON EARTH**

In the 1880s, gold was found in Alaska, the northernmost state of the USA. Many people moved there, hoping to become rich. New towns were quickly built and expanded. One of these towns was named Iditarod, meaning 'far, distant place'. In 1909, Iditarod grew so fast that it briefly became the largest city in Alaska. During the summer, essential supplies could be delivered by boat, but in winter, the rivers and ocean froze, making travel impossible. So, in 1910, a winter trail was created for teams of dogs pulling sleds. They carried mail, food, and clothes to the gold miners. This trail was called the Iditarod Trail. It took about three weeks for a dog team to cross Alaska. They stopped at 'roadhouses' where the drivers could rest and eat, and feed their dogs. The trail was used every winter until the 1920s when airplanes replaced steam boats and dog teams as the main transport. However, the dogs had one last important role in 1925, when a disease called diphtheria struck the city of Nome. The disease could be treated, but the nearest medicine was in Anchorage, on the other side of Alaska. Airplanes were still new, and it was uncertain if they could fly in such cold weather. Also, Carl Eielson, the only pilot skilled enough for the flight, was away. So, it was decided to use dog teams to transport the medicine. The journey covered over 1,000 kilometers, mostly along the Iditarod Trail. It took twenty teams just six days to complete the trip. Leonhard Seppala, a Norwegian who came to Alaska for gold, traveled the first 400 kilometers. He relied on his dog Togo to navigate through the blinding snow, and Togo proved to be a reliable guide. The last part of the journey was completed by Gunnar Kaasen, who had driven dog teams in Alaska for 21 years. His lead dog was Balto. At one point, Balto refused to go further, saving the team from falling into icy water. The diphtheria outbreak was stopped, and Balto became a hero. Today, a dog sled race is held every year from Anchorage to Nome, following the route of the 1925 journey. It is called the Iditarod and is known as 'The Last Great Race on Earth'."

The story appeared in a local newspaper, and Jose Craveirinha, who had supported other African athletes, learned about Maria. He went to meet her and saw her playing football outside the club. He immediately noticed she was fast. 'He talked to me about athletics. I didn't know what he meant. The only sport I knew was football. Then he bought me running shoes and took me to train. It was very hard work, and my legs really hurt.' But Jose visited her parents and convinced them she could be successful and this would help end their poverty. They agreed to let him take her to train. In 1991, she finally accepted an invitation to train in the United States. She had refused before because she knew she would miss her family. Her background was different from the girls she met in the US. She explains, 'They were good athletes, but while I worried about my parents having enough to eat, they worried about dresses and make-up. They knew very little about me and even less about my problems. But I knew I was lucky to be there. The trainers were excellent, and I learned a lot.'

Players from each band even created new tunes right there on stage. It was exciting to watch, but even better when my band played on stage! We have a great jazz band at my school, but not everyone who wants to play in it gets accepted—only about half, in fact. But anyone who is eager to play goes to jazz practice before school, and we often spend time together after school, listening to jazz and learning its language. There are also trips to jazz summer camps across the country—I’ve been to a couple and learned a lot. Adults are often surprised that young people are getting interested in jazz. My music teacher thinks it's because pop music isn't challenging enough for people like me who are serious about music. But I find it exciting because it's both new and old at the same time—you can create your own music, but you also feel you're part of its history, as you're playing on stage in the same way as great jazz performers before you.

PET_28,"**Antarctica Sightseeing Flights Website**

Welcome to our website. Here is what you need to know before booking a flight. During the short Antarctic summer, Antarctica Sightseeing Flights takes tourists in a large passenger plane (Boeing 747) from Sydney, Australia, over Antarctica and back. Flight dates for next year are not confirmed yet, but if you book now, your deposit can be moved to another date if we need to change the flight day.

**Questions**

These are answers to the most common questions about Antarctica Sightseeing Flights.

**How long is the flight?**

The flight usually lasts 12 hours. About four hours into the flight, we start seeing the first sea ice and icebergs. We spend four hours flying over Antarctica and the rest of the time returning home. On the way to and from Antarctica, experts who have lived at research stations there give talks about the environment and history, and answer questions. A camera near the pilot, connected to the video system on board, shows you the pilot's view from take-off to landing.

**Will I get a seat next to a window?**

All passengers receive two boarding passes. Halfway through the flight, passengers switch to the seat on their second boarding pass. Business and first class passengers will have a window seat for half of the flight and a seat next to a window for the other half. Economy passengers will have a window seat or a seat next to a window for half of the flight and an aisle seat for the other half. While over Antarctica, we encourage passengers to walk around the plane so everyone can enjoy the views. The pilot flies in long 'figure 8s' over interesting spots so both sides of the plane can see the sights well.

**What happens if the weather is bad?**

We have 17 different approved flight routes. Our captain checks the satellite cloud images on the morning of the flight and chooses the route with the clearest views.

**Will I see penguins and other wildlife?**

Most Antarctic wildlife lives at sea level, over 3,000 meters below the plane, so we can't see them clearly. We do not land on Antarctica, mainly for environmental reasons. To see Antarctic wildlife, you would need to join a boat tour.

**Can I take photographs?**

Yes, you can! All cameras are welcome. We even offer some fun photo opportunities on board where you can try on Antarctic cold weather clothes."

I was happy staying at home, so I wasn't too interested at first. I'm really glad I decided to come, though.' Their teacher, Philippe, says, 'It's great fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, although the kitchen isn't always as tidy when they're cooking! As adults, we're always learning more about food. If parents interest their children in cooking while they are young, they'll have enough skill to make food for themselves when they leave home.''"
PET_5,"Text: 'Winter Driving Winter can be dangerous because it's hard to predict what will happen, and accidents can occur easily. Fog might appear suddenly over a hill. Ice can be hidden under melting snow, ready to make you lose control. The car coming towards you might suddenly slide across the road. Rule Number One for driving on icy roads is to drive smoothly. Sudden movements can make a car hard to control. So, whenever you turn the wheel, use the brakes, or speed up, do it gently and slowly. Imagine you have a full cup of hot coffee on the seat next to you. Drive in a way that you wouldn't spill it. Rule Number Two is to be aware of what might happen. The more ice there is, the further ahead you need to look. Test how long it takes to stop by gently braking. Remember, you might be driving faster than you think. In general, allow double your normal stopping distance when the road is wet, three times this distance on snow, and even more on ice. Try to stay in control of your car at all times to avoid trouble.'"
PET_41,"Craigie Aitchison

The painter Craigie Aitchison was born in Scotland. He moved to London planning to study law, but instead, he went to art school. There, he found traditional drawing classes hard, but he continued painting. In his late twenties, the Italian government gave him money to study art, and he became interested in early Italian artists, which is visible in some of his work. He loved the greens and browns of the Italian fields and the clear light there, and he wanted to capture this light in his paintings. This led him to paint colors thinly, layering them from light to dark, but he says he's never sure what the results will be. He explains, 'It's a secret - because I don't know myself. I don't start by painting yellow, knowing I'm going to put anything on top.' Like many talented people, Aitchison makes it sound easy. 'Anyone can do the colors - you can buy them. I simply notice what you put the colors next to.' Unlike some artists, he never makes drawings before starting a painting, as he feels that if he did, he might get bored and not finish the painting. Instead, Aitchison changes his paintings many times before they are done. This is why his favorite models are people who don't ask to see their pictures while he's painting them.

PET_38,"Text: 'Rock Band Two years ago, our 14-year-old son, Ben, asked us for a set of drums for his birthday. At first, we were against the idea because of the noise. 'It's better than watching television or playing computer games in my free time,' Ben argued, 'and it'll keep me out of trouble.' In the end, we agreed. 'All right,' we said, 'but you must think about the rest of the family and the neighbours when you play.' That was just the start. Because drums are not easy to move, the other members of Ben's band started coming to our home with their guitars and other electrical equipment. So, for several hours a week, the house shakes with the noise of their instruments and their teenage singing. At least Ben's hobby has been good for our health: whenever the band starts practising, my husband and I go out for a long walk. And I must admit that, although their music may sound a little strange, they are a friendly and polite group of young men. I cannot judge their musical skill - after all, I didn't expect my parents' generation to like the same music as I did when I was a teenager - but they do play regularly in local clubs for young people. Our main worry is that they won't spend enough time on their school work because of their musical activities, though this hasn't happened yet. I am always telling Ben how important his studies are. But one thing is certain - Ben was right: it has kept him out of trouble and he is never bored.'"
PET_17,"Atlantic College

Last week, I visited Atlantic College, a top private school in Wales. This school is special because it gives students important experiences outside the classroom, along with preparing them for exams. The students, aged 16 to 18, come from all over the world. They study in the morning and in the afternoon, they do useful activities like helping on a farm, assisting people with learning difficulties, or checking rivers for pollution.

One great thing about Atlantic College is its diverse student body. Students come from different social backgrounds and countries. Since the fees are PS20,000 for two years, many students need financial help. Grants are available, and a quarter of the students are British, with many receiving government support to attend.

""I really admire the college for promoting international understanding among young people,"" said Barbara Molenkamp, a student from the Netherlands. ""You learn to live with and respect others, even those you don't like. During the summer holidays, my mother noticed I argued less with my sister.""

In conclusion, Atlantic College provides an excellent education with methods that truly work."
PET_47,"Text: 'Being an older student At 32, I have just finished my first year at university. I attend lectures regularly, and I have learned to read books quickly and write long essays. I decided to go to university after being away from school for fourteen years. As a secretary, I was earning a decent amount of money, but I was bored because the job didn't challenge me. I felt stuck and became more and more unhappy. I envied the students at the local university because they seemed happy and full of hope. I wanted to be part of that. However, now that I'm a student, I find it hard to connect with younger classmates. They often think I'm a lecturer and ask me questions I can't answer. I also feel distant from the lecturers because, even though we are the same age, they know much more than I do. But I am grateful for this chance to study because I know a qualification is important for getting a rewarding job, which matters a lot to me. Unlike most eighteen-year-olds, I prefer spending weekends with my books rather than going out partying. There are also the usual student benefits like long holidays and discounts at theatres and cinemas. I often wonder what I'll do after university, but I hope that continuing my education at this age has been a good decision.'"
PET_48,"Henry Ford was born on a farm in Michigan in 1863, but he did not enjoy farming. At the age of fifteen, he started working as a mechanic. In 1893, he built his first car. After driving it for 1,500 kilometers, he sold it and made two larger cars. In 1903, he founded the Ford Motor Company. By using strong but light steel, he was able to make affordable cars for ordinary people. In 1908, he created the first Ford Model 'T', which cost $825. Soon, he was selling 100 cars every day. By 1927, the Ford Motor Company was valued at $700 million. Early Ford cars were simple and inexpensive, but this simplicity sometimes meant fewer options. Henry Ford famously said about the Model T, ""You can have any color you like, as long as it's black."""

The winters in Canada are so cold that the birds would die if they stayed. Last spring, Bill Lishman found sixteen young Canada Geese on his farm. They had lost their parents. Bill thought, 'These young birds won't know what to do in the autumn.' Bill had a small plane and decided to teach the birds to follow him. All summer, he took short trips in his plane, and the young geese flew after him. When the cold weather came in autumn, Bill flew to Virginia in the United States, 600 miles south of his home in Canada. The geese followed him all the way. Bill left the geese in Virginia and returned home. This spring, Bill waited for the birds to come back. They didn't arrive, so Bill flew to Virginia to find them.

She owns 50 sheep, and each sheep produces enough wool for six sweaters. Every six months, Stephen shears the sheep to keep them cool. Five years ago, Jenny made some sweaters with the wool and tried to sell them at country markets. But it was summer, and the weather was hot, so people didn't want to buy sweaters. She then made some socks. Everyone loved them because they were cheap, strong, and easy to wash. That's how Jenny's business began. At first, she made the socks at home, but soon she had thousands of customers, so she had to send the wool to a factory, where all the socks are now made by machines. There are six colors, five sizes for all ages, and different socks for walkers, sportsmen, and skiers. Jenny is busiest at Christmas because Corryvale socks are a popular gift.

Inspector Ian Saunders told our newspaper that the number of house burglaries has increased by more than 30% compared to last year. He also mentioned that 67% of burglaries occur when people leave and forget to close a door or window. He added that night-time burglaries are rare because families are usually at home then. However, he said that winter afternoons are the best time for burglars because it is dark, and they can't be seen easily. Also, many houses are empty at that time because people are often still at work. Inspector Saunders suggested leaving lights on in living rooms and bedrooms when you go on holiday to help deter burglars. He also encouraged neighbors to watch the other houses in the street when people are not at home and to call the police if they notice anything unusual. 'We will also tell you how to make your house safe,' Inspector Saunders said. 'This kind of help is free.''"

KET_44,"Text: 'The History of Farming Before people started farming, they went to the forest to find plants or fruit they could eat. This meant that people were always moving to find food. But about 12,000 years ago, in the Middle East, people began to grow their own food. These people were the first farmers. Farming allowed people to stay in one place, and their villages slowly grew larger. Some people in the villages could do other jobs, like making clothes, because the farmers grew food for everyone. However, farming was hard when the weather was bad, and then some people did not have enough food to eat. Today, farmers can grow more food, and it travels thousands of kilometers from where it is grown to our homes.'"

Kevin learns words more easily by seeing pictures and hearing information than by reading. Frazer wanted to help him. Frazer and Peter worked together for over 200 hours to create a computer game, and now it's ready to use. It's a speaking and picture game.

'Bollywood' is the name of the film industry in Mumbai, India. It produces almost 1,000 films each year. Since its first film in 1913, Bollywood has made over 29,000 films. This is more than the USA, making it the largest film industry in the world. Most Indians prefer watching films over any other leisure activity, and ten million of them go to the cinema every day. Bollywood films often tell romantic love stories, and singing and dancing are important parts of each film. Indian films are also popular outside India. Last year, Bollywood earned over $500 million by selling its films to other countries. Indian actors make more films each year than American actors in Hollywood, but they are not paid as much. This is why most Bollywood films cost about $2 million to make. A Hollywood film usually costs at least $5 million. Most Bollywood actors are young. They work hard but usually only for a few years. Amitabh Bachchan, who some people say is India's greatest actor, is different. He has starred in more than 140 films over an acting career of almost 40 years."

There were so many thieves stealing money in the streets that people stayed in their homes as much as possible. In 1750, Henry Fielding began paying a group of people to stop thieves. They were like policemen and were called 'Bow Street Runners' because they worked near Bow Street. Fifty years later, there were 120 Bow Street Runners, but London had become very large and needed more policemen. So, in 1829, the first Metropolitan (or London) Police Force was started with 3000 officers. Most of the men worked on foot, but a few rode horses. Until 1920, all the police in London were men. Today, London police are quite well paid, and for the few police officers who still ride horses, the pay is even better than for the others.'"

Catching the fish is easy,' he says. 'First, you break the ice and make a small round hole in it. Next, you take a fishing line and put some bread on it. Then you put the line through the hole and into the water. You pull the line up when the fish eat the bread. They are between ten and twenty centimeters long.

Then my friend Jeff, who lives in Australia, called with bad news. He can't come to stay with us during the holidays because he has a summer job. So, we can't go camping together now.

KET_11,"Text: 'Madame Tussaud's A very famous tourist attraction in London is Madame Tussaud's museum. At this museum, visitors can see wax figures of famous people. Madame Tussaud was born in France in 1761. Her uncle, who was a doctor, created wax figures of people and opened a museum for them in Paris. Marie helped her uncle with his work. In 1789, during the French Revolution, Marie was put in prison. While there, she had to make wax copies of the heads of famous people who had died, including Queen Marie Antoinette. In 1795, Marie married Francois Tussaud, and in 1802 she moved to London with her wax figures. She opened a museum there, and her figures are still on display today.'"
KET_14,"Text: 'BICYCLES The bicycle is an affordable and eco-friendly way to travel. The first bicycle was made about 150 years ago. Initially, bicycles were expensive, and only wealthy people could afford them. These early bicycles looked very different from the ones we have today. Later, as bicycles became more affordable, many people bought them. People began riding bicycles to work and during their free time. Today, people use cars more than bicycles because cars are much faster and you don't get wet when it rains. However, some people still prefer to cycle to work. They argue that there are too many cars in city centers and it's hard to find parking!'"
KET_63,"Text: 'The Elephant Show by Daniel Allsop, age 14 Last summer, I went to Thailand for a beach holiday with my family. One day, we visited a park near our hotel. It had beautiful flower gardens, but we were mainly interested in the elephant show. We went to a large square with seats on three sides. Three elephants came in with their keepers and stood in front of a big piece of white card. Each elephant got a paintbrush and started to paint on its own card. Sometimes, the keepers gave the elephants a new brush with paint and took the old one away. Slowly, following their keepers' instructions, the elephants drew pictures on the cards. I couldn't believe what I was seeing! One picture showed a river, another a tree, and the third a bunch of flowers. When the keepers held up the paintings, everyone wanted to buy one. We gave the elephants the bananas we brought for our lunch. Twenty years ago, elephants worked in the forest. Now, they don't work there anymore, but the smartest of these animals live in special centers where visitors can watch them.'"
KET_56,"Text: 'Big Cats There are many different types of big cats. They vary in size and do not look or behave the same. Tigers are the largest big cats. From head to tail, they can be 3.7 meters long. Most cats don't like water, but tigers often lie in water when it is hot! Lions are the only big cats that live in large family groups. Several lions may work together to hunt for food for the group. They usually live in flat, open areas where they can see far and easily follow other animals. All big cats need good eyesight because they hunt smaller animals for food. They also need to be fast and very strong.'"

KET_20,"Text: 'THE OSTRICH The ostrich is the largest bird in the world, and an adult can weigh more than 90 kilos. Most wild ostriches live in southern Africa, but there are only a few left. Like all birds, ostriches have wings, but they cannot fly. They use their wings to help them turn when running. Ostriches can run very fast, between 65 and 90 kilometers an hour, so it is very hard for other animals to catch them. Baby ostriches are the same size as chickens and take about 3 years to grow into adults. Ostriches eat plants and can live for many days without water.'"
KET_40,"Text: Victoria Jamieson from Britain began snowboarding at the age of 20. Now, at 23, she has won many competitions in this sport. We talked to her last week at a snowboarding competition in Switzerland and asked why she started snowboarding. She said, ""I've always liked sports, especially skiing, so snowboarding felt like a natural choice. It doesn't take long to learn, and you can become really good in a few months."" We asked if she practices a lot. She replied, ""In winter, I snowboard in the mountains every day from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. I also run and bike. But I love doing all of it! I enjoy the competitions and being in the mountains. It's so beautiful. But free-riding, which is doing what you want when you're not competing, is the best thing in the world for me."" We asked what is important when learning. She said, ""You can learn quickly, but you need lessons. It's also important to have the right clothes so you don't get wet because, at first, you spend a lot of time falling down!"""

KET_64,"Mount Kilimanjaro is the tallest mountain in Africa. Many people have climbed it, including a seven-year-old boy and an 87-year-old man. There are different paths to reach the top. The Marangu path, which is five kilometers long, is considered the easiest. It takes about five days to climb and is very popular with tourists. However, only half of the climbers make it to the top. This is often because the weather can change quickly. At the start, it might be hot and wet, but at the top, there is ice and snow, and the temperature can be below 20 degrees Celsius. Climbers need to bring both sunglasses and warm clothes!"
KET_29,"Text: 'Otters Not many people have seen an otter. These animals live near rivers and build their homes from small pieces of wood. They usually come out of their homes at night. Otters are excellent swimmers and can move through the water at more than 10 kilometers per hour. They have thick brown fur that keeps them warm in the water. An otter can close its ears and nose, allowing it to stay underwater for several minutes. Twenty years ago, there were not many otters in Great Britain. The rivers were very polluted, so many fish and insects died, and the otters couldn't find enough food. But today, there is plenty of food for them because the rivers are clean again.'"

KET_59,"Text: 'Buildings People have always built structures. We need houses to keep us warm and dry, and we build stadiums to watch football matches and concerts. We use other buildings, like museums, to store beautiful things. Many people work together on a building. The architect decides how the building will look and draws plans to show their ideas. Engineers ensure the building will be strong and safe. Then, the workers carefully construct it. The Sydney Opera House is a famous modern building with a beautiful roof. But the building is attractive from every angle, not just from above. There is also a famous roof on the Olympic Stadium in Munich. This unique building looks like a tent made of glass.'"

On one of these hills, there is a picture of a very large man. This man is called the Cerne Giant because the nearby village is named Cerne. Nobody really knows when the Cerne Giant was created, but people believe it was a very long time ago. You can walk from Cerne to get closer to the picture. If you visit on the first of May at sunrise, you will see the villagers dancing around the man on the hill.'"
KET_61,"Gail Rollins is one of the best runners in Edinburgh. This summer, she wants to compete in the 10,000 meters and maybe the 5,000 meters at the European Championships. In the past, Gail was famous for finishing second in big races. However, she always laughed and smiled, and people in her hometown love her for that. Everything changed in 2004 when she ran her first half-marathon, a very long road race. She won with the fastest time of the year for any British woman runner. Gail's manager and husband, Mike Rollins, also used to race when he was younger, but he had to stop because he injured his right leg. He can still run a little and sometimes trains with Gail. But it's not fun for Mike when Gail overtakes him and he can't catch up. Gail trains hard. She does a long run in the morning and fast runs in the afternoon. But she always takes a break from running on Sundays. ""I am with her all the time,"" says Mike. ""Sometimes I say, 'Are you sure you should be eating that?' It's usually cakes, but she can eat almost everything."""
KET_52,"Text: 'Piano players - when they were young Ivan Petrov Ivan was born on a farm in Russia. From age twelve to eighteen, he studied in Poland. His first music teacher couldn't play the piano but taught him and his sister opera songs. His mother started teaching him piano when he was six. At ten, he decided he wanted to write music and soon began his first song. Oleg Gagarin Oleg was the youngest of five children. When he was four, his father, who enjoyed playing the piano, taught him some traditional Russian music. At six, he started lessons with a piano teacher in his city. Oleg quickly began winning prizes for his piano playing. At fourteen, he went to a music college in Austria for two years, then returned to Russia. Josef Heptmann Josef's father was German but taught music in Poland, where Josef was born. The family moved to Germany when Josef was two, and he started playing the piano a year later.

He is very busy now, but one day he would like to write his own music.'"
KET_28,"Bill Prince-Smith was a farmer, teacher, and dentist before he started writing children's books at 60. Now, thirteen years later, he has written over 80 books. Every day, he writes in his office. In the evening, he gives his work to his wife to read. 'She tells me when she doesn't like something,' says Bill. 'My ten grandchildren don't live nearby, but they also read my stories and say if they are good or bad.' This way, Bill has learned what young children like to read. Bill writes about life in his village and the nearby farms. His fifth book, The Sheepdog, is his favorite. It is about a farmer and his helpful dog. 'I have always liked animals,' says Bill, 'and dogs are so clever; they learn very quickly.' Last year, the book was made into a film with real animals and actors. The filmmakers used the latest computer technology to make it look like the animals are speaking. Bill was very happy with the film. 'Sometimes filmmakers change books, but they didn't change mine, and I love the film.'"
KET_35,"Text: 'POSTCARDS Today, people enjoy sending postcards to their friends and family. These postcards usually have pictures of beaches, mountains, or castles, and you can write a message on the back. Many people send postcards when they are on holiday because they are cheap, and the pictures are often better than their own photos. The first postcard was sent at the end of the nineteenth century. It showed a picture of a town by the sea. Later, postcards had pictures of news events from that week, like an accident or an important person's visit. People liked these because newspapers did not have pictures at that time.'"

The closest living relatives of dinosaurs are birds. Dinosaurs didn't all look the same. There were more than 5000 types. Some were very small, but others were huge. The largest were bigger than any other animals that ever lived on land. The Brontosaurus, for example, was twenty meters long and ate plants. The Tyrannosaurus Rex was not as big, but it was stronger. It had sharp teeth for eating meat and could run fast because it had long back legs.'"

There are two types of black bears: One lives in the forests of North America, and the other lives in Southeast Asia. But not all black bears are black; they can be dark brown or reddish brown. Everyone loves the black and white panda bear, which comes from China. Not many pandas live in the forest today because it is hard to find food.'"

Crocodiles live in tropical areas around the world, such as Africa, South America, and Northern Australia. They usually stay in slow-moving water, but they can move quickly in water and on land. You often see crocodiles in large groups. They eat anything they catch, like fish, birds, and small animals. Sometimes, they even eat large animals or people. There are more than ten types of crocodiles, and all have very sharp teeth. They often lose their teeth, but new ones grow back quickly. Crocodiles are usually about 3.5 meters long, but some can be much bigger. Crocodiles can live for a long time. The oldest one in a zoo lived to be 66 years old."

One hundred and twenty years later, in 1903, the Wright brothers created the first plane with an engine and flew it in the United States. In 1918, the US Post Office started the first airmail service. Over the next thirty years, aeroplanes changed a lot. In the 1950s, planes became much faster because they used jet engines. In 1976, Concorde was built in the UK and France. It is the fastest passenger plane in the world and can fly at 2500 kilometres per hour, making the trip from London to New York only four hours long. Today, millions of people travel by plane, and it is hard to imagine a world without them.'"
KET_47,"Text: 'The Globe Theatre Visiting the theatre in London 400 years ago was very different from visiting a modern theatre. The building was round, there was no roof, and people got cold and wet if the weather was bad. The queen enjoyed going to the Globe Theatre, by the River Thames, to watch the plays of William Shakespeare. All the actors at that time were men. The audience ate, talked to their friends, walked around during the show, and some people even threw things at the actors! Today, you can still visit the Globe Theatre. A new theatre is in the same place near the river. You can watch a Shakespeare play there or learn about life in the seventeenth century.'"

I'm having a great holiday in Australia. When we arrived two weeks ago, the weather was bad and it was cold. Now the weather is better, and we go to the beach every day. This week we are staying in Sydney, but next week we will go to the Great Barrier Reef. The water there is very warm, and I love swimming. The fish are all different here: red, yellow, purple! Australia is very beautiful. We don't want to come home!

See you at the end of September.
