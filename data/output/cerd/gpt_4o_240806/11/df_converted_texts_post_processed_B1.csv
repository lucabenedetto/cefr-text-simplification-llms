CPE_15,C2,"'Garbage in, garbage out Charging families for each bag of rubbish they produce seems like a good idea for the environment and economy. But it might not be. In many developed countries, people have their rubbish collected regularly. They put their rubbish bags or bins outside, and a special truck takes them away. Usually, this service is free because it is paid for by local taxes. This means a family that throws away a lot of rubbish pays the same as a couple that throws away very little. However, getting rid of rubbish is not free. The more rubbish there is, the more collectors and trucks are needed, and the more local authorities have to pay for landfill. This is a basic economic problem: if rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish. The simple solution is to make people pay for the rubbish they throw away. This would encourage them to throw out less and recycle more, if there are places to recycle. But two American economists, Don Fullerton and Thomas Kinnaman, found that this idea can have unexpected and sometimes disappointing results. They studied several American towns and cities that started charging for rubbish. The most common system is to sell stickers or tags for rubbish bags or cans. Only bags with these labels are collected. In a study, they looked at a scheme in Charlottesville, Virginia, where people paid 80 cents for each tagged bag. The number of bags fell by 37%, but this was because people packed more rubbish into each bag. The weight of rubbish collected fell by only 14%. In other Virginian cities without this scheme, the weight fell by 3.5% anyway. Some people also dumped rubbish illegally to avoid paying. This is hard to measure, but it might account for 30-40% of the reduction in collected rubbish. On the positive side, recycling increased by 15%, but this might not be because of the fee, as many people were already recycling. In another study, Fullerton and Kinnaman found that charging for rubbish does reduce the weight of rubbish, but not by much. A 10% increase in sticker prices only reduces rubbish by 0.3%. To reduce rubbish a lot, people would need to buy less of everything. A small fee is unlikely to change much. Other factors, like income and education, might be just as important as price. In richer towns, people throw away more rubbish and have less time to recycle. So, should we stop charging for rubbish? Not really. Free disposal is too cheap. But simple policies can have complex effects, and sometimes the results are not what we expect.'"
CPE_19,C2,"**Work and Change**
Theodore Zeldin talks about how our work life might change. Do you feel respected and appreciated at work? Just having a successful career is not enough anymore. Many people feel their jobs are not valued or understood. Even famous people can feel unhappy. Loving your job used to be special, but now you need to think about how your job affects you as a person, your mind, character, and relationships. This is important. No matter how good you are at your job, if it makes you boring or unable to talk to others outside your field, or if you are too busy to learn new things or be creative, then no amount of money or status will make up for it.
I am exploring how work can help us grow as people, instead of just shaping us to fit industrial needs. Work should not only be about making money but also about living a fulfilling life, discovering new talents, and meeting different people. This change does not mean ending unemployment. As people become more educated, they want jobs that are interesting and meaningful. A career should be like a work of art, with a happy person at its center.
Even traditional jobs like doctors, accountants, and architects are not as appealing as they used to be. Doctors are often more stressed than their patients. Accountants worry about their profession's ethics. Architects rarely get to be creative. Administrators are stuck in bureaucracy. Middle managers are losing confidence in their roles. Companies and public institutions are getting smaller. Ideas like decentralizing decisions and rewarding performance have not made employees more committed. In Britain, only 8% of employees strongly feel their values match their organization's values.
I am studying different jobs to see how they shape or sometimes harm people. I have looked at how different cultures expand what humans can do and how courage can be developed. I have focused on happiness, love, friendship, and respect. Now, I am looking for more satisfying ways to work. Many experts focus on making companies last longer and earn more money, but we also need to think about what kind of people we want to be and who we want to spend our lives with. How many of us feel truly alive at work? How many of us are like part-time slaves, stuck in jobs because we see no other choice?
Take hotel workers, for example. Ten percent of people work in the hospitality industry. Many smart and lively people work long hours for low pay and little respect. Hotels have not changed much since the days of the Ritz. They are not just places to sleep but could be cultural centers where people from around the world meet. Hotel staff, often foreigners eager to learn, have only brief interactions with guests. Hotels could connect guests with the city and each other. They could use the skills of the students they hire, instead of giving them only simple tasks. If hotels focused on their staff's true ambitions, they could offer many more services. But accountants often say hotels should focus on one main activity to make the most money.
It's time to rethink what work means, from a human perspective, not just a financial one. Work is a relationship. People want jobs that allow them to be independent and express themselves. They should have the chance to design their own jobs and choose their colleagues and customers, within practical and profitable limits. This means they need to communicate beyond professional language and connect with different minds. Everyone knows communication is important, but true conversation is different. It is a deeper connection that creates respect and can change you. It is more than just relaxing; it is a way to create equality. Every meaningful conversation changes the world a little bit."
CPE_24,C2,"**Broadcasting: The Social Shaping of a Technology**
The word 'broadcasting' originally meant spreading seeds by hand over a large area. This is not just an agricultural term; it also represents the idea of planned growth and success. Broadcasting involves spreading information from a central source, much like planting seeds from a central bucket.
When new technology allowed words and pictures to be sent electronically, it was organized in a way that fit this agricultural metaphor. Television, like the telegraph and telephone, is a form of communication. However, from the start, it was seen as a central 'mass' medium, sending information from one place to many homes. This matched the social and economic structures of modern societies.
There were some experiments with different ways of organizing television. For example, in the 1930s, radio amateurs in Britain tried two-way television, similar to a telephone. Magazines like Radio News showed how to build TV transmitters and receivers. But in 1938, big companies set standards that pushed these small experiments aside.
In the early 1930s, television was mostly watched in public places, not just in the USA but also in Britain and Germany. Public viewing was common, and some thought it might challenge the idea of TV as a home-based medium. However, as technology improved and prices dropped, TV sets became more common in homes.
As people in Western countries gained better living standards from the 1920s, the idea of the home as a center for entertainment became possible. This trend is now happening worldwide. Broadcasting became a way for governments to efficiently reach all citizens and create a sense of national community.
Broadcasting also played a role in democracy, providing equal access to information for informed participation in society. However, as technology changes, the term 'broadcasting' might become outdated, referring only to a specific period of centralized media."
CPE_13,C2,"**Clutter**
Sometimes it feels like no matter how many things you own, you never feel safe. It's normal to want a home that meets your needs, but sometimes the desire to get more things goes too far. Modern advertising is made to make us feel insecure. It often tells us that if we don't have certain things, we are not good enough. To see how much you are influenced, try not to read any advertising signs next time you walk down the street. These expensive messages try to convince us to buy things in very clever ways, often without us noticing. We see them everywhere - on TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, t-shirts, the internet - all telling us to buy, buy, buy.
**Caves**
Research centers and universities around the world have spent many years studying caves, especially their origins, water systems, and life forms. Caves are a small but mysterious part of nature, which makes us curious and eager to learn more about them. Because they are natural wonders, caves have been studied for a long time, especially in places where they have affected how people live. However, visiting many caves requires physical skill, so cave research is often done by both scientists and people who explore caves for fun.
**Weather Watch**
Many observant people, using only their senses, started the study of weather, which has become a very technical science since the 17th century. Satellites and electronic tools now give us a lot of weather information quickly, and computers solve complex math problems faster than humans can. Weather science uses many long words that are hard for non-experts to understand. It might seem like there is no room for simple weather knowledge, but that's not true. Human experience is still important for turning computer data into weather forecasts. Human observations can still give unusual information that helps professionals understand the atmosphere better."
CPE_16,C2,"**MUSIC AND THEATRE**
Until recently, I thought opera was mainly theatre. Now, I see that opera is mostly about music. I learned this while working at a national opera house. In theatre, the words and the actors are most important. There is no one directing the action once the play starts, and the audience usually speaks the same language as the performers.
At a music performance, like in a concert hall or opera house, many people, like me, might not understand music technically. Some might feel embarrassed about this, but most are amazed by the performers' skills. A great singer or a perfect orchestra is easy to admire. Even a good musician shows years of hard work. Watching top-class music is like watching a sports match. We know athletes do something similar to us running for a bus, but they do it much better.
Theatre audiences have different expectations. They might not understand an actor's skill and might not be impressed by something that seems easy to do. They often ask actors, ""How do you learn all those lines?"" This doesn't mean theatre audiences are less demanding than music audiences. Many people go to both. But in theatre, audiences and performers meet on more equal terms, no matter how difficult the play is.
Does music need to learn from theatre about this relationship? I think yes. Music performances are full of emotion and can be very theatrical. But the way music is presented, with strict dress codes and respect for conductors and soloists, can feel too formal. Sometimes, audiences clap at the wrong time, which can interrupt the performance.
Many people are working to make music more accessible and to break down barriers. I remember a special event, Jonathan Dove's community opera ""In Search of Angels,"" which moved from a cathedral to the town. It was a high-quality musical experience and life-changing for many in the audience, who also participated.
I wish music had more of the risk and excitement that theatre can have. Sometimes, using unusual locations can surprise both performers and audiences. It might be uncomfortable, but theatre audiences are used to following artists into unexpected places. Most plays are performed in a traditional way, like in a concert hall. But I believe music conventions can change. I love both theatre and music and want more people to enjoy them as much as I do."
CPE_21,C2,"**Sand**
I admire how sand can be turned into useful things like glass and concrete. However, I don't like sand in its natural form. For me, it is a difficult barrier between a car park by the sea and the water. Sand blows in your face, gets in your food, and hides important things like car keys and coins. When you are wet, sand sticks to you like glue and is hard to remove, even with a strong water spray. But, strangely, when you step onto a beach towel, get into a car, or walk on a clean carpet, sand falls off you. For days, you find sand on the floor every time you take off your shoes, and more sand appears when you remove your socks. Sand stays with you longer than some illnesses. I prefer to avoid sand.
**Lock and Key**
People have always wanted a safe home for privacy and security. In the past, a wooden beam might have blocked the door, but now we have electronic locks that use plastic cards. These cards can have more combinations than there are atoms in the universe. However, people still want to keep out the 'bad guys'. The idea of a lock and key is partly psychological. Some companies have tried using computerized locks with smart cards that control electronic locks. But people don't like them much. At work, it might be okay, but at home, everyone wants the comfort of turning a real key in a lock. So, when a locksmith company made a new electronic system, they included a real metal key in it.
**Modern Art**
I was nervous about visiting the new Tate Modern gallery because, like many people, I don't understand modern art. I know I like some of it, especially furry things, neon light sculptures, and big photos. Maybe if I knew more about it, I would have more opinions. But you are not supposed to analyze art like a school essay. The idea is to let art communicate with you. This is a great idea, but it never worked for me. However, this new gallery tries to help visitors understand the art. The first thing I noticed were the labels. These labels explain the art and tell you what it is trying to say. Instead of just staring at the pictures, these bits of information helped me understand."
CPE_46,C2,"**Every Picture Tells a Story**
Adapting novels into films often means reducing, condensing, and deleting parts of the story. This can be frustrating for writers, but it can also be enlightening. When I worked on a script, I noticed that I could remove a lot of dialogue and description from a scene in the novel and still convey the same message. This doesn't mean the original dialogue and description were unnecessary. It's about the kind of attention each medium requires from the audience and the type of repetition each uses. In a novel, repetition might include mentioning character traits multiple times or using speech tags like ""he said."" These help readers understand the story better. In stage drama, which is mostly speech, real conversation is imitated with some style. In some modern plays, this is extreme, making the dialogue seem full of unnecessary language, only serving to connect speakers without clear communication.
**Watching Movies**
Watching movies can make you feel like you're part of the film's world. It's an experience that takes you away from reality for the film's duration. Once the movie ends and the lights come on, you're back in the real world. People often don't feel responsible for the time spent watching a film, and this feeling of unreality can make it hard to take movies seriously as an art form. In the past, some people, including our parents' generation and teachers, saw movies as just entertainment, not art. They enjoyed being entertained but didn't consider movies to be an art form.
**The Film Studios**
The Leiper Film Company studios were a mix of many different buildings. The layout was confusing and hard to understand. There were a few permanent landmarks like the Script Department, but most rooms looked the same and were used for meetings. Finding a specific room was difficult without help. The studio didn't have a clear main entrance, which added to the confusion. There were three main entrances, all similar, and only one led to where you wanted to go. There was no place to ask for directions. Strangers rarely visited because the studio didn't encourage it. Employees, however, knew their way around and worked together to create movies that brought romance and adventure to audiences. For a few hours, characters like Jane and George, Sally and Dick, would escape from everyday problems, thanks to the studio's efforts.
**Film-makers**
Many people want to make movies. Bookshops have many 'how-to' books on scriptwriting and film production. Universities offer courses, and there are competitions for aspiring filmmakers. Robert Rodriguez made the film El Mariachi with a low budget of $7,000, which made him famous among American independent directors. In his book about making Mariachi, he recalls his 23rd birthday, thinking about how Orson Welles made Citizen Kane at 25 and Spielberg made Jaws at 26. He felt he had only a few years to make his breakthrough film. In the past, filmmakers took time to mature. They worked behind the scenes as editors, writers, or cinematographers and directed low-budget films to learn the craft. John Huston was 35 when he made his first film, The Maltese Falcon. Fred Zinnemann, director of High Noon, found success in his forties. Today, without studio or TV support, aspiring filmmakers often have to be independent."
CPE_3,C2,"In those days, the council houses covered the western side of the city. They were rows of small, dull houses made of orange half-brick or pale white stucco. In summer, chemicals from the May and Baker factory, two miles away, would fill the air with a strong smell of sulphur. The most common sight in that part of Norwich early in the morning was a paperboy wrinkling his nose as he walked up to someone's door. I have forgotten most of my early life, but I remember sitting near an upstairs window, looking at the houses as they disappeared into the distance. Later, I have other memories - faces I can't name, my mother ironing towels in a house that I don't think was ours, and snow falling over the big mansion at Earlham.
My mother often appears in these early memories. I remember her as a small, precise, and often angry woman. I never understood why she was angry, so I couldn't do anything to make her happy. Even as a child, when I went with her to the small shops in Bunnett Square or on longer trips into the city, I knew she was different. She was the most solitary person I have ever known, as alone in a room full of people as on a moor. She also had a strict sense of proper behavior, which was unusual in West Earlham. This sometimes led to furious cleaning or handwashing and telling me to 'behave properly'. I didn't understand this as a child, and even now, I'm not sure I do. It meant not walking into neighbors' gardens or damaging their rose bushes, sitting quietly in the dining room with hands folded, listening to radio programs my mother liked, and many other rules.
Despite her solitude, my mother had some friends. There was Mrs. Buddery, who loved the Royal Family, Mrs. Winall, who rarely spoke, and Mrs. Laband, who was livelier and not fully approved by the others. Later, I realized they were not great company. They often talked about bad legs, cold weather, and ungrateful children, a group I felt I was part of. Looking back, it felt like a heavy weight of the West Earlham houses, my mother and her friends, and the need to 'behave properly' was on my shoulders, and I needed to grow up to lift it. This was not easy. Growing up in West Earlham followed a set pattern. Until you were five, you stayed at home. I remember boring days when I was about four, playing on a rug while my mother sat in an armchair. After your fifth birthday, you went to Avenue Road infants school, half a mile towards the city. Some lucky children had a mother with a bike and a child seat. I think my mother let other children take me to school.
If I remember anything about these early years, it's the summer holidays. These were days when you saw glimpses of the world outside West Earlham. There was an old man next to Mrs. Buddery who told stories about his time in the Merchant Navy. Once, there was a charity event at a house far away, where a kind woman gave out lemonade and tried to interest me in something called the League of Pity, a junior charity. But my mother dismissed it, saying they were 'only after your money'. My mother often talked about people wanting money, and she had a low opinion of politicians. She thought of the House of Commons as a place where rich people took money from the public. I might be exaggerating, but my mother didn't have much kindness. However, she did care about my education. Sometimes on Sundays, she would take me on the 85 bus to the Norwich Castle Museum. We would walk through rooms of paintings by the Norwich School of Artists. My mother didn't mind this activity and even started to have opinions on the paintings. I remember her once joking about a painting of a Roman soldier, saying, 'Well, I wouldn't like to meet him on a dark night!' This was a rare moment of humor from her."
CPE_10,C2,"**Philadelphia Avenue**
I walked down Philadelphia Avenue on the side with odd numbers. The evening was getting darker, and the air was thick with a light, prickly rain. This made my walk feel secretive and special. I knew this side of the street very well; it was where our neighbors, the Matzes and the Pritchards, lived, along with Han Kieffer's grocery store, and the homes of my first friends, all girls. Even though I didn't know everyone by name, each house was unique to me, just like the small channels in the sidewalk that carried rainwater to the street. As the street went downhill, the houses seemed to get smaller, and the front yards became tiny. Over the years, things had changed: wooden porch railings and pillars were replaced with wrought iron, in a style that seemed Southern or Spanish. In Shillington, some houses I remembered as homes had become stores, and some stores, like Pep Conrad's and Han Kieffer's, had become homes again. I wondered how people lived in those spaces that used to be shops.
**Bachelor Fads**
Rick Gilbert, a furniture designer, lives in a flat that used to be a curtain warehouse. It has typical loft features like exposed brickwork and big doors. But Gilbert didn't want an open-plan space because it was hard to separate work from home life. So, he used a large sheet of corrugated plastic to divide the space. This created a hallway and led the eye to the kitchen in the middle of the flat. He wanted the kitchen to be a neutral area for both cooking for friends and making coffee for clients. To balance the modern look of the plastic and steel, he used light wood for the floors and filled the flat with sentimental furniture from his parents or markets.
**Bruce Chatwin**
Bruce Chatwin's life was full of secrets and stories. He was a brilliant writer, and his first book, ""In Patagonia,"" published in 1977, changed travel writing. It was exciting like a thriller and imaginative like romantic fiction. Chatwin often mixed fact with fiction to make his stories more interesting. He believed that through travel, one could discover histories that seemed to exist just to fascinate future explorers.
**Swimming**
One summer, during a heavy rain, I swam in the pool behind my house. The rain made bubbles on the water, and when the storm got stronger, it felt like the pool was rising to meet the sky. It was then, in the summer of 1996, that I thought about swimming across Britain. I wanted to follow the rain to the sea and escape the routine of swimming back and forth in a pool. Many places today are labeled and explained, but activities like walking, cycling, and swimming let us explore the wild and mysterious parts of the world. A swimming journey would let me experience the mystery of nature, like dark woods or high mountains."
CPE_67,C2,"'CRYING Charles Darwin thought that humans cry for no clear reason. He was probably wrong. More recently, scientists have said that crying is important for social reasons. Psychiatrist John Bowlby said crying helps create a bond between mother and child. Many people think that tears, especially in children, show helplessness. But why adults cry is harder to understand. It seems that the sound of crying is less important than what it shows visually. Crying might have helped early human groups by building trust and social connections. Tears can also happen for other reasons. We might cry to show sympathy for people facing injustice. Also, we might cry without wanting to, which can be embarrassing, when we hear beautiful music or moving speeches. We might cry during a sad movie, but this happens more often when we are with others than when we are alone. The social role of crying seems clear, but research is still ongoing.'"
CPE_27,C2,"**The Heat is On**
We all know about global warming, but how much warmer will the Earth get, and how will it change our lives? Many people have an idea of what global warming is, but not everyone knows its effects. A warmer climate will likely change the weather everywhere. Since the atmosphere is connected to everything on Earth, changes in climate will affect plants, animals, water, and soil. Humans use these natural resources to grow food, build cities, and support billions of people. Any changes to these resources are important.
The problem is understanding how the world will change and what causes these changes. In the last 100 years, human actions have increased the amount of certain gases in the atmosphere, which are linked to global temperature. These gases are likely affecting the climate, but we don't fully understand how the global heat balance works, making the future uncertain. We do know that greenhouse gases and global temperatures have changed together over the past 40,000 years, suggesting they are related. Evidence shows that Earth's surface has warmed by about 0.6°C over the past century. Most scientists believe this warming is partly due to human pollution.
A lot of research uses computer programs called general circulation models (GCMs) to predict climate conditions. These programs use physics and chemistry to study temperature, pressure, solar radiation, and other factors. However, they are not perfect and can be slow and costly. We don't fully understand all climate processes, but we know the climate system is complex. Despite these challenges, most people agree that climate change is happening faster than before. GCMs help us understand what the world might be like in the future.
Currently, predictions suggest that by 2100, the average global temperature will rise by 1°C to 3.5°C, sea levels will rise by 15-95 cm, and rainfall patterns will change. Extreme weather, like heatwaves, floods, and droughts, may become more common. These changes could impact the environment and humans. Climate change can affect where ecosystems like forests and grasslands are located, the species they contain, and their ability to provide benefits to society. This includes food production, water resources, and human settlements. Some effects may be irreversible and harmful, but not all. Some impacts might be beneficial. For example, in Australia, warmer temperatures have increased wheat yields since 1952.
However, many predicted effects of climate warming are not beneficial. Small climate changes can affect water availability, especially in dry regions or areas with existing shortages. The Mediterranean Basin is one example, where rainfall patterns have changed. Another effect is changes to glaciers, which will impact ice, vegetation, wildlife, and human structures. The Arctic ice might melt completely, making transport and exploration easier but increasing iceberg risks.
The most visible effect of global warming could be rising sea levels. This happens because warmer water takes up more space and melting ice adds to the ocean. With half of the world's population living in coastal areas, rising sea levels could cause severe problems. Cities like London, New York, and Tokyo might face flooding. Many people could lose their homes, creating environmental refugees. Small island nations could be most affected, as they might disappear if sea levels rise too much. This would be devastating for their people and culture, and other countries would need to help those displaced."
CPE_66,C2,"'Mission to Mars Wanted: a middle-aged, married couple for a 501-day trip to Mars and back. Applicants must be strong both physically and emotionally. This will be the profile of the first astronauts to go to Mars if multi-millionaire Dennis Tito's plans to launch a capsule on 5 January 2018 are successful. The capsule will take the crew to about 160 km above Mars. The spacecraft will use Mars's gravity to return to Earth without using more fuel, as saving fuel is very important. The 2018 date is set because the next time Mars and Earth are in the right position for a launch is in 2031. It is a big challenge, and new technologies need to be developed quickly. If everything is ready in time, the spacecraft might succeed. But even if it doesn't launch, the work done will help future missions.'"
CPE_44,C2,"'AESTHETICS Sometimes, the existence of art can make it hard to understand aesthetic theory. This is because art is often seen as just physical objects like buildings, books, paintings, or statues, separate from human experience. However, the real art is what these objects do in our experiences. This misunderstanding can make it difficult to truly understand art. Also, when art becomes famous and admired for a long time, it can create fixed ideas that block new insights. Once art is considered classic, it often gets separated from the human experiences and conditions that created it. This separation makes it hard to see the true meaning of art, which is what aesthetic theory tries to explain. Art is often put in a special category, away from other human activities and achievements. 
The main job for someone writing about the philosophy of art is to connect art with everyday life experiences. Just like mountains are part of the earth, art is part of human experience. To understand art, we need to look at ordinary experiences, not just the art itself. For example, to understand how plants flower, we need to know about soil, air, water, and sunlight. Similarly, to understand art, we need to start with everyday events and scenes that catch our attention and give us enjoyment. 
Many people enjoy things like movies, jazz, and comic strips without thinking of them as art. This is because art is often seen as something only found in museums and galleries. But the desire for enjoyable experiences finds its way into everyday life. People who disagree with the idea of art being only in museums still often separate art from everyday life. The best times for appreciating art are when it is closely connected to everyday activities.'"
CPE_22,C2,"**Observing Lions**
People often think of lions hunting as a perfect team. In the evening light, a group of quiet lions jumps from the shadows and surrounds their prey. Lions seem like social animals that work together for a common goal, like getting their next meal. However, after many years of watching lions in the wild, we have a different view. We started our research in 1978, hoping to learn why lions hunt together, raise cubs, and scare off rivals with loud roars. If an animal's success is measured by how many surviving offspring it has, then working together might not always be best. If an animal is too generous, others benefit at its cost. So, why don't lions follow the usual rules of self-interest? We thought we could answer this in two to three years. But lions are very good at doing nothing. Like the noble gases krypton, argon, and neon, we would add lions to the list of things that don't react much. It has taken many research methods to find clues about lion behavior. Since wild lions can live up to 18 years, we are only now getting answers to our questions.
**Pop Music Review**
The release of Bedrock's third album was a big moment for the band. ""New Life"" started a movement that changed rock music in this country for the rest of the decade. The old style of serious music with loud guitars was replaced by a lighter, more melodic style. The album mixed social observations with humor and irony. Bedrock showed they were good at collecting different styles and writing songs. They sang about traditional English topics like sunbathing and Sunday afternoons. But the album's real strength was in its deeper, more emotional songs like ""So Low"" and ""To the Brink."" ""New Life"" is a beautiful album with 16 high-quality tracks and no filler, which is rare in the era of long CDs.
**Extract from an Autobiography**
As a child, I was fascinated by stories of ""The Sibyl,"" wise women from the ancient world. I first heard about them in a story my mother told me. An old woman offered nine books to the King of Rome for 300 gold pieces. He refused, and she burned three books, offering the remaining six for the same price. When he refused again, she burned three more books. He finally bought the last three for the full price. I learned a lesson about salesmanship and life from this story. As a lonely child, I often asked to play with others and was refused. My mother told me to do something interesting so others would want to join me. It worked, and I never forgot that lesson. When I was asked to write a travel book, I looked for something I was interested in. I'm not a big traveler, so I sent my editor a list of places I didn't want to go. I'm only interested in ruins because I like to travel through time in my mind.
**What Becomes of Your Manuscript?**
When you submit your manuscript, it usually goes into a pile waiting to be sorted. This pile is called the slush pile. The person sorting it is often a junior editor or an experienced freelancer. They don't have much influence, but they want to find something original. The junior editor wants to make a name for themselves, and the freelancer wants to keep their job. If they like your novel, they will pass it to a senior editor. At an acquisition meeting, the editor must justify accepting your novel based on its quality and potential sales. They also consider if you, as an author, seem like a long-term prospect. They will have to say how promotable you are, which is important for a new novel. Publishers often like to meet a potential author before making an offer."
CPE_39,C2,"**Advertising Challenges in the Early 1990s**
If you worked in an advertising agency in the early 1990s, you probably faced a very difficult time. The recession was severe, affecting many countries for the first time in thirty years. In Britain, 1991 was especially tough. The economy shrank, interest rates were high, people spent less, many lost their jobs, and thousands of homes were repossessed. Every business felt the impact, with some industries like vehicle and building trades seeing a 30% drop.
Advertising professionals were not the only ones losing jobs, but those who kept their jobs felt a lot of pressure. They were expected to help improve company profits while working with smaller budgets. They were told to achieve more with less money. Despite these challenges, the importance of marketing grew. Companies started focusing more on creating products and services that customers wanted, rather than just what was easy to produce. This shift increased the status of marketing professionals but also added to their responsibilities.
Marketing was seen as a solution to many problems, and since about half of marketing budgets were spent on advertising, the pressure was on advertising professionals. The 1980s were a great time for advertising, but the 1990s started with a downturn. This was partly due to the economy, but also because companies began questioning the value of advertising. They wanted to know exactly what they were getting for their money.
Client companies demanded better strategies, creativity, and media placement from advertising agencies. They wanted the best people working hard to produce excellent work. Advertising professionals faced the same challenge as their clients: doing more with less. The recession made it hard to take risks, which are often needed for good advertising.
Other challenges included demographic changes, the growing power of retailers, changing consumer needs, more legal restrictions, and the challenge of advertising in foreign markets. These factors forced advertisers to rethink their strategies. They needed to figure out which parts of their advertising were effective.
Finding help to improve advertising was not easy. Companies and agencies were busy dealing with these challenges and were not eager to share their successful strategies. Conferences and seminars offered some help, but books on advertising often did not provide practical advice. They sometimes gave the false impression that all advertising work was of high quality and good value for money, which was not always true."
CPE_18,C2,"**The Lure of the Kitchen**
When I was at university, I decided I wanted to be a chef. This was not a common choice among my friends. Cooking was not a popular job that many of us wanted. Being a chef seems difficult: the work is long, stressful, and not well-paid. But these things didn't stop me. I was unhappy at university. The studies were hard, and the social life was closed and self-important. Being a chef seemed like the perfect way to escape from that. It offered a seriousness and honesty that I didn't find in my college life. But my wish to cook was not just because I was a student. It also showed an artistic dream. I first saw this dream when I ate a meal at a famous London restaurant. It was amazing. I still remember my starter. After that meal, I wanted to thank the chef who made it. I felt happy for days. After this, I wanted to learn the secrets of this wonderful art. I changed my student life to prepare for my future in cooking. My history degree felt empty, taking me away from my real goal. I learned about cooking by reading cookbooks, visiting markets, and making fancy meals.
**The Swimming Instructor**
The school's swimming teacher was a former drill sergeant, small and strong, with tattooed arms. When I asked him to teach me how to dive, he told me to sit on the pool's edge, put my hands above my head, and roll forward, pushing off with my feet. I practiced that move until the hour was over. The next time, he had me stand up and dive off the edge. The instructor was strict, and every time I came up from the water, he looked at me with disapproval: 'Don't look down, look up!' 'Keep your legs straight.' 'Point your toes, I said!' The next week, I went up onto the high board. It was a fixed board, and its front edge bent slightly downward. It seemed very high as I stood there, trying to be brave. Slowly, the echoing voices disappeared, and I felt like I was in silence. I moved my arms as I was taught, tried to look up, not down, and jumped into the air. For a brief moment, I was flying. When I hit the water, I fell awkwardly, and my legs were everywhere. The instructor looked at me with contempt and shook his head. But even he could not take away my happiness. That's what they mean by 'free as a bird', I thought.
**The Traveller**
For those of us who value a comfortable bed, running water, and the chance to live at least until tomorrow, the idea of the traveller is both confusing and interesting. These are people who choose to risk their lives by climbing dangerous mountains, sailing alone in small boats through big seas, eating insects if there is nothing else, and living for months in the unknown. It is easy to see these people as strange - and they are - like hermits, freefall divers, or writers. They exist, but their unusual world is far from our daily life and can be ignored, we think, as unimportant. We can go back to our world of microwave ovens and phones, happy that the only risks we face are predictable ones, like crossing a busy street.
**Sailing**
Jonathan Raban is afraid of the sea, saying it is not his natural place, which is probably why he spends so much time on it. He does not say he is a top sailor, though he is clearly a good one. His main reason for sailing is that, as a writer, he likes to write about sailing. Sailing gives him exciting stories to write about. Raban's small boat has an electronic device that tells sailors their exact position anywhere on earth. He likes this tool, but he also has a simple view of other sailing aids. He thinks the compass was a bad invention, causing a 'big change in the relationship between man and sea'. Raban believes that since it was invented, about a thousand years ago, it has become the main focus for sailors, so they no longer study the waves and feel the sea. The ocean, once full of life, is now just a space. Since the sailor's job is just to stay on course, he can be replaced by an autopilot for long times. This may be why Raban had time to look so carefully at the waves."
CPE_62,C2,"**Holiday Reading**
Summer gives us two great joys: leaving home and reading books. These joys are connected. Books help us feel more at home in the world. We can relate to experiences in books, even if they were written long ago or far away. In books, we find our own thoughts and feelings. Authors can describe situations we thought were unique to us. They express our thoughts clearly, which we might struggle to do. This is even more amazing if the book was written in a different place or time. We feel thankful to these authors for helping us understand ourselves. Through reading and travel, we break free from routine. Our eyes are most open when we are in a new place or reading a great book. Books help us notice things we ignored before. We become aware of the sky's colors, a friend's behavior, or a hidden sadness we didn't know we had.
**Author's Note**
These travel reflections were published in the Observer newspaper over seven years. I have made some small changes, but added very little. I corrected a few mistakes, but only if they were important. For example, in an article about China, I thought the Hong Kong dollar would stay strong, but it fell a year later. If I changed the article to predict this, it wouldn't be a true report from that time. Like any traveler, I was there at that moment, not knowing what would happen next. This is the story of mass travel: the world opening up to people who can afford a ticket. I believe that travelers are not blind. Even a postcard can have a purpose.
**Ecotourism**
If there were awards for overused tourism phrases, ""ecotourism"" would win. The term started in the early 1980s, when people became more aware of the environment. Tour operators realized travelers wanted to believe their trips wouldn't harm the environment. ""Ecotourism"" became a popular marketing term. Now, it includes anything from living with remote tribes to a short boat trip. Any tour with cultural interaction, nature, wildlife, or adventure is called ecotourism. The original idea was to help people make informed choices, but without clear rules, travelers are confused about what ecotourism really means.
**Transylvanian Journey**
I lost my notebook from my Transylvanian journey for 50 years, but found it again by luck. It helped me remember that time, but not completely. In Transylvania, I had an easier time than expected, staying in friendly country houses for weeks. When I stopped traveling, I stopped writing, thinking there was nothing to record. I was slow to start writing again, and sometimes only made short notes. I worried that some details might be out of order, but then decided it didn't matter. This book is not a guidebook, so I let the story tell itself."
CPE_49,C2,"**Fashion**
Fashion is often thought of as a modern idea, linked to the growth of capitalism in the 1800s and 1900s. However, many fashion historians say that fashion, in terms of style and design, has a long history. They often start with the market and trade growth in the 1500s and 1600s. As societies have become more complex, populations have grown, and new ways to make different clothes and accessories have been found, the meanings of clothing have also become more complex. Today, it is hard to say exactly what any piece of clothing or accessory means. For example, a man's suit, which seems very uniform, can have different meanings in different situations and to different people.
**Writer**
News stories about publishers fighting over new manuscripts have given a false idea of what life is like for most novelists. For those of us not on the best-seller lists, there are two ways to make a living. The smartest among us write in the evenings and have other full-time jobs that are secure even if the book doesn't sell well or become a movie. Others, like me, do various small jobs, such as teaching, running workshops, and writing articles like this one. I've heard of a writing job at a chocolate factory, but I've never gotten anything like that. Somehow, by juggling part-time jobs and credit cards, and often with help from the people thanked in the Acknowledgements, the novel gets written.
**Sudden Fame**
The small places we were performing at around the country were starting to sell out, and extra security was needed to manage the growing number of screaming girls. We had to use secret entrances to the venues to avoid being surrounded by fans. On the few nights we weren't working, it was hard to leave the house without being chased by followers. In just a few days, we became celebrities. Our fans watched our every move, and our management and others took care of all our needs. Even though I was always shy, it was replaced by a strange confidence that only naturally shy people in similar situations can understand. In short, I was emotionally overwhelmed."
CPE_31,C2,"**Music - The Future Challenges**
Technology is changing our lives at work, home, and in our free time. Susan Hallam talks about how this affects music in Britain. In the late 20th century, we had more ways to listen to music, like radio, TV, records, tapes, CDs, and videos. But, live music performances and full-time jobs for musicians have decreased. More people can now access music, which meets many human needs. Music is important for national events and personal activities. A world without music is hard to imagine. The question is not if there will be music in the 21st century, but what kind of music it will be and if people will still want to learn musical instruments.
I believe people will still want to learn instruments. The music industry is a big part of Britain's economy, and musical skills are important for many jobs, especially in media. Playing an instrument can also help develop skills early in life. Research in the USA shows that music can improve spatial reasoning, a part of intelligence. Although these results need more proof, studies in Europe show that group music lessons can improve social skills and concentration in children.
Research is also looking at how playing an instrument can help develop other skills. For example, regular practice can help with good study habits, and playing in concerts can teach punctuality and organization. Because of these benefits, there will likely be a demand for music lessons in the short term.
In the long term, music might change in two ways. First, people will listen to more diverse music, with new genres mixing different styles. Second, technology will be used more in composing and performing music, making it easier for people to create music without needing technical skills. This might reduce the need for live performances. More people of all ages might want to make music in their communities, reflecting their local traditions.
To prepare for this future, music teaching needs to change. More people should be able to learn different instruments throughout their lives. The way we teach and assess music will need to adapt to include a wider range of skills. Musicians will need to inspire and teach people of all ages, work with large groups, and have skills in communication, social interaction, and management. This is a big change from traditional methods and will require accountability. This change is an opportunity to show the quality of music education.
Finally, we need to raise the importance of music in our lives. Music is crucial but often taken for granted. Everyone in the music profession should work together to change this."
CPE_58,C2,"**The Actor's Craft**
Sometimes, people make fun of actors. This often happens because actors talk about their work in interviews. They should respond like the dancer Pavlova, who said, ""If I could tell you, I wouldn't dance it."" Instead, actors often use boring phrases or get caught up in gossip. Paul Scofield, a famous actor, once wrote to a friend that an actor's work is only interesting when performed. Talking about it makes it seem empty. Acting has no strict rules, except maybe being heard clearly. With each new play, actors start fresh, learning and growing with the characters and the writer's ideas. When a play ends, the actor feels empty until the next one. This emptiness is clear when discussing theatre work.
**A Review of Hamlet**
Adrian Lester's performance as Hamlet is a mix of youth and maturity. His acting is simple yet confident. He handles the text well and shows great control, making him a standout actor. Lester plays a young man full of hidden anger, using humor and wit to be both strong and likable. His performance is skillful, even if it seems understated. Watch how Lester's body moves, like he's waiting to come alive. Handy, who plays Horatio, gives a similar impression. This raises questions: What is acting? What is behavior? Is acting just copying real life, or is it something more? These are key questions in theatre.
**One Director's Approach to Rehearsal**
This director starts rehearsals with a method called ""dropping in."" The stage manager shows the script on a screen. Actors sit quietly, listening to others speak and feeling the words' impact. When it's their turn, they look at the screen, think about the words, and find a reason to speak. For example, if the line is ""Queuing all night, the rain, do you remember?"" they breathe, imagine the scene, and find the impulse to speak. This director believes in discovering what's happening without planning too much. Actors should trust that something will happen if they keep an open mind.
**The Perfect Theatre**
The perfect theatre makes you feel like your presence matters. Going to a live performance is special, and the staff should feel this too. It's not good if the staff treats it like just another job. The theatre should connect the performer and the audience. Everyone should see and hear clearly and feel involved. The size of the theatre is important; it should fit the human voice and body. Many theatres from the late 1800s got this right, creating spaces that embrace the stage. I like theatres with a sense of history, like worn steps in a church. You can't please everyone with a play. Audiences don't always know what they want to see. When you go to the theatre, you want to see something surprising, something you couldn't imagine at home."
CPE_37,C2,"**Paul Simon and Rock and Roll**
In the 1950s, rock and roll was mainly popular with young people. However, it also had a big impact on middle-class and older people. It helped create the next group of rock stars, who listened to it and felt it would be important in their lives. For Paul Simon and other young people in the US, the best way to hear this exciting new music was on Alan Freed's radio show, Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party. Freed's show was a must-listen for many future rock stars. Like young John Lennon in Liverpool, who listened to Radio Luxembourg to hear rock and roll, Paul Simon was amazed by the music on Freed's show. He was ready to move from just listening to music to making his own.
**Snow Adventure**
There was no clear path, but I thought I would be safe if I walked carefully. The wind was strong, pushing me as I slipped on the ice. Suddenly, the snow under me broke, and I fell into a hole about four feet deep. The snow had covered a gap between two rocks, leaving a thin layer that I fell through. I climbed out, feeling shaken and worried about what I would have done if the hole was deeper. I sat against a pine tree sticking out of the snow to think about my situation. In one hour, I had only gone half a mile. It was clear I needed to change my plan.
**Understanding Qualitative Research**
There are many books that try to help researchers with qualitative research. These books often talk a lot about how to collect data but not much about how to analyze it. Many people find data analysis mysterious. So, we asked different social scientists who have done qualitative research to talk about how they analyze their data. The goal was to share ideas and understanding about data analysis, not to create a guidebook. This means making hidden methods more clear. Although this seems easy, it is actually quite difficult. We let our contributors present their work in different styles, including personal stories and more formal writing."
CPE_2,C2,"**Screen Learning**
A few days ago, I saw my six-year-old eating noodles in a funny way. He was pulling them up with his teeth and trying to look fierce. ""I'm a little dinosaur,"" he said. He was acting out a scene from a TV show he watched. I asked him what he remembered about dinosaurs, and he didn't remember much. Many people are excited about learning through the internet and computers, but is learning from a screen really effective? One writer shared his experience with an interactive program he tried with his son. The father read the words carefully, but the son was more interested in playing with the pictures. The father thought that if his son had spent ten minutes with a book, he might have learned something. Television, as shown by my son and his noodles, is a medium that gives impressions and suggestions. Research shows that learning happens best in an environment where there is dialogue with teachers or parents. It needs guidance. Using new technology to teach children is fine, but formal education is still very important.
**Hollywood**
By 1918, most of the world's film-making had moved to Hollywood. Local people didn't like it at first, seeing their area of Los Angeles changed by these new people. But in the end, they accepted it because of success, which is very important in America. Success in Hollywood means making a lot of money at the box office. Hollywood knows a good film when it sees one: a film that might make a star, but must make money. In less than a century, Hollywood grew from a small village to a town as famous as New York, Rome, or Paris. Physically, it has changed a lot: a hundred years ago, you would walk through orange groves to the village store. Yet, in some ways, it is still like a village - small and focused on one thing - films. People there talk about how much films have made, who is dating whom, and who is working on which project. Successful people often try to live somewhere else but still work in Hollywood. It is the place where almost everyone in show-business eventually goes.
**Photography**
Photography was created by nineteenth-century artists as a new art form. These artists wanted a lasting and accurate record of what they saw around them, and they found it. The new combination of light, lens, shutter, and a flat surface with light-sensitive chemicals made images that were more lasting and detailed than paintings. This worried other artists, and after their first excitement about the new images, art critics said that photography was not art. They believed that because photography depended on machines, it couldn't be a creative act. Despite the critics, photographers knew they had found a new way to express themselves. They used photography like other artists used brushes and pencils - to show their vision of the world and the people in it.
**Book Illustration**
During the time when book illustrations were in black and white, it was common for every children's book to have illustrations. This also included many novels for older readers, although this became less common as time went on. Children's publishing was very active, but it was often done with low budgets, leading to some routine and average work. However, the best artists always did their best work. The black-and-white archive is a mix of ordinary and great work, a great place for research or browsing. The best works are likely to be shown to the public again, either through reprints or new books about the artists, or in exhibitions of original books and drawings. There are signs that this is starting to happen, and people are beginning to appreciate this artistic period again. An enterprising publisher might see the potential for a series of classic children's book illustrations from this time, either in reprints or new editions using the original artwork."
CPE_68,C2,"**Blogging: Sharing with the World**
Some time ago, a website talked about the risks of public check-ins, which are online announcements of where you are. The website's message was clear: you might think you are just telling the world, ""Hey, I'm at this place,"" but you are also letting everyone know you are not at home. This made people more aware that sharing too much online can be risky. The internet gives us many chances to share our lives with a global audience, offering possibilities like wealth and fame. So, we dive into the internet, sharing confessions, personal photos, and stories. But soon, we realize that the internet can be dangerous and confusing.
This might sound depressing, but don't worry. There is a way to navigate this future, thanks to a group of online pioneers. In the early days of the internet, they explored these challenges. They lost jobs, made and lost friends, and dealt with the challenges of being famous, all before social networking existed. These pioneers, the first bloggers, have already experienced what many of us are going through now. We should learn from their experiences to avoid making the same mistakes.
In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started posting on the ""WWW,"" which was mostly used by students and scientists. The web was created at CERN in Switzerland to help researchers share their work. Hall saw it as a chance to share his life. He created a detailed online autobiography with words, photos, and art. In January 1996, he started a daily blog, and many people were interested in his bold use of this new medium. Hall shared everything, and no topic was off-limits. His work was very open, but it also had a certain beauty that some might call art.
One day, visitors to Hall's site found it replaced with a video titled ""Dark Night."" He shared that he had fallen in love, but when he wrote about it online, he was told, ""either the blog goes, or I do."" He realized that sharing his life online made people not trust him. He stopped the blog, but the problem of sharing too much online continues. Sharing online is fun, but if you think it will make people like you more, you might be disappointed.
In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a web worker in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job at a software company. One day, a colleague sent her blog to the company's vice presidents, including some she had made fun of, and she lost her job. Experts call this the ""online distribution effect,"" where people feel they can say things online they wouldn't say in person. But our online and real lives are connected, and ignoring this can lead to big mistakes.
Armstrong's story ended well. She was upset and stopped blogging for a while, but she got married and started blogging again about her family. Now, she is a successful ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing supports her family. She learned that just because the web lets us say anything, it doesn't mean we should."
CPE_23,C2,"**Enough Sleep?**
Many people today feel tired all the time. In busy and rich countries, more people have trouble sleeping and feel anxious. In the USA, research shows that 40 million people have serious sleep problems. In Britain, some popular books have characters who can't sleep or are set in sleep labs. People are interested in sleep: how it works, its benefits, and sleep problems. A main concern is that people need more sleep. A top sleep researcher says, ""People sleep less when they're busy. They wake up early to avoid traffic.""
A sleep researcher did an experiment. He let people sleep up to 14 hours a night for a month. It took them three weeks to settle at about eight hours of sleep. This shows they needed more sleep than they were getting.
In Europe, a university in the English Midlands studies sleep. They look at how tiredness affects sailors, how airport noise affects sleep, and the dangers of driving when tired. They find volunteers through student newspapers. Volunteers are paid and asked to change their sleep patterns. Dr. Louise Reyner reassures them: ""Some worry because we put electrodes on their heads, but we can't see their dreams or thoughts."" The lab focuses on physical effects.
In a dark room, there is a driving simulator. Volunteers come at 2 pm, when people naturally feel sleepy, after a short or no sleep. They drive while answering questions. The road seems endless, the sun is bright, and the air is warm. Many deny they will fall asleep. Dr. Reyner has a video of one trying not to sleep. At first, he is alert, but then he starts blinking slowly and nodding off. Each time, he wakes up suddenly, but the car has already gone off the road. Coffee might help. Dr. Reyner says two cups can make you a safe driver for over half an hour, even with no sleep. She suggests tablets, energy drinks, and caffeinated gum for alertness. Shift workers could use them.
What do we know for sure about sleep? Humans, like other mammals, sleep in a daily cycle. During sleep, we go through four stages, from light to deep sleep. Dreams usually happen in the lightest sleep, and the brain stops the body from moving to prevent injuries. Beyond this, there are theories. Some say sleep repairs the body, restores muscles, or rests the brain. But these might also happen when awake and relaxed, so no one is sure. Scientists agree that women sleep half an hour longer than men and older people need less sleep, but they don't know why.
When asked about the purpose of sleep, some researchers say, ""Sleep is a way to pass time safely."" In the past, people may have slept differently. A history professor found that between 1500 and 1850 in Britain, people had different sleep patterns. They went to bed at nine or ten, woke up after midnight, stayed awake for an hour, and then had a ""morning sleep."" This time was used for thinking, remembering dreams, or even stealing. The poorest people benefited most from this quiet time. By the 17th century, with more artificial light, the rich started sleeping like we do now. The industrial revolution made most people work longer hours in lit buildings, changing sleep patterns.
Outside Europe and America, the old sleep pattern was common until recently. In some non-western places, there are no strict bedtimes. People sleep for a few hours, then get up again. Continuous sleep is not possible due to noise, fire watching, and predators. It seems people everywhere need more sleep."
CPE_60,C2,"'We are talking about big boots here. Really big boots. I stood in my expensive cowboy boots on the rocks in the Arizona desert. Money was no problem. I wore the whole cowboy outfit, but I was not a cowboy. It wasn't working. I looked at the Arizona mountains and had to admit, I was not at home. I flew in from Denver just after dawn and thought I might look like a cowboy. But that feeling disappeared when I saw a real cowboy at the Phoenix airport. He wore a sweaty T-shirt, needed a shave, and was picking up a dirty bag. He saw my new cowboy boots, raised an eyebrow, and left without looking back.
I wished there was an outfit I could wear that made me feel like I belonged. I loved being a racing driver. I am addicted to it, and it's all I know how to do. But I don't do it anymore. I can't, even if I wanted to. I thought, looking at the mountains, what do I do now? A racing driver should have other plans for when he stops racing. I thought I did, but they disappeared.
How about being a commentator at the racetrack? 'We have fifteen former drivers in line for that job. We'll call you.' Or maybe selling classic cars? That idea lasted almost all winter, but nobody was buying old Ferraris, and Honda was changing its dealer list. So I left before there was nothing left.
Being an 'ex' anything is hard. How much do you want to hear about how I was almost the World Champion? Nobody wants to hear a story that ends in 'almost'. Even if I had been world champion, you would only listen for five minutes. Last year's champion is last year. I don't want sympathy, and I don't get any. Why should I? I had a good run, made money, and kept enough. But I miss driving those fast cars. I miss the danger and the excitement. I miss the people and the reporters who cared about what I said. Being famous, even a little, isn't all bad. Businessmen and politicians liked to say they knew me. Little boys wanted my autograph. And now that I don't drive a racing car... Only last week the phone rang twice. I have a lot of free time.
I looked up at the blue sky. No buzzards overhead. Maybe Arizona doesn't have buzzards. But a couple of little birds in a cactus were singing. I never thought the desert had songbirds. I realized that a fake cowboy in designer boots had a lot to learn.'"
CPE_1,C2,"**Vancouver**
In the last ten years, many people from all over the world have moved to Vancouver, in western Canada. In the evening, people like to walk down the city streets, and if you join them, you will probably hear different languages. People come to Vancouver for its mild weather, beautiful location between the ocean and the mountains, clean and safe environment, and good education and job opportunities. Some people complain about how fast new buildings are being built, but the new people and growing tourism have helped the city grow. Locals used to call Vancouver 'Terminal City' because it was a gateway to other places. Even though the name is not used much now, Vancouver is still a gateway.
**Putting Pen to Paper**
Journalists like me are usually not good at writing letters. Some say it's because we don't like writing for free, but I don't think that's true. It's more likely because we always try to make a big impact with our writing, so we lose the natural feeling of a letter. Real creative artists, who don't focus on the impact (even if they rewrite a lot), don't have this problem. I think the real test of an artist is how well they understand the effect of their words. When Shakespeare wrote his famous lines, he probably didn't think about how the mix of long words made them powerful, but it showed he was a great writer.
**Supermarket Opening**
In the past, opening a new supermarket in Britain was a big event. A soap star, a disc jockey, or a minor royal would come to cut the ribbon. Now, new supermarkets open so often that celebrities are not needed. Why pay a famous person when anyone can open it for free? Last week, waiting pensioners didn't care who opened the new Superbuy store, as long as they were first in line. One customer heard that the first five men would get a bottle of aftershave, and the first five women would get flowers. This news spread quickly, making those at the front feel proud and the latecomers feel envious."
CPE_53,C2,"**Citizen Kane**
When the film *Citizen Kane* came out in 1941, there was a lot of excitement around its release. It was delayed because the distributors were afraid of what William Randolph Hearst, who the film was supposedly about, might do to them. Even though the reviews were mostly very positive, the film was not a big success in theaters. It was television that made it popular again. *Citizen Kane* is perhaps the most inspiring film for people who want to become filmmakers. This is surprising because it was Orson Welles's first film. Welles said that the film's success was because he didn't know what he could or couldn't do, so he just did what he wanted. He had a great team, including cameraman Gregg Toland, screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, and special-effects expert Linwood Dunn. When Welles and Mankiewicz decided to make a film about a newspaper owner who was like Hearst but also not like him, Welles knew he had found the perfect project for himself as both director and actor. He took the opportunity with great energy.
**Dermot and Carmel**
Dermot thought Carmel was acting a bit strange that morning. He told her twice that he might be late and not to worry if he stopped by the golf club on his way home. He needed to talk to someone, and that was the best place to do it. Twice, Carmel nodded her head as if she hadn't really heard or understood him. ""Will you be all right? What are you going to do today?"" he asked. She smiled and said, ""Funny you should ask that. I was just thinking that I had nothing to do all day, so I was going to walk downtown and look at the shops. I thought it was almost a sinful thing, just wasting the day."" Dermot smiled back. ""You're allowed to enjoy yourself. And as I said, if I'm late, I won't need anything to eat. So don't go to any trouble."" ""No, that's fine,"" she said.
**Title Race**
Tea boy? No, I'm a mobile lukewarm beverage resource facilitator.
Human nature can be very funny. A recent study showed that job titles cause jealousy and problems at work. A survey by a big recruitment company found that 90% of employers and 70% of employees agree that titles create divisions among colleagues. Surprisingly, the survey found that 70% of office workers would give up a pay raise for a more 'motivational' or 'professional' job title. If our desire for fancy titles is stronger than our desire for more money, we are in a difficult situation. Today, nobody wants to be called a subordinate. The titles being discussed focus on skills (like specialist or coordinator) but are really just nicer ways to say the same thing."
CPE_55,C2,"'The Vienna Assignment I was in Vienna to take photographs. That was usually why I traveled. Photographs were more than my job; they were part of my life. The way light fell on a surface always sparked my imagination. A single picture could capture the essence of a time and place, a city, or a person. I always hoped to take the perfect photograph. As long as I had film in my camera, there was a chance. Finish one roll, load another, and keep looking. That was my way. It had been for a long time. I almost succeeded once when a photo of a smoke plume from a burning oil well became popular worldwide. It was just luck, but they say you make your own luck. I went freelance after that, which seemed smart, but life outside photography took some wrong turns. The mid-nineties weren't as successful as I expected after my photo made it to the cover of Time magazine. That's why I was in Vienna, not somewhere more newsworthy. But I was still taking photographs and getting paid. It didn't seem bad to me. The assignment was unexpected. I had done the London photos for a picture book: Four Cities in Four Seasons - London, Paris, Rome, Vienna. It was a European project that paid me well to take photos in my home city in all seasons. I gave my own style to daffodils in Hyde Park and the heat haze in Piccadilly. I accepted that the best of my work might be ignored. It was just a picture book, not meant to challenge anyone's views. After a cold snap over Christmas, I handed in my London-in-winter photos and learned that the Austrian photographer, Rudi Schussner, had left the Vienna job. They offered me the role instead. The Austrian publishers liked my work, and I was available, unlike the French and Italian photographers. I was happy to go. Things at home weren't great. A week in snowy Vienna was a welcome change. They put me up at the Europa, in the heart of the old city. I had last been to Vienna with my wife for a busy summer weekend. It was hot and not very memorable. I hadn't taken many photos. Alone in a cold January, it was going to be different. I knew it as soon as I arrived and saw the city covered in snow. I was going to enjoy myself and take great pictures. The first day, I didn't even try. I rode the trams around the Ringstrasse, getting on and off to feel the city's mood. The weather was set, frozen like the old empire's buildings. I hadn't seen Schussner's work for other seasons. I didn't want to. This was going to be my Vienna. A photograph is a moment, but you have to wait for it. So I waited and looked until I was ready. The next morning, I was out at dawn. Snow had fallen overnight, making Stephansplatz white and empty. I hadn't figured out how to capture the cathedral in one shot. Its spire was tall, but at ground level, it was massive. I might have to settle for a partial shot. In that weather, it could still be magical. Photography has always been magical. In the 19th century, people thought it was mysterious. Pictures develop and become clear on their own. Even when you know how it works, the mystery remains. Maybe that's why what happened at Stephansplatz that morning didn't surprise me.'"
CPE_50,C2,"**Kinetic Art Rejoice**
Something amazing has happened at London's Hayward Gallery. It has become a place full of wonder, not because of a big, expensive show, but thanks to a unique exhibition about kinetic art. Kinetic art is art that involves movement. This exhibition looks at the history of kinetic art over the last 60 years. It shows that making art that moves or explores movement has been an important, though often unnoticed, part of creative work in the 20th century. Curator Guy Brett, who has studied kinetic art for a long time, has gathered a wonderful collection of paintings, drawings, documents, and films. These are shown without many explanations, so visitors can enjoy discovering things on their own.
**David Hockney**
David Hockney's art is liked by many people, even those who usually don't care about art. This might be because his art is easy to understand or because it shows fun and relaxing scenes. Some people might even like him more for his interesting personality and humor, which make him popular in the news. Some critics think Hockney is not a great artist. However, others argue that he might seem less important because he is so popular, not because his work lacks quality. Hockney himself knows his limits and believes it's not fair to judge his work by an idea of greatness. He doesn't claim to be a great artist and knows that only time will tell how important his work is.
**Window-shopping - an art exhibition**
Recently, I have seen many contemporary art exhibitions, some good and some not. What bothers me are shows that try to push a certain idea, suggesting all the artists share the same view. Sometimes this works, but often it feels forced. As a curator, I wanted to create a show that was different. With seven artists, I used a space in an empty warehouse for an exhibition called 'Window-shopping.' It was a collection of individual artworks that were only connected by being art. For example, Sam Cole's knitted cats moved around on a toy train track, while Matthew Crawley's video camera experiment flickered on a monitor. These works didn't fit into a typical themed exhibition, but they worked together in their own way. I didn't make any big statements about contemporary art, but maybe there aren't any to make about an activity where artists set their own rules.
**Art History**
People who love paintings sometimes don't want to analyze them because they think it might ruin their enjoyment. Some say that art historians, who focus on theory, ignore the pleasure of looking at art and the creativity involved. This idea is like thinking that knowing how a dish is made takes away from its taste. Enjoying art doesn't mean we can't learn more about it. In fact, knowing more might make it more enjoyable. Pleasure is complex, and how we feel about art is influenced by the society we live in. While it's important to enjoy art instinctively, the idea that thinking about art takes away from its enjoyment is an old belief."
CPE_25,C2,"**Metals**
Stone Age people might have been interested in metals because they wanted to decorate themselves. Imagine sitting by a river, waiting for a fish or just relaxing. One of our early ancestors might have found a shiny yellow stone and picked it up. It didn’t feel like a normal stone, but it looked nice. This is how gold might have become important to early people. Gold is soft and easy to shape, so it quickly became popular. Copper might have been found by accident too. Once people saw how useful copper tools were, they looked for copper ores and ways to get copper from them. This is how metalworking became an important skill for our ancestors.
**St Ives**
We were silent as we carried our bags down the winding, cobbled street to the center of town. We were bent over because of the strong wind and trying not to get wet from the icy waves hitting the promenade. The streets were empty, and the windows of every house by the water were closed tight against the storm. We had watched the weather get worse as we arrived in St Ives on the small train. As the grey skies got darker, visiting Cornwall in the off-season without a car didn’t seem like a good idea anymore. I had convinced my friend to come with me by promising walks along the beautiful Cornish coast and cozy evenings by the fire.
**Computer Modelling**
The problem with studying the past is that it is gone. The people who lived in times of peace and hard times are long dead. The reasons they settled in one place or moved to another, and how they formed families, villages, and cities, are forgotten. Archaeology gives us some clues, but we cannot test our ideas with experiments on past cultures. We cannot watch the past like a movie. But maybe we can. Computer modelling lets us recreate ancient landscapes and fill them with virtual communities. These digital people have some needs and abilities like real humans. We can set rules for them and change things like rainfall or population to see how this digital culture reacts."
CPE_34,C2,"**Vervet Monkeys**
Cheney and Seyfarth studied a group of vervet monkeys. One day, the dominant male monkey saw a strange male monkey in nearby trees. The stranger wanted to join the group, which could mean trouble for the dominant male. To keep the stranger away, the dominant male used a clever trick. When the stranger tried to come closer, the dominant male gave an alarm call that meant a leopard was nearby. The stranger quickly went back to his trees. This happened several times. But then, the dominant male made a mistake. He gave the alarm call while he was calmly walking in the open, showing there was no real danger.
**What Cats Catch**
In the English village of Felmersham, people collected what their cats caught. Over one year, 70 cats caught over 1,000 animals. An American professor saw these numbers and guessed that all the cats in Britain might be killing 100 million birds and small animals each year. However, this is not realistic because most cats live in towns and catch fewer animals. The important question is whether these numbers are too high. The answer seems to be no. Many people feed birds in winter, and gardens provide places for birds to nest. The survey showed that cats are important hunters, but they are not destroying Britain's bird population.
**Buffalo's Day**
Buffaloes are very important to marsh people. Every morning, the buffaloes leave their sleeping places and slowly move to the reed beds. They make tired sounds as they go. At first, they stand on the edge of the platform, complaining about the hard day ahead. Then, the leader steps into the water, and they all follow. In the water, they seem to forget their plans and rest for a while. Eventually, they start swimming, looking very tired. They spend the day in the reeds, eating green plants they find.
**PICASSO, Pablo**
In 1940, Picasso painted fish still lifes while staying in the fishing port of Royan. One painting shows a fishmonger's table with a crab and some fish. The fish look alive, even though they are not. Picasso used overlapping shapes and soft colors to create a calm, underwater feeling. But there is also a sense of danger. The fish and crab seem ready to fight, and even the chain around one fish looks threatening. This gives the painting a deeper meaning."
CPE_12,C2,"**Photography**
For the past 150 years, photography has been used to capture all parts of human life and activity. In this short history, photography has grown in its ability to capture time and space. It lets us see quick moments and both big and small things. Photography has shown us images from faraway places on Earth, distant parts of the solar system, and the complex social issues of modern life. It has become one of the most important ways to show the human experience.
However, using images to record events has a much longer history. The first pictorial recordings go back to the Upper Palaeolithic period, about 35,000 years ago. We don't know exactly why early cave paintings were made. They might show real hunting events, serve as magic to increase animals for hunting, act as religious symbols, or simply decorate living spaces. But images seem to be closely linked to human culture.
Throughout history, people have questioned how accurate visual images are and their importance in society. The idea that ""seeing is believing"" has always given special importance to images. When photography was invented in the mid-1800s, its impact was huge. Photography was seen as a way to automatically provide a true visual record. The camera, working like the human eye, was thought to give a fixed image close to what we see. This chemical process captured what seemed like a natural event: the camera image. It was also seen as a cultural achievement, creating images that artists had long tried to make by hand.
Because cameras seemed so real in showing what we see, people thought everyone could understand photographs. This led to the idea that photography might be a ""universal language."" For example, in 1933, photographer August Sander said even an isolated Bushman could understand a photo of the sky. But with the rise of global communication in the late 20th century, we need to ask if photos can really cross cultural differences. Or is photography limited by cultural rules like language? Our familiarity with photos might make us overlook the complex ways they show ""reality.""
Photography is often seen as providing clear evidence, making it seem transparent and blurring the line between our view of the world and its photographic images. It's common for someone to show a photo from their wallet and say, ""this is my grandson.""
Since its invention in 1839, photography technology and attitudes have changed a lot. This is partly because photography has moved into ""mythic time."" Its original role as a 19th-century record-keeper has become more historical. Photos, once close to the photographer and subject, are now historical documents. They reveal as much about the people and society that made them as they do about their subjects.
I want to show that the camera is not just a silent recorder of events. Photography does not just reflect culture; it can inspire social and political change. For example, the Italian Renaissance in the 15th century relied on new visual methods like perspective. Similarly, photography has greatly contributed to the media culture of today, while also showing the harsh realities of the world."
CPE_26,C2,"**How to Write Poetry**
Writing poetry can be tricky. It's like walking through a field with hidden dangers. You need to be spontaneous, but one wrong move can cause problems. It's risky to act like you know everything, so instead, I suggest that beginners should read a lot, write often, and let their imagination run free, as long as it doesn't lead to chaos. Some people need a stable life to write poetry, while others write to escape sadness. Some follow a schedule, while others wait for inspiration. All methods are fine, as long as they are not just copying others. It's important to find your own voice, listen to it, nurture it, and let it grow. One day, it will be strong enough to stand on its own.
**The Short Story**
In a short story, you can't have too many characters or long descriptions. Flashbacks should be brief and only used if necessary to explain something. A good way to do this is through a quick memory in the main character's mind. This memory can help move the story forward but should not slow down the action. Dialogue is very useful because it can show different sides of a question quickly. It also keeps the reader interested. Writing too much can ruin a short story, but it doesn't mean it should be too short. A short story needs conflict and action, just like a novel, but every word must be important.
**Screenplays**
Writing a screenplay is like playing chess. Many chess players make moves without knowing what will happen next. They might see one or two moves ahead, and that's enough for them. Over time, they learn that chess is more about long-term strategy than short-term tactics. They start to see the whole game, not just individual moves. They notice patterns, like openings and end games. The more you play chess, the more you understand its complexities. The same goes for writing a screenplay.
**Looking at Writing**
Charles Darwin once said that humans naturally speak, but they don't naturally write. Language is found in all societies, and while languages change, they don't get better. English today is not more complex than ancient languages. All healthy children learn to speak without lessons. When children are together without a common language, they create one. Writing, however, has been invented only a few times in history. It started in complex societies and improved slowly. Until recently, most children didn't learn to read or write. Even today, many struggle with it. Children are naturally good at speaking, but writing is a skill that must be taught. We need to understand how writing works and how to teach it to children."
CPE_8,C2,"I have never started a novel with more doubt. I call it a novel because I don't know what else to call it. I have little story to tell, and I don't end with a death or a marriage. Instead, I leave my reader unsure. This book is about my memories of a man I met only occasionally, and I don't know much about what happened to him in between. I could make up details to fill the gaps and make my story clearer, but I don't want to do that. I only want to write what I know. To protect people who are still alive, I have given the characters in this story made-up names, and I have tried to make sure no one can recognize them. The man I am writing about is not famous. He might never be. When his life ends, he might leave no more trace than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the water. Then my book, if read at all, will be read only for its own interest. But maybe his way of life and his strong and kind character will influence others, so that, long after his death, people might realize he was a remarkable person. Then it will be clear who I am writing about, and those who want to know about his early life might find something useful in my book. I think my book, with its limits, will be a useful source of information for my friend's biographers. I do not claim that the conversations I have written are exact. I never took notes of what was said, but I have a good memory for what matters to me, and though I have put these conversations in my own words, I believe they represent what was said. I mentioned earlier that I have invented nothing, but I have taken the freedom that historians take to put words in the mouths of people in my story that I did not hear myself. I have done this to make the scenes more lively and realistic. I want to be read, and I think I am right to make my book interesting. The smart reader will see where I have used this trick, and he can choose to ignore it. Another reason I am worried about this work is that the people I write about are from another culture. It is very hard to know people, and I don't think you can really know anyone but your own countrymen. People are not only themselves; they are also the place they were born, the home they grew up in, the games they played, the food they ate, the schools they went to, the sports they played, and the poets they read. These things make them who they are, and you can't know them just by hearing about them; you can only know them if you have lived them. You can only know if you are them. Because you can't truly know people from another country except by watching them, it is hard to make them believable in a book. I have never tried to write about anyone but my own countrymen, and if I have done so in short stories, it is because you can describe characters briefly in them. You give the reader broad hints and let him imagine the details. In this book, I do not claim that my characters are as they see themselves; they are seen, like my main character, through my own eyes."
CPE_4,C2,"**POETRY RECITALS**
Throughout history, the world of literature often seems confusing to those living in it. Over time, however, people look back and see patterns and important figures more clearly. Today, poetry is especially complex with many different styles and opinions about how poetry should be written, shared, and taught. There is a general debate between two groups: 'literary' poets, who write poems to be read on paper, and 'popular' poets, who enjoy performing their poems in front of an audience. 
This division is not strict. Public poetry readings have become more common in the last twenty years. Small literary groups in towns hold them in local halls or homes. Schools and colleges invite poets to read to students. Arts festivals often include poetry readings by famous poets. These events have mixed results for poets. For 'pop' poets, who write poems to be performed, public readings are beneficial. Their poems are usually simple and easy to understand when heard once. However, on paper, their poems might seem less impressive.
On the other hand, poets who focus on traditional poetry, aiming to express deep emotions and thoughts in a compact form, may not be fully appreciated by audiences hearing their work for the first time. The risk is not that they will copy the style of entertainers, but that they might choose to read their simpler works to connect quickly with the audience. Listening to poetry readings cannot replace reading poetry on paper, but it can be a fun and educational experience. Hearing poets read their work helps listeners understand the emphasis and rhythm, but it is helpful if the audience has the text or knows the poems beforehand.
The main reason for popular poetry recitals, sometimes mixed with music, is to make people associate poetry with enjoyment, rather than seeing it as an art only for a select few."
CPE_30,C2,"**Oral History**
Historians are increasingly using oral evidence, but it has challenges. It's not realistic to think that someone's story is a perfect reflection of the past. During an interview, both the historian and the person being interviewed influence each other. The historian chooses who to talk to and what to focus on. Even if the historian just listens, their presence can change how the person remembers and talks about the past. The final story is shaped by the historian's background and how they understand history, which can affect the person being interviewed. Historians need to recognize their role in creating new evidence. Even without the historian, the person’s memories might be influenced by other sources, like the media, or by feelings like nostalgia or later life experiences. These emotions can make the story seem convincing, but they might not be from the time being discussed.
**Animal Science**
There are two main ways to study animal science: focusing on the body (physiological) and looking at the whole animal. Physiologists study how the body works, like how nerves and muscles create behavior. The 'whole animal' approach looks at the behavior of the entire animal and what affects it. Within this approach, psychologists and ethologists are different. Psychologists usually study learning in a few species, like rats and pigeons, in labs. Ethologists study natural behavior in animals, often in the wild. Although these fields are different, they are starting to work together more. Physiologists often say their methods are more basic, but even if we understood every nerve cell, we still need to study behavior as a whole. Behavior has its own structure that we need to understand. Describing a bird's nest-building by looking at nerve cells is like trying to read a book with a microscope.
**The Social Sciences**
Students new to social sciences face a challenge: they must learn both the content and the methods of the subject. They need to understand the knowledge in textbooks and how this knowledge is gathered and organized. These two parts are closely connected. We all know about social life from daily experiences, so social sciences might seem like common sense. However, each social science goes beyond common sense. Each focuses on a specific part of social life, uses special methods, and has its own concepts. These basic ideas form the 'logical basis of the subject' and help social scientists go beyond everyday understanding, making each discipline unique.
**Classical Architecture**
In Ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was more than just building structures. The Roman architect Vitruvius said architecture involves order, arrangement, proportion, symmetry, propriety, and distribution. He used Greek terms for some of these ideas, likely from an earlier Greek source. Utility and function are not part of his main definition, though he later discusses the best designs for different purposes. The focus is on architecture as an art. Classical architecture has complex origins. Before it, there were simple huts in Greece and Italy that didn't meet Vitruvius' artistic standards. These basic forms contributed to later architectural ideas. Despite its elaborate appearance, a classical temple is essentially a simple, single-roomed hut."
CPE_7,C2,"The two sisters, Lily and Mui, kept Lily's driving a secret from Chen for a while. Lily would drive around the allotments, the railway line, and the gasworks. She once misjudged a small bridge, causing a big bump, but otherwise, she drove well. Chen, however, found it amusing when he discovered what Lily had been doing. ""So you can really drive, Lily? Well done!"" he said. Mui thought men were strange because Chen wasn't upset. Instead, he was excited and started planning a trip with Lily. They decided to go on a Monday at the start of next month, leaving early and returning by midday to avoid losing customers. Meanwhile, Lily would practice driving around the allotments. Mui, despite her worries, bought a road map and got a ten percent discount, which impressed Chen. Lily felt a bit insulted by Mui's lack of trust in her navigation skills.
Within an hour of leaving home, they were looking at the English Channel. Lily drove perfectly, and even Mui, who was ready to give directions from the back seat, had to admit it. Lily overtook a few slow vehicles with great skill, and Chen even applauded. After passing the gasworks of a seaside town and the lagoon with its small motorboats, they drove along the empty promenade. Lily parked in a street with many empty parking spaces. She wasn't sure about the road markings, so she preferred to pay a fee rather than risk being towed or fined. Lily locked all the van doors carefully. Chen joked, ""No one will want that heap of tin,"" which annoyed the sisters. Lily accused him of being ungrateful, and Mui said he was too easily fooled by appearances. Surprised, Chen took their son, Man Kee, to look at the sea. He held Man Kee on the railing and thought about his son's future. Chen wanted Man Kee to have a good education and own many restaurants.
The sea made Chen feel thoughtful as he planned Man Kee's career. He saw a ship on the horizon and used a telescope to look at it. At first, he couldn't find it, but then he saw it clearly: a small, old tramp steamer. Chen lifted Man Kee to see through the telescope. ""Do you see the ship, Son?"" he asked. ""It's a special ship for us. It will take us back home when we're done here."" Chen kissed Man Kee's head. Lily and Mui joined them, and Lily put her arm around Chen. Chen said, ""Let your mother see, Son."" But Man Kee didn't want to let go of the telescope. When he finally did, the view was gone, and all Lily saw was a white light. By the time Chen found another coin, the ship had disappeared over the horizon, and Lily only saw seagulls following the ship's path."
CPE_43,C2,"'THE WELL I read somewhere that if you look from a deep hole, you can see stars during the day. I convinced you to help me with my plan. You watched as I pulled up the well bucket, steadied it, and climbed in. I asked you to let me down. I didn't think about the bucket's weight or your strength. You held the handle, but when I pushed the bucket off the well's edge, I fell. You screamed and tried to stop the handle, but then let go. I fell into the well and hit my head. I saw strange lights, like stars in cartoons when characters get hit. At first, I was dazed, then scared, then relieved, and finally angry at you for letting me fall. I was also worried about what Mother would say. You called down, asking if I was okay. I was about to shout back when you called again, sounding scared, which stopped me. I lay still, watching you through my eyelashes. You ran to get help. I quickly climbed out of the well and hid in the shadows near the moat bridge. I heard voices from the castle. Mother and Father came with you and Arthur. Mother was upset, and Father told Arthur to use the winch. You looked pale and shocked. I felt a mix of excitement and fear. Then I saw the wet trail I left from the well to where I hid. I was scared they would see it. Father shone a flashlight into the well. Mother was screaming, and I felt guilty. I wanted revenge on you, but now it was serious. I realized I needed a plan. I came out of hiding, pretending to be weak. I told them I found a secret tunnel from the well to the moat and crawled out. I thought they believed me until Father asked me to repeat the story. I added that the tunnel collapsed, so no one could check it. Father looked at me with disbelief. He told me not to be ridiculous and walked away. Arthur looked at me with pity, worried about my lying. His look was as hurtful as Father's words. I realized they saw through my lie, and it affected me deeply.'"
CPE_51,C2,"**REMOVAL DAY**
Susan, a widow, is leaving her family home now that her children are grown up. The moving van had ""Removers of Distinction"" written on it. Susan noticed that everything special about the house was being packed away. Fred, the removal man, was carefully wrapping breakable items, while his team was not as gentle. Susan was leaving a beautiful four-storey house that overlooked a small harbour. She remembered the years spent there with her children growing up.
When they first bought the house, her son Robert, who was five at the time, asked, ""Mum, when you buy a house, how do you get it home?"" Now, Robert was an adult and was helping with the move. He was making sure Susan didn't mention the piano. Francesca, her daughter, was also helping. She was very particular about the Steinway piano, insisting that only she could handle it properly.
Fred, the removal man, commented that Susan didn't look like she was going to cry. Susan asked if people often cried during moves. Fred said they do, but they feel better once everything is at the new place. Susan could understand this. She remembered the day they moved in, and how the piano got stuck on the stairs. Her husband Peter had solved the problem by hiring a builder to remove a window and using a crane to bring the piano in.
Now, Susan was worried about the piano again. The banister rails were still not perfect from when they were removed years ago. She thought she should have warned the movers, but it was too late. Fred told her it was just the piano left to move. Susan was nervous, but Robert and Francesca were there to watch.
As the piano was carefully moved down the stairs, Susan felt emotional. She realized how much the objects in the house meant to her. But when the piano was safely outside, Robert started laughing, and soon all three of them were laughing together. They walked down the path arm in arm, and the only tears Susan shed were tears of laughter."
CPE_11,C2,"**Online Book Reviews for Everyone**
Is writing your own book reviews just for fun? When the Internet started, the idea was that anyone could share their thoughts online. In the beginning, you needed some technical skills to do this. But one area that became open to everyone was book reviews. 
Amazon.com, the first big online bookstore, allowed anyone to write reviews. People could say what they thought about a book and give it up to five stars. This seemed like a great idea because it let readers share their opinions, not just professional critics. Other online bookstores did the same, but Amazon was the biggest, with over 80% of the market. This meant Amazon had the most reviews and also the most problems.
Many reviews were submitted every day, so Amazon couldn't check them all. They had rules: no one-word reviews, no personal attacks, no bad language, no spoilers, and no talking about other reviews. But since reviewers were anonymous, some people misused the system. For example, authors could write fake positive reviews for their own books. Lev Grossman did this for his first novel after getting bad reviews. He wrote fake good reviews until he admitted it in an article, and then Amazon removed them.
Authors could also comment on their own books through a special link. Most used it to encourage people to buy their books. However, Amazon didn't always check if the comments were really from the authors, except for famous writers. 
The real drama came from readers. When James McElroy's book about a cheerleading team was published, it got good reviews from the press. But people in the book felt betrayed and wrote angry reviews on Amazon. These reviews disappeared after a few days.
Despite these issues, Amazon liked that people spent time writing reviews because it was good for business. They watched popular books closely to make sure reviews followed the rules. Funny reviews were more common on less popular books. For example, a children's book called ""The Story about Ping"" inspired jokes because ""ping"" is also a computer term. One review humorously compared the book's story to computer networking.
Most reviews on Amazon were serious and gave a good idea of whether a book was worth buying. The writer George Orwell once said that reviewing too many books meant pretending to have feelings about them. So, letting everyone review books was seen as a positive change."
CPE_14,C2,"**Art in Modern Times**
In the last 200 years, people often think that every artist must be different from others. Art is admired for being unique, new, and sometimes shocking. We like to praise artists whose work was not appreciated 100 years ago. But when it comes to today's art, we often say an artist has gone too far, and what they do is not art anymore. The media often say this for us, and we agree because we expect art to be confusing and new. We don't notice the old themes and methods in modern art. We think artists should be different from us, with special talents that break the rules. In the past, people asked artists to create art for specific reasons, and it was part of everyday life. Today, we let artists do what they want and get upset if they try to be more like us.
**Picture This**
I will describe a situation and ask an important question. An artist picks a piece of text from an art book. The text talks about different kinds of pictures and says, ""There is no end to the number of different kinds of pictures."" The artist asks someone to make a canvas and take it to a sign painter. The sign painter writes the text on the canvas in simple black letters. My question is: Is this a painting?
**Underground Encounters**
At the Mercury Gallery, London until 26th June
Usually, when a painter finds success in one style, they stick to it. Collectors expect artists to keep doing the same thing, and trying something new can upset people. Gallery owners like safe choices, and art buyers want continuity. Some artists, like Picasso and Hockney, successfully try new things. Eric Rimmington is another artist trying something different. He is known for still life paintings but now paints the London Underground. He has always been interested in railways. In the 1980s, he drew the railway land at King's Cross Station. Now, he paints the underground world. His exhibition, ""Underground Encounters,"" has 40 paintings and drawings showing the unique world of the London Underground.
**Extract from a Novel**
I have come to this island with a few books. I don't know why I say ""escape."" The villagers joke that only a sick person would come here to rebuild. So, I am here to heal myself. Apart from an old woman who comes to clean the house, I am alone. I am neither happy nor unhappy; I feel like I am floating in memories. I talked about how art seems useless but didn't mention its comforts. The comfort in my work is that in the quiet of painting or writing, reality can be changed and shown in a meaningful way. Our everyday actions hide the true meaning. For artists, art is a way to deal with what hurts us in life, not to avoid our destiny, but to fulfill it with imagination. Otherwise, why do we hurt each other?"
CPE_63,C2,"**Family Business**
""Look here, it's no good!"" said my Dad. We were in the car going back to London. My father, with my brother Maurice, had just picked me up from the fancy girls' school I attended. He had also just been to Parent's Day, where I got the Latin prize and the prize for doing best in my exams. He had a long talk with my headteacher, and now we were heading home for the holidays.
""What isn't?"" I asked, though I guessed what he was thinking from his unusual silence. He usually talked a lot. ""You can't fool me. You'll do what you want now,"" he said. ""With all those certificates, I was told you will get a scholarship to Oxford.""
""So?"" I said, trying to be brave. ""Mightn't that be useful?""
""I also heard,"" he continued, and I knew a confrontation was coming, ""that you want to be a barrister. A barrister of all things!"" My father knew a lot about barristers and the law.
""I just said that,"" I replied. ""I couldn't think of anything else to say!""
""And apparently,"" he went on, ""you have the right personality - you can understand things quickly, you talk well, and you enjoy performing.""
""I don't know about that,"" I said. ""All I know is what I see in TV dramas.""
""Be that as it may,"" he continued, ""I feel your heart's never going to be in the business now. Obviously, you'll go to Oxford University, and after that, I can't see you wanting it.""
The problem was that, like many children in family businesses, I felt trapped by family expectations. I could see different careers open to me, and I wanted to explore them. At the same time, I didn't want to upset my father. I wasn't as scared of him as Maurice was - I was the favorite - but I found him intimidating.
""It's too soon to know,"" I said weakly.
""I tell you you're not going to want to join us,"" said my father, who was usually right about these things, ""and it's a pity because you've got the gifts - the brains, the nerves, the vision.""
""There's still Maurice,"" I said, sulking. My father snorted. We both knew Maurice hated the business.
""Anyway,"" I continued, ""you could always use me as a sort of consultant.""
My mother wasn't around to help - she had died when I was young, and my father raised me and Maurice. Maurice was two years younger, and because he was motherless, I got used to taking care of him. It wasn't hard. I loved Maurice. Because the business was successful, we lived in luxury - a big house in London, posh schools, nice clothes, parties, theatres, operas. My father knew many people - politicians, actors, businessmen - and our house was full of interesting conversations.
""I tell you what,"" my father continued. ""You can help us during holidays until you leave Oxford, and then if you decide to leave us, you can. It will give you some pocket money and be a real help to me.""
""OK,"" I said, relieved to avoid immediate decisions and my father's sulks if I opposed him. This was how he controlled us.
So it happened. In my last term at school, and then during university vacations, I helped out, never more than twice a year, and always on the safer tasks. I became one of the smarter students, with a little house, a small but powerful white car, designer clothes, and a black dress with a Paris label that I planned to wear for my final exams.
In my last term, my father visited me and took me to a village for a meal and a chat. There were only a few weeks left. My tutor predicted I would get a First Class degree (in Law), and I knew that if I stayed focused, he might be right. I felt confident and concentrated.
This was not to be. My father told me that, in about a week, he needed me for one last task, the most important business the family firm had ever attempted, and that it would be worth my while.
""But Dad,"" I protested, ""I've got my final exams coming up, and I need to concentrate on that. It's really important that I do well, and I don't want to think about anything else right now.""
I could tell that such pressures were beyond my father's imagination (or maybe he was jealous of my life away from him?) and that he would see a refusal as a betrayal in his time of need.
That was not all. As he described the task, I saw more clearly than ever before the focus and skill with which my father worked, his energy, and self-control. In his way, he was a sort of genius, and I respected that. It made my own plans seem less important.
""All right,"" I said. ""I'll do it."""
CPE_56,C2,"Simon Costello realized that buying the house in Pembroke Square was a mistake within a year of moving in with his wife, Lois. They could only afford it by being very careful with money, which wasn't ideal. At first, it seemed like a good decision because Simon had many successful cases, and Lois had returned to her job at the advertising agency with a salary increase to thirty-five thousand. Lois was the one who wanted to move, arguing that their flat wasn't suitable for a family, and they needed more space, a garden, and a place for an au pair. They could have found these in a less expensive area, but Lois wanted more than just space. She felt their old address wasn't good enough for a successful couple like them. 
To save money, Lois decided one of them should use public transport. Since her job was far away, Simon had to take the crowded tube, which made him unhappy. He often thought about his grandfather's house in Hampstead, where he was treated well after a long day. But times had changed, and Lois made it clear that her career was as important as his. They needed both salaries to maintain their lifestyle.
Now, their situation was at risk because of Venetia. She had come to their office upset and accused Simon of knowing that a client, Brian Cartwright, had bribed a jury four years ago. She also said Cartwright gave shares to Simon's fiancée before the trial. Simon denied it, but his denial sounded weak even to himself. He felt guilty and remembered being punished as a child. He wished he had been prepared and said something different. Venetia's anger and disgust confused him. He wondered why she was so upset and if she had the right to ruin his career. If the rumor spread, he knew he would be in serious trouble."
CPE_36,C2,"I chose this place to live because I thought I could be anonymous here. I believed people wouldn't care if the rented houses were falling apart or if the gardens were overgrown. But I was wrong. People in the shops soon start to recognize you. The roses next door remind me that the gardens were once loved. Usually, I stay inside, trying to forget about the summer outside, but tonight, I am watching the birds flying between the trees and roofs. I have cleared some space in the garden for a chair, and my arms are scratched from the plants. It is a small London garden where plants must grow tall to survive. 
My upstairs neighbor, Jaz, leans out of the window. She has written several unpublished books, and as an English teacher, I sometimes have to pretend to like them. I have her latest book now. 'How's the work going, Jaz?' I ask. 'In no other job do people ask you about your work all the time,' she replies. Then she says, 'I'll bring something to drink.' I don't want Jaz in the garden, and I realize it looks messy. The only way to the garden is through my flat, and Jaz is knocking on my door. 'You're on holiday now,' she says, sitting in the chair. 'I should've been a teacher - writers don't get holidays. They say, those who can, do, those who can't, teach.' And some can't do either. 'What plans for the holidays?' she asks. I feel anxious about the school year ending. Empty days. Hot pavements. The walk to the shops. The park with its fountain, and loneliness on the bench. 'I'm going to Stonebridge tomorrow. Can you feed the cats?' I ask, feeling nervous. 'Of course,' Jaz says, 'if I'm around,' knowing she will be. 'Where will you stay?' she asks. 'With my oldest friend, Ruby, at the Rising Sun,' I lie. 'Going back to your roots. What do you think of my book?' Jaz asks about her manuscript, The Cruelty of Red Vans, which I haven't finished reading. I like the title and tell her. I decide to be honest. 'Try writing about nice people for a change,' I suggest. 'Teachers!' Jaz responds like a student unhappy with a grade. 'I keep a journal where I write something good about each day,' I say. 'Keep a journal! Nice people! Get a life, Ann,' Jaz replies. I have a life. I have my work, and I go out sometimes. When we go inside, my kitchen feels calm. Then I remember my school geography teacher, Miss Tarrantine, who was about my age, winking and saying, 'I've had my moments.' We almost died laughing."
CPE_6,C2,"**Heritage**
Heritage is important because it connects people and communities to the past. We often feel connected to our personal heritage, knowing about our grandparents and their stories. But there is also a need to learn about our wider past to understand our future. Heritage gives us a sense of continuity, helping us find our place in history. Just like we inherit genes, we also inherit culture from past generations. There may be parts of our national heritage we don't like, but it is still ours, and it makes us feel part of something bigger. Heritage teaches us a lot and is important for our well-being. It influences everything from customs to material culture. In the past, we learned about our heritage through stories from our ancestors. However, Western industrial society broke up communities, and much of this oral tradition is lost. Now, places and buildings help us learn about our past. It is important to preserve these as a testament to our ancestors' identity.
**The Fens**
I started writing a novel called ""Waterland,"" where the landscape of the Fens in England became important. People often ask why I, a Londoner with no personal connection to the Fens, chose to write about it. I chose the Fens because they seemed simple and empty, a good setting for my story. But I learned that the Fens are not flat or empty. They are as English as any other place but also strange and mysterious. It is interesting that in the middle of England, the Fens feel foreign to many English people. The Fens are both empty and full, cultivated and wild, open and mysterious. My research for the novel was not extensive. I have not visited places like Wisbech or Prickwillow. As a fiction writer, I prefer to imagine worlds rather than rely on facts. Imagining the Fens has its own logic because, as Edward Storey's book shows, the Fens are not just a landscape but a state of mind.
**Museums**
Museums should make their collections easy to access. In the past, this meant putting items in display cases with long labels. Now, displays should be lively and interesting, using techniques to capture visitors' attention and emotions. Museums should also reach out to the community. For example, they can provide loan boxes of objects for teachers or use similar materials to help elderly people with memory loss. Museums focus on real artefacts and specimens, not replicas. They offer a chance to see and learn from real historical items. This is what makes them different from heritage centers, theme parks, books, and CDs. Museums that create exciting displays and outreach programs will find that virtual history can actually help them by increasing interest in the real items they have.
**Architecture and Environment**
The desire to preserve things is not new, but changes in our towns happen quickly and affect us all. This makes some people want to preserve everything, while others think more about the future of towns. People who have lived through events like world wars may value preservation more. Stability becomes important to them. If there is a need for preservation, planners should consider it. Change is not bad if we learn to manage it. Physical changes in our towns reflect social changes, like changes in population, welfare, and demands."
CPE_33,C2,"**Einstein**
If you ask someone on the street to name a scientist, they will probably say Albert Einstein. His face is often used to sell smart products, like computers and encyclopedias. Most people don't know much about what Einstein did, except that he created some theories called 'relativity'. These theories are famous for being hard to understand and making strange predictions that seem different from everyday life. Einstein was part of a big change in science, which started modern science in the 20th century. Scientists were trying to describe the universe better by studying matter and natural forces. Einstein made important contributions by rethinking the basics: time, space, matter, and energy. Before him, people followed Isaac Newton's idea that stars and planets moved in a fixed space and time. Einstein changed this idea, saying that time and space are not fixed but relative.
**Young Readers**
When we were children, Lydia and I didn't trust books that won prizes because we thought they would be 'worthy', which to us meant 'boring'. Our mother didn't like our attitude and would criticize us, but our father would happily give us small amounts of money to encourage us to read these books. He would also sneak in some good books among our Christmas and birthday gifts, marking them with 'This Book is NOT Literature'. Although we ignored most of his choices as 'boys' books', he did introduce us to some good short stories and once to a famous collection of poems.
**Language**
In 1851, Jacob Grimm wrote that 'The origin of human language is truly secret and marvellous'. This mystery has led to many strange ideas. In 1928, Charles Caller said that early humans might have made sounds like ""meuh"" when they felt danger. ""Meuh"" sounds sad. People who lived in dangerous places with scary animals made desperate sounds, and some words today might still have echoes of those sounds, like malaria meaning ""fever"" or the Latin mors meaning ""death"". Because of these odd ideas, many people avoided the topic, thinking it was for eccentric thinkers. But recently, the origin and evolution of language have become important research areas. Language probably started in East Africa about 100,000 years ago. It was mainly used for friendly communication and was important in power struggles. Sharing information was likely not its main original purpose, unlike what philosopher John Locke thought when he said language was a 'great conduit' for sharing knowledge."
CPE_20,C2,"'Writing Reviews Frank Kermode looks at the skill of writing reviews from a writer's perspective. Most reviews are written and shared in ways that make them last only a short time. There are deadlines and strict limits on their length. Once published, they stay relevant only as long as the newspaper they are in - a day, a week, or at most a month. The short life of reviews often decides their literary value. Many people, including the writers, think reviewing is a job done for reasons like needing money or because they can't spend all day working on a novel or a serious book. However, reviewing is a skilled and complex job. It's one thing to be quick and fair in a short newspaper review, and another to write a long, detailed review for international journals. The fifteen hundred words of a main article in weekly magazines have challenges of both short and long reviews. Length is not the only thing to consider. The reviewer must think about the audience, from casual readers to those deeply interested in the subject. A reviewer needs to know a lot about many things and must write in a way that intelligent people can understand and enjoy. This means the reviewer often writes other things besides reviews. The American novelist John Updike, who doesn't think highly of criticism, still enjoys writing reviews between his novels. He collects all his reviews, even short ones, into books with modest titles. Some might think lesser-known writers should accept that their reviews are temporary, but if they can, they should enjoy some lasting recognition, especially if they believe some of their best writing is in reviews. I feel this way about my own work. My main job has been academic, and most of my serious books are academic, the kind professors like and are expected to write. In the English-speaking world, unlike other cultures, it's common for the same people to do both reviewing and literary study. The days are gone when academics criticized professors for writing reviews, or when non-professors complained that professors were taking their jobs. Now, there is so much reviewing that almost everyone can do some, although the pay is often small. I believe this is good for readers, as they can trust the reviewer knows what they are talking about, and for professors, as it helps keep them balanced. It also reminds them to communicate clearly with non-professors. When talking to each other, they might use complex language, but when addressing intelligent non-professors, they need to be clear. Finally, reviewing must be a secondary job. You can only do it well if you are also doing something else well.'"
CPE_40,C2,"Ralph unlocked the door to his apartment and entered the dark, quiet hallway. Even after three years, he sometimes felt a little unsure about owning the place when he came home alone at the end of the day. When he first bought the flat, he would come home excited and curious, often as early as possible, wondering what the flat had been like while he was away. It felt like a welcoming place to him, where he was in control. He thought he should worry about things like intruders or leaks, but the flat always seemed to be waiting for him, either tidy or messy, depending on how he left it. Over time, he started to see it as just another part of himself, a space filled with his thoughts and feelings. He became frustrated that it couldn't change. Sometimes, there would be a small pile of letters by the door or the answering machine would have messages when he returned. He was glad the windows hadn't been broken or the flat damaged, but he wondered what it would look like if that happened. From his dull office on the Holloway Road, Ralph often looked forward to his evenings alone at home. Once he left the office and started his bus ride home, he felt more like himself and didn't need to be alone anymore, though he often forgot this when planning his social life. At his desk, he longed for time alone with his things, but once home, he felt empty and waited for a sense of self to return. Instead, he felt a deep emptiness, making him think that working in a job he didn't like had changed him, moving him away from who he thought he was. He would read or listen to music at night, but now he wondered why he did these things. His thoughts and feelings were unclear, and he felt lost. There was a time, he thought, when he didn't feel this way, when he might have escaped if he had realized his own value. But he had been eager to settle into something and followed the first path that seemed right. After university, he tried to make a plan for his future, but he only wanted to survive quietly. He applied for jobs he heard about from friends, following their paths without thinking he could find happiness in his work. He went to one interview and didn't think much about the job, which was an editorial role at a free local newspaper. He was happy to have a pleasant conversation with Neil, his boss, and didn't think about the long meetings he would have later. Neil offered him the job right away, saying Ralph was the only graduate who applied, which Ralph took as a compliment at the time."
CPE_45,C2,"**Goat Racing**
I was about to see goat racing. It was Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. I moved through ice-cream vans, many people, food stalls, and loud music. Everyone was going to the racecourse, and I tried to find a good spot. A part of the area was marked off for the race. It wasn't like big racecourses, but people stood on both sides of the track to watch the goats run. It was hard to keep the goats in order because they like to eat almost anything.
**Canoe Trip**
As the day ended, I started to worry about the night. The canoe was too wet to sleep in, and we hadn't seen any villages or huts since morning. In the dim moonlight, we used our torch to see the cliffs, but the batteries were low. We put in new ones, but they didn't work. We couldn't find a place to camp. A few miles later, Lesley thought she saw a light, and we felt hopeful. But it was just moonlight on the waves. Soon, we heard the loud noise of fast water, but we couldn't see what was happening. Time seemed to stop as we moved on.
**How to be Presentation Perfect - we answer your questions**
I am not good at making presentations, but as a managing director, I have to present to my colleagues and major shareholders. How can I improve my presentation skills and confidence? You are not alone. Presenting is a different skill from running a company, but many senior executives need to be good at it. If you want to convince your audience, you must believe in what you are saying. Show your passion and enthusiasm. Do your homework and test your ideas before the presentation. Ask colleagues to think of difficult questions the audience might ask. Start with something everyone agrees on and build towards your conclusion."
CPE_64,C2,"Some activities cannot be rushed. They take the time they need. If you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you add oil too quickly to mayonnaise, it will curdle. If you pull too hard on a tangled fishing line, the knot will get tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some things it does very fast, while others take longer. We can get faster at solving puzzles or doing math in our heads. But some things cannot be rushed, or they will fail, like the mayonnaise or the fishing line. Sometimes, trying to think fast is not helpful, like trying to sleep in half the time. We learn and think in different ways, and these ways work at different speeds. ""He who hesitates is lost,"" says one proverb. ""Look before you leap,"" says another. Both are true. The mind has three different speeds. The first is faster than thought. Some situations need a quick, automatic reaction. When my motorbike skidded on a wet road, my brain and body reacted quickly to keep me safe. A concert pianist or an Olympic fencer also reacts quickly without thinking. This fast physical intelligence is called our ""wits."" Then there is thought itself, which involves figuring things out, weighing pros and cons, and solving problems. A mechanic fixing an engine, a scientist interpreting results, or a student working on an assignment all use this kind of thinking, which we call ""intellect."" Someone good at this is called ""bright"" or ""clever."" Below this is a slower way of thinking. It is less clear and more relaxed. When we are lost in thought by the sea or just waking up, we are in this mode. This slow way of knowing is just as smart as the faster ones. Letting the mind wander is important, especially when life gets busy. Thinking slowly is a vital skill. Some problems are better solved with a slow mind. Recent studies show that slow thinking is good for understanding complex or unclear situations. Deliberate thinking works well for simple problems. But when we don't know what to consider or when the issue is too subtle, we need the slow mind. If the problem is managing difficult people at work or deciding to change careers, it might be better to think slowly. This type of intelligence is linked to creativity and wisdom. Poets have always known the limits of deliberate thinking and have used slower ways of knowing. Philosophers have written about the parts of the mind beyond conscious thought. Recently, scientists have started to study these slower ways of knowing. Cognitive science shows that the unconscious mind can do many important tasks if given time. It can learn patterns, understand complex situations, and solve difficult issues better than fast thinking."
CPE_29,C2,"**Surviving in a Foreign Land**
I have been welcomed warmly. It's a friendly and well-equipped base camp in a very isolated place. At any time, there are about forty people - scientists, students, weather experts, satellite trackers - in a close community where everyone helps each other. My basic French is just enough to communicate, but not to have casual conversations. I miss the small details, and my phrasebook is not helpful at breakfast. This is not a practical problem for me, but at first, it affected my self-confidence. I was a bit nervous about mealtimes. I would hesitate, worried about which table to choose, scared of the silence when I spoke, anxious like I was in the first weeks of school. I still smile awkwardly or panic when people talk to me. I think the reason for this occasional sadness is not about missing company or communication, but because I've lost the social advantage that my ability to talk has always given me.
**Elliot**
When I first met Elliot, I was just a young author like any other, and he didn't pay much attention to me. He never forgot a face though, and when I saw him here or there, he shook hands with me politely, but didn't try to become friends; and if I saw him at the opera, for example, he was with important people and didn't notice me. But then I had a big success as a playwright, and soon I noticed that Elliot was more interested in me. One day, I got a note from him inviting me to lunch, and I thought he was testing me. But after that, since my success brought me many new friends, I started to see him more often.
**Alfred Hitchcock**
The film director Alfred Hitchcock always said that he didn't care about the story of his films, or even the acting, but he did care about the photography, the soundtrack, and all the technical parts. For Hitchcock, it wasn't a message or a great performance that moved the audience; he believed that people are excited by pure film, no matter their cultural background. So, if a film is made correctly, in terms of its emotional impact, the Japanese audience should scream at the same moment as the Indian audience. Hitchcock's view of himself was always clear, logical, and hard to argue with. He was a man of reason and a talented craftsman who liked to hear an audience scream. He didn't deal with guesses, abstract ideas, or intellectual hints, and his view of his own film characters was not deep. He focused on film, pure film, and the most precise, calculated beauty of what a strip of film can do to an audience."
CPE_57,C2,"**Amateur Astronomy**
Many things have changed in astronomy over the last 50 years. About 30 years ago, there were not many charts and catalogues. Telescopes were limited, and there were few books on practical astronomy. Today, you can find many telescopes and equipment for almost everything you need. Electronic calculators and computers have changed how we make almanacs and charts, and they help with analyzing observations and publishing results. This might be the best time for amateur astronomy. However, some things have been lost. Now, you might have to travel 80 km to find a sky as clear as it was in cities 50 years ago. During the day, airplane trails can last for hours and turn into clouds, making it hard to observe the sun and stars at night.
**Too Much Choice**
Society has too many choices now. There are too many things to do and too many options. In the new economy, people always want the next new product or service, and technology makes changes happen faster. New products come out quickly, and it can be overwhelming. More choices mean more stress, less time, and more complexity. People are now looking for 'simplexity' - simple things that give meaning in a complex world. But simplifying life is hard when there are so many products. There are more types of detergent and breakfast cereals than we need, and more software updates and phone plans than we can keep track of.
**McAndrews Hotel**
Every summer, we spend two weeks at McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. It is a family tradition started by my grandmother, and now it is very important to us. Nothing can change this ritual. The people who stay at McAndrews are similar: old-fashioned, maybe a bit odd, and some might say snobbish. I do not like the bad manners and rudeness of shop assistants today, which some call equality. I do not like waiters who try to be too friendly. I know most of the other guests' names because they have been coming here since they were children, like me. But I can be sure that when I see them in the hotel, we will only exchange a polite greeting. Such respect for dignity and personal privacy is rare in hotels these days."
CPE_9,C2,"**Othello**
A special production of Shakespeare's play ""Othello"" has moved from Stratford to London. This gives me a chance to correct a review I wrote when the show first opened last spring. At that time, I said that Ray Fearon was too young to play Othello and criticized his acting. I still believe that the age difference between Othello and Desdemona is important, but I now admit that Mr. Fearon's performance is excellent. In fact, the whole cast is excellent. Some memorable scenes include Cassio's dangerous games with other young officers and the moment when Iago starts to lose control. The scene where Emilia helps Desdemona get ready for bed is very emotional. The pace and tension of the play are amazing. Don't miss this production.
**Lake Vostok**
In the middle of Antarctica, there is no movement. On the edges of the continent, there are many penguins, seals, and birds. But on the large white plateau inside, there is no life. Except for a huge hidden lake called Lake Vostok, which is under almost 4 kilometers of ice, right below the coldest place on earth. The water has been cut off from air and sunlight for up to 25 million years. Biologists are eager to explore its mysterious depths and find out what strange creatures live there. Geologists and glaciologists are also very interested. For two years, researchers from around the world have been planning how to uncover the lake's secrets. If they succeed, the next few years will be known as the decade of Lake Vostok.
**Scientists**
There was an interesting discussion on the radio last week. It seems that some scientists are very excited about what makes them want to be scientists. The phrase ""because it's there"" comes to mind. We all know it's the old search for knowledge, the wish to understand everything from atoms to black holes. But these scientists want to know why we want to know all of this in the first place and why science can't explain why we want to know. Surely, it's more important to know if what scientists are doing is right, rather than getting stuck in debates about the purpose of it all. I think the important issue is not why we pursue science, but to understand that science is a tool, and we should decide how, where, when, and why to use it."
CPE_42,C2,"**Food**
Our relationship with food is very basic and satisfying. Many people who love cooking buy cookbooks like this one. Often, we think that cooking is only worth it for special occasions or complicated dishes. But that's not true. You can make a delicious soup by just putting some chopped carrots, a leek, celery, and a few herbs into water. This is much better than buying a packet or opening a can. Instead of buying a chocolate mousse with too many preservatives, you can make a delicious dessert in five minutes that both adults and children will love. Cooking is also a way to show care and love. Sharing food is important for our deepest human needs, which is why we celebrate birthdays, anniversaries, and other events around tables. No one would have a takeaway for a wedding or anniversary party! And not many people would discuss a business deal over canned soup.
**In the Elevator**
This morning, Alistair tried to clean his office, but papers were still everywhere. Tax forms were sticking out of desk drawers and boxes, waiting for a day when he felt like filing them. He also had extra paperwork because he owned an apartment building. Books and journals were near the new bookshelves but not organized. As the elevator took him to his floor, he knew Mallory would be on time for their meeting. She would knock on his office door exactly on time. She was very precise about time and neatness. How would she react to the mess? She might think someone had messed up his office. He could pretend to be surprised when he walked in. Mrs. Wilson, his cleaning lady, came while he was trying to clear some space on the carpet. He smiled at her with hope when she was unlocking his apartment. But she looked at him with hard eyes. She didn't want to clean his office. She thought of him as someone from far away, not from her world in Brooklyn.
**KAREN**
Karen wanted to be different from her mother, so she created her own story of strength. One important moment was when she was twelve, and her brother accidentally hit her in the eye with a golf club. At first, she thought she was blind, but the doctor said the bone protected her eye. She only needed a few stitches. When she opened her eyes in the doctor's office and saw her mother, she felt she was saved for a reason.
**Miss Fogerty**
Miss Fogerty was walking quickly across the village green, feeling both excited and sad. She had just learned something important. In a small community, it's exciting to be the first to know something. But she was also very sad about Dr. Bailey's condition. He had been her doctor for many years and helped her with her yearly throat problems. She appreciated how he always made time for his patients and listened to their worries. This made him very loved in the village. He always gave his time, knowledge, and humor, and in return, he received loyalty and affection."
CPE_59,C2,"**Joanna's Lessons**
Joanna MacGregor is a busy concert pianist. But she has also started writing books for young children learning the piano. Joanna is known for her amazing piano performances. She plays many styles of music, like classical, jazz, blues, and more. At a recent concert for kids, a boy asked her to play ""Match of the Day."" Joanna found this funny and played it, making the boy happy.
Joanna is different from many top pianists because she cares about how young children learn the piano. She has written a piano book for children called ""Joanna MacGregor's Piano World."" She did this even though she has a very busy schedule. She is involved in many music festivals, runs her own recording label, and likes to work with other artists.
Joanna believes the first piano lessons are very important. She thinks music should be for everyone, not just for those who want to be great musicians. She grew up with many children learning different kinds of music at her home, where her mother taught piano. She believes everyone should have the chance to learn the piano, just like learning to swim or speak a little French.
Some children learn piano quickly, but Joanna is interested in those who take their time. Many children stop learning because they feel they can't meet their parents' expectations. Joanna wants music to be something children enjoy, not something they feel pressured to do.
Joanna's piano books are colorful and fun. They include stories and CDs with music to make learning enjoyable. She believes learning should be fun and encourages children to explore the piano. As children progress, they need to learn to read music, not just play by ear. Joanna understands this because she also relied on her ear when she was young.
The most important thing, Joanna says, is practice. She didn't practice seriously until she went to the Royal Academy of Music. Now, she practices eight hours a day, which she finds very important. She advises children to know what they want to achieve before they practice and to mix hard and easy pieces."
CPE_54,C2,"**Writing by Hand and on Screen**
Dr. Johnson once said, ""What is written without effort is in general read without pleasure."" This means that good writing is often difficult to create. When I look back at my handwritten school essays, I notice there were not many mistakes. Today, I would rewrite them many times. I think this is because writing by hand was hard work. Writing slowly made me think carefully. Since it was hard to change or erase, I wrote with care. On the other hand, using a computer can make us careless. Many writers find that they spend as much time fixing drafts on a computer as they did writing by hand. Also, emails, unlike handwritten letters, can be emotionally heavy. Some say emails have brought back the art of love letters. Many love emails are sent now, where before there was just small talk. That's a good thing. At least these emails are written in some form of English and grammar. But words on a screen can feel dull. Writers who are not used to the power of words may exaggerate. Words typed quickly lack the care and character of handwriting.
**The CD**
I put down my cup and looked at the CD. The case was not impressive, but the shiny disc inside was interesting. ""Wonderful little things, aren't they?"" Mr. Warriston said, coming back into the room. I agreed and carefully gave the disc to him. ""Amazing they can hold seventy minutes of music,"" he said, bending to the hi-fi device. He turned it on, and lights came on. He pressed a button, and a small drawer opened. He put the disc inside, pressed the button again, and the tray went back in. ""Some people say they sound sterile, but I think they..."" ""Do you have to turn them over, like records?"" I asked. ""What? No,"" Mr. Warriston said, standing up straight. ""No, you only play one side."" ""Why?"" I asked. He looked confused, then thoughtful. ""You know,"" he said, ""I have no idea. I don't see why you couldn't make both sides playable and double the capacity..."" He looked at the machine. ""You could have two lasers, or just turn it over by hand... hmm."" He smiled at me. ""Yes, good point."" He nodded at my wooden chair. ""Anyway. Come on, let's get you sitting in the best place for the stereo effect, eh?"" I smiled, happy to have asked a technical question Mr. Warriston couldn't answer.
**Books versus Electronic Text**
When comparing books and electronic text, author Malcolm Bradbury was right when he said that if matches had been invented after lighters, we'd think they were an improvement. Many people, excited by new technology, say electronic text is as important as the invention of printing and that it is almost complete. They forget that changes in how we think take a long time. This kind of thinking is called chronocentricity, the belief that our generation is at the center of history. For example, a book from 1979 said, ""The 1980s will see the book as we know it begin a slow and steady slide to oblivion."" So far, this has not happened. Reading long texts on a screen is not enjoyable, so most people don't do it. Also, the way information is organized on computers makes people read only small parts. Some say this leads to new ways of storytelling, but there's nothing new about reading non-linearly. Many books, like religious texts, dictionaries, and poetry collections, are not read from start to finish. What is new is that computers don't encourage reading a whole text.
**The Office**
Charles walked into the office and saw a perfect world of order. The carpet was clear of the papers that had covered it since it was put down, and the desk was dark wood, just as he remembered from the auction five weeks ago. Neat file-holders were being put in their drawers. Twelve years of trade journals filled the shelves on one wall. Kathleen struggled to close the filing cabinet and then turned to him. ""You have to use computers, Charles. This is too much."" ""Hello, Kathleen. Oh, this is amazing."" He admired the room and its antique furniture. He wasn't thinking about a computer or any other machine in it, not even a pencil sharpener. ""Simply amazing,"" he said, avoiding the topic of computers. Over the two years he had known her, they had this conversation many times. She couldn't understand why he resisted technology when he was so good with computers and had even published an important paper on computer skills. She had inspired that paper. With a keyboard, she could change any software into something new."
CPE_32,C2,"""You don't take sugar, do you?"" shouted his secretary. She wasn't really asking because she had been making Lancelot coffee for many months. She sometimes forgot because he wasn't supposed to be there often. But now, he was there all the time. He realized that staying away from work caused problems. He thought about how he went from being a valued advisor, meeting authors and playwrights over lunch, to someone always trying to prevent disasters, with no parking space at work.
""This came,"" she yelled, waving a manila folder and putting it in front of him. ""From that guy in Los Angeles. You said you wanted to see it."" The label said: ""A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert."" It also said ""An Expanded Synopsis."" Lancelot did not want to see another synopsis. He wanted to see a ""First Draft."" Ian Cuthbert had been given a large advance for this book when Lancelot bought the company. Ian was an old friend, and Lancelot had made the mistake of commissioning books from friends. Ian was proof that friends can be unreliable.
Lancelot skipped the introduction, which he had read many times, and looked at the synopsis. It was all familiar. He closed the folder and put it aside. Ian's manuscript seemed like it would never come. The synopsis lacked the brilliance Ian was known for and felt unconvincing. Lancelot remembered a famous author whose last book was published incomplete after his death, with payments made chapter by chapter. But Ian's advance had been huge, which was against the usual business practice of paying authors after they deliver a manuscript.
Lancelot, who studied modern languages at Oxford, remembered when Ian was the most promising talent at Cambridge. Ian's peers had taken over British theatre quickly, but Ian's energy seemed unmatched. He wore his coat like a cape and talked about famous writers as if he knew them. Yet, Ian's talent stayed hidden. While others succeeded, Ian became more difficult. He was chosen to edit an arts magazine but never published an issue. His contract with a fashion magazine produced little except stories about his high salary, which increased to make him work more, but he still produced nothing. At editorial meetings, Ian criticized others' ideas. Ten years later, he was unreliable. Lancelot was starting to admit that ""A World History of the Short"" was a mistake from the beginning."
CPE_65,C2,"'England's breakfast change Health experts agree that a good breakfast is very important. However, in history, breakfast is quite new in England. In medieval times, breakfast is rarely mentioned in literature. There are some mentions of travelers eating at dawn before long journeys, and sick people having breakfast for health reasons. But most people did not eat breakfast unless they were kings or nobles. In the sixteenth century, breakfast slowly became normal for everyone. Some say this was because there was more food available. But they may not have thought about other big social changes. For example, new work patterns might explain why breakfast became more important. People started working for set hours, often very early. So, eating in the morning became necessary and was not just for the rich."
CPE_61,C2,"**Photography**
When a photographer takes a picture, they choose what to show based on their skills, personal views, and cultural norms. In this book, we will see how these factors affect the style and message of a photo, and how people react to it. For example, when we look at a photo in a newspaper, we might think about whether it shows the scene accurately or if it shows the photographer's opinion. Is the exact moment important, or is the photo a symbol of something bigger in the world?
**More than a Game**
For me, sport is more than just a game. The best athletes believe in themselves completely. To succeed, you need to focus only on your goal. Sport is tough, and no one will do it for you. It's either succeed or fail. Sport has taught me discipline and determination, and also how to work as part of a team. My sport lets you shine individually, but it's also a team game, so you need to balance both. Like in life, you can succeed alone, but you must remember others around you. Sport has given me a lot, not just money. It has opened doors and shown me things around the world. But you also have to give up a lot for these benefits.
**Tuning In**
Some experiences stay very clear in our memory. For me, one such moment happened one night in California many years ago. I was awake, listening to a mockingbird singing beautifully from a hidden spot in a tree. I don't usually have trouble sleeping, but the bird's amazing song kept me awake. As I listened to its complex melodies, I thought of my knowledge of jazz and Indian classical music. The bird's song felt like an amazing, improvised performance. I reacted with surprise and joy to each new musical variation until I finally fell asleep."
CPE_52,C2,"People have always had strong feelings about birds. But what do these feelings say about us? Paul Evans explores this idea. In a greenhouse, a small brown bird, a wren, is hitting the glass. Is it trying to tell us something, or is it just trapped? Both ideas could be true. Wrens have been part of British culture for a long time. In the past, people believed the direction a wren flew could bring good or bad luck. Today, wrens are still popular in British art and homes. Even if old beliefs are forgotten, wrens are still important to us. A forest without wrens feels empty. This is because birds have always been part of our stories and beliefs. In the past, people depended on nature to survive and created stories about animals. These stories can change over time. For example, the red kite was once a common bird in London, seen as helpful. Later, it was seen as a pest and almost disappeared, except in Wales. Now, red kites are protected and are a symbol of conservation in Britain. Our connection to birds goes back to early humans. They watched birds to learn about danger, weather, and food. Birds also connected them to their dreams. When we think about why birds matter to us, we also think about what it means to be human. Birds represent freedom and beauty, and we admire them. Some people think our feelings about birds are old and not needed now, but they are still part of us. Birds are now seen as indicators of environmental health. In Britain, 30 bird species are in danger, which is sad because it means losing part of our culture. Birds like the skylark and turtle dove are symbols of love and magic. Losing them is a cultural loss. Birds that are not in stories or literature are often ignored. Folklore is important because it keeps stories alive and connects us to nature. These stories have a power that scientific facts do not. Watching birds, whether on TV or in our gardens, brings excitement that science cannot explain. Birds are fascinating, and the stories we tell about them help us understand their messages. The wren in the greenhouse is a mystery, linking the present with the past and future."
CPE_28,C2,"'Maps The purpose of a map is to show the relationships between points and features on the earth's surface. These are shown by distance and direction. In the past, distance was often described in time, like 'a day's journey by river', which told more about how easy it was to travel than the actual distance. Direction was also important, but for most travelers, the main questions were 'Where do I go from here?' and 'How far is it?' Because of this, written travel guides were popular for a long time. Even today, some maps, like those of railway systems, might not show true directions. Early maps used signs to show important landmarks, and these signs varied in size to show their importance. The style of maps changed depending on their purpose and location, so understanding early maps requires knowing the style used. The history of map-making is about improving the accuracy of distance and direction and adding more details. Map-making has used other sciences to help. For example, instead of using shadows or stars to find direction, people used the magnetic compass. Instruments were created to measure angles accurately. As people explored more, they tried to map the world. Astronomers found that the earth is not a perfect sphere, which changed how large areas were mapped. Over time, different people needed maps for different reasons. Soldiers needed accurate maps for planning battles, which led to the invention of contour lines. Archaeologists, historians, and geographers also needed special maps. Today, map-makers create maps showing many things, like geological layers and land use. The value of maps in many sciences has led to a modern revival of map-making. The development of maps has not always been smooth. There have been times of slow progress and times of fast development. Sometimes old ideas stayed alongside new ones. Map-makers often knew how to improve maps but had to wait for better tools. Since copying old maps was easy and cheaper, publishers were often slow to accept new ideas. Therefore, maps should not always be seen as accurate evidence of what people knew at the time. The many maps we have today are the result of much work and thought. They are an important record of human history, making the study of old maps both interesting and educational.'"
CPE_35,C2,"**Tim Rice's Story**
I was invited into a young man's living room. It was a nice and organized space, unlike the messy rooms around it. Moving from the kitchen to his room felt like going from economy to business class on a plane. He had the largest collection of records I had ever seen, the first stereo record player and tuner I had come across, and he had even bought Georgian wine glasses, pictures, and furniture. His name was Andrew Lloyd Webber. He had won a scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford, to study history, and he had nine months before starting. During this time, he wanted to become England's answer to the composer Richard Rodgers. 
I had my own big dreams. I wanted to be a pop star for reasons like women, money, and fame. The difference between Andrew and me was that my dreams were not as serious to me. But when Andrew suggested I try to become a famous lyricist like Oscar Hammerstein, I decided to give it a try. This was because, within ten minutes of meeting, he played me three tunes he had composed, and I could tell he was very good. He played more music from shows he had written at school, reminding me of the best show albums from my parents' collection. He needed a new lyricist for the outside world. I didn't have much to impress him with, except for praising his music and a seven-inch single of a song I had written, which an unknown pop group had recorded. We promised to meet again and write something together. 
I was still more interested in pop music than in theater, but I knew I had met someone with rare talent and determination. I thought it would be a mistake not to work with him. Even if we didn't succeed in musical theater, we could try to compete with the Beatles and Rolling Stones later. The Everly Brothers had just made a comeback and might need new songs. 
The next day, back at my desk where I was training to become a lawyer, my certainty about a life in show business with Andrew had faded a bit. I would still look for groups needing a vocalist and write more songs, but it seemed likely I would become a lawyer by the time I was twenty-five. My father predicted I would grow out of pop music by the time I was twenty-one, which worried me because I only had a few more months to enjoy it. But I felt I had nothing to lose by seeing Andrew again. It would be fun to write lyrics for musicals instead of pop songs. Andrew was interesting and talked about good food and Victorian architecture, and he supported Leyton Orient football team. 
I wasn't sure about the musical idea he had been working on, about Dr. Thomas Barnardo, a philanthropist who founded orphanages. The story was worthy but didn't excite me. The hero was too perfect, and the idea was not original, similar to Lionel Bart's show, Oliver. However, Andrew's belief in his music was infectious and not completely wrong. What did I know about musicals? As David Land, who later became my agent, said, if there's a demand for one hamburger bar, there is room for two. We could be the second one. I started working with great enthusiasm, especially on the funny songs. Andrew explained the plot, played the tunes, and often gave me the titles, which his previous lyricist had thought of. I skipped a day at the office, pretending to be sick, to write my first theatrical lyrics. I didn't know it then, but I had changed careers."
CPE_5,C2,"**Language**
Humans have a special ability: we can communicate with each other using language. Language is so important in our lives that it is hard to imagine living without it. If you see two or more people together anywhere in the world, they will probably start talking. Even when alone, people often talk to themselves, their pets, or even their plants. I like to think of language as an 'instinct'. This means that people know how to talk naturally, just like spiders know how to make webs. Spiders did not learn web-making from a special spider school; it is something they just know how to do.
**Climate and Weather**
Climate and weather, created by the air around us, have a big impact on where animals and plants live. Climate can change the look of a place. For example, warm and wet weather all year helps tropical jungles grow, which have many different species. On the other hand, cold and windy places have fewer living things. Weather patterns, which together make up the climate, happen because large amounts of air move and mix. The air is always moving because the earth spins, and the air does not move as fast as the earth. The sun is another important reason for air movement.
**Coffee**
As a bar-person, I had to serve drinks and make coffee, which worried me. In Lygon Street, Melbourne, a restaurant's success can depend on its coffee. I spent several days learning how to make coffee and how to clean the espresso machine. I also learned how to make a perfect cappuccino. By the end of the first week, I realized making good coffee was harder than it looked, and I thought I might be moved to cleaning ashtrays. Fortunately, my boss was patient. ""Making coffee is both an art and a science,"" he said, ""and you need time to learn how to do it well."""
CPE_41,C2,"**Art on TV**
Why does television often fail with programs about visual arts? Painting and sculpture should be easy for the camera to show. The camera can show a whole artwork and then zoom in to see details. But there are few TV series that show both the joy and complexity of looking at art. A good example of this problem is Robert Hughes's series, ""American Visions."" Hughes is a trustworthy critic with a strong personality. He had almost eight hours to introduce British viewers to American art, which British galleries often ignore. I thought the series would focus on great artworks. Instead, it was about how American history and culture are shown in its art and buildings.
**Dealing in Metals**
For 20 years, I worked as an international metals dealer and became known as a risk-taker. Metals are less regulated than other markets. With some luck, a willingness to take risks, and a good understanding of the market, you can make a lot of money. Risk-taking is a big part of the industry. This adventurous culture fits well with a free-market global economy. But now, free-trade economists who said the market would keep the price of scarce metals stable have found the opposite. More minerals are being extracted, and the cost of raw materials is going down. Considering inflation, the prices of most metals are about half of what they were 20 years ago. Recently, I was asked to investigate claims against a multinational company that benefits from these cheap raw materials.
**Extract from a Holiday Brochure**
Abaco and its small islands are part of the 700 islands of the Bahamas. They stretch from Florida past the Tropic of Cancer to Cuba. Each island has its own personality and offers something special. To get around the islands and cays of Abaco, you need a boat. If your room doesn't include one, don't worry. There are many ferries and water-taxis. Or, you can rent a boat if you want to go on your own. Sailing is the most popular way to travel here. Abaco is called 'The Sailing Capital of the World' for a good reason. The calm, protected waters are perfect for fishing, diving, snorkeling, and swimming. The cays and their beaches stretch for 200 miles like a string of pearls. It's not only at sea that you find treasures. At night, the lights of the restaurants and cafes of Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay sparkle."
CPE_69,C2,"'Build Your Own Bamboo Bike in the UK
The Bamboo Bike Club, run by engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan, offers a course where you can build your own custom bamboo bike frame. It's a fun weekend activity in Hackney Wick, east London. On a Saturday morning, the Bamboo Bike Club is busy with the sound of machinery. Bamboo bikes are becoming popular again, thanks to companies like Calfee Design in California and Bamboo Bikes in Yorkshire. However, these bikes can be expensive, with ready-made frames costing around $2,995 or £1,868.
James and Ian wanted to make bamboo bikes more affordable. They spent years working in a shed in Brecon, Wales, to create a business that offers bamboo bikes at a price that more cyclists can afford. They realized they wanted to share the joy of making a bike, not just sell frames. So, they started the Bamboo Bike Club, which is more like a community than a company. James works with wind turbines, and Ian is a civil engineer, but they run monthly courses where you can build your own bike frame.
On the first day of the course, you learn how to choose strong bamboo and make strong joints. You start by gluing the bamboo tubes together to form the bike's frame. Metal tubes are used for parts that need extra strength, like the handlebars and wheel forks. James and Ian help you with every step, making sure everything is done correctly. If you make a mistake, you can try again with a new piece of bamboo.
On Sunday, you wrap the joints with hemp and glue them with epoxy resin to make them strong. After adding a waterproof coating, the bike is ready for wheels, brakes, and other parts. The bamboo bike is strong and can last a long time. Ian has used his bike for over a year, and James has tested one off-road for three months without breaking it.
Bamboo bikes may look a bit rough compared to professional frames, but they are unique. They are great for a relaxed ride. James's bike is light and smooth, making it fun to ride. The best part is the price, which is less than £500.'"
CPE_38,C2,"**Self-help Books**
Dione Reverend was an editor at Random House in New York when she found a manuscript by an unknown psychologist, Dr. John Gray. She saw the title and knew it would be a bestseller. She was right. Dr. Gray is now very rich, and Dione Reverend has her own company. Dr. Gray's book on communication between men and women is very popular in the self-help industry. This industry is growing and claims to help people improve their lives. It also benefits from people's desires to get better and supports the publishing world in New York. In Britain, the self-help genre is also becoming popular, with many books being published. However, many self-help books are rejected for being too similar to others or too specific. Editors look for books that can sell well. They ask questions like, ""How promotable is the author?"" and ""Is the idea universal?"" Dione Reverend says that a catchy title is very important for a book's success.
**Autobiographies**
When someone writes an autobiography, there is an agreement between the writer and the reader that the truth is being told. However, this is not always the case. Writers might leave out things they find too embarrassing or unimportant. Sometimes, they might change the truth to make the story more interesting or to better show their true self. Some writers might even call their book an autobiography to make readers believe it is true, even if it is not. This can happen without any bad intentions.
**Dashiell Hammett's Detective Stories**
Detective stories became popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. They often show the conflicts in society. In these stories, a crime represents human desires like lust or greed. Solving the crime shows how society can return to normal. In Hammett's stories, society is shown as corrupt. The detective and the criminal understand each other. The detective is both a part of the law and a bit of a criminal. He is both a crook and a competitor. Sometimes, the detective feels connected to the criminal, and sometimes he is very eager to catch them because of this connection.
**Science Writing**
Stephen Jay Gould is a well-known science writer. He believes that to write well about science, you need to understand the culture of science. Only scientists can present science well because they know the community and its rules. Gould advises never to underestimate the reader. You can make the language simpler, but you should not change the main ideas. If readers feel they are being talked down to, they will lose interest."
CPE_17,C2,"**Air-conditioning**
At Cannons Gym, a popular place for City of London workers to visit during lunch, the air feels very cold. To handle this summer's very high temperatures, the gym has used a lot of air-conditioning. Sometimes, when it's quiet, the gym feels as cold as the Arctic. This is an example of how people often use too much air-conditioning. It has become a big part of work and leisure, showing how humans can control or change the climate. However, many buildings with air-conditioning could use other ways to stay cool. They could use natural light and air, and have thicker walls that keep out heat during the day and release it at night. These ideas might seem simple, but they can work well and reduce the need for air-conditioning.
**Sundials**
It is interesting that as we start a new millennium, people are again interested in sundials. Sundials are tools that tell time by the position of the sun. A hundred years ago, they were important for keeping time accurately. But as clocks and watches improved, sundials became just garden decorations. Now, people are taking them seriously again. David Harber, who makes sundials, thinks they are special because they connect us to the planets. He says there is a magical moment when a sundial starts working. They are calm, romantic objects that remind us of our place in the universe.
**Paint Your Own China**
I used to think china-painting was only for very skilled people. I once saw older women at an arts and crafts show painting teacups with perfect flowers. Their hands were steady, and the paint never smudged. I thought they must have been practicing for many years or had a special talent. So, I wondered who would join a china-painting class. Would beginners also be very talented? But the class was not scary at all. The students were there to have fun, and even the teacher did not want to paint flowers on teacups as quickly as I remembered."
CPE_47,C2,"'The Wrong Country Uncle chose a package holiday for them at a good price: a flight from Gatwick Airport, twelve nights in Venice, the fairyland city, at the Pensione Concordia. When Keith and Dawne went to the travel agency to book, the clerk explained that the other people in the package were a school group from the south coast, all learning Italian. But something went wrong. Either at the travel agency or at the check-in desk, or in a computer, a small mistake happened. Dawne and Keith ended up in a hotel called the Edelweiss, in Room 212, somewhere in Switzerland. At Gatwick, they gave their tickets to a girl in the yellow-and-red Your-Kind-of-Holiday uniform. She called them by name, checked their tickets, and said everything was fine. An hour later, they were surprised to hear elderly people on the plane talking in North of England accents. Keith thought there must have been a cancellation, or maybe the Italian class was on another plane. They ordered two drinks, and then two more. 'The coach will take us on,' a stout woman with glasses said when they landed. 'Stay together now.' There was no mention of an overnight stop in the brochure, but when the coach arrived at its destination, Keith thought that must be what it was. As they got off the coach, it was almost midnight: tired and dirty from travel, they didn't feel like questioning their right to the beds they were offered. But the next morning, when they realized they were being offered the beds for their whole holiday, they became worried. 'We have the lake, and the water birds,' the receptionist explained with a smile. 'And we can take the steamer to Interlaken.' 'A mistake has been made,' Keith told the man, trying to stay calm. He could hear his wife's nervous breathing next to him. 'We were supposed to be in Venice. At the Pensione Concordia.' 'I do not know the name, sir. This is Switzerland.' 'A coach is supposed to take us on. An official said so on the plane. She was here last night, that woman.' 'Your group is booked for twelve nights in the Edelweiss Hotel. To change now, sir, if you have changed your minds -' 'We haven't changed our minds. There's been a mistake.' The receptionist shook his head. He didn't know about a mistake. 'The man who made the booking,' Dawne said, 'was bald, with glasses and a moustache.' She gave the name of the travel agency in London. 'Some problem, have we?' a woman said, smiling at Keith. She was the stout woman he thought was an official. They'd seen her talking to the yellow-and-red girl at Gatwick. On the plane, she'd walked up and down the aisle, smiling at people. 'My name is Franks,' she said now. 'I'm married to the man with the bad leg.' 'Are you in charge, Mrs. Franks?' Dawne asked. 'Only we're in the wrong hotel.' Again she gave the name of the travel agency and described the bald-headed clerk, mentioning his glasses and moustache. Keith interrupted her. 'It seems we got into the wrong group. We reported to the Your-Kind-of-Holiday girl and left it all to her.' 'We should have known when they weren't from Dover,' Dawne added. 'We heard them talking about Darlington.' Keith made an impatient sound. He wished she'd let him do the talking. 'We noticed you at Gatwick,' Keith said. 'We knew you were in charge.' 'And I noticed you. I counted you, although I guess you didn't see me doing that. Now, let me explain. There are many places Your-Kind-of-Holiday sends its clients, many different holidays at different prices. There are, for example, villa holidays for adventurous people under thirty-five. There are treks to Turkey, and treks for singles to the Himalayas.' 'Now, what I am trying to say is that all tickets and labels are similar, the yellow with the two red bands.' Mrs. Franks suddenly laughed. 'So if you just followed other people with the yellow-and-red label, you might think you could end up in a wildlife park! But of course,' she added kindly, 'that couldn't happen in a million years.' 'We're not meant to be in Switzerland,' Keith insisted. 'Well, let's just see, shall we?' Unexpectedly, Mrs. Franks turned and went away, leaving them standing. The receptionist was no longer behind the desk. The sound of typing could be heard. 'She seems quite kind,' Dawne whispered, 'that woman.' Keith wasn't listening. He tried to remember everything that had happened: giving the girl the tickets, sitting down to wait, then the girl leading them to the plane, and then the pilot's voice welcoming them, and the air hostess with the smooth black hair checking everyone's seat belt. 'Nice to have some young people along,' an elderly man's voice interrupted Keith's thoughts. 'Nottage is the name.' The old man's wife was with him, both looking like they were in their eighties. They'd slept like logs, she said, best night's sleep they'd had for years, which of course was due to the lakeside air. 'That's nice,' Dawne said. Keith walked out of the reception area and Dawne followed him. In front of the hotel, they didn't say to each other that there was an irony in what had happened. On their first holiday since their honeymoon, they ended up in a package tour of elderly people when the whole point of the holiday was to escape the needs and demands of the elderly. In his bossy way, Uncle had said so himself when they'd tried to persuade him to come with them.'"

Many people in Britain know who Sir Ernest Shackleton was and have a general idea of what he did. In America, however, he is only now becoming well-known. The Wall Street Journal called Shackleton 'an Antarctic explorer whose achievements went unnoticed for most of the 20th century,' which might be an exaggeration. But now Americans are very interested in him. Biographies and stories about the voyage of the Endurance are being made and are expected to sell quickly. The American Museum of Natural History is planning a big exhibition, and Columbia Tristar is making a film about Shackleton's life. Some American managers see Shackleton as a role model. They admire his actions and learn lessons in leadership and communication from him. They even talk about 'speaking Shackleton.' Shackleton, with his reindeer sleeping bag and blubber-stove, has become a model for modern management consultants. Jim MacGregor, a managing partner in New York, chose Shackleton as a role model years ago. His company deals with communication during mergers, acquisitions, and corporate crises. For example, when a company's plant explodes or when half the workforce has to be let go. Shackleton once worked in public relations for a Glasgow steel company, but it might be hard to see how surviving on albatross meat in freezing temperatures relates to handling a business crisis. 'Even if a company manages its crises well, it can still cause problems by communicating poorly,' says MacGregor. 'Shackleton is a model for management because of his leadership and communication skills. He had his values in order. He was at his best when he and his team had a lot to lose, like their lives. One of Shackleton's most interesting decisions was to turn back when he was only 97 miles from the South Pole. This decision showed his credibility for the next expedition: the lives of his men were most important.' This refers to Shackleton's 1908 expedition to the South Pole when, 97 miles short of their goal, with supplies running low and limited time to return to their ship, Shackleton made the brave decision to turn back. In a crisis, says MacGregor, people want to know someone is in charge. While managers today might avoid responsibility, Shackleton was ready to take it. His 1914 expedition became legendary. His ship, the Endurance, was trapped in ice for nine months and was finally crushed. When it sank, Shackleton told his men, 'we should all eventually reach safety if you continue to do your best and trust me.' From the diaries and accounts kept by his men, it is clear that Shackleton was always in charge. 'Shackleton thought everything through, planned for every situation, kept his men informed, and asked for their opinions,' says MacGregor. 'He was adaptable, willing to let go when something was lost and start anew. We've built a set of principles here that Shackleton illustrates. Clients can relate to his story without feeling criticized.' Shackleton believed that an explorer needs optimism, physical endurance, and patience. 'One of the hardest things to do in desperate situations is to do nothing, especially in America, where people want quick solutions,' says MacGregor. 'If you buy bonds and guess wrong on the interest rates, you hang in there and eventually you'll get your money back. To ""fix it"" and sell would mean a big loss. Also, don't be afraid to change your plans if they're not working. If a new product is bad, don't keep selling it.' Shackleton led by example. On the way back from the Endurance, he saw Hurley, the expedition photographer, without gloves. He gave Hurley his own gloves, saying if he didn't wear them, he would throw them overboard. Someone else remembered him doing the same with a biscuit when they were starving on the 1905 expedition: 'He said he'd leave it in the snow. Millions of pounds couldn't have bought that biscuit.' As Caroline Alexander, author of Endurance, says: 'The public's interest in heroic efforts is growing. Shackleton shows that there is nothing heroic happening now. Everything else fades away, and he stands as the true example of the ideals we miss today.'"
CAE_15,C1,"'Finding Food in Madagascar's Forests In the forests of Madagascar, there is a primate called the aye-aye that lives like a woodpecker. Both the woodpecker and the aye-aye search for insect larvae by making holes in wood. The woodpecker uses its beak to make holes and its long tongue to get the insects. The aye-aye uses its sharp teeth to gnaw into the wood and its long, thin third finger to reach and scoop out the insects. Although scientists described the aye-aye's feeding habits over a hundred years ago, they have only recently learned how it finds insects inside the wood. Dr. Carl Erickson from Duke University studied the hunting skills of two male aye-ayes, Nosferatu and Poe, a female, Samantha, and her baby, Annabelle. He wanted to see if they found insects by looking for signs on the wood, like holes where insects might have entered. Dr. Erickson gave the aye-ayes logs with several small holes. Some holes led to spaces with mealworms, while others were empty. The aye-ayes went directly to the holes with food, showing they did not need to see the holes to find the insects. Dr. Erickson tested if the aye-ayes used smell or sound to find the insects. Even when the smell was blocked, and the insects were dead and silent, the aye-ayes still found them. So, how did they do it? Dr. Erickson found that the aye-ayes could sense empty spaces in the wood. When looking for food, an aye-aye taps the wood with its middle finger and listens with its large ears. Dr. Erickson thinks the aye-aye uses echo-location, like a bat, to find hollow spaces. It might also hear insects moving when disturbed by the tapping. The idea that the aye-aye takes the place of woodpeckers in Madagascar is interesting. However, there are birds like the Sickle-billed and Nuthatch Vangas that also look for insects in wood, so the woodpecker's role might not be empty. The aye-aye is like a woodpecker and an echo-locating bat combined. It also acts like a squirrel because its teeth grow continuously, and it has been seen in the wild gnawing through nut shells and using its long finger to get the nut meat.'"
CAE_19,C1,"'Ordinary People, Ordinary Lives Most of us have photos of our grandparents, but how many of us know what their lives were like when they were young? Diaries give us small, incomplete glimpses, and family stories are often only half remembered. What will our grandchildren know about us? We often plan to write things down but never do it. We might leave videos instead of photos, but they are still two-dimensional. Hannah Renier has a solution: she writes autobiographies for other people, creating a hardback book of at least 20,000 words, with pictures if wanted. These books are not about famous people, but about ordinary ones. The idea came to her when she talked to her family and realized how much of the past was disappearing. ""When I started, I didn't take it as seriously as I do now,"" she says. ""People say they do it for their children or for the future, but they also enjoy it themselves."" The promise of privacy helps people be honest. ""I had the confidence to be honest,"" says a 62-year-old man who made and lost a fortune before making another. ""I was surprised at what came out. There were painful things, like my divorce."" ""I did it for my family, so they could learn something, but I haven't let my children read it yet. They were hurt by things in my life, and there are details I don't want them to know now. If they insist, I'll let them. But I'd rather they read it after I'm gone."" He also saw patterns from his childhood that led to repeated mistakes. Ms. Renier has noticed this in others too. ""It's amazing how many people are influenced by their parents,"" she says. ""Things parents said or did affect them for the rest of their lives. They marry people their parents would like, or do the opposite to rebel."" ""Many disappointments come out. Even sixty years later, people regret or resent things that were never resolved with their parents. There is no age of reason. If people had problems in their youth, they still have them in middle age. They try to impress a parent who wasn't impressed, and if that fails, some want to say 'I can't stand my mother.'"" Ms. Renier is more of a recorder than an investigator. ""It's not for the public, and I'm not there to be nosy. People sometimes tell me things and then say, 'I'm not sure if that should go in.' I include it anyway—they can remove it when they see the draft. But generally, people want to be honest, with all their flaws."" ""It's not vanity publishing. It's not people saying 'I've had such an interesting life, the world needs to know.' Things are changing faster than ever, and we are losing sight of the past. It's a way to connect with our ancestors because families don't sit together as much anymore. People want a little immortality."" Each book involves up to 30 hours of recorded interviews, which Ms. Renier uses to write the life story, rearranging the timeline and interpreting. Modern technology allows her to produce everything except the binding with its gold lettering: you can choose your own color and title. Fascinating to the private audience for whom each book is made, the results are not about revealing secrets at any cost. Ms. Renier organizes her material logically and writes well, so the final content is as good as its subject. The book looks high-quality and costs nearly £3,000, with extra copies at £25 each. She gets about 10 inquiries a week, but the cost, due to the time involved, stops many people. ""I thought it would be a more affordable product,"" she says. ""But the people I've worked with have all been well-off, readers of Harpers & Queen, where I advertise. They're the kind of people who would have had their portraits painted for their descendants.""'"

The Museum of Classical Archaeology has one of the few collections of Greek and Roman sculpture casts in the world, with over six hundred pieces. Remember, nothing here is original. All sculptures are accurate copies made from the originals, mostly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Museum is in a special gallery with great natural light. Plaster casts have many benefits: sculptures that were originally together but are now in different museums across Europe can be seen together as they were meant to be. You can see almost all the famous Greek and Roman sculptures in one afternoon.

We also help young photographers (aged 12 to 16) improve their skills with our Young Members scheme, led by our resident photographer. We sell photographic books, magazines, and materials.
**C. Sedgwick Museum of Geology**
The Sedgwick Museum has a great collection of fossil animals and plants, rocks, and minerals from all over the world and from all geological ages. It also has Britain's oldest complete geological collection, that of Dr. John Woodward (1665-1728), with nearly 10,000 rare specimens in their original 18th-century cabinets. Adam Sedgwick, a Professor of Geology, added a lot to the collections, creating an outstanding museum. The collection is organized by geological age, showing major changes in life on Earth over time. The new Whewell Gallery displays beautiful minerals and gems, with labels explaining their nature and modern use.
**D. The Cambridge University Collection of Air Photographs**
There are over 400,000 air photographs in the collection, taken by university staff over the past 45 years. The University has its own aircraft at Cambridge Airport and takes photos throughout Great Britain. The photos are interesting as they show the landscape and human activity from prehistoric times to today. There is a small display in the entrance hall, and the library staff can help with questions. The photos cannot be borrowed, but copies can be bought and usually take about a month to make.
**E. Cambridge Medieval Brass Rubbing Centre**
The Cambridge Brass Rubbing Centre is the second oldest and longest-running center of its kind in the world and is a unique tourist attraction. You can enjoy making wall hangings by rubbing one of over a hundred different brass plates from the tombs of medieval knights and ladies. By making resin copies, called facsimiles, the center preserves the originals while allowing people to enjoy brass rubbing. Brass plates, used as memorials instead of statues, spread from Germany across medieval Europe and Scandinavia. Many were destroyed in revolutions, but most of the remaining brasses are in Britain, and the Cambridge Centre has a wide range of examples."
CAE_13,C1,"**From Here to Fatherhood**
**A. The Theatre Director**
I have had 35 years of being around small children because of my unusual personal life. I have loved every minute of it. This morning, I fed the baby, and for me, that is what being a father is all about. I am very lucky with my children. We all love opera, theatre, books, and music. This creates a strong bond, especially now that they are mostly grown up, and I am more of a friend than a father. I don't believe in physical violence. I have slapped my children in anger, but I don't support it. I may not have been a very attentive father, but I have always tried to be available. I am here if they need me, but I let them call me. If you start chasing them to ask why they haven't been in touch, you make them feel guilty. My parents did that to me, and I would never do it to my children.
**B. The Advertising Executive**
I was young when my children were born, only about 25, and I found the responsibilities difficult. It made me feel older quickly, but it also kept me young, which I value. As they became teenagers, they introduced me to music, youth culture, and clothes. This has been very helpful for running the agency. I have never felt out of touch. When they were young, I was busy with my business, so I missed some things like their first concerts and sports days. I feel sad about that, but now I can take them on holidays to the south of France. They get along well with our friends and come to parties and advertising awards with us without feeling shy. I think it helps that I do something they find glamorous and interesting.
**C. The Politician**
My first child was born just as I was about to be elected to the Greater London Council, and the others came soon after. My wife and I promised to make time for them, but as I became more politically active, time became a problem. I only accept weekend meetings and public events if there are facilities for the kids to come with me. This way, they know what I do when I am not with them, and there is no feeling of Daddy disappearing. I have noticed more MPs bringing their kids to the House. Maybe we are all realizing the need to involve our children in our lives.
**D. The Writer**
My first marriage ended when Kate and Bonnie were young, so I had to think a lot about being a father. I made big efforts to stay in touch with them. My ex-wife and I even tried living next door to each other so the kids could come and go as they wanted, but I think they found that confusing. Kate has said in interviews that I was always there for her, but I am not sure I was a very good father. I was around a lot, but like many parents in the Seventies, I treated the kids as adults too soon. Kate recently said we were too liberal. I think I could have been more organized. I regret that now. I still worry about my older daughters as much as my youngest. In that way, your kids never leave you.
**E. The TV Presenter**
I was ready for kids. I was 30, met my wife, and we had a lovely house. We thought, ""Why keep spending money on new sofas when we could have a child instead?"" Having my daughter Betty has made me understand who I am. You feel special when you have a child, and you are, but you also become just one more parent in a long line of parents. It's a great equalizer. Sometimes I feel annoyed, but one look at her makes it go away. A baby's smile is the best way to make a grown man melt."

CAE_46,C1,"**Science Defying Gravity**
Journalist Tom Mumford joins students testing their ideas in weightlessness. From the outside, it looked like a regular airplane. The pilot told the young passengers it was a Boeing KC-135 refueling tanker, built in 1964, similar to a Boeing 707 passenger plane. But inside, it was different. The 13 students from Europe and America were about to have an unforgettable flight. The inside was a long white tunnel with few windows, lit by lights along the padded walls. Most seats were removed, except for a few at the back where the nervous students sat. For a year, they competed with other students to join this flight, offered by the European Space Agency. They had to suggest creative experiments to do in weightless conditions. The best ideas won a place on this special flight, which was like an extraordinary roller-coaster ride.
For the next two hours, the Boeing would fly like a giant bird, going up and down. The goal was to create a weightless state at the top of each curve. At 3,000 meters, the pilot cut the engines, and the plane went higher on its own before gravity pulled it down again. In those few seconds between going up and falling, everything inside became weightless, and the students felt closer to the moon than the Earth.
The plane took off smoothly, but soon the pilot made it climb at a 45-degree angle for about 20 seconds. The engines roared, blood rushed from our heads, and bodies floated in the cabin. Then the engines stopped, and we were weightless almost immediately. For 20 seconds, we floated in silence: the floor felt like a trampoline, and one step sent us towards the ceiling. We floated aimlessly; directions like left or right, up or down, no longer made sense. Only gravity helps us understand where we are.
After ten seconds of freefall, the pilot pulled the plane out of its dive. Gravity returned suddenly, and some students landed with a bump. After the first curve, some students felt sick thinking about the 29 more to come. Thirty curves gave ten minutes of 'space time' for experiments. The Dutch students studied their robotic cat, Leonardo, to see how cats always land on their feet. They used a device to turn it belly-down with radio controls. During the next curve, another student accidentally landed on it.
Nearby, a German team from the University of Aachen studied how metal joins are affected by no gravity, thinking about future space stations. Another team from Utah State University looked at making solar sails from thin liquid films in sunlight. They tried to make these films in microgravity, hoping satellites could use solar sails like yachts use wind.
After two hours of flying up and down, breakfast felt unstable, but the main feeling was excitement, not sickness. This feeling would last a long time. ""It was an unforgettable experience,"" said one student. ""I wanted to become an astronaut before, but now I want to even more."""
CAE_3,C1,"**With the Trees, I Planted My Stake in New Zealand**
Jonathon Porritt is the author of ""Seeing Green - The Politics of Ecology."" He talks about a unique time in his life when he didn't experience any summers. He traveled to New Zealand every summer in the UK, which is winter in New Zealand, and spent nine winters in a row there. He enjoyed this because he likes winter.
His parents had an idea to buy a small piece of land in New Zealand for him and his siblings to take care of. His mother said, ""If you plant trees on it, you can have it."" This way, they would always have a connection to New Zealand, where their father grew up. They found a plot of land about 20 miles north of Auckland in a place called Rangitoupuni. The land wasn't very good, but it was suitable for planting trees.
Jonathon was excited about the idea because he loved working with land. He had spent a year in Australia working on farms, so planting trees sounded great to him. He started planting in 1968, and by 1972, he and his siblings had planted trees on the entire 70 acres.
The winter of 1968 in New Zealand was very rainy, but Jonathon remembers it as a happy time. Every morning, he faced the challenge of getting ready to plant trees in the rain. He worked with an experienced tree-planter, which helped him learn. They used a planting bag to carry the trees and had to make sure the lines were straight when planting.
Jonathon enjoyed the hard physical work, and it made him fit. Planting became automatic, and he developed a rhythm. This allowed him to think deeply about life and nature, which influenced his future work.
He has returned to New Zealand four times to see the trees grow, which has been satisfying. He worries about natural disasters affecting the trees but is happy they are now 20 years old and healthy.
In 1984, Jonathon took time off from teaching to return to New Zealand alone for three months. He wrote his first book, ""Seeing Green,"" in a small cabin on the tree farm. He feels a strong connection to the land and believes it is a powerful bond between people and the earth."
CAE_10,C1,"**BRINGING UP BADGERS**
""What now?"" I thought when a helper handed me a cardboard box. My husband Derek and I turned our dairy farm in Somerset into an ""open farm"" six years ago, and we are known for caring for orphaned animals. The noise from the box was strange, like a mix between a cackle and a bark. I looked inside and saw three small grey badger cubs, each about eight inches long. Their fur was soft like velvet, and they had milky-colored eyes on their black-and-white striped heads. I had never seen badger cubs before. Most are born between mid-January and mid-March and live underground. If orphaned, they usually die of starvation. These three were found by builders who accidentally dug into their home. The mother was found dead with her babies still feeding from her. The cubs were healthy but cold and whimpering. After removing their fleas, I took them into the kitchen and placed them by the stove for warmth. There were two females, Primrose and Bluebell, and a male, Willow. At first, I fed them with a syringe, but I had to wipe them with a warm cloth to mimic their mother licking them. This helped them go to the bathroom. For the first few days, they were fed every four hours. Within a week, they were drinking from a bottle and moving around, though unsteadily. They seemed happy with each other and a heated pad as a substitute ""mum.""
Three weeks later, I noticed Willow was lethargic, though he was eating normally. I should have acted immediately, but I didn't realize the importance. The next morning, I found him dead. The vet's post-mortem showed Willow died from a lung infection. When bottle-feeding, it's important not to let the animal drink too fast, as liquid can enter the lungs. In Willow's case, this caused an infection that was hard to treat, even with antibiotics. I was sad about losing Willow but continued caring for the others. Six days later, a local farmer brought me another male cub, abandoned by its mother. The area had been disturbed too much, and the cub was cold and hungry. We named him Willow II. He was about two weeks younger than the females and difficult to feed. I had to move the bottle's teat around in his mouth to get him to drink. After 10 minutes, he would finally latch on. By the end of April, the females were eating creamed rice and then anything. Willow II was different. He struggled to eat without making a mess. Eventually, I gave him a sausage, which he slowly ate. After a week of sausages, he was ready for other foods.
At nearly five months old, they were eating cereals for breakfast, a meat and vegetable meal for lunch, and fruit, nuts, cheese, hard-boiled eggs, and sunflower seeds in the evening. Badgers usually eat earthworms, beetles, bugs, baby rabbits, mice, voles, and plant shoots or roots. My badgers were better off than others that year because the summer was very hot, making it hard to find earthworms. By August, the cubs became nocturnal and went for walks at dusk or night. We often walked through the cider orchard, where they played and chased each other. As ""human badgers,"" we joined in the fun. I learned to avoid their playful nips, but Derek didn't and often got bruised. During these walks, I saw other badgers in our field. They were likely expanding their territory to find food, as badgers are territorial and can kill intruders. We were warned they might enter our badger pen and harm the cubs, so we secured the gate with sheet metal.
The local press took pictures of me walking the badgers, and the response was so positive that we started a project to build a sett on the farm for them. With advice, we designed a new home for the badgers. Our son Daniel drew the plans, and we built a sett with tunnels, an enclosure, and a badger gate facing their usual path. It had three chambers, one larger than the others, with a glass side for viewing. As the sett took shape, the badgers explored it before their walks. Eventually, they preferred the sett over walks. The building cost more than expected, but a local bus company, Badgerline, sponsored part of it, and local firms donated materials. Everyone wanted the badgers to have a home. One evening, they finally moved in. After watching them for a while, we left them to settle. Later, I checked on them and saw three badgers asleep in their chambers.
These days, I don't walk with them as often, especially since they wake up at midnight. We see Primrose occasionally, as she joined a neighboring sett, but Bluebell and Willow II still greet us before running off into the night. This is their territory now, a place they know well and a home they have accepted."
CAE_67,C1,"**In Search of True North - and the Man Behind Halley's Comet**
Dr. Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, wants to follow the journey of Sir Edmund Halley, who studied compass variations. Anjana Ahuja reports.
Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) is famous for the comet named after him. However, one of his important achievements was studying 'compass variations' during his sea voyages on the ship Paramore. These variations, now called 'declination', are the angle between magnetic north and true north. Without knowing this, sailors couldn't correct their compasses, making it hard to navigate the oceans accurately.
Halley was one of the few people paid to do scientific research at that time. He sailed to the Cape Verde Islands to study declination in the North and South Atlantic. The first trip was stopped due to problems with the crew, but Halley tried again. This time, he traveled to Rio de Janeiro, South Georgia, Newfoundland, and back to England. In 1701, he published a chart showing compass variations in the Western and Southern Oceans. This chart was very useful to sailors for over a century until changes in the Earth's magnetic field made it outdated.
Dr. Clark, who loves sailing, plans to celebrate the 300th anniversary of Halley's trip by following the same route. He needs to raise £70,000 for the journey, and Sir Vivian Fuchs, known for leading the first cross-Antarctica expedition, is supporting him. Dr. Clark became interested in Halley while working at Halley Station in Antarctica, where he read about the scientist's life. Halley was not only an astronomer but also did research in geophysics and helped Sir Isaac Newton with his famous work, Principia Mathematica.
Dr. Clark's expedition, called 'In the Wake of the Paramore', will have scientific value. He will take the same measurements Halley did, but with better instruments. These measurements are important because the Earth's magnetic field is always changing. The data will help improve the international geomagnetic reference field, a model of Earth's magnetic field. Dr. Clark will use global positioning satellites to find true north, which is necessary for measuring the magnetic field's direction.
The British Geological Survey and the United States Navy will provide instruments for the expedition. A Danish satellite will also be taking similar measurements, and Dr. Clark hopes his data will fill any gaps in the satellite's coverage of the Atlantic Ocean. Ground-based measurements are also useful for comparison.
Halley's journey was the first scientific expedition at sea, and he was the first civilian made a naval captain for this purpose. Dr. Clark has the experience needed for this journey. He spent two years in Antarctica, worked with the geomagnetic group at the British Geological Survey, and sailed from Rio de Janeiro to England. He plans to complete the expedition in four stages with different crews.
Dr. Clark is committed to this project, saying, 'I am prepared to give up my life for eight months to do this.' He feels a strong purpose from Halley's life and work."
CAE_27,C1,"**POWER DRESSING**
Every summer, the peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire show off their beautiful tails to the female peahens. This behavior puzzled Charles Darwin because, in a world where survival is tough, it seemed strange that birds would evolve such extravagant tails. Darwin believed that animals evolved through natural selection, meaning the strongest and smartest survive. However, the peacock's tail seemed to be a disadvantage, so Darwin suggested another idea called 'sexual selection'. He thought females chose mates based on beauty.
Darwin's friend, Alfred Russel Wallace, disagreed. He believed that if peahens chose the most beautiful males, there must be a good reason. The males might have some hidden quality that helps them survive. Today, scientists like Marion Petrie from the Open University are studying the peacocks at Whipsnade to find answers. They want to know if peahens really prefer males with the showiest tails and if these males have other advantages.
Observations show that peahens do prefer males with more eye-spots on their tails. However, it's still unclear if these males are better in other ways. Some scientists, like William Hamilton from Oxford University, think that showy males might be healthier and have fewer parasites. But this hasn't been proven in the Whipsnade peacocks yet.
This year, Dr. Petrie is comparing the offspring of attractive and less attractive males to see if the former grow faster or are healthier. If they are, it would support Wallace's idea that female choice is practical.
There's another theory by R A Fisher called 'Fisher's Runaway'. It suggests that if females start preferring males with slightly better tails, over generations, this preference and the trait will grow stronger. This could explain the peacock's tail and support Darwin's idea of 'beauty for beauty's sake'."
CAE_66,C1,"'THE BOAT OF MY DREAMS The best boat design should mix old and new, says Tom Cunliffe. He did this with his own boat, 'The Westerman'. This week, the Summer Boat Show in London is full of beautiful yachts with new technology. Most of them come from a big change in boat design 25 years ago. My boat, however, is on a quiet creek on the south coast. It was designed last year, but it looks like it is 100 years old. You might think I am a romantic person. Maybe I am, but I don't think so. This boat uses old boat design ideas, but modern technology made it easier to build. However, modern technology often makes sailing too easy and takes away the real experience of being at sea. I don't think sailors should suffer, but I like my boats to have a coal stove for warmth and comfortable beds. Why go sailing if everything is automatic? Sometimes, dealing with the sails is part of the adventure. Also, why move the steering from the back to the middle of the boat? This change makes more room inside, but I believe a boat should feel like a boat, not a house. When I bought my old boat, Hirta, the previous owner said it had comfort but no luxury. Hirta taught me he was right. It had heavy sails, no pumped water, no electricity, no fridge, no central heating, no winches, and no electronics, especially for navigation. Yet, it was the nicest boat I have ever sailed. But old boats need a lot of care. After a back injury, I knew I had to sell Hirta. I couldn't find a good new boat, so I decided to build one. The Westerman has never let me down. Nigel Irens, the designer, and Ed Burnett, his assistant, used computers to design it, but Irens first drew it on a napkin. Then he made a model, like in the old days. We looked at the model and then used the computer to make changes. The final design was perfect. The Westerman has crossed the North Atlantic and won four out of six races. She looks timeless, sails smoothly, and her inside, made from old pine wood, feels peaceful. This is because she was designed as a sailing boat first, not as a place to live. This old method works well. She shows that you don't need to follow new trends to be happy and that history can teach us valuable lessons. Made from wood treated with a special glue, she is completely waterproof. So, she has all the benefits of a modern boat but looks and feels like a traditional one.'"
CAE_44,C1,"**RETREAT, RELAX, RECHARGE**
Health farms and country house hotels with spa facilities are very popular. We asked five journalists to visit some of these places.
**A. HENLOW GRANGE**
I was happy to visit Henlow Grange for six days because I was tired and needed to relax. My room in the big 18th-century house was very comfortable, and I felt calm right away. On the first day, I did nothing and slept a lot. From the second day, I joined many classes like yoga and body conditioning. The instructors are very good, and I felt more flexible as the week went on. They offer many treatments, like aromatherapy, seaweed baths, and facials. The staff are friendly and professional. Henlow is planning to add a new swimming pool and a Light Diet Room. You can also ride bicycles around the grounds or walk in the garden. During my stay, I felt happier and more energetic. I left feeling great and full of energy. This is a perfect break for a stressed working woman. Save Room 5 for me! - Marcella D'Argy Smith
**B. SHRUBLAND HALL**
The calm atmosphere of this stately home was clear from the moment I arrived. The Hall has a beautiful library and a conservatory. When you arrive, you get a medical check-up, including weight and blood pressure. We were called patients, which was strange because I am healthy. But they found a shoulder problem during the check-up, and the fitness instructor helped me with it. Each person gets a special diet. I lost weight without fasting, but I had a headache on the second day. My meals included grapefruit for breakfast, salads for lunch, and fruit with yoghurt for dinner. If you are not on a diet, you eat in the main dining hall, where the food is tasty. You get a massage or water therapy every other day. Extra treatments are well-priced. - Liz Gregory
**C. CAREYS MANOR**
Careys is not a health farm but a lovely old manor with log fires and a big lounge. If you are watching your weight, you might skip the gourmet food. The French chef makes rich sauces and desserts. Luckily, there is a gym and pool to work off the calories. There is also a spa bath, steam room, and treatment rooms. A big attraction is the sports injury clinic. I got advice on an old shoulder injury. The physiotherapist suggested good posture and exercises. Careys is comfortable and luxurious. If you want to explore, there is beautiful countryside around. - Beverly D'Silva
**D. CLIVEDEN**
Cliveden is a grand country home and a five-star hotel. It offers health and beauty treatments, a gym, saunas, a swimming pool, tennis, and horse riding. There are beautiful walks and gardens on the 376-acre estate. Waldo's restaurant has amazing food. The dinner menu is long, and the meal was wonderful, especially the sticky-toffee pudding. I went to bed happy! The next morning, I spent time in the gym before my next meal. I enjoyed a facial and an aromatherapy massage. Cliveden has many fitness and beauty options if you want to use them before enjoying a meal at Waldo's. - Kay Letch
**E. SPRINGS HYDRO**
The best and worst thing about Springs Hydro is the carrot cake. It's delicious but has 360 calories, which is not good if you want to lose weight. The aromatherapy massage is also great. I chose relaxing oils and fell asleep twice during the massage. The place is modern and well-run, with many therapists and beauty rooms. They offer many treatments, like manicures and facials. The guests are a mix of people, from football teams to friends and singles. I would love to visit here once a month. - Eve Cameron"
CAE_22,C1,"**NATURAL TALENTS**
In the seven million years since humans separated from chimpanzees, we haven't changed much genetically. We are still more than 98% the same as chimps. This means that what makes us different from animals is a recent development. Our ability to make art and do other things we consider uniquely human must come from a small part of our genes. This is a big responsibility for just a few genes. 
Studies of animal behavior show that many things we thought were unique to humans are not. For example, both humans and wild chimpanzees use tools. Chimpanzees use sticks as tools, and sea otters use rocks to open clams. Monkeys have simple language with different sounds for 'leopard', 'eagle', and 'snake'. These findings show that there are few absolute differences between us and animals, except for art.
If human art comes from a unique genetic gift, it's interesting that our ancestors didn't make art for most of the 7 million years since they split from chimps. The earliest art might have been wood carvings or body painting, but these don't last over time. Clear evidence of human art, like cave paintings and statues, only appears around 35,000 years ago with the Cro-Magnons.
Some people say human art is different because it is non-utilitarian (not useful for survival), made for aesthetic pleasure, and learned rather than instinctive. Let's look at these ideas. First, as Oscar Wilde said, ""All art is quite useless."" Human art doesn't help us survive or pass on genes, unlike most animal behaviors. For example, birdsong helps birds defend territory or attract mates, which helps pass on genes. By this measure, human art is different.
The second idea is that only humans make art for aesthetic pleasure. We can't ask birds if they enjoy their songs, but they mostly sing during breeding season, so they probably don't sing just for pleasure. Again, human art seems unique.
The third idea is that human art is learned, not instinctive. Different human groups have different art styles that are learned, not inherited. For example, songs in Tokyo and Paris are different, but people can learn each other's songs. Some birds, however, are born knowing their species' song. It's like a French baby raised in Japan suddenly singing the French national anthem without learning it.
Human art changes quickly. Geese honked 2,000 years ago just like they do today, but human art styles change fast. Even a casual museum visitor can tell a 20th-century painting from the Mona Lisa. Experts can often identify when and who painted a work. However, they might mistake paintings by two chimpanzees, Congo and Betsy, for human art. Congo made up to 33 paintings in one day and got upset when his pencil was taken away. In 1957, their paintings were shown in London, and many were sold, which some human artists can't claim.
These chimpanzee paintings blur the line between human art and animal activities. Like human art, they weren't made for practical reasons but for the painter's satisfaction. You might say human art is different because it's meant to communicate, but some famous human art was also made for personal satisfaction."
CAE_39,C1,"**A Big Adventure**
The Taklamakan Desert in western China is one of the last places on earth that people have not explored much. It is also very dangerous. Charles Blackmore crossed it and survived to tell his story. There are not many big adventures left and not many heroes. Children's stories used to be about brave explorers with sunburnt skin and eyes looking far into the distance on their journeys into the unknown. These days, you don't find such people in stories or in real life. Or so I thought until I met Charles Blackmore.
Blackmore's big adventure was leading a team across the Taklamakan Desert in western China. Its name means 'once entered you never come out', but local people call it the Desert of Death. He remembered the dangers and excitement of that amazing journey while sitting calmly at home with his family. The team he led included four Britons (one was the medical officer), an American photographer, four Chinese experts on the area, 30 camels, and six camel handlers. It turned out that the camel handlers had never worked with camels before; they were long-distance truck drivers. This mistake could have been very dangerous and could have ruined the expedition.
This group set out to cross 1,200 kilometers of the world's least friendly desert, and Charles Blackmore wrote an interesting book about their journey. At the time, he was about to leave the Army after 14 happy years. He started the expedition for fun, to fill a gap in his life, and to prove something. 'I always thought I'd spend my whole life in the Army. I was offered a promotion, but suddenly I wanted to see who Charles Blackmore really was, outside all that. It was a big risk. Tina, my wife, was very worried that I wouldn't come back because nobody had ever done that route; we went into it without knowing what to expect. In the end, it took 59 days to cross from west to east, and the desert was very kind to us.'
Anyone reading his amazing story of that crossing will wonder why he used the word 'kind'. The team suffered a lot: dysentery, extreme temperatures, severe thirst and dehydration, and the loss of some of their precious water supply. 'But', Blackmore explains, 'when we were at the limits of our endurance and the camels had gone without water for seven days, we managed to find some. We didn't experience the Taklamakan's famous sandstorms. And we never faced the raw, biting desert cold that would have stopped us completely. That's not to say that we weren't fighting against problems the whole time. The fine sand got into everything, especially blisters and wounds. The high dunes were very hard to climb, for us and for the heavily loaded camels, which often rolled over onto us.'
'What drove me on more than anything else was the need to survive. We had no backup plan. Neither our budget nor time allowed one. No aircraft ever flew over us. Once we got into the sandhills, we were completely on our own. I knew I had the mental strength for the trip, but I was very scared of my physical ability to do it. I remember day one -- we sat at the edge of the desert, and it was so hot that you couldn't breathe. I thought, ""We've got to do it now!"" At that moment, I was a very scared man.'
If it was like that at the beginning, how did they feel towards the end? 'When you've walked for 1,000 kilometers, you're not going to give up. You've endured so much; you've got so much behind you. We were very thin, but very muscular and strong despite our physical exhaustion. My body was well-toned, and my legs were like pistons. I could walk over anything.'
In the middle of the book, Blackmore describes lying in the desert, looking up at a full moon, and thinking of his family. How aware was he of the difficulty it must have been for them? 'Inside me, there's someone trying to find peace with himself. When I have doubts about myself now, I go back to the image of the desert and think, well, we managed to pull that together. As a personal achievement, I feel prouder of that expedition than of anything else I've done. Yet in terms of a lifetime's achievement, I think of my family and the happiness we share -- against that measure, the desert does not compare.'
Has Charles Blackmore found peace? 'I yearn for the challenge -- for the open spaces -- the resolve of it all. We were lifted by the sense of purpose. I find it difficult now to be part of the sameness of modern life.'"
CAE_18,C1,"Susan Harr felt overwhelmed by technology, so she decided to unplug her gadgets and enjoy doing things by hand. Many people love technology because it gives us gadgets that make life easier and save time. However, Susan realized that technology can be expensive and not always worth the trouble. She started to let her household gadgets go as they stopped working. This made her question what ""extra time"" technology really gives us. Is it just time to buy more gadgets? Susan thinks we are being tricked by marketing experts.
When her word processor broke and made strange noises, she left it in the backyard. Now, she enjoys sewing by hand instead of using a noisy machine. She finds it relaxing and can take her sewing anywhere. While she appreciates some gadgets, like the washing machine, she found joy in losing others. For example, she returned her rented color TV and went back to a small black-and-white one. This change made her family spend more time walking the dog, reading, and talking.
Sewing by hand has become a new hobby for Susan. Her old sewing machine is now a plant table, and she can't afford a new one, so she sews by hand. She used to think sewing by hand was hard work, but now she finds it soothing and satisfying. She can sew while listening to the radio or talking with family. It helps her slow down and enjoy life at her own pace. She also enjoys washing dishes by hand, which gives her time to daydream.
Susan now looks around her house and wonders if she really needs things like the freezer, microwave, or lawnmower. She even thinks about saving money by not using electric lights."
CAE_62,C1,"'The Cabinet-Maker Charles Hurst makes a living from perfectly crafted furniture. Joanna Watt meets him. Charles Hurst seems like a man in a hurry. When I arrive at his workshop, located under a railway arch in East London, he greets me with a quick handshake and says, 'Well, fire away then!' It's not clear if he is really brusque or just shy. But looking around the workshop, it's obvious Hurst is busy. The space is full of half-made furniture and planks of wood in many natural colors. Hurst has been a cabinet-maker for ten years and has a great reputation. His order book is always full for months, even though he doesn't advertise. People know that if you want a good cupboard, table, bookcase, or kitchen units, Hurst is the person to go to. Finding a furniture-maker is not hard, but finding one who makes beautifully crafted furniture with simple lines is rare. 'There are few real cabinet-makers now. People call themselves furniture-makers,' Hurst says. He is disappointed by some modern furniture. 'I am amazed by what some furniture-makers get away with, and saddened by what people will accept.' He dislikes poor-quality, mass-produced furniture and craftsmen who make second-rate pieces. Hurst's quest for perfection and his talent are keys to his success. He is confident about his ability. 'I have a huge natural ability,' he says. 'I have always been good at making things.' Hurst is self-taught. How did he learn? 'I asked the right questions and picked it all up,' he says. Most of his work comes from private clients. 'I used to do some commercial work for companies, but it was soul-destroying.' Some clients come back many times. 'You end up doing the whole of their house. That is very satisfying.' But he admits that relationships with clients are not always easy. 'The most annoying clients are those who don't know what they want, and then decide they do when it's too late ... my favorite clients are the exacting ones.' Hurst is pleased with himself but also praises others when deserved. 'There are people far better than me. I can admire other people. After all, I wasn't trained at Parnham' (a top furniture design college). He is critical of craftsmen who 'are trying to be artists and take a year to make one piece.' He also dislikes degree shows where students try to make fashion statements. 'That can be pretentious. A piece of furniture is not about making a statement. It has to be something that people really can use.' Hurst is confident and sometimes brusque, but not pretentious. As I leave, he shows humility. 'After all, I am only making furniture,' he says.'"
CAE_49,C1,"'Three theories about sleep People spend about one-third of their lives sleeping. It seems clear that sleep is very important. However, scientists still do not agree on exactly why we need to sleep so much. There are three main ideas. The most common idea is that sleep is mainly for our body's health. It says that we sleep to help our body stay healthy. While we sleep, our body fixes any damage from the day and gets ready for the next day. Another idea focuses on learning. This idea says that sleep helps us process the information we learn during the day. Without sleep, we would not be able to learn well. The third idea is about energy. It says we need sleep to recharge our energy, like recharging a battery, so we have enough energy for the next day.'"
CAE_31,C1,"**ECCENTRICS**
An eccentric is someone whose behavior is different from what is normal in society. This makes us ask, ""What is normal?"" Most people have their own little habits or interests. For example, some people love entering newspaper competitions, collecting beer mats, or writing letters to newspapers about many topics. Eccentricity is about being unique. Inside us, there is a struggle between wanting to be different and wanting to fit in. It's like having two trains pushing against each other on the same track. One train is called individualism, and the other is conformity. For most people, conformity is stronger. We want to be accepted, loved, and feel like we belong. 
People with unusual hobbies or strong opinions often find others like them. They form clubs and have meetings to share their interests. They look for people who understand them, as their family and friends might think they are odd. Being part of a group, even a small one, feels comforting. 
We all feel a pull between being ourselves and fitting in. Sometimes, we want to show we are different, like when someone at a bar says, ""I say what I think,"" or when a new person says, ""You must take me as you find me."" 
Anyone can choose to be more individualistic. Many successful people have done this. For example, Bob Dylan, an American singer, said that when you follow your true feelings and don't give up, you might confuse people. But this is not eccentricity at first. When a pop singer wears strange clothes for attention or a hostess makes shocking comments to be noticed, it is not eccentricity. If they keep doing these things until they can't go back to normal behavior, then they might be eccentric. 
The key to being eccentric is being natural. Eccentrics don't try to be different; they just are. They don't care about what others think. They do what they do because of who they are. This makes them different from enthusiasts, practical jokers, criminals, exhibitionists, and recluses. These people are aware of the world and react to it. Some want to impress society, and some want to escape it, but they all think about society. Eccentrics, however, just live their lives without worrying about what others think."
CAE_58,C1,"**Natural Books**
We asked four naturalists to tell us about the wildlife book that influenced them the most.
**A Geoffrey Lean**
Choosing the author was easy for me. As an environmental journalist, I have met many important people in the field. None impressed me more than Barbara Ward, a small, frail woman who was central to environmental issues in post-war Europe. She turned her experiences into a powerful philosophy. As a young journalist, she helped me understand the field. Choosing the book was harder. It could have been ""Only One Earth"" or ""Progress for a Small Planet."" But ""The Home of Man"" is, to me, her most important book. It talks about the rapid growth of cities and the big themes she cared about. It is a passionate call for what we now call 'sustainable human development'. I have read many books since, but none match it.
**B Linda Bennett**
When I read ""Signals for Survival"" by Niko Tinbergen, I can imagine the sounds and smells of a herring gull colony. This book explains animal communication with words and pictures. After reading it, watching a gull colony changes from chaos to an organized social structure. You can see which birds are partners and recognize families. Niko Tinbergen was a great behaviorist who wanted to share his findings with everyone. He worked with Eric Ennion, a talented wildlife artist, to create this book. Ennion's paintings, with simple lines and colors, show how one gull is aggressive and another is peaceful. This is the work of a true field naturalist.
**C Lee Durrell**
""My Family and Other Animals"" by Gerald Durrell is the book that influenced me the most. It led me to a wonderful husband and a career in conservation. This book defined my love for the natural world. I was researching animal sounds in Madagascar when I first read it. I was facing many challenges, but reading this book made my world brighter. It shows animals, people, joy, and beauty all connected. Many say humans are the worst because of the harm we cause, but I remember Gerald as a boy, seeing the world as a family. This is a concept we all need to understand.
**D Bruce Pearson**
I found ""The Shell Bird Book"" by James Fisher in my school library after it was published in 1966. I was drawn to the 48 color plates of birds by Eric Ennion. I already had other bird books and spent holidays learning to identify birds. They encouraged me to sketch birds to help with identification. But ""The Shell Bird Book"" offered more. It had chapters on bird migration, the history of birds in Britain, and birds in music, literature, and art. This wide range of information and exciting images made me appreciate birds and nature more broadly. The book showed me that my emotional and creative response to nature was as valid as a scientific one. Since art was my strong subject, I saw new opportunities for myself."
CAE_37,C1,"**DO REVIEWS SELL BOOKS?**
We asked five top British publishers if book reviews help sell books. Here is what they said:
**Publisher A**  
Reviews are very important for publishers. They are the first thing we look at in a newspaper. The Book Marketing Council found that more people buy books because of reviews than for any other reason, like ads or word of mouth. Authors and publishers both dislike getting no reviews, but publishers are usually calmer about bad reviews. They think that any mention, good or bad, can help sell books because readers want to decide for themselves. Publishers enjoy reviews that match their own opinion of the book since they are often the first to read it.
**Publisher B**  
Publishers and the press both care about book reviews, but they have different needs. Newspapers want to entertain their readers, while publishers want their books reviewed positively. Book reviews are better now than 40 years ago, but paperbacks are still often ignored. Publishers need reviews because they help make a book and its author known. A good review by a trusted person can increase sales, especially if there are several reviews. Fame helps get books into readers' hands.
**Publisher C**  
Reviews are essential for literary publishing. We publish books by authors who are not famous, so we rely on reviews since we rarely advertise. Good reviews are more valuable than ads because they are seen as honest opinions. Reviews can help sell books, but they need to work with other things like word of mouth and good marketing.
**Publisher D**  
In the US, a review in the New York Times can make or break a book. In Britain, bookshops don't always pay attention to reviews. Sometimes it takes many years of good reviews for people to start reading a writer's work. Some poorly reviewed books sell very well, so it's unpredictable. Non-fiction reviews often focus more on the reviewer's knowledge than the book itself.
**Publisher E**  
All publishers and writers want long, positive reviews. But do they sell books? I once published a biography that got great reviews, but it didn't sell because people felt they didn't need to buy the book after reading the reviews. The reviewer's name used to matter more, but now it's the surprise choice of reviewer or the quality of the review that can make people buy the book."
CAE_2,C1,"'WEATHERVANE MAKER The making of weathervanes is a very old skill, starting in early Egyptian times. Today, this craft is still alive in the workshop of Graham Smith. He is one of the few people in the country who make weathervanes by hand. Graham's designs are made especially for each customer. 'This way, I can make a unique and personal item,' he explains. 'Many of my customers are women buying gifts for their husbands. They want a special gift that shows the man's job or hobbies.' This is very different from the traditional cockerel, which is the most common weathervane design. Graham's first weathervane was not a cockerel but a witch on a broomstick. He made it as a surprise gift for his wife. Friends liked it and asked him to make weathervanes for them. 'I realized that I could make weathervanes in many different shapes,' he says. Graham decided to focus on a weathervane business. He had trained as a precision engineer and worked in that job for 15 years. Then he and his wife, Liz, decided to change roles - she went to work as an architectural assistant, and he stayed home to take care of the children and grow the business. That was five years ago, and he is happy with his new path. 'My old job was not artistic, but this is exciting and creative,' he says. 'I really enjoy designing.' Graham has now created over 100 original designs. He works with great detail and always gets the customer's approval for the design before cutting it by hand. Graham also keeps many traditional designs in stock because they are as popular as the custom ones. 'People like hand-made things,' Graham says. 'They like to have something a little different.' Graham does not plan to expand his business because he wants to keep it as a small craft. 'I have found my place in the market. People love the uniqueness, and I enjoy turning a simple shape into something almost lifelike,' he says. 'For centuries, weathervanes have helped communities by showing changes in the wind that bring changes in the weather,' he explains. 'Now, with more people moving to the countryside, they want to add a special touch to their homes. This has helped crafts like mine.' Graham is now very busy, sending flat-packed weathervanes to clients around the world. Buyers from America and Denmark are especially interested. 'The price,' he explains, 'depends on how detailed the design is.' His most recent request was for a curly-coated dog. Whatever the occasion, Graham can create a special gift.'"
CAE_68,C1,"**Beginner Takes All**
Before it was even published, *The Horse Whisperer* was the most talked-about book of the year. It is the first novel by British screenwriter Nicholas Evans, and it has made him a lot of money. Here, he talks about his inspiration and success.
The start of the year was tough for Nicholas Evans. He is a screenwriter, producer, and wants to be a director. Things went wrong when *Life and Limb*, a film he had been working on for months, suddenly failed. He was worried because he hadn't earned any money for two years, and this film was his only hope to pay the bank.
Instead of finding a job, Evans made a surprising decision. He bought a ticket to America to research his first novel for three months. The idea for the story came from a farrier he met on Dartmoor. The farrier told him about a calm horse that suddenly became wild. Its owners were desperate until they found a gypsy who calmed the horse just by talking to it. These men were called 'horse whisperers'. Evans was fascinated and started researching to write a screenplay. But after *Life and Limb* failed, he decided to write a book instead.
In the spring, he traveled across the US, visiting ranches and learning about horses and the people who work with them. He felt alone and worried about his future. By August, he had written half of the book and showed it to a friend who was a literary agent. The agent thought it was ""fine"" and said Evans might get $30,000 for it. Evans needed more money to pay his debts and support his family.
In October, the first 200 pages and a 12-page summary of the book were sent to seven UK publishers before the Frankfurt Book Fair. Soon, his agent called to say he had turned down an offer of $75,000. Evans was shocked. Within a week, the book was sold to Transworld Publications in the UK for $550,000 and to Delacorte in the US for $3.15 million, both record amounts for a first novel.
Evans was amazed. They hadn't even sent the book to New York or Hollywood, but soon major studios were competing for it. His UK agent worked with an agent in the US, and they received an offer of $3 million for the film rights. Four big filmmakers called Evans to try to buy the rights to his unfinished novel.
Evans shared this story while we drank coffee at his home. He said he turned down an offer to write the screenplay for *The Horse Whisperer*. He didn't want to ruin the fairy tale. Writing screenplays is tough, and he didn't want to work for people who had paid him so much. He wanted to stay involved but not too closely.
The success of his novel also brought new offers to make *Life and Limb*, but he wasn't sure he wanted to do it anymore. He thought it would be wise to write another novel."
CAE_23,C1,"'Young Masters Age is a challenge for Bobby Fischer as he tries to make a comeback. Chess is now more than ever a game for young people. After 20 years away from the game, Bobby Fischer is back and playing against his old rival Boris Spassky. Fischer won the first game with a brilliant move, but he is not the same player he was in 1972. He is now 49 years old, out of practice, and not in the best shape. Spassky is even older. Chess has changed a lot in the last 20 years. Fischer helped make chess popular, and now it is more professional. Winning is the main goal for modern players. In international chess, a player's nerves and stamina are as important as their intelligence. The pressure is high: players must make a certain number of moves in a set time, or they lose the game. Games are longer now, and many are played without breaks. This gives an advantage to younger players. In the last 30 years, each new world champion has been younger than the one before. Of the world's top ten players, eight are under 30. The way chess is played has also changed. Much of the game happens off the board. Players must prepare well before matches, especially because computers have changed chess a lot. A small computer can store one million chess games and help players study their opponents. In a recent match, both players had teams working to find weaknesses in each other's games. The opening moves are studied very carefully. Being well-prepared in the opening can decide the game. Today, there are more top players than ever before. Hundreds of grandmasters compete for small prizes around the world. Success needs both physical and mental effort. A single game can last up to eight hours. During this time, players must stay focused. Losing concentration can lead to disaster. The chess clock adds to the tension. The end of the game can be a fast 'time scramble', where players have only seconds to make moves. They must move quickly and press their clocks with great skill. These moments are not for thinkers. The game becomes a battle of nerves and determination. At the top level, losing is very painful. Winning brings great satisfaction and a chance to recover. But one win is not enough to win a tournament. Players must be ready to play again the next day. Most tournaments last 9-11 days, with games every day. World championship matches are even tougher. In 1984, a match between Anatoli Karpov and Gary Kasparov in Moscow had to stop because both players were too tired. Karpov lost about 10kg in weight. Can Fischer beat these challenges? He once said, ""All I want to do, ever, is play chess."" This made his leaving the chess world in 1972 hard to understand. But it made him a legend. If he returned for money, he will earn a lot. Whatever happens in his match with Spassky, both will become much richer. But if Fischer came back to prove he is still the best, losing could be very sad for him.'"
CAE_60,C1,"**Fame and Fortune**
Imogen Edwards-Jones talks to some new British talents, from poets to pop stars, who are becoming famous.
**A** Nick Grosso, in his early 30s, has written three successful plays. He is now turning his first play, ""Peaches,"" into a movie script. ""It's low budget, but we don't know how low,"" he says. ""It won't be over £30 million, but it could be as low as £30."" The amazing thing about Nick is that before writing ""Peaches,"" he had never seen or read a play. ""When I wrote the play, I never thought it would be performed,"" he says. ""It's set in a car. I wouldn't do that now because I know the problems it causes. I knew nothing back then."" He left school at 16 but returned a year later. After finishing his A-levels, he joined the Young People's Theatre. ""I realized I wanted to write for actors. I wanted my writing to be heard, not just read, because of the rhythm and rhyme,"" he says. ""It was the first time I enjoyed being in an educational environment. It was very exciting.""
**B** Comedian Simon Pegg, 28, has made great progress since studying drama at Bristol University. He is now writing a TV comedy series and has just finished a tough tour with comedy star Steve Coogan. He has always worked hard. Even at Bristol, he was performing in comedy clubs. ""University was very theoretical,"" Simon remembers. ""It made me realize I didn't want to be a serious actor and that I was more interested in comedy. People think comedy is the hardest job, but it isn't. If you have courage and good material, making people laugh is wonderful."" He has performed with the comic group Funny Business, but his work with Steve Coogan has been the most successful. ""He saw my show, and since I was a big fan of his, he probably saw me copying him,"" Simon admits.
**C** Ciaran McMenamin, 24, became famous when he starred in the series ""The Young Person's Guide To Becoming A Rock Star."" The reviews were very positive, and his career has taken off quickly. ""It's been a great opportunity for me,"" he says with a smile. ""Now I can choose what I do, which is what I've always wanted."" This is a rare position, especially since he just graduated. Looking at Ciaran's early career, it's clear he was always going to be successful. Encouraged by his mother, he went from lead roles at school to the Ulster Youth Theatre, where he stayed for four years. ""I used acting as an excuse not to do homework,"" laughs Ciaran. ""But then I decided to take it seriously because I was good at it and loved it."" Now he is waiting for more praise, but when asked about fame, he becomes thoughtful. ""When you're 18, you think you'll love the photos and interviews, but you soon realize that's not why you act. It's about getting respect for good work.""
**D** Neil Taylor, 25, is the lead singer of the pop band Matrix, which has just signed a three-album deal with Domino Records. Neil and his bandmate Rick Brown are expected to be very successful when their single ""Chimera"" is released soon. ""The record company talks about a big hit, but I have no idea. If two people buy it, I'll be happy,"" he says. Unlike many new pop stars, Neil has worked hard for his success. He left school at 16 and has been trying to enter the music business ever since. ""It's funny how things happen,"" he says. ""I was doing student gigs for eight years and was about to give up when I met Rick Brown, who had contacts at Domino, and we formed Matrix. It couldn't have happened at a better time. There were times when I was very depressed, and I've been in some terrible bands. But hopefully, it will all be worth it.""
**E** Poet and author Stephen Richards, 27, has won many prizes and awards. He is well known in the poetry world, where he has been touring and giving readings for six years. Now his first novel, ""Hidden,"" will be published in March. ""It's a story of obsessive love. It was a strong idea that I couldn't express as a poem."" Stephen loved creative writing at school but became unhappy with education later. ""I decided not to go to university, but when I got bored with stuffing envelopes at a theatre, I decided to go."" After university, he published his first work, a children's book, in 1992. ""I don't think my parents expected me to be a writer. They thought I'd be a reader because that's all I did as a child."" With his poetry being praised, moving to novels is brave. ""There's a structure with my poetry, so there's less chance of making big mistakes,"" he explains. ""A novel can be any length, so there are more chances for bad words. My main goal is not to just produce work without caring about the quality."""
CAE_1,C1,"A. Isabel, the main character in this funny novel, is an art student who is 31 years old. She loves historical romance stories and is looking for Mr. Right. Isabel thinks she looks good in jeans but doesn't wear them often because she doesn't want to be seen with the wrong people. She worries that her knobbly knees might stop her from finding love. However, she remains hopeful, which helps her and others in the story. The author writes with great energy, using a fast-paced style like an old silent movie. B. This story is about the beginning and almost end of a local radio station in America. It is told from the perspective of a smart child named Francis With. Francis works for WLT (With Lettuce and Tomato) Radio, a station started by Roy and Ray Soderbjerg to promote their sandwich shop. The station broadcasts a mix of singers, preachers, soap-opera stars, and announcers. The small-town American setting allows the author to use dry humor and simple writing. The story takes the reader back to the 1940s and 1950s, a time of old-fashioned cars and radios. C. In this story, it is normal for a second husband to talk with his wife's first husband. Professor Richard Vaisey falls in love with a Russian poetess and talks about it with his wife's ex-husband. The poetess writes bad poetry, which bothers Richard, and she wants his help for her brother, who is in prison. The author skillfully untangles these problems with humor and insight, making the story enjoyable and clever. D. Two pairs of best friends, two women and two men, meet in London in the 1960s and stay connected for 25 years. At the start of this long novel, one of them, an American businessman named James Hudson, is starting a newspaper, which his friend Richard Blake is editing. The newspaper launch is important, but so is the fact that the woman they both loved (and one married) was killed years ago. The story includes murder, ambition, love, and jealousy, with good writing that helps readers get to know the characters well. E. This story, written by a top American author, is about Ian Bedloe, who feels guilty for a mistake and decides to take care of his brother's three orphaned children. At 40, Ian is becoming an unusual bachelor surrounded by the mess of family life. The story explores many emotions and focuses on the sweet relationship Ian builds with the youngest child, Daphne. It is a warm and touching book with a perfect mix of sadness and humor."
CAE_53,C1,"**Volunteer Tourism: A Discussion**
**A.** Volunteer tourism is when people travel to other countries to help with projects like building homes or schools. However, volunteers often pay a lot of money to do this work. If this money was given directly to the local community, it might pay for more work than the volunteer can do. This is especially true for gap year students, who usually do not have special skills. Some studies question if these young people volunteer to help others or to improve their own careers. Still, these projects might help volunteers become more ethical and caring in their future lives.
**B.** Volunteering can help people understand each other better, solve conflicts, and participate in global issues. It can also create international friendships. This can be good for both volunteers and the communities they help. But if only rich people from wealthy countries volunteer, they might benefit more than the communities they visit. These volunteers might use the experience to advance their careers, while the communities gain little.
**C.** Sometimes, international volunteering can seem like charity from rich countries or a way for volunteers to improve themselves. But it can also be a way to share skills and knowledge between cultures. Volunteering can make people aware of global issues like poverty and injustice, and encourage them to fight these problems throughout their lives.
**D.** Volunteer tourism is popular because it seems like a simple way to help others. It avoids big government and business, focusing on personal acts of charity. However, it can also ignore the need for bigger changes in poor communities. While volunteering is a good act, calling it sustainable development can be misleading. It might distract from understanding and solving the real causes of global poverty."
CAE_55,C1,"**Sound the Alarm: Stuart Harris Reports**
Many of us listen to the radio when we wake up and need something to help us get out of bed. That's why we have clock radios. But how do you choose a good one? Our team, including me, inventor Tom Granger, and broadcaster Paul Bridges, tested five models.
The first model has a 'dual alarm function.' I thought it meant you could snooze and then wake up again, but it actually lets you set two different wake-up times, like one for weekdays and one for weekends. This model also has a cassette player, which is a good deal since it costs about the same as the second model. You can fall asleep to your own tapes and wake up without news. We liked the radio quality, but it's as big as a rugby ball. Paul Bridges said he needs space on his bedside table for his keys, wallet, glasses, and phone. He also books a wake-up call just in case.
The second model was the best-looking and overall winner. Paul Bridges loved it, although the clock on his test model got stuck at 16:00. I liked the digital display with grey numbers on a green background. The snooze bar is wide, so you can tap it with your eyes closed. It has a self-power back-up, so you don't have to reset it if the plug is pulled out. However, it was hard to set up, but once we learned, we felt 'cool' and sophisticated.
Tom Granger thought the third model, with its built-in lamp, was 'unbelievably tacky.' You have to pull the light out of its socket to use it, which made him question its quality. The clock kept jumping from 12:00 to 02:00, so he had to reset it. The light only shines on the clock, which is already lit. Paul Bridges liked the lamp idea but found the radio hard to tune. The buzzer was loud and annoying, but this model is the third most popular on the market.
The fourth model is aimed at young people with its bright colors and strap. Tom Granger and I liked it because it stands out. It was the only one we could set up without reading the instructions. However, the alarm can be 10 minutes early or late, which Paul Bridges found 'completely useless.'
The last model is the simplest and cheapest. Tom Granger liked it because it was standard and took up little space. It has old-fashioned dial tuning, which he found more intuitive. He admitted that button-tuning has improved radio quality, but we thought the tuning was crude. The buzzer worked well, getting me out of bed in just two beeps!"
CAE_50,C1,"'Hedgehogs A hedgehog is a small animal with sharp spines covering its body. Hedgehogs live in many parts of the world, but they are not native to America or Australia. All hedgehogs can roll into a tight ball when they are attacked, making their spines point outwards. This helps protect them from danger. The number of spines a hedgehog has can affect how well this works. Some hedgehogs that live in the desert have fewer spines because they need to be lighter. These hedgehogs might try to run away from danger first and only roll into a ball if they have to. Hedgehogs are mostly active at night and sleep during the day, usually under bushes or in a hole in the ground. Although all hedgehogs can hibernate, not all of them do. If the weather is good, some hedgehogs stay awake all year.'"
CAE_25,C1,"**Great Sportswomen on a Winning Streak**
Being successful in sports is tough for everyone, but women often have to work even harder. Training and competitions take up a lot of time, so they have to make sacrifices. Despite challenges, these women are breaking records and overcoming prejudice. Here, we talk to some amazing British sportswomen who are achieving their dreams.
**A. Jill, 27, Skier**
""It's an amazing feeling to fly through the air and land perfectly, but it can be scary. Sometimes you don't feel well, or it's windy and hard to see, but you just keep going. It's difficult to have a career outside skiing because we train for ten months a year. You give up a lot of your social life and friends. But it was my choice. There are six men and three women in the British team. We all compete on the same courses and get treated the same - it's a young sport.""
**B. Caroline, 22, Cyclist**
""Two years ago, I borrowed a bike to join a charity race. I won because I cycled faster than everyone else, which was amazing because I'd never cycled before! I'm well paid as a professional, and cycling has lots of potential for endorsements. However, I worry that people might think I succeeded because of how I look, not because I'm the best cyclist. So I focus on cycling now, rather than earning money. I train at least four hours every day on the bike, plus stretching exercises, swimming, and running. My boyfriend is a cyclist too, so he understands the time commitment.""
**C. Annabel, 26, Rower**
""Rowing is hard for girls to start because very few girls' schools offer it. Most don't start until they're 19 or 20, which makes it harder to succeed internationally. Also, coaches usually stay for only a year or so, so there's no continuity, and the women's squad is often disorganized. But it's great fun, I love being fit, and there's a good social life.""
**D. Ffyona, 24, Long Distance Walker**
""At 13, I dreamed of walking around the world—I didn't know how big it was then! Britain felt too small and safe. I was very determined and didn't like others controlling me. Now I am more tactful. Each walk is different. Walking across Australia was the most painful experience I've ever had. I walked 50 miles and 21 hours each day with only three hours of sleep, in high temperatures, and with 15 blisters on each foot. But I got the record! I had to, because my sponsorship money was running out after 95 days. Men often think women are more likely to fail, so sponsoring them is seen as a higher risk.""
**E. Lisa, 26, Saloon Car Racer**
""Some men have big egos when driving—you see it on motorways. When I'm doing well, they don't talk to me. Being a woman has its disadvantages. When I reach a corner, men think 'I've got to beat her,' so I've had a lot of bumps! You have to be naturally competitive and aggressive. It's very hard to earn money, and what I do make goes back into the sport. Women have been racing since the 1920s and were always seen as unusual. It's great that more women are taking up racing every year. For me, the appeal of saloon car racing is aiming for perfection—always trying to complete a perfect lap.""
**F. Alison, 28, Triathlete**
""I get up at 5:30 three mornings a week to swim. I need Tuesday and Thursday mornings to catch up on sleep. In the evening, I just cycle or run. Yes, I do fall asleep at my desk sometimes! There is a lot of nervous build-up before a race, and when you're racing, you really push yourself—you don't feel good if you don't. I've often asked myself why I do it. The answer is: a) I'm happier when I keep fit, b) I'm lazy at heart, and if I didn't make myself do this, I'd really be lazy, c) racing is very social. Men and women usually compete together, but when an event is covered in the press, 90% of the article will explain the men's event, and 10% will say, 'Oh, by the way, so-and-so won the women's event.' The prize money isn't as good either, of course. But now we've formed an International Triathlon Women's Commission, so we're working on it."""
CAE_34,C1,"**The Day I Drew Picasso**
Richard Cork remembers the day he met the famous artist Picasso. Richard was an 18-year-old student traveling around Europe and Morocco in an old van before starting university. He ran out of money and found a job painting boats in Cannes. One day, while eating at a restaurant in Cannes harbor, he saw Picasso, who was 78 years old, having lunch with his wife, Jacqueline, and three friends. Picasso was known to be a private person, so Richard was surprised to see him.
Richard's friend encouraged him to ask Picasso for his autograph. Nervously, Richard approached Picasso and offered his sketchbook. Picasso kindly signed his name and added a drawing on the page. Richard was thrilled and started a conversation with Picasso, using an American woman at the table as an interpreter.
After showing the autograph to his friend, Richard was encouraged to go back and draw Picasso's portrait. Without asking for permission, Richard started drawing. Picasso noticed and made funny faces to make it difficult for Richard. Eventually, Picasso stopped and allowed Richard to draw him calmly. Richard observed Picasso's youthful appearance and intense eyes.
When Richard finished, Picasso wanted to see the portrait. Although Richard was embarrassed, Picasso looked at it and then drew a quick sketch on the same page. Picasso's drawing was playful and different from Richard's careful work. Richard asked Picasso to sign the drawing, but Picasso declined, saying Richard already had his signature.
Richard felt very lucky to have met Picasso and received his attention. This experience meant a lot to him."
CAE_12,C1,"**Shopping Tricks**
Have you ever gone into a store and bought more than you planned? We explain the tricks shops use to make you spend more money.
**A. Freshness Image**
Supermarkets know that customers like fresh products. They often put fruits and vegetables at the store entrance or have a display of house plants to show freshness. They might also have a bakery inside that spreads the smell of fresh bread. The store's colors, like green, can also make things look fresh. Most of what supermarkets sell, like frozen foods and cleaning products, is different from this fresh image.
**B. Smart Display**
Where products are placed in a store is very important for sales. Supermarkets use computers to find out which areas are most popular with shoppers. They put high-profit items or fast-selling products in these spots. Shelves at eye level are popular because they sell better. Special offer bins attract people who love bargains. Stores also use 'complementation' by placing related items together, like salad dressings near salads.
**C. Spreading Essentials**
Supermarkets put basic items like bread, tea, and sugar far from the entrance. This way, shoppers pass by other tempting products. Chain stores do the same with popular items, placing them far from the entrance. They know loyal customers will look for these items and might buy other things along the way.
**D. Less is More**
Chain stores have changed how they display products. The Next chain, for example, moved away from the 'pile them high, sell them cheap' method. Their stores look like boutiques, showing fewer items to make them seem special. Even though their clothes are mass-produced, the store design makes them look exclusive.
**E. Total Temptation**
Food shoppers care more about the total bill than individual prices. Supermarkets mix low-profit staples with high-profit items. Not everything in a supermarket is cheap. They might sell some items at a loss to attract customers, known as 'loss leaders'. They also buy in bulk to get discounts from manufacturers.
**F. Price Tags Matter**
In chain stores, shoppers buy fewer items and notice prices more. Pricing something at $14.99 instead of $15 is still effective. It also helps reduce theft because staff must ring up the sale to give change.
**G. Effective Lighting**
Both supermarkets and chain stores think carefully about lighting. Chain stores aim for natural light so clothes look the same as they would outside. Supermarkets use special lighting and mirrors to make fresh food look better.
**H. Walking Paths**
Some chain stores use different carpets to guide shoppers. One pattern shows the path through the store, and another marks sales areas. This is called the 'Yellow Brick Road'. It doesn't always work, as some shoppers stick to the path. Marks and Spencer use wood or marble for paths, leading to more inviting carpeted sales areas.
**I. In-Store Ads**
When you enter a supermarket, you see big photos of delicious food. In the U.S., some supermarkets use 'video trolleys' with screens that show ads as you shop. Sensors trigger ads for products near you, like ready-made meals. These trolleys target impulse buyers and can increase sales by about 30%."
CAE_26,C1,"'Sea, Ice & Rock Mountaineer Chris Bonnington (58) is famous for climbing Everest in 1985. He has also created new climbing routes in Britain and the Alps and written many books, like Quest for Adventure and Everest the Hard Way. Robin Knox-Johnston (53) started his sea career in the Merchant Navy. In 1968-9, he was the first person to sail around the world alone, in his yacht Sunhaili. He broke the transatlantic record, taking 10 days to sail from New York to the Lizard. The two teamed up to sail and climb in Greenland, and they wrote about the trip in their new book: Sea, Ice and Rock. In 1979, I was working on Quest for Adventure, a study of post-war adventure. I called Robin to ask for an interview, and he invited me to join him for a sail. I could show him some climbing techniques, and he could teach me the basics of sailing. It was my first time on a yacht. We sailed for a while and then anchored. Robin's wife and daughter stayed on the boat, and we paddled to the shore to practice climbing. The route was quite difficult, and I was impressed by how steady Robin was in tricky conditions. He moved quietly along. After a bit, we reached a huge drop. I asked Robin if he had ever climbed before. He hadn't, so I showed him. When I finished, Robin politely asked if he could go down the way he climbed down ropes on his boat. He was used to using his arms, but I wanted him to use his legs. I wasn't too happy about it, but he lowered himself down safely. During that trip to Skye, Robin and I became good friends. His idea to combine our skills on a trip to Greenland was just a bigger version of our Skye trip. Robin impressed me as a leader. Usually, the skipper makes all the decisions, but Robin asked everyone first. Most of the time, nobody dared to advise him, but it was nice to feel part of the decision-making process. To be honest, I found the sailing difficult and boring. The moments of crisis on the way back were easy to handle: the adrenaline pumps, and you get all worked up. The hard part was spending day after day in the middle of the sea. I love the land and am not really a do-it-yourself person. Robin, on the other hand, is a natural sailor and enjoyed fixing the engine or mending the toilet. I knew Robin didn't really need me. To be honest, I felt a bit useless at times; I found that hard. The crew was also packed very close together: six people on a 32ft yacht, designed to sleep four. At least on a mountain expedition, you can get away from each other. When we reached Greenland, and it was my turn to 'lead' the expedition, I found it hard to be responsible for Robin's life. There were many times climbing together when if Robin had fallen, he could have pulled me off with him. I had to watch for that constantly. I underestimated how difficult the Cathedral -- Greenland's highest mountain - would be. Robin isn't a natural climber, which made his efforts even more impressive. The first time we tried to reach the top, we were on the go for 24 hours. On the way down, we were falling asleep on 50-degree slopes, 1,500 feet above the ground. Robin went through a lot, but he totally trusted me. He just followed. When it got too difficult, and I realized we had to turn back, he accepted it. I also knew that Robin was worried about the boat: whether we'd be able to get it through the ice, whether it was in one piece. Yet he was all in favor of us trying to climb the mountain again. The only time there was a near-crisis in our relationship was on the yacht on the way home. We were taking turns to be on watch. I was supposed to get up at 4 am for my shift, but Robin decided not to wake me. He felt he could do it himself. The previous night I'd almost fallen asleep. I felt that he didn't trust me - I felt insecure, and I said so. Robin immediately reassured me that I'd jumped to the wrong conclusion. While we enjoyed the Skye trip, we didn't really know each other until the end of the Greenland expedition. I found that underneath his tough exterior, Robin was a kind-hearted, sensitive person.'"
CAE_8,C1,"**A History of the Apple**
Apples have been with us for a very long time, in many different colors, shapes, and sizes. However, in the late 20th century, we risk losing this heritage.
**Prehistoric Wild Apples (8,000 BC)**
People have been eating apples since prehistoric times. In ancient Britain, they spat out apple seeds. Around 10,000 years ago, they left apple remains near their homes in Switzerland and Italy. In Switzerland and near the Caucasus mountains, ancient people stored apple halves for winter. These were wild crab apples, small and wrinkled, known as 'windings' in Ancient Britain. They were very different from the apples we know today.
**Norman Knowledge (1000 AD)**
The French learned fruit-growing skills from the Romans, which they developed in monasteries. This knowledge, including cider-making, was brought to Britain. The dessert apple, Decio, was introduced by the Roman general, Etio. However, most Roman apples did not suit the British climate, so Norman varieties became more popular. British monks continued to develop new apples, and many Western apples come from these varieties.
**Medieval Favorites (1200)**
In the 13th century, several apple types became popular in Britain. The Old English Pearmain, recorded in 1204, was the main dessert apple until the 18th century. Its cooking partner was the Costard, sold in Oxford markets from 1296 to the 17th century, giving us the word 'costermonger' for someone who sells fruit and vegetables on the street. Apple production declined due to droughts, the Black Death, and the Wars of the Roses. More apples were imported until the 16th century when Henry VIII sent Richard Harris to France to learn about apple growing. Harris brought back many apple grafts, including the famous Pippins, and created the first modern orchard in Kent.
**Settler Treasure (1750)**
By the 17th century, apples were so popular in Britain that settlers took them to Canada, Australia, the US, South Africa, and New Zealand. Captain Bligh took apples to Australia, Jan van Riebeeck to South Africa, and the Pilgrim Fathers to America. In North America, John Chapman, known as 'Johnny Appleseed', planted apple nurseries from Pennsylvania to Indiana. He was seen as a medicine man by the Indians and became a folk hero.
**Modern Delicious (1850)**
Around this time in Iowa, a Quaker farmer named Jesse Hiatt found a new apple tree growing. He named the apple 'Hawkey'. At a fruit show, a judge tasted it and exclaimed 'Delicious, delicious!'. In 1895, it was introduced as 'Delicious' and became one of the most popular apples worldwide.
**Granny Smith (1850)**
Another famous apple was discovered in Australia by Maria Anne Smith. Known as 'Granny Smith', she found a small tree growing from discarded fruit in 1868. She transplanted it and soon harvested the first major crop of green apples, which became famous worldwide. She said, 'It's just like God to make something useful out of what we think is rubbish', referring to both the fruit and her convict origins.
**Uniformity (1950)**
Apples are now grown worldwide, from India to Africa. Most are grown commercially and come from just a few varieties, chosen for their red skin or ability to travel well, not for taste. This uniformity is reducing the variety of apples. While UK gardeners have kept many old varieties alive, the US has lost most of its apples from 100 years ago. Consumers are now asking for more variety. We must protect natural diversity in apples and other foods for everyone's benefit."

CAE_30,C1,"'Richard Nerurkar, a top British 10,000-metre runner, visits the Kenyan high-altitude training camp. This camp is near Mount Kenya, which is the highest mountain in Kenya. For three years, Richard trained in Kenya's Central Highlands during winter, but he never trained with Kenyan runners. On his fourth trip, he changed this. He competed in his first race in Kenya and stayed at the national team training camp. This camp is where Kenya's best runners prepare for the World Cross-Country Team Championships. Richard was invited by the national team coach after he finished fifth in a World Championship 10,000 meters race. Training at high altitude helps runners because it increases red blood cells, which carry oxygen. This is one reason why Kenyan runners are successful. Richard's first race in Africa was in Nairobi. It was the first international cross-country race in Africa. He finished behind 41 runners, most of whom were Kenyan. He realized that Kenyan success is not just because of altitude. Kenyan runners have a simple approach to running. They run with ease, eat simple food, and enjoy competing. Richard learned more about their training during his stay at the camp. The camp is at St Mark's College, 6,200 feet up Mount Kenya. It is basic, with few comforts. Athletes live with students and share rooms. Their day includes three workouts: an easy morning run, interval training mid-morning, and a steady run in the afternoon. They run about 40 kilometers a day, except on Sundays when they run 20 kilometers. Life at the camp is simple. Breakfast is tea, bread, and boiled eggs. Lunch and dinner are ugali, stew, cabbage or spinach, and tea. After running, they bathe in streams from Mount Kenya. Richard left the camp with a new appreciation for Kenyan success. It is not just genetics or altitude. The simple lifestyle, hard training, and passion for success are key to Kenya's success in distance running.'"
CAE_7,C1,"**Hit and Miss of Mass Marketing**
Advertising is having a tough time. It's not just because of the recession. Advertising started to drop in 1989, even before the recession hit hard. The problems with advertising are deeper and happening all over the world. Advertising hasn't kept up with economic changes. Advertisers think about big markets and big media, but as more brands and media have appeared, target markets have become smaller. Even big brand campaigns should focus on smaller audiences, but they often don't. This is where advertising has gone wrong.
Think about your shopping habits. When you go to a supermarket, you might buy 30 to 50 items. Many of these won't be advertised brands. You might buy a few advertised brands from the 15,000 products in the store. Over a year, you probably buy only a few hundred brands. For things like cars, you might buy one every three years, and it might be provided by your employer. You don't buy many clothes either, and most aren't advertised brands. Even with things like candy, medicine, and services, you probably don't buy more than 400 different brands a year.
Compare that to the 32,500 branded goods and services advertised. Let's focus on the 9,500 brands that spend more on advertising. The average person buys 400 of those 9,500, and not all because of advertising. That's about 4 percent. So, you could say 96 percent of advertising is wasted, but nobody knows which part. When you watch TV, count how many commercials are for brands you buy or might buy. For most people, it's about 1 in 16 (6 percent), so the other 15 (94 percent) seem wasted.
You might think you're not affected by advertising, but almost everyone thinks that. The truth is, nobody buys most of the brands they see advertised. Waste is part of using media for advertising. Not everyone who sees an ad will buy the product. People notice only a few ads and ignore the rest, so waste can't be avoided. But advertising can still be cost-effective. It reaches many people to find the few who will respond, because advertisers can't know in advance who will be interested.
Media advertising works because it's a cheap way to communicate with many people. However, all waste is unpleasant. With smart targeting, advertisers can reduce waste by reaching more people who will respond, but they can never know exactly who will. Even the best direct mail doesn't get a 100 percent response. This is different from face-to-face selling, where a salesperson might succeed with every client. This can't happen with media. If advertisers knew exactly who would respond, they wouldn't need media. They could contact people directly.
Any advertiser who gains one million new customers (2 percent of the adult population) is doing well. For soap powder, the top brands would be happy with a million extra customers. Any advertising campaign that wins over 2 percent of the population would be very successful. To succeed, advertising needs to target its message more precisely than ever before."
CAE_43,C1,"'Solar Survivor Charles Clover visits Britain's most environmentally-friendly home. Southwell in Nottinghamshire has some surprises. One is Southwell Minster, an ancient cathedral with 'green' men figures carved by medieval craftsmen. Another is Britain's greenest house, the 'autonomous house', designed by Robert and Brenda Vale. The Vales use rainwater for washing and drinking, recycle their sewage into garden compost, and heat their house with waste heat from electrical appliances and their own body heat, along with that of their three teenage children and two cats, Edison and Faraday. The house looks traditional, with a clay tile roof, and is 300 yards from the Minster. It matches the town's old buildings and was approved by planners even though it is in a conservation area. The house is super-insulated, with special windows, so you don't hear any noise inside. Inside, you must take off your shoes, and it feels very quiet. On a sunny day, the conservatory warms the air before it goes into the house. Vale opens ventilation shafts and windows to create airflow because the house is very draught-proof. Even the cats have their own air-locked door. The Vales, who teach architecture at Nottingham University, cared about the environment long before it became a big issue. They wrote a book on green architecture in the 1970s, The Autonomous House. They designed a building that emits no carbon dioxide and decided to do without mains water. They use composting toilets, rainwater tanks, and copper gutters to protect drinking water, which they filter before use. Water from washing goes into the garden. They don't have a dishwasher because they don't want to use strong detergents. 'We wanted to show that it was possible to design a house that is less harmful to the environment, without living in the dark,' says Robert. The house's only medieval aspect is its look: the hall, with the hearth and staircase, is the full height of the building. The Vales pay no water bills. Last winter, the house used only nine units of electricity a day, costing about 70p, which is what other four-bedroom houses use on top of heating. Soon it will use even less when solar panels and equipment are installed in the garden. The house will use electricity from the mains for cooking and appliances but will generate extra electricity. There will even be enough to charge an electric car. The only heating is a small wood-burning stove in the hall, which the Vales say they use only in the very coldest winter. Is it warm in winter? One night in February, Robert was reading and said it was too warm to light the fire. The room temperature was 18C, which is less than usual for living areas, but comfortable because there are no draughts and no heat loss. An Edwardian lady in the early 1900s was comfortable at 12.5C because of her clothing. People in old houses should live like they did then, he suggests. But this idea might not catch on. The house is low-tech, so there is little to go wrong. Most materials were from a builder's merchant and installed by local craftsmen. This made the house cheap to build, costing the same per square metre as low-cost housing for rent. Commercial building companies are not interested in this idea.'"
CAE_51,C1,"'The camera never lies Arthur Conan Doyle, who created the Sherlock Holmes stories, thought he was a logical man, like a scientist. But in 1920, when he saw photos of fairies in a garden, he believed they were real proof that fairies existed. He published the photos with an article he wrote, saying fairies were amazing supernatural things. It wasn't until 1939 that the two women who took the photos admitted they were fake. They had cut out pictures of fairies from a book and placed them among flowers. The photos are very beautiful. But the simple trick shows that a basic idea about photography, that the camera cannot lie, is not true. The camera can lie, and it always could. Today, we use computer software to change our digital photos, and it is not true that photography ever had a time when it was completely honest. From the start, when cameras began capturing reality, that reality was being changed.'"
CAE_11,C1,"'Blacksmiths Throughout history, iron has been very important to people, and those who work with it, called blacksmiths, have been seen as more than just skilled workers. Before the Industrial Revolution, blacksmiths were as respected as doctors and astrologers because they made weapons, armor, and farming tools. They were also celebrated as artists. In the 18th century, blacksmiths created beautiful ironwork for places like St Paul's Cathedral. The flowing metal designs of French and Belgian Art Nouveau buildings were also made by talented blacksmiths. However, by the late 1960s in Britain, blacksmiths were almost gone because heavy industry no longer needed them, and modern buildings rarely used elegant wrought-iron designs. In the past 10 years, there has been a revival due to more interest in decorative architecture and creative interior design. Still, much of the work seems old-fashioned, with gates and balconies often described as 'classical' or 'Victorian-style'. In trendy design stores, you often see rusty candlesticks with decorations. Fortunately, there are new options, and several events in the coming weeks aim to promote blacksmithing. The first event is an exhibition of forged ironwork by members of the British Artist Blacksmiths Association (BABA) at the Fire & Iron gallery in Leatherhead, Surrey. Alan Dawson, BABA's secretary, says, 'We might be starting a new Iron Age because both the public and blacksmiths are seeing things differently.' Power tools have made it easier for blacksmiths to work with metal, allowing them to bend, split, twist, and weld it easily. 'In short,' says Dawson, 'these artists now have a material that lets them express themselves.' About 250 pieces are in the show, from bookends to a spiral staircase. Prices start at £90 and go much higher. Most of the money will go to the makers, but some will support the promotion of good ironwork, says Dawson. His own works include an eight-foot gate and a lamp with a glass shade. 'My style comes from letting steel bend and flow when it's hot. It's like drawing with metal in space,' he says. Many artists are fascinated by iron. Unlike most metals, which are easy to shape when cold, iron and steel are tougher. Susan May, a jeweler, says, 'It's magical because it's very soft when hot, but becomes hard and unmovable when it cools.' Ann Catrin Evans' steel door-knockers and handles look like they belong in horror films. One design is like a ball and chain, another like a Celtic cross. 'I love that steel is cold and hard,' she says. 'And it feels like it will last forever.' No other metal has given people as much visual pleasure or a greater feeling of security. Iron will likely be used decoratively for many years, as long as we avoid more rusty candlesticks.'"
CAE_14,C1,"'THE DAY I STOPPED SMOKING I thought everyone would be happy, but one of my colleagues was very angry. 'What do you mean?' she shouted. 'If it was that easy, why didn't you stop years ago?' I couldn't really explain how one afternoon I was a heavy smoker, and four hours later I wasn't. It even surprised me. The stop-smoking session was a mix of group therapy and hypnotherapy, and it happened exactly two months and three weeks ago. I didn't plan to stop, and I didn't really want to. I didn't like the pressure from people who wanted me to quit smoking - and I still don't. Also, I had low blood pressure and a healthy family. I didn't cough or feel sick and seemed to recover from colds faster than my friends who lived healthier lives. On that normal Thursday afternoon, I went to the Birmingham session of The Easy Way to Stop Smoking to write an article about other people trying to quit. 'I won't try to stop myself, it wouldn't be fair,' I said. 'Since I'm here to write, not to quit, it wouldn't be right to expect your method to work on me.' I thought I was being reasonable. After all, I really enjoyed smoking. It made me happy. I thought the counsellor looked at me knowingly. We were allowed to smoke as much as we wanted, and most of the afternoon was in a room so full of smoke that we had to open the windows. I noticed that when I was told to smoke, I didn't want to - and neither did the others. I guess the stop-smoking messages made sense. Just as smoking had become a challenge because people were against it, the idea of stopping started to feel interesting. The thought of not being a smoker made me feel strong. It was a secret feeling just for me. Could I also conquer the world? In many ways, it was easy. The physical craving for nicotine, like hunger, went away after a minute or two, and I only felt it for four or five days. The one thing I thought would be hardest without cigarettes - my work - wasn't a problem at all. I really believed I couldn't work to deadlines without nicotine and that I would fail to write a story. Surprisingly, spending time at home on weekend mornings was the hardest - and it still is. I think smoking was a way to avoid boredom; having a cigarette was something to do. Yes, I do miss my cigarettes, but not too much. Each 'new' experience as a non-smoker has to be faced - eating out, waiting for a plane, checking into a hotel, a theatre break. All are key moments when I used to smoke.'"
CAE_63,C1,"Dorothy Hodgkin: A Forgotten Scientist
Dorothy Hodgkin is the only British woman scientist to win a Nobel Prize, but not many people in Britain know her name. Georgina Ferry, who is writing Hodgkin's biography, has noticed this. When she tells people about her work, only a few recognize Hodgkin's name.
Why should people know about Dorothy Hodgkin? Winning a Nobel Prize is a big achievement. If she had won in literature, she would be famous. Hodgkin, who passed away in 1994, was an extraordinary person. Her life shows important changes in the 20th century, like the progress of women's education and the spread of science around the world.
When Ferry started her research, she read other scientific biographies. A friend suggested a book about Linus Pauling, a famous chemist and friend of Hodgkin. But she couldn't find it in her local bookshop. This surprised her because Pauling was a very important chemist and won Nobel Prizes in chemistry and peace.
Some people think scientific biographies are boring. Peter Medawar, another Nobel Prize winner, said that scientists' lives are not interesting to read about. This view makes publishers and booksellers less interested in these stories. There is a belief that science and the arts are very different, which affects how scientists are seen in biographies.
However, scientists can have interesting lives, just like artists, writers, or politicians. Some scientists avoid media attention because they don't want to seem self-promoting. But this can give a wrong idea about science and discourage young people from becoming scientists.
Things are changing. Scientists now appear more in public. For example, Richard Dawkins presents TV quiz prizes, and Steve Jones advertises cars. These activities help people see scientists as real people.
The publishing world is also changing. Scientific biographies used to be serious and not very exciting. But books like Richard Feynman's ""Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman?"" show scientists as real people with interesting lives. Now, even famous scientists like Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein are shown with their personal flaws.
Dorothy Hodgkin was dedicated to her work. She solved the structures of penicillin, vitamin B12, and insulin, which won her the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1964. She also had three children and a husband who was often away. Her personal life may not seem important to her work, but it shows how she balanced different parts of her life.
Hodgkin's life is interesting not just for her science but also for how she lived. Scientific inquiry was her passion, and understanding this passion is a challenge for biographers. Many readers don't have the scientific background to understand complex ideas easily. But learning science is not harder than reading Shakespeare or learning a new language; it just takes effort.
It's unfortunate that many educated people don't know about scientists like Dorothy Hodgkin, even though they are part of our rich heritage."
CAE_56,C1,"Margaret and her special skill
Margaret Wilkins has a special skill called a 'sixth sense'. She can find water underground using a forked hazel stick. Many farmers ask for her help when their wells dry up. Margaret and her husband have a business that drills wells. They use machines like drilling rigs and air-compressed hammers. But to find water, Margaret only needs her hazel stick. They are successful more than 90% of the time.
Dowsing is the skill of finding water, minerals, or lost things underground. Some people think it is a 'sixth sense'. There are many ideas about how it works. Some say it is because of magnetism, while others think it is spiritual. One idea is that everything on Earth vibrates, and water vibrates more than other things. Dowsers might be able to feel these vibrations. Some say they can 'sense' water, while others say they can smell it.
The Wilkins have been very busy during recent droughts. At one point, they had a waiting list of almost six weeks. Most of Margaret's customers are farmers with dry wells. She says, 'We usually see customers only once because wells last a long time.' Other customers have remote cottages or barns, now used as holiday homes, where it is too expensive to run water pipes. Some customers are golf-course developers who need water for their clubhouses.
Margaret tries to find water 50 to 70 meters deep. 'You can't drill a well where farm waste might get into the water. The water we find is in cracks in hard rock, and if we bring it straight up, it should be clean. But in Cornwall, you have to watch out for iron.' They also need electricity to run the pump, so the well should be near power supplies.
Margaret starts looking for water with a map and a pendulum on large areas like golf courses. 'I hold the pendulum still and move it over the map. It swings when there is water below.' After finding likely areas on the map, she walks over the fields with her hazel stick. 'When I'm above water, I feel strange and use the stick to find the exact spot to drill.' She holds the stick with both hands and pulls it slightly. 'When water is below, the stick rises. It's important to drill exactly where the stick shows. If you drill in the wrong place, you can miss the water. My husband checks the same area, and we usually agree on where to drill. If we don't agree, we keep looking.'
Margaret is not alone in using this old skill in the west of England. Many people are interested in this mysterious ability. Margaret calls it an 'intuitive perception of the environment'. This might explain why she finds water so well. Without this 'sixth sense', how could her family run their well-drilling business successfully year after year?"

Have you ever thought about swapping lives with someone else for a day? Maybe you think it would be fun to do something different for a change. We arranged this for four people - read about their experiences.
**Amanda's Story**
Amanda, a 23-year-old mother with two daughters, swapped lives with her friend Cindy, who is 30 and works as a waitress in a busy London restaurant.
I had never been in a place like it before. It was so dark and noisy, with many people and a great atmosphere. It was very different from my hometown, and I wasn't sure I would manage! Being a mother is a busy job, but this was something else! I had just fifteen minutes to learn how to carry a tray of drinks with one hand. The other waitresses made it look easy, but as I was getting the hang of it, the drinks fell off the tray and crashed to the floor. I was so embarrassed, but the other waitresses laughed. Everyone makes mistakes at first!
By opening time at 11:30 am, a queue had already formed outside, and I felt nervous. I was worried about remembering all the orders, but everything was automated. After a couple of hours, my feet hurt, and I couldn't get used to the loud music. Every time a customer spoke to me, I had to say 'Pardon?', which was embarrassing! By the end of my shift at 5 pm, I was exhausted and wanted to soak my feet in hot water. I couldn't believe it when one of the waitresses said it had been a 'quiet' day! I never realized how tiring waitressing would be. I've always thought it was a job for shy people, but you need to be friendly and able to handle lots of customers. I'm quite shy, and I don't think I could cope on a busy Saturday night. I wasn't impressed with the pay either. I must have been a bad waitress because even the rich Americans didn't tip me! I was glad to get back to my children. It seems easy after waitressing!
**Cindy's Story**
Cindy was a bit nervous about being a 'mum' for the day, but she was looking forward to it too. She had been warned the girls were cheeky, but she thought she could handle it. Little did she know!
As Amanda left for the restaurant, I had to get the two girls dressed and fed. After dropping off Sophie at school and Katie at nursery, I thought I'd have three hours of peace. Wrong! A note from Amanda reminded me to make the beds, clean the house, and do the washing. At 1 pm, I picked up Katie, went to the supermarket, and then took her home for lunch. But when I brought Sophie home from school, the real trouble started. They turned the sofa into a trampoline and screamed loudly! I thought they'd get tired soon. Wrong again. I thought I had a lot of energy, but they beat me! After much persuasion, I got them into bed by 8 pm, but then the fun started! How many glasses of water can a child drink? I knew it was just a trick to come downstairs and watch TV, but it was exhausting to spend all evening negotiating with them. I never realized how tiring it could be looking after two small children. You don't get a second to think about yourself, and the responsibility is overwhelming. Even so, I really enjoyed the day.
**Rosemary's Story**
Rosemary, 42, runs a dairy farm. She swapped with Hilary, 30, a teacher at a primary school.
On the farm, I have to get up at 5:30 am, so sleeping until 7 was a luxury! But I worried about how to look. I couldn't turn up in overalls and boots, could I? Looking at about 400 pupils at assembly, I hoped I blended in and didn't stand out as being from the farm. After that, it was time for a maths class. The children worked in small groups, using workcards graded by difficulty - different from when I was at school! Then I helped with a nature project - identifying and feeding snails. By lunchtime, I was exhausted and looking forward to a break, but teachers only have about five minutes to eat. There's so much to do before classes start again. I attended a staff meeting and helped with athletics trials. After lunch, there was a silent reading lesson (bliss!) and then a French lesson. This was fun because the children wanted to practice on me, which showed my rusty French. Finally, we went to the school hall for Physical Education. I was drained, but the children had endless energy. The hardest part was speaking in front of the class. Teachers may get more holidays, but I think I'll stick to farming!
**Hilary's Story**
Hilary arrived at White House Farm at 8:30 am, only to find Rosemary had been up for three hours! Rosemary's 280-acre farm has 100 Jersey cows, 15 calves, and about 800 ewes. She also makes ice-cream, yoghurt, and cream, which is sold in shops and restaurants.
I spent most of the morning in the ice-cream parlour, bottling milk, squeezing ice-cream into cartons, and sticking on labels. It was hard not to taste the goodies! At lunchtime, it was time to check the sheep. I drove to a field and picked up a ewe that had fallen over. If sheep are left for more than 12 hours once they fall, they could die, so they have to be checked every day. What a nightmare it must be in winter! After feeding the calves, I started the milking. It took two-and-a-half hours. And Rosemary does this twice a day, starting at 6 am, seven days a week, 365 days a year! I found it quite lonely. I missed the children - animals don't talk back! The worst part is not being able to get away from work. The cows always have to be milked, so it's hard to plan time off. Rosemary will only get about three days' holiday this year. Farming seems romantic, but the reality is different. The income is irregular, and I'd hate to depend on the weather."
CAE_6,C1,"'A trumpet isn't just for Christmas... It is interesting how many musicians come from homes without music. Hakan Hardenberger, the only son of parents who didn't play music, grew up in a country area of southern Sweden. At 30, he is now one of the world's top trumpet players. His records include not only concertos by old composers but also new works. When you meet him, he looks young and friendly, just like the sound of the trumpet. Recently, he played the Hummel Trumpet Concerto in one of London's top concert halls, and a TV show talked about his work and growth, filmed in both London and Sweden. Born near Malmo, his career started with a Christmas gift when he was eight. His father, who liked Louis Armstrong, decided to give him a real trumpet, not a toy. The gift was a success, and Hakan never stopped playing. His mother found a teacher for him, the second trumpet player in the Malmo Symphony Orchestra, Bo Nilsson. Nilsson saw Hakan's talent right away. Hardenberger is grateful to have had such a teacher who loved the trumpet and was always looking for new ways to play it. Hardenberger explains that the trumpet is not a perfect instrument, and each one has its flaws. He believes in understanding these flaws and working with them. From the start, he had a special sound, which he developed as a child. Unlike John Wallace, a famous British trumpet player who started in brass bands, Hardenberger always saw himself as a solo artist. He admired the French trumpeter Maurice Andre and collected all his records. His parents supported his dream to become a professional trumpet player. At 15, he needed to decide where to study. America was too far and dangerous, so he went to Paris at 16 to study with Pierre Thibaud. Thibaud advised against joining an orchestra, comparing it to gardening. Hardenberger knew he played better than others his age, but it was during a competition in Paris at 17 that he realized he had a special gift for connecting with people. Thibaud suggested he enter the competition for experience. He learned the pieces for the first round and advanced to the second. He knew most of the pieces in that round too, but in the final, he faced a difficult concerto. He didn't win first prize, but he enjoyed performing and realized people listened to him even if he thought he didn't play well. Hardenberger is realistic about his work and career. He doesn't try to explain his gift for communication, as he believes it might ruin it. He thinks the power of music is in its ability to move people.'"

""I wake up at 6:30 am, go to the gym at 7 am, and start work by 8 am. I begin operating at 8:30 am. I operate all day on Monday and Wednesday, and sometimes on Friday afternoons. Most head operations take three hours, but some can last all day. I've worked ten hours straight without eating or using the bathroom. Deciding when and how to operate can be stressful. I don't feel stressed while operating, but I do worry about the next day's plans. Brain surgery is often a last option for patients, but when it works, it's amazing and makes up for the times it doesn't. From 10 am to 1 pm, I have an out-patients' clinic where I explain the operations. I enjoy talking to patients, but time pressure can make it hard to comfort them if they are upset. I leave work between 6 pm and 8 pm. Some nights and weekends, I'm on call and always carry my pager. On holidays, I worry for the first three days about my patients, and I dream about operating.

We work in teams. My team has three senior designers, a company partner, and a junior designer. The work is mostly production, with only ten to fifteen percent design. I get a brief from the client, and then spend three or four weeks designing and developing the project. After presenting my ideas to the client and getting approval, we work on estimates and budgets. I start hiring photographers and illustrators, and I work with printers to meet job needs on time. I spend a lot of time managing people and need to communicate well with them. When their work is done, I assemble everything and send it to the printers. Managing several jobs at once can be very stressful. Deadlines are always near, and no day is the same. Lunch is at 1 pm for an hour, and we try to go to the pub. Otherwise, I have sandwiches and work through. It's great when the client likes the designs, but disappointing if the job is rejected.

""I usually get up at 7 am, but two or three times a week, I meet a long-haul flight and get up between 4:30 am and 5 am. At 10:30 or 11 am, I might go for a bike ride or swim. Because driving is a sitting job, I have to watch my diet and exercise. I usually have a big breakfast and just snacks during the day. People often ask me to recommend places, so I need to know my way around. Many jobs are pre-booked, so I can check routes beforehand. Not everyone is polite. Some passengers are rude, but most are well-behaved, and I have a good relationship with regular clients. Sometimes I hear conversations in the car and have to focus on driving. The press has tried to make me talk about clients, but I won't. I work seven days a week, up to fifteen hours a day. I have to be careful not to get too tired. I try to go to bed by 11 pm.""
**D. THE LANDSCAPE GARDENER**
**Name:** Tracy  
**Age:** 27  
**TRACY'S DAY**  
""I get up at 7 am, leave home at 7:30 am, and go to my first job. My assistant and I mostly maintain gardens we designed. We do some commercial jobs, but mostly private gardens. We spend about an hour and a half at each house. At 11 am, we get hungry and go to a cafe for breakfast. In summer, I may work until 10 pm; in winter, until 4:30 pm. The business office is at home, so when I return, I check messages and return calls. If someone wants their garden landscaped, I arrange a consultation in the evening. We use old materials and unusual plants to make gardens look old. Sometimes people have specific ideas that aren't great. It's satisfying to see a garden finished and blooming. It's hard to relax in the evenings because I can hear the business phone. I never have trouble sleeping because the work is physical, and I'm always tired. I'm not very strong, but I'm fit. It's a tough job, but it lets your imagination run wild.""

**ZENA'S DAY**  
""I arrive at the site by 8:30 am. I'm the assistant resident engineer, looking after the building of bridges and a wall to prevent cars from driving into a quarry. I check that contractors follow the schedule and safety rules with minimal environmental impact. I help coordinate site professionals and solve problems. Contractors start at 6 am, so my first task is to find out from the clerk of works what's happened since I left. The rest of the day depends on what he tells me. There's usually paperwork or design questions to answer. Lunch is usually for half an hour between 2 pm and 2:30 pm, but I eat as I go. When contractors are on break, it's easier to check the site. Checking their work can cause conflict, so we need an open relationship. I see the duty resident engineer once a day, but if something important comes up, I act immediately. I usually leave the site at about 6 pm and I'm on call all the time."""
CAE_40,C1,"**Careers: Six People Talk About Their Typical Working Day**
**A. Credit Card Executive**
I wake up at 6 am and get to the office by 7.30 am. I manage customer programs for our regular credit card users. My job includes launching and managing the Membership Rewards scheme in Europe. I keep in touch with current card users, find new ones, and build relationships with partner companies. I spend the first 45 minutes organizing my day and answering emails. I handle all advertising for the membership program in Europe, so I meet with marketing staff and advertising agencies to plan strategies. I have meetings most of the day, but I keep my door open for questions. I travel to different markets in Europe once or twice a week. When I'm in London, I leave work between 6.30 pm and 7.00 pm.
**B. Record Company Executive**
I start work at 10.00 am and go through the mail, which includes demo tapes, letters, and invoices. The phone starts ringing at 10.30 am with calls from producers and publishers. I have meetings throughout the day about campaigns or projects for artists. When I listen to demo tapes, I try to be constructive. I know if the sound fits our record label. After signing a band, we work on the first album, choosing songs and producers. I share my vision of the album with the company for marketing. I also manage budgets. I leave work at 7.00 pm and often go to gigs, sometimes seeing up to five new groups a night. I might visit an artist in the studio after a gig. I usually get home by 1.00 am and listen to a record to relax.
**C. Sales Director**
I get up at 8.00 am and arrive at work by 9.30 am. I check the diary for client visits and enjoy showing people around the showrooms. We sell antiques from £1,000 to £6,000 and buy from various sources. Many items need restoration, so I work with restorers and repairers. I read the Antiques Trade Gazette to stay updated and visit the Victoria and Albert Museum to compare furniture. I do the accounts monthly and tax returns every three months. I go home at 5.30 pm and take about an hour to relax.
**D. Air Traffic Controller**
I work in shifts and leave home at 6.00 am for early shifts. At 7.00 am, I take over one of the four control positions in the tower. We rotate stations, working for about an hour and a half, then taking a break. We control aircraft movements as a team. In winter, we handle about 1,000 movements a day, more in summer. Night shifts are quieter, allowing time to read up on new requirements. It's important to be alert, so I take sick leave if needed. The job is stressful, and it takes time to relax after a shift. I hope to become a watch manager and maybe a general manager.
**E. Shop Manager**
If I have an early shift, I leave home by 8.00 am. I start by setting up the electronic sales system. I ensure someone watches the till and coordinate breaks. I help customers find and order books. I enjoy serving customers, though it can be annoying if they expect too much. Between 2.00 pm and 4.00 pm, publishers' reps visit, and I discuss new titles. I decide how many copies to order. If we feature a new title, I ensure timely delivery. The early shift ends at 5.45 pm. I work late shifts twice a week, closing the shop and going home.
**F. Financial Analyst**
I listen to the news at 7.00 am, then take a taxi to work by 8.45 am. I contact freelance reporters to learn about my region. I assess financial risks for companies abroad, warning clients of potential issues. I provide three services: an online executive preview, a security forecast, and a travel information guide. From 9.15 am to 9.30 am, I meet with editors to discuss stories. My first preview is due by 10.00 am, and the second by 11.00 am, so I work quickly. I type stories, send them to my editor, and make changes before they go online. I travel to Africa about three times a year to report on events. I leave work around 6.00 pm, but it's hard to relax, and I'm often awake until 1.00 am."
CAE_45,C1,"**Career Power: Take Control at Work**
A. **What Makes a Good Leader?**
A good leader inspires others and brings change. Leadership is not about being tall or very smart. Pat Dixon, who wrote ""Making the Difference: Women and Men in the Workplace,"" says leadership is about making things happen with people who are as excited as you are. Enthusiasm is important, and a good leader should speak clearly and confidently. Dixon says, ""It's having the confidence to say 'I believe' instead of 'I think.'""
B. **Discovering Leadership Potential**
John van Maurik, a director of a Leadership in Management course, believes many people have more leadership potential than they know. Becoming a leader means recognizing and developing these hidden talents. We are all born with some leadership ability, but we need the right situations to grow. While it's easy to see leadership in famous people like Emmeline Pankhurst or Mahatma Gandhi, it can be harder to see it in our own workplace. Yet, leadership is very important for good management.
C. **Comparing Leaders and Managers**
Think about the best and worst boss you've had. They might have been good at setting goals and meeting deadlines. But how did they do it? The best leader motivated and supported you. The worst made you feel unimportant and blamed you when things went wrong. The first was a good leader; the second was a poor manager.
D. **Leaders vs. Managers**
Leaders and managers are different. Managers like working within set rules. Leaders create new paths. Michael Shea, author of ""Leadership Rules,"" says a good manager can keep a company running, but a good leader can change a struggling organization, whether it's a company, a sports team, or a country.
E. **Improving Leadership Skills**
Whether you're a boss or a middle manager, you can improve your leadership skills. Here are some tips:
- Leadership is best when you choose to do it. Find what you are passionate about. When you feel inspired, use that energy to lead.
- Think of yourself as a leader. Recognize your ability to lead.
- Sometimes you need to lead firmly. Try different styles. If you usually ask for others' opinions, try taking the lead. See how this changes the results.
- Set goals and try to beat them. Look at your job and find where leadership can improve your effectiveness and career.
F. **Developing Leadership**
- Leadership develops by taking the lead, taking risks, and learning from mistakes. Learn to delegate, motivate, organize, and praise.
- Your way of leading might not win over everyone. Keep improving your communication skills. You don't have to be liked, but your ideas should be.
- Be visible and accessible to important people. Remember, you don't have to lead all the time. Know where your contribution is important and help others become leaders too."
CAE_64,C1,"'Films on video Film critic Nick James reviews some recent releases A Abyss Before Titanic, director James Cameron made this intense Cold War thriller about oil rig workers and navy experts trying to rescue a nuclear submarine deep underwater. The bravery of foreman Bud and his team reminds us of heroes in movies by Howard Hawks. The production design and special effects are very impressive. However, the dialogue and characters are not as strong. Despite the skilled film-making, the story is like a B-movie. B The Thin Red Line This video release of the James Jones novel about the battle for Guadalcanal, directed by Andrew Marton, is interesting compared to Terrence Malick's new film. While Malick's version is mystical and poetic, Marton made a more traditional war movie, which is often closer to the book. He focused on one soldier and his tough sergeant. Malick's film is richer and more complex, but Marton's version has its good moments. The flashback scene, where the soldier dreams of his wife, is done with a harshness that might work better than Malick's soft-focus images. C On Guard Loosely based on Paul Feval's 1875 novel, this entertaining swashbuckler is better than most musketeer adventures. It has a great villain in Fabrice Luchini's sneaky politician, causing chaos behind the scenes. Vincent Perez is a lively hero, and while Daniel Auteuil might be too serious for this fun film, he also has his moments as an acrobat-turned-swordsman. The filmmakers use costume-drama clichés with so much wit and energy that it doesn't matter. D Character A beautiful but serious story, set in early 1900s Rotterdam. The detailed production and costume design make the film look like a museum piece. Jan Decleir is very gloomy as the harsh bailiff Dreverhaven, who is ruthless when evicting tenants. His difficult relationship with his son is central to the story, but the filmmakers seem too focused on the period details to fully explore this dark tale. E The Good, the Bad and the Ugly This digitally re-mastered video shows director Leone's skill at its best. The sound editing is excellent, with every footstep and dog bark clear. The storytelling is harsh, and whenever there's a pause, Morricone's great music makes the heart race. Morally, there isn't much difference between the good (Clint Eastwood), the bad (Lee van Cleef), and the ugly (Eli Wallach), as they all seem equally ruthless in the post-Civil War West. F The Longest Day 'Forty-eight international stars' says the publicity for this three-hour Darryl Zanuck war epic. With four directors and 23,000 extras, this film is overdone. The early scenes, where soldiers wait for the invasion, are slow for both the audience and the soldiers. On a logistical level, this is impressive, but it needs the big screen. On video, it is a lesser experience.'"

CAE_57,C1,"'I might be too old for this adventure, but here I go! At 34, Tim Pozzi has left a good job to go backpacking. He thinks about why he and others his age decide to take this big step. This summer, I quit my job, decided to rent out my apartment, and travel in Southeast Asia for a year. You might think I'm lucky, but I'm 34 years old, and I'm nervous. It's not like I haven't traveled before. After university, I spent two years backpacking around North and South America. When I came back, I wanted to do it again someday. But you know how life goes... I fell in love, started a career, bought an apartment, and got used to earning a salary. But I slowly realized I was giving up my own happiness for my salary. When I quit my job, it felt like I was in control of my life again. I now have no ties. Many of my friends are married with children, and while they wouldn't trade places with me, they envy my lack of responsibilities. I'm not in a relationship, and I have no big career goals. I feel like I should make the most of this freedom - even for my friends' sake! Why am I so nervous? First, it's about making the necessary plans. How could I let someone else live in my home? And how would I organize the rental? And besides, I had to decide where to go. I'm a terrible procrastinator and am already weeks behind my plan. 'Might as well enjoy the summer in England,' I told myself. Then, 'Why not stay for the start of the football season?' Cutting emotional ties makes it even harder. I'm delaying because, deep down, I wonder if I can still handle backpacking. Will I be able to adjust to a simpler way of life? Will I feel out of place among young backpackers just out of school and university? Maybe not. I've found it's more common for Britons in their late twenties and thirties to want to leave their lives and travel to foreign places. Jennifer Cox, from Lonely Planet guidebooks, says more people realize they can have adventures if they are brave, organized, and confident enough. For Danny, a 30-year-old accountant, and his girlfriend Tammy, a 28-year-old teacher, it's a chance to have one last adventure before settling down. They bought a round-the-world ticket for a year. 'I'm ready to give up job security for the trip,' says Danny. 'There's always a thought that, ""OK, I'm not moving up the career ladder, I'll be in the same position when I come back,"" but I think it's a risk worth taking. When I left the office, I threw my calculator into the river as a sign of defiance!' For Matt, who just left the Army, the year he spent traveling was a time of change. 'In the military, there's a set way of doing things. I went away because I needed to change this and have a normal life as a civilian.' While there are many reasons to travel at my age, there seem to be common factors. 'We have a more flexible workforce today,' says Angela Baron from the Institute of Personnel Development. 'More people work on short-term contracts, so if your contract ends, you've got nothing to lose.' Big companies are even allowing career breaks. 'If you've spent a lot of time and money training someone, it's nice to know they're coming back rather than going to a competitor.' For Dan Hiscocks, managing director of Travellerseye, a company that shares stories of 'ordinary' travelers, more people in their thirties are thinking about their lives. 'If you're not happy with what you're doing - and many people aren't - it's no longer about just sticking with it. Now people know there are opportunities and that a job isn't ""for life"" anymore. Travel offers a chance to rethink and consider your life.' Is giving in to wanderlust just another example of my generation's struggle with adulthood? Jennifer Cox thinks not. 'It's a sign of a better-educated, more stable society when we're less worried about paying bills and more about living a balanced life. We're actually taking the time to ask ""Is this what I want?"" Ben, a 32-year-old picture researcher going to Central America for a year, doesn't believe he's running away. 'It's more about running towards something. It's trying to get things I want for myself.' But he does feel some fear. 'It's the thought of what I'm leaving behind, that comfortable routine - just going into the office every day, saying ""hi"" to everyone, and sitting down with a cup of coffee.' I share Ben's worries about leaving behind an ordered life with few challenges, and I'm not sure I'd be making this journey if I hadn't found my boss so difficult. As Jennifer Cox points out: 'This is common. There's often a trigger, like a breakup or losing a job. Such an event can push people to go and do it.' It may have taken a push to get me moving, but I'm now looking forward to the next 12 months with growing excitement. Whatever happens, I'll be happy to have taken control of my life. And in that, I'm sure I speak for all of us older backpackers.'"
CAE_42,C1,"'Plugging in the home Georgina McGuiness had taken a long break from journalism and felt out of touch with technology. She shares how she turned her home into a workplace. The Christmas before last, I turned 37 and realized I needed to restart my journalism career. My resume showed I was stuck in the 1980s, when typewriters were the latest technology. I felt like no one would hire me because I didn't know how to use a computer or desktop publishing. I was afraid of technology; even pocket calculators confused me. I knew I had to act fast to save my career. Then, I entered a competition in a local newspaper and won a computer package for my family. We got a laptop for my husband and a personal computer for everyone. We quickly learned about the Internet and started chatting with people around the world. The children stopped watching TV, and I set up a small office in the kitchen with a phone, fax machine, CD-ROM, and modem. I could work from home and still take the kids to school. The children were comfortable with computers because they used them at school. I was more cautious, worried I would lose my work by pressing the wrong button. But I learned the basics, and it was easier than I thought. I started freelancing for a magazine, writing two articles a month. The computer helped me become organized, especially with office tasks. Spreadsheets keep track of income and expenses, and pre-made invoices save time. For a journalist, the Internet is great for research and connecting with others. But working from home can be lonely, and there are distractions. Sometimes, we argue over who gets to use the computer. Many people now buy multimedia PCs for education and entertainment. In my neighborhood, more people work from home to avoid commuting. A report on PC usage in UK homes says the average computer user is 38, well-educated, and owns a personal computer. I feel ahead of the game. Maybe one day, I'll email a column to a newspaper in Melbourne or publish my own magazine from home. The possibilities are endless.'"
CAE_59,C1,"**The Tartan Museum**
The new Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh has modern buildings that look very different from the old city around them. Sally Varlow visited the museum just before it opened to see if the inside was as interesting as the outside.
The museum is easy to find. It stands out on Chambers Street with its big, yellow sandstone tower and unique building shape. Last winter, people had mixed feelings about the building's design. Some loved it, calling it a 'masterpiece', while others were not so sure. Now, as the museum is about to open, the exhibitions inside are getting similar reactions.
The museum tells many stories about Scotland's history. It has important objects like Mary Queen of Scots' jewels and silver from Holyrood chapel. The museum does not just focus on national pride but aims to be interesting enough for people to visit again. Dr. David Clarke, who is in charge of the exhibitions, wants the museum to be enjoyable for everyone, not just experts. He believes in showing the truth about history, so there are no fake scenes or imagined stories.
The museum uses explanation panels, captions, and some computers to tell the stories of the objects. It is not clear yet if this will be enough to make the stories exciting. Inside, the museum has different galleries with pale walls and big display cases. There is plenty of light and space to enjoy each item.
The museum also has a Discovery Centre for children, thanks to a group of 9- to 12-year-olds from all over Scotland. They wanted to ride through the displays, but instead, they got a special hands-on area for kids.
On the top floor, there is a Twentieth Century gallery. It shows objects that people in Scotland think were important in the last century, like an electric guitar and televisions. This gallery will change every three years. Some people think it is not serious enough, but it might seem better when the computer display of personal stories starts next week.
Dr. Clarke believes that objects help us understand the past better than anything else. The modern building design works well inside, but some people are not sure if it fits with the old city around it."
CAE_54,C1,"'The end of print may take some time Peter Preston Transition. It's a nice word and a calming idea. Change can scare some people and challenge others. But transition means moving smoothly from the present to the future. Unless, that is, it is newspapers' 'transition' to the online world, which is uncertain and uncomfortable - because it might not be a process at all. But surely (you say) it will happen eventually. Everyone knows that print newspaper sales are dropping while visits to their websites are increasing. Just look at the latest print circulation numbers. The Daily Telegraph, The Guardian, and many others are down between 8% and 10% year-on-year, but their websites are growing. This may be true, depending on timing, age groups, location, and more. After all, everyone - from web experts to print analysts - says so. Yet pause for a moment and notice a few things that don't quite fit. If sales in that area have fallen so little, maybe the crisis mostly affects newspapers? Yet again, the messages are mixed. The latest survey by the World Association of Newspapers shows that global circulation rose 1.1% last year (to 512 million copies a day). Sales in the West dropped, but Asia more than made up the difference. As for news and current affairs magazines - which you'd expect to be hit by digital changes - they had a 5.4% increase. In short, on both sides of the Atlantic, although some magazine areas went down, many showed rapid growth. You can see a similar trend with books. Kindle and similar e-readers are booming, with sales up a lot this year. The first step of transition seems clear. Yet, when booksellers looked at the value of the physical books they sold over the last six months, they found it just 0.4% down. Screen or paper, then? It wasn't one or the other: it was both. Stories about young people stopping reading newspapers are greatly exaggerated. Look at the latest National Readership Survey figures and you'll find nearly 5,000,000 people aged between 15 and 35 reading the main national dailies. And even within Europe, different countries have different stories. There's Britain, with a 10.8% drop in recent years (and a 19.6% fall for quality papers), but in Germany, the decline has only been 7% overall - with just 0.8% lost to quality titles. And France shows only a 3.1% fall (0.8% at the quality end of the market). These different national trends may show a situation more complicated than the digital revolution experts think. America's media analysts used to say that growing online advertising revenues would pay for change and, along with lower production costs, make online newspapers a success. But now, with digital ads on newspaper sites actually dropping, such ideas seem outdated. Already 360 US papers - including most of the biggest and best - have built paywalls around their products. However, the best way to attract paying readers seems to be a deal that offers the print copy and digital access together. In other words, print is also important in selling internet subscriptions. And its advertising rates bring in nine to ten times more money than online. Of course, this big difference isn't good news for newspaper companies, as keeping both an active website and an active print edition is difficult, complex, and expensive. But newspaper brands still have much of their high profile in print; on the web, just being noticed is much harder.'"
CAE_32,C1,"**Photographing People**
People are very interesting to photograph. A picture with a person in it is usually more interesting than one without. However, taking good photos of people can be hard. The photographer needs to think about actions, gestures, and expressions. Sometimes, the camera can make people act differently.
**A. GROUPING PEOPLE**
When taking group photos, avoid straight lines. Ask people to stand at different angles and distances. Some can sit or kneel in front so you can see all faces, or you can take the photo from a higher position.
**B. POSING FOR PICTURES**
People often act unnaturally in front of a camera. They might become stiff. Help them relax by suggesting they fold their hands or put them in their pockets.
**C. THE RIGHT APPROACH**
Don't pretend you are not taking a picture. This can make people uncomfortable. Most people will agree to be photographed, even if they protest at first. They might become self-conscious, so you may need to guide them. Make sure they are not looking aimlessly out of the picture.
**D. EYE CONTACT**
A photo is more powerful if the person looks at the viewer. Ask them to look into the lens. They don't have to smile. Remind them just before you take the picture. You can also say something funny to get a natural reaction.
**E. CANDID CONCENTRATION**
Instead of direct eye contact, the person can focus on something in the picture. This can make them feel more comfortable, and the viewer can see what they are looking at. Candid shots are interesting, and the expression is important.
**F. EXPRESSIONS AND GESTURES**
Expressions and gestures tell us a lot about the person in the photo. A laughing child makes us smile, while a sad face makes us feel sympathy. Look for familiar expressions like shrugs, winks, or thumbs-up. They are a visual language.
**G. SITUATION INTEREST**
Photos with a clear background can be very impactful. The background can add interest and information about the person. Try to remove details that are not important or blur them. Make sure the background does not overpower the subject.
**H. INTERACTION**
When people are talking, arguing, or working together, there are chances for good photos. Couples, mothers and babies, or teams can make great pictures. Look for eye contact or physical contact, like a handshake. Capture how one person reacts to another.
**I. PEOPLE AND PLACES**
Many photos of people are taken on holiday to show the places they visit. To show people with a background, use a standard or wide-angle lens. Move back to include the whole scene. Ask people to stand close to the camera. A slightly higher camera position can help. A good photo balances the people and the place.
**J. TO POSE OR NOT TO POSE?**
Decide why you want to take the picture. If you want to remember someone, ask them to pose with a nice background. Family photos can be boring if they are all formal poses. Candid photos of events are more lively. A spontaneous picture can bring back memories better than a posed one."
CAE_65,C1,"**Under Sarah's Spell**
Sarah Janson is an artist who creates trompe-l'oeil paintings. These paintings trick the eye into seeing something that looks real. In this interview with Joanna Watt, Sarah talks about her work and her views on art.
Sarah Janson is different from many artists because she doesn't sign her work unless someone asks her to. She believes the artwork is more important than the artist. Sarah is very humble and sometimes acts like her paintings create themselves. This makes her a bit shy during interviews. She doesn't like talking about herself and feels embarrassed when asked to be photographed.
Sarah's living room is in a building with other artists' studios in London. It is full of paintings and drawings. Once she feels comfortable, the interview becomes fun and interesting. Sarah has been a trompe-l'oeil artist for sixteen years. She studied drawing for two years at art school, got a degree in graphic illustration, and worked at a publishing house. However, she wasn't satisfied with illustration and started working with a decorator named Jim Smart. He asked her to create a trompe-l'oeil, and she loved it. She decided to start her own business, even though she wasn't sure where it would lead.
Sarah's skills in observation and detail, learned from illustrating, are important for trompe-l'oeil art. She believes that no one can teach you trompe-l'oeil; it's about observing life. She says she is still learning and thinks that if you believe you have mastered something, it's time to stop. Sarah is honest about her weaknesses, like her difficulty in painting bread, which she says looks like grey concrete. She also struggles with math, which was a challenge when she worked on a large project for a chapel ceiling.
Sarah often talks about her work as if someone else did it. Her trompe-l'oeil art is very special and stands out from others. She has done many important projects for companies and private clients. Her work is often inspired by architecture. For example, she painted a dining room to look like a Venetian palace and created a painting that makes a hallway look like it leads to more rooms.
Trompe-l'oeil art can lose its appeal once people understand the trick, but Sarah knows how to keep it interesting. She believes the art should be clever and personal to the client. She enjoys working with clients and getting ideas from them. Some clients know what they want, while others need more help. Sarah listens to them and tries to understand their imagination. Many clients become her friends because she spends a lot of time with them while working.
Sarah appreciates her clients and is thankful for those who trust her with their walls. They are happy with her work, which keeps her busy, even though she doesn't like to boast about her talent. She says, ""I really don't like to shout about myself."" But her work is impressive and deserves more attention."

They are not about doing well in exams. Instead, they focus on social skills and personal qualities like initiative, empathy, adaptability, and persuasiveness. These are called emotional intelligence.
**B** Today, job security is not guaranteed, and 'portable skills' are important. Personal qualities are becoming more important at work. Emotional intelligence is the ability to understand and manage your own and others' feelings. It includes self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills. It's not just about 'being nice'. Sometimes it means telling someone the hard truth. It also means managing feelings so people can work well together.
**C** Many businesses now see emotional intelligence as important for management. The more complex the job, the more emotional intelligence matters. Some people succeed without it, but as work becomes more team-based, companies that work well together have an advantage. Emotional intelligence is becoming essential for success in every job around the world.
**D** Unlike IQ, which changes little, emotional intelligence can grow as we learn from life. Studies show people get better at handling emotions, motivating themselves, and understanding others. This growth is called maturity. Emotional intelligence can be learned and is important for job stability. It is not a magic solution for business success, but ignoring it can make other things less effective."
CAE_52,C1,"'Should the media make money from content they don't own? Digital cameras and camera phones have made it easier to take pictures of important events. Social media has changed how people share these photos. Now, news often appears first on social networks, and some journalists use these images for fast-moving stories. Unfortunately, some reporters have used these photos without asking for permission. There is a rule that says images on social media can be used without permission if there is a very good reason or strong public interest, but people still argue about whether this is right. Research shows that about one in ten people would film or take pictures of a news event. This means that user-generated content (UGC) is important for the future of the media. However, to keep a good relationship with the public, the media must make sure people are paid for their work and always ask for permission.'"
CAE_28,C1,"**Ancient Chinese Medicine in the West**
**Acupuncture: A 2,000-Year-Old Practice**
Acupuncture is an ancient Chinese medical practice that is 2,000 years old. It is part of traditional Chinese medicine, which also includes herbal medicine, massage, diet, and exercise. Acupuncture is used to treat many conditions, but it is most known in the West for helping with pain. Some doctors, midwives, and physiotherapists use it regularly for pain relief.
**A. Understanding Acupuncture**
Traditional Chinese medicine believes that health is when the energy of the mind, body, and spirit are balanced. This energy, called Qi (pronounced ""chee""), flows through the body along paths called meridians. There are twelve main meridians, each connected to an internal organ. If the flow of Qi is blocked or weak, the body can become unbalanced, leading to illness. An acupuncturist will try to find where the Qi is imbalanced by checking your pulse, looking at your tongue, and asking about your health and lifestyle. They use fine needles inserted into the skin to help the flow of Qi. They might also use warmth or pressure on certain points.
**B. Acupuncture Points**
The points used in acupuncture are related to meridians and may not be near the area of pain. People often feel a dull ache or tingling when the needle is used. This can be done by hand or with an electro-acupuncture machine. Acupuncturists say this feeling shows the needle has reached the Qi. There are over 300 main points on the meridians, with many more used less often.
**C. Scientific Explanations**
Even without accepting traditional Chinese medicine, Western doctors agree that acupuncture can help with pain. They have scientific ideas about how it works. For example, stimulating certain nerves might block pain signals from reaching the brain. Some scientists think acupuncture releases natural pain-relieving chemicals called endorphins.
**D. Types of Pain Treated**
Many people with long-term pain try acupuncture when other treatments do not work. It is commonly used for back pain, sports injuries, arthritis, headaches, migraines, and pain after surgery. Acupuncturists also claim to treat menstrual pain, facial nerve pain, and pain in terminally ill patients.
**E. Modern Use of Acupuncture**
Although acupuncture has been used in China for over 2,000 years, using it instead of anesthesia during surgery began in the 1950s. This convinced some Western doctors that acupuncture is more than just a mental effect. In China, acupuncture is used in many surgeries, including heart surgery. It can be used alone, with electrical stimulation, or with drugs. It is said to reduce pain, but this varies from person to person. Acupuncture anesthesia does not have the side effects of regular anesthesia, like nausea, and recovery is quicker.
**F. Effectiveness of Acupuncture**
Clinical trials for acupuncture are hard to conduct, but some show that 50 to 80 percent of people find it effective for chronic pain. Acupuncturists agree with this success rate but know it does not work for everyone. For long-term pain, it usually takes six to seven visits to feel relief, but some improvement should be felt after two or three visits.
**G. A Different View on Pain**
Western and Chinese medicine see pain differently. Acupuncturists look at the whole person, not just symptoms. They spend time diagnosing and finding weaknesses in the Qi. They also consider external factors like weather and the type of pain. This approach is different from most Western doctors.
**H. Choosing an Acupuncturist**
Some medical professionals have traditional acupuncture training, while others use scientific explanations. Traditional acupuncturists believe that only traditional Chinese medicine can lead to deep, long-lasting changes. It is important to choose a qualified acupuncturist who will refer you to a doctor if needed."
CAE_35,C1,"P.D. James is a famous crime writer. Her full name is Phyllis Dorothy James. She seems calm and confident, like she could be the head of a girls' school. But she is actually shy. She says that Adam Dalgliesh, the detective in her books, is like her, or how she would be if she were a man. Dalgliesh likes to solve crimes alone, just like P.D. James likes to write alone. She needs privacy to write. 
P.D. James is very popular, but she is modest and does not call herself Britain's best crime writer. She has written 12 detective novels that are loved by many people around the world. She enjoys reading books by her friend Ruth Rendell, who writes under the name Barbara Vine. She also likes books by women writers like Iris Murdoch and Anita Brookner, and male authors like Graham Greene and Evelyn Waugh.
P.D. James became successful later in life. She was 42 when her first crime novel, ""Cover Her Face,"" was published. She was born in Oxford and grew up in Cambridge. She met her husband there, who was a student at the university. Her husband, Connor Bantry White, was an Irish doctor who came back from World War II very sick. She had to work hard to support him and their two daughters, Clare and Jane. Her husband's parents helped take care of the children during those tough times.
She worked full-time for the National Health Service and later at the Home Office. She worked in the Police Department and the Criminal Law section. While working in forensic science, she got used to seeing dead bodies. But she was not interested in death itself. She liked the challenge of writing a crime novel. She always wanted to be a writer and enjoyed reading detective stories.
P.D. James did not want to use her own life's difficult events in her books. Writing detective stories was a way to learn to be a serious novelist. She believes that solving a crime in a story shows the importance of life, even if the person was not well-liked. She says, ""Nobody really likes violence."""
CAE_5,C1,"**The Pen is Mightier than the Psychoanalyst**
The study of handwriting to understand a person's character is becoming more popular. In some countries, if you apply for a job, you might be asked for a sample of your handwriting. Your handwriting could help decide if you are right for the job. Handwriting analysis, or graphology, is seen as a real science in many places. Researchers say it can help show certain illnesses, like heart disease and cancer, and reveal psychological states and emotional problems. Handwriting analysis is being used more for career guidance and during job interviews. Many big companies hire graphologists to study the handwriting of people applying for important jobs. However, most doctors and psychiatrists are unsure about the value of graphology.
Patricia Marne, a professional graphologist for over 20 years, thinks doctors should take it more seriously. She believes handwriting can show psychological traits and some medical conditions. She says, ""Handwriting can show social class and intelligence. It can also help assess mental ability, whether a person should focus on arts or sciences, and if they have a tricky or open character."" According to Ms. Marne, graphology can be useful in spotting possible criminal tendencies: ""Criminals often have disturbed handwriting, which is usually poorly shaped. Many criminals come from difficult backgrounds and have stopped emotional development. This often appears in childish handwriting and in going over letters several times.""
Ms. Marne can tell if people are honest, manipulative, or reliable employees. ""Young male offenders often have very high ascenders, showing they live in a world of fantasy and dream of success. Graphologists can see if violence is about to happen, if the writer is under a lot of pressure, and if there are psychopathic tendencies. Handwriting can be used to predict possible suicides."" Heart and lung problems can also appear, she says. ""You can't diagnose from one sample unless the writing is clearly shaky or disturbed. But if it changes over time or becomes disjointed, or if there's a break in the signature that wasn't there before, it could mean something serious has happened."" A big emotional upset can also show in a temporarily changed signature, she says.
Ms. Marne says handwriting can show other psychological traits. People whose letters form 'threads' instead of being separate are, apparently, clever and tricky. Those who write mainly in capitals are trying to hide their true selves. Very light pressure shows sensitivity and low energy. Originality in handwriting shows confidence and artistic ability. Disconnected writing is a sign of a loner. Very small signatures show inhibition and an inferiority complex; circles over the 'i' are a call for attention, and crossing the 't' heavily over the whole word shows intolerance and a patronizing attitude.
Ms. Marne says it takes six years of study and experience to analyze handwriting accurately, and this needs empathy and intuition. She believes more research is needed to make graphology a proper science. She thinks this will happen soon. ""It's actually more accurate than psychoanalysis because you can tell the whole history of the person, including all their emotional crises, without asking them questions they might answer incorrectly.""
Even though this sounds interesting, there is little strong evidence to support these claims. Some psychiatrists are very critical. They say handwriting is a result of education, artistic ability, and the type of writing taught, and it has no other meaning."
CAE_41,C1,"'Is your office working well? Fresh air and good chairs are important for a happy, healthy team, according to a new survey. We visited four different offices to see how healthy and happy they were. Our expert panel included a building health consultant, an ergonomist (who studies people's working conditions), and an occupational psychologist. Here are their opinions.
Office A: Advertising Agency
Building Health Consultant: This office is very simple; no central heating, no mechanical ventilation, and windows open to the street. It is hard to see why this space works, but the small, dynamic team seems happy. They adjust to the seasons by opening doors and roof panels or using electric heaters, like at home. This might be the key: a team of seven people has created a happy, home-like work environment without outside rules.
Ergonomist: The furniture here is mixed; no two pieces match. Much of it causes bad working postures. Chairs are old, most aren't adjustable, and many are broken. Even though this is not good, the staff has a varied work schedule, which they control -- office work, meeting clients, making presentations, etc. This variety reduces the risk of tiredness, boredom, and muscle problems.
Occupational Psychologist: Staff enjoy the variety of work and the flexible office space. They said their office was 'just the right size' -- small enough to know what colleagues are doing, large enough to work alone. I found the office attractive and fun, showing both efficiency and creativity.
Office B: News Service
Building Health Consultant: The office is not very exciting, but it is comfortable and the staff do not dislike it. The air quality and maintenance are good, helped by a No Smoking policy.
Ergonomist: The company has already used an ergonomist. Chairs are excellent, lighting and computer equipment are good. Space is good, but the layout could be better. The environment is impersonal and boring, with grey, bare walls.
Occupational Psychologist: Walls are bare except for year planners and a poster about maternity rights. Most staff have been there for at least five years and relationships are okay. The office could be better if desks were arranged to share information more easily. Success stories or future projects could be shown on the walls.
Office C: Bank
Building Health Consultant: This office gets mixed reactions. It feels like being in a glass case, looking at and being looked at by many similar offices. Even with smokers and non-smokers in a small space, the air did not seem stale. Standing 1.5 meters from a smoker, you could not smell the cigarette.
Ergonomist: The office is very standard and not inspiring. Desks are just okay. Not all chairs for computer use meet requirements, but this is user choice. Computer screens are often on small desks with lowered keyboard shelves, which is not good for modern equipment.
Occupational Psychologist: Staff support each other and have good technology. Many communication awards are on display. The wood-colored panels and brown carpet give a slightly serious look. The office is busy.
Office D: Newspaper
Building Health Consultant: It is hard to say anything good about this building. The air-conditioning is very basic, causing big temperature changes. The space is cluttered, and most people have little desk space. The office is very dusty, with many places for dust to settle. The roof collects dust, which can fall on people below.
Ergonomist: The furniture looks more like it belongs in a carpentry workshop than in a high-tech industry. Most chairs are not good for keyboard users, especially those shorter than 1.75 m. Many chairs are old, lack adjustment, and have armrests that keep users from getting close to the desk.
Occupational Psychologist: Old brown chairs, dirty carpets, dust, and dirt everywhere. There is a lot of room for improvement -- the place needs cleaning, individual success should be recognized more, and air conditioning needs immediate improvement -- there are many smokers. Few conversations were happening when we visited; everyone seemed stressed and focused on deadlines. The company needs to work more as a team.'"
CAE_38,C1,"Chewing Gum Culture
Chewing gum is popular and people in America chew 12 million pieces every day. Learn how this old habit became a big business. Each piece of gum has less than ten calories, but it is considered a food and must meet the rules of the American Food and Drug Administration. Today’s gum is mostly made from synthetic materials, with added pine resins and softeners to keep the flavor and improve the texture. 
In the past, things were different. The ancient Greeks chewed a resin from the bark of the mastic tree, found mainly in Greece and Turkey. Greek women liked mastic gum to clean their teeth and freshen their breath. American colonists learned from the Amero-Indians in New England to chew the resin from spruce trees. In the early 1800s, people in the eastern United States could buy lumps of spruce for chewing, making it the first commercial chewing gum in the country.
Modern chewing gum started in the late 1860s with the discovery of chicle, a milky substance from the sapodilla tree in the Central American rainforest. This gum was smoother and more elastic, leading to a new industry. However, attempts to grow sapodilla commercially have not worked. As the gum market grew, synthetic alternatives were needed. Today, the few remaining chicle gatherers, called chicleros, have a hard and dangerous job. They walk long distances in very humid conditions to collect sapodilla. They face dangers like poisonous snakes and insects, including the chicle fly that lays eggs in their ears and nose. With just a rope and an axe, a skilled chiclero can climb a tree quickly to cut the bark and collect the sap. They carry the liquid to a camp where it is boiled and made into bricks. Life at the camp is tough, with a simple diet of maize and local alcohol from sugar cane.
Despite the hard work, chicleros worry about their jobs. Not long ago, the United States imported 7,000 tonnes of chicle a year from Central America. Last year, only 200 tonnes were collected in Mexico's Yucatan peninsula. As gum sales have increased, manufacturers use synthetics to cut costs and meet demand.
Gum producers are finding new ways to market their products. They claim gum helps you relax, gives you energy, and reduces tension. Soldiers in both world wars were given gum. The biggest claim is that gum reduces tooth decay. When we eat, plaque acid forms and causes decay. Saliva neutralizes the acid and provides minerals like calcium, phosphate, and fluoride. Gum makers say chewing for 20 minutes can increase saliva flow. Research continues on new textures and flavors. Glycerine and other vegetable oils are used to mix the gum base. Most new flavors are artificial, but some still need natural help. Also, 137 square kilometers of America is used to grow mint for the two most popular chewing gums in the world."

**B. NEW ZEALAND - HERMITAGE HOTEL, MOUNT COOK**  
The Hermitage Hotel is on New Zealand's South Island. I found it by accident while climbing. We climbed a glacier and walked down to find this hotel. It is in beautiful, wild countryside, high up in the mountains. After a tiring climb, it was amazing to find such luxury, with someone playing piano music.
**C. MAURITIUS - BEACHCOMBER PARADIS HOTEL**  
On the south-west of Mauritius, the Paradis Hotel is on a quiet peninsula. The road to the hotel passes empty beaches. The hotel is not small, and many people enjoy the free watersports. However, you can find peace on nine kilometers of private beach. In the evening, when everyone leaves, you can sit on the beach and feel far away from everything.
**D. ST LUCIA - LADERA HOTEL, ST LUCIA**  
The Ladera Hotel in St Lucia is in a dramatic location. It is quiet and far from busy areas, 1,000 feet high. The open rooms have views of the Pitons and the Caribbean Sea. The style is colonial, with wooden furniture and four-poster beds with netting.
**E. TURKEY - THE SPLENDID HOTEL, ISTANBUL**  
This hotel is on Buyukada in the Princes Islands, a peaceful escape from Istanbul. The islands are an hour by boat and have no cars, only horse-drawn carriages. The architecture is from the 1920s. The Splendid Hotel is a landmark, painted white with red domes. It is a bit old now but still charming.
**F. FRANCE - CHATEAU D'ETOGES, EPERNAY**  
In the village of Etoges, in Champagne, is a beautiful 17th-century chateau. It has a moat with swans. The chateau was a family home and now has 20 unique rooms, some with four-poster beds. One room even has a billiard table. There are special weekend rates with breakfast, dinner, and complimentary champagne.
**G. KENYA - THE FAIRVIEW HOTEL, NAIROBI**  
The Fairview is a comfortable hotel in Africa, not too fancy. It is a popular stop for travelers between safaris. Some guests decide to stay longer after seeing the gardens and rooms. There are apartments for long stays. The hotel is on Nairobi Hill, away from the busy city center. It is a great place to watch the sunset with a drink and enjoy a hearty dinner.
**H. ITALY - HOTEL SPLENDIDO, PORTOFINO**  
The Duke of Windsor was the first guest at Hotel Splendido. Many famous people have stayed here, like Lauren Bacall and Humphrey Bogart. Today, you might meet a wealthy businessperson. The hotel was once a monastery and is still splendid. The restaurant serves simple, delicious food, and the hotel has fine Persian rugs and homemade pasta."
CAE_47,C1,"**The Hotel Inspector**
Sue Brown is a hotel inspector. She checks hotels to see if they are good. Christopher Middleton watched her work. 
At the Globe Hotel, things start badly. The receptionist is talking on the phone and does not notice Sue. Sue whispers, ""Very poor."" This is a common mistake she has seen many times in her 11 years as an inspector. The Globe Hotel has three red stars, which means it is one of the top 130 hotels out of 4,000 in the guide Sue works for. Sue expected better service.
The entrance to the hotel is not welcoming. There is an unmanned door with a buzzer and a long, empty corridor. Sue is not impressed. Things get worse when the receptionist cannot find Sue's booking. Only three of the hotel's 15 rooms are booked that night. Sue's room is on the top floor, but she does not like it. It is stuffy, and there is a big hole in the wall behind the wardrobe.
Sue used to be known as ""The Woman in Black"" because people thought she was tough, but she says she is not. The next morning, after paying her bill, she tells the hotel manager, Robin Greaves, who she is. He looks worried. He apologizes for a bad smell in the lounge, saying there might be a blocked drain. Sue suggests not taking guests to that lounge until it is fixed. Greaves agrees and takes notes.
Not everything is bad. Sue praises Emma, the assistant manager, and Trudy, the waitress, for their good work. Dinner was good enough to keep the hotel's two-rosette food rating. Greaves asks how to get three rosettes. Sue suggests not serving a pudding that falls apart. 
Sue's job is to say what other guests might be too shy to say. Sometimes people complain about her, but she has to tell the truth. She also writes a full report for the hotel. Hotels pay to be in the guide, so they want to know how to improve. 
Sue tells Greaves that the Globe will keep its red stars, which is good news. But another inspector will visit in the next two months to check if things are better. Greaves says he looks forward to it, but he does not seem very happy."

Mountaineer Doug Scott shares his experience of climbing the highest peak on each continent, known as the Seven Summits. Here is his journey:
**A. Mt. Everest, Asia (8,848m)**
My journey to climb the Seven Summits started with Mt. Everest. My partner, Dougal Haston, and I were in a snow cave near the top. Dougal started talking to someone who wasn't there, likely due to lack of oxygen. I also felt strange, talking to my feet because of the cold. Despite the challenges, Dougal gave me confidence, and we reached the summit.
**B. Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)**
In April 1976, Dougal and I climbed Mt. McKinley, known for being dangerous. We carried all our gear on our backs, a first for a new route. The low air pressure made it feel like we were higher than we were. After a tough climb, we reached the summit.
**C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,895m)**
In September 1976, I went to climb Mt. Kenya but ended up on Kilimanjaro. We got lost in the jungle, which was serious because of the lack of water. We found a trail and reached the summit using the Umbwe route.
**D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)**
In January 1992, my wife and I climbed Aconcagua. We avoided the busy standard route and joined a group on a different path. We reached the summit just before dark. Meeting other climbers inspired me to consider climbing all Seven Summits.
**E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)**
In November 1992, I realized climbing all Seven Summits was possible. We traveled to Antarctica, where the sun never sets at that time of year. Despite strong winds and cold temperatures, we reached the summit in 8 hours.
**F. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)**
In the summer of 1994, our team climbed Elbrus. After some acclimatization, we took a cableway partway up and then walked to the summit. We thought we reached the top, but there was more to climb. We returned safely the next day.
**G. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)**
On this expedition, we wanted to explore a new route and meet the local Dani people. Despite warnings of danger, we climbed the mountain. On May 12, we reached the summit, completing my Seven Summits journey. Mission accomplished!"
FCE_15,B2,"'Style Merchants Style is important in our lives today, from clothes to home decoration and accessories. Jo Foley talks about the trends for this year's fashion lovers. Ned Ingham: Dress Designer Ned Ingham creates beautiful, romantic wedding dresses. 'People should choose simpler styles instead of traditional, stiff dresses with too many frills,' he says. Ingham has been drawing and designing wedding dresses since he was a schoolboy. At 16, he went to fashion school to learn how to make clothes. But you don't have to be a bride to wear an Ingham dress: he also designs long, classic evening dresses with modern colors and fabrics. For those who prefer classic styles, Ingham offers a navy-blue summer suit, a key piece in English women's wardrobes for most of the 20th century. In his hands, it looks new and fresh. Sally Quail: Jeweller Sally Quail used to work for an art dealer, but she never had formal training in jewellery. She started designing her own engagement ring when she couldn't find one she liked. This led her to become a designer in 1990. Now, many famous people want her jewellery. Her style features large semi-precious stones set in gold, inspired by 18th-century designs. Recently, she started using diamonds. 'It must be my age,' says 36-year-old Quail. 'I reached a point where I wanted a diamond, so I began working with them.' Lily Grimson: Handbag Designer Just four years after starting in the competitive fashion world, Lily Grimson, with only a basic course in art and design, has had two of her bags chosen for a major design exhibition. Her designs are always noticed. All of Grimson's fashion bags are handmade in the UK. A Grimson handbag is not just a bag - it is full of glamour, made from the finest calfskin or heavy silk. A mix of style and care makes a Grimson bag special. Peter Little: Hairdresser For over 20 years, Peter Little has styled the hair of some of the world's most famous people. 'Most women want hair that looks natural and is easy to manage at home,' he says. His approach is unique - he makes sure his clients don't look like they just left a salon. But this relaxed look is expensive - £250 for the first appointment, and there's a three-month waiting list. Using his fame, Peter has created his own line of hairdryers and styling tools. Now, people who can't visit his salon can style their hair at home. Penny Pratt: Florist Penny Pratt runs a small shop and is a flower consultant for a large supermarket chain. She also gives floral ideas to top restaurants. This is impressive for someone with no formal training in floristry who left her teaching job 10 years ago to try something new. Her simple, modern flower designs have won many prizes, helping her start her own London Flower School. She has also given successful lectures in Japan and the USA. She says, 'Flower arrangements are simpler now. Keep them simple but strong, and don't use too many leaves - they are too big and architectural. For wedding bouquets, the rule is: the flowers must be of the same type.'"
FCE_19,B2,"**Five-star luxury with modern technology**
The five-star Merrion Hotel has just opened in Dublin. It took almost two years to convert four large eighteenth-century houses into this hotel. This allowed them to install the latest technology for both staff and guests. General Manager Peter MacCann wants his staff to know guests by name, but he uses the hotel's computer system to remember guests' preferences. This system, which cost £250,000, helps treat returning guests in a special way. For example, if a guest asks for certain music CDs during their first stay, those CDs will be ready for them on their next visit. 
Room temperature is a common complaint from hotel guests worldwide. At the Merrion, guests can adjust the temperature in their rooms within a small range, and the front desk can make larger adjustments. Business travelers will appreciate the technology in the rooms. MacCann expects that up to 65% of the hotel's business will come from this market. Each room has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that also works as a photocopier and printer, and a video-conferencing facility. 
The hotel has prepared for future technology changes by installing extra cables and renting TVs, so they can be easily updated. Despite all this technology, the rooms are designed to be comfortable and welcoming. The hotel has 145 large, well-furnished bedrooms, a swimming pool, gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a beautiful garden.
The food at the hotel must be excellent, as expected in luxury hotels. Chef Patrick Guilbaud, whose Dublin restaurant already had two Michelin stars, moved his restaurant to the Merrion. This move benefits both him and the hotel. He has a new, modern kitchen and better parking facilities. The hotel gains a popular restaurant without financial risks. With advanced technology and a skilled staff, the Merrion is set to succeed."

Artist Susan Shepherd is famous for her flower paintings. Her large garden around her house gives her many ideas for her art. The garden is full of her favorite flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some plants grow wildly and spread seeds everywhere. The garden has a nice mix of colors, shapes, and structures, thanks to the previous owners who loved gardening. They left plants that Susan liked, and she also got their gardener, Danny. Susan says, ""It was really his garden."" They worked well together. At first, Danny didn't agree with some of Susan's ideas, but when she explained she wanted to paint them, he understood.
Susan likes to paint detailed pictures of single plants rather than the whole garden. Sometimes she paints groups of plants where they are, but usually, she picks them and takes them to her studio. She says, ""I don't set the whole thing up at once."" She paints one flower at a time, which can take a few days, and then adds more flowers. Sometimes, it takes a couple of years to finish a painting.
Her busiest time is spring and early summer when tulips and poppies bloom. ""They all come out together, and you're so busy,"" she says. She also enjoys watching flowers change as they age. For example, tulips change shape and open up when left in water. At first, they seem boring, but they twist and turn over time.
Susan has always loved plants. She studied botany in school and collected wildflowers. She didn't like garden flowers back then because they looked fake to her. She was fascinated by wildflowers growing in difficult places like rocks or cliffs.
Today, her garden has many plants from faraway places, but they fit well in her garden. She has a relaxed attitude towards her garden, like a kind aunt who lets children play freely as long as they don't cause harm. With two upcoming exhibitions, Susan finds it hard to work in the garden. She hired another gardener, but she knows that to stay connected with her art, ""you have to get your hands dirty."""
FCE_13,B2,"Many trees in the Brackham area fell during the terrible storms in March. The town lost two big lime trees from the old market square. This changed how the town center looked, which upset some of the older residents. Normally, Chief Inspector Douglas Pelham, head of the local police, would have been upset too. But during the storm, when the wind knocked down the walnut tree in his garden, Pelham was too sick to notice. He was a strong and healthy man, but he got very sick with bronchitis for the first time in his life. When he first felt a headache and tightness in his chest, his wife, Molly, tried to get him to see a doctor. Pelham thought the police needed him, so he ignored her and kept working. This made him forgetful and short-tempered. Finally, his colleague, Sergeant Lloyd, took him to the doctor. By then, he was too weak to argue. Soon, he was getting his medicine and going home to his wife, who sent him straight to bed. On Thursday morning, when Molly told him the walnut tree had fallen, Pelham couldn't understand it. On Thursday evening, he asked about damage to the house, was relieved there was none, and went back to sleep. On Saturday, when he felt better, he realized the walnut tree's loss changed how the living room looked. The Pelhams' large house had a big garden. It was expensive, but Pelham was happy with it. The garden gave them privacy. But now, the storm changed things. Before, the walnut tree was part of the view from the living room. It didn't make the room dark because there was another window, but it made nice light patterns that hid the old furniture they brought from their last house. Without the tree, the room was very bright, showing the old furniture clearly. The view from the window was also different. The tall house next door, once hidden by the tree, was now visible with its ugly purple bricks and pipes. It had many windows that seemed to watch the Pelhams. ""Doesn't it look terrible?"" Pelham said to his wife. But Molly, standing in the doorway, seemed happy. ""I've been telling you since we moved here. We need to buy a new sofa, no matter the cost."""
FCE_16,B2,"**Living in the Valley**
We had been living in our valley for sixteen months when we first understood the dangers in the hills around us. These dangers could threaten our survival. It was the year when the storms came early, even before November ended. Until then, we felt safe in our valley, protected by the hills. Soon, snow began to fall. In one day, it was about 15 centimetres deep. It almost blocked our road and made the path by the stream slippery and dangerous. But on the nearby hills, the snow was much deeper and stayed longer. Up there, the wind was very strong. In our valley, we only felt sudden strong winds; trees moved, but the branches stayed strong. Still, we knew we had a reason to worry. The snow and wind were inconvenient, but they did not trouble us much. It was the river, the Ryburn, which usually flowed gently, that worried us the most. It reminded us of what could happen if the water from the hills was not controlled by dams built many years ago.
Soon, the snow started to melt. Every day, we watched dark clouds gather over the hills to the west. Grey clouds spread over the valleys. They moved and rose, warning us of what was coming. We had seen enough of the sky; now we began to watch the river, which was becoming fuller and wilder every day. The snow was washed away as more rain fell from the clouds, but high in the hills, the reservoir was filling and was close to danger level. Then it happened - for the first time in years, the reservoir overflowed. Up in the hills, it was like Niagara Falls, as water surged over the dam and into the stream below. The river seemed wild as the waters rushed down. Just a couple of metres from our cottage, the stream was wild under the bridge. It was deeper than we had ever seen it near our home, hitting its banks hard. For three days, we hoped it would stay below its wall. Luckily, our hopes were answered as the dam held and the waters began to go down.
In the past, before the dam was built, the river often flooded the nearby villages. Now, the dam controls the river, and usually, everything is fine. The large amount of water from the hills, from snow and heavy rain, stays behind the dam with only small overflows. Because of this protection, we can enjoy the big clouds over the valley and be amazed by the river's power. Thanks to this, we feel our home in the valley is still safe and secure."
FCE_21,B2,"Film Critic Mark Adams reflects on his last ten years working as a film critic for a newspaper called The Front Page. Writing about films for The Front Page was his first real job. Before that, he had done some reviewing of novels for other newspapers, films for a magazine, and anything he was asked to do for the radio. This is how he met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page, who also wrote for radio and television. Tom hired him, but Tom was not mainly a journalist, or he would have been more careful in choosing his staff. 
At first, Tom's idea was to have a team of critics for art forms that didn't need special knowledge: books, TV, theatre, film, and radio. They would have a weekly lunch to choose what to cover from the artistic material Tom decided on, with guests to make it sociable. It felt like a dream: a new newspaper, and Mark was part of the team. It seemed unlikely that a new paper could succeed in a crowded market. Mark even thought it was as likely as a millionaire wanting to help him personally by pretending to employ him. He lacked self-confidence. The first time he saw someone reading the newspaper on the London Underground and turning to a page with his review, he didn't know where to look.
Tom's plan for a team of critics never worked out. It was a good idea, but they didn't meet as planned, so everything was done by phone. The public preferred to link a reviewer with one subject area, so Mark chose film. Without Tom's initial push, they wouldn't have the current setup, where Mark writes a long weekly piece, usually on one film. This way of working suits him well. He wouldn't have liked the usual film critic's job, which involves reviewing every film that comes out. That routine would make him bored quickly. He would soon be sighing, ""What bad film must I watch now?"" - a sigh often heard in screening rooms worldwide.
The space he is given allows him to expand his argument or, in a dull week, to create something out of nothing. But what is his role in the public space? He thinks people choose films based on stars, publicity, or the director. There is also loyalty to a 'type' of film or its opposite. It's rare for someone who hates westerns to buy a ticket for one after reading a review, or for a love story fan to avoid a romantic film because of reviews. So if a film review isn't really a guide for consumers, what is it? Mark doesn't feel he has to be 'right' about a movie. He doesn't think there should be a set number of 'great' and 'bad' films each year. All he has to do is present an argument. He is not a judge, and he doesn't want to be."
FCE_46,B2,"Why would a schoolgirl want to swim 1500m, cycle 40km, and then run 10km? Because ""it's fun."" Teenager with a love for endurance sports WANTED: Sports-loving training partner for a triathlete, preferably female. Chance to train with a potential Olympic champion. Must enjoy distance running (regular 15km sessions), distance swimming (training in cold rivers is a plus), and distance cycling (enjoying 100km rides is an advantage). Ability to do all three without resting is essential. The triathlon is becoming one of the most popular Olympic sports. Recently, it has attracted large crowds who are fascinated (and shocked) by athletes swimming 1500m, cycling 40km, and then running 10km without stopping. It might be exciting for those watching, but why do triathletes want to push their bodies so hard? And why would a 17-year-old girl with excellent academic results give up everything for this challenging sport? Melanie Sears hasn't yet learned the usual phrases about personal satisfaction and mental challenge that most athletes use. ""You swim for 1500m, then run out of the water and jump on your bike, still wet. Of course, then you freeze. When the 40km cycle ride is over, you have to run 10km, which is a long way when you're feeling exhausted. But it's great fun, and all worth it in the end,"" she says. Melanie entered her first triathlon at 14. ""I won the junior section - but then I was the only junior taking part. It seemed so easy that I was waving at my teammates as I went around."" Full of confidence, she entered the National Championships, and although she had the second fastest swim and the fastest run, she didn't win. ""I was following this man and suddenly we came to the sea. We realized then that we had gone wrong. I ended up cycling 20 kilometers too far. I cried all the way through the running."" But she did not give up and is determined that she never will. ""Sometimes I wish I could stop because then the pain would be over, but I am afraid that if I let myself stop just once, I would be tempted to do it again."" Such determination draws admiration from Steve Trew, the sport's director of coaching. ""I've just been testing her fitness,"" he says, ""and she worked so hard on the running machine that it finally threw her off and into a wall. She had given it everything, but whereas most people step off when they realize they can't go any further, she just kept on."" Melanie was the top junior in this year's European Triathlon Championships, finishing 13th. ""I was almost as good as the top three in swimming and running, but much slower at cycling. That's why I'm working very hard at it."" She is trying to convince her parents, who will pay the £1,300 cost of her trip to New Zealand for this year's World Championships, to buy a £2,000 bike (""It's a special deal, with £1,000 off) so she can try national 25 km and 100 km races later this year. But there is another price to pay. Her tough training sessions have made her a bit of a loner. ""I don't have a social life,"" she says. ""I'm not a party person anyway. After two hours of hard swimming on Friday nights, I just want to go to sleep. But I phone and write to the other girls in the team."" What does she talk about? Boys? Clothes? ""No, what sort of times they are achieving."" Where will all this focus end? Melanie has tried other events. She has tried the triathlon ""sprint,"" for example, where you only have to swim 750m, cycle 20km, and run 5km. She wants to enter even tougher events than the triathlon. ""The big trouble is, I have no one of my age to train with,"" she says. Funny, that."
FCE_70,B2,"**The Collectors**
Amanda Roy writes about the things she collects and why many people enjoy this hobby. I have always loved collecting, and one in three adults enjoys this hobby too. It is a world of passion and excitement. But remember, if you don't love an object, don't collect it.
Since ancient times, people have wanted to collect things. Early humans collected pebbles and wore them as necklaces. They liked the shapes and colors. Over the years, not much has changed. Children still collect stones and seashells for their beauty.
I have been collecting all my life, from flowers like tulips to pottery and paintings. My first collection was stones from my parents' garden. When I was six, I went to a school in a remote part of England. My parents took me to a local museum full of objects collected by people in the past. I was fascinated by these objects.
Many people are interested in collecting. One in three adults shares this passion. Some people collect because it is the only part of their lives they can control. For me, it's just something I enjoy.
A famous collector was the Duc de Berry in France. He had a 'room of wonders' with coconut shell cups, carved ivory beads, and Oriental china. Catherine the Great of Russia collected over 4,000 paintings. But you don't have to be rich to start a collection. I have collected tulip bulbs and china cups with great determination. I once convinced another tulip collector to give me one I wanted. I planted it, but it was stolen by another collector.
I also collected 350 American rag dolls. I searched all over the USA for different designs. This collection was destroyed when my house caught fire. The next morning, I saw the remains of my furniture and collection. I don't know which made me sadder.
I am interested in how collections change hands. A silver spoon that belonged to a king or poet becomes valuable. As small objects become popular, their prices rise. Toys from the 1950s are now an investment, but only if you kept the original boxes. (I threw mine away, along with the toys.)"
FCE_3,B2,"**My Job**
Four people talk about their jobs.
**Lisa - Exhibition Programmes Organiser, Science Museum**
I organize temporary exhibitions. This means I plan and design the exhibition and promote it. I need to learn about the exhibition topic first and then talk to experts to decide the main themes and goals. I plan what objects and pictures to show. I make sure visitors understand the exhibition by planning interactive displays, workshops, and theatre. I also work with engineers and electricians to ensure the display is safe. Before the exhibition opens, I help design and write brochures and leaflets to inform people about it.
**Janet - Teacher of London Taxi Drivers**
I start my day at 7.30 a.m. by checking the accounts. Then I see what new maps and documents are needed for learning the 'runs' or routes for the London taxi-driver test. By midday, about 50 students are in school, figuring out the best routes. They find the most direct way, using the correct one-way streets and turns. I help when there is a disagreement, like if a right turn is possible at a junction. When they are close to the test, I give them a simple route and then tell them they must find another way because the road is closed. The next student must find a third route, and I give a reason why they can't use it. This is to make them think.
**Sarah - Marine Conservationist**
I live by the coast and work from home. I answer phone calls, create educational materials, and set up training courses. Sometimes, I go to our main office, but usually, I am on the coast. I work with schools and study centers and run courses for coastal managers and decision-makers about the sea. I take them out to sea in a boat to help them understand marine life better. This often changes their views because it is different from making decisions on a computer. I am lucky because conservation is my hobby, so I enjoy my job. The downside is that I work for a charity, so we always need more money. This means I am always looking for more resources and can't do everything I want.
**Chris - Map and Atlas Publisher**
My work is varied. I make sure our publishing program meets market needs and keep stocks of about 300 books we publish. We have high standards for information and content. We get many letters from readers about things like international boundaries, and these need careful replies. I discuss future projects and current sales with co-publishers. I work with an enthusiastic team, which makes the job enjoyable. The downside, like many jobs, is too much administration, leaving less time for interesting tasks like product development and design."
FCE_10,B2,"'Our Holiday in Ireland We always went to Ireland in June. Since we started going on holidays together, we spent the first two weeks of the month at Glencorn Lodge in County Antrim. It's a big house by the sea, near the village of Ardbeag. An English couple, the Malseeds, bought the house and made some changes, but they did it very carefully. Strafe found Glencorn for us. He saw an advertisement when the Malseeds still needed to advertise. 'How about this?' he said one evening and read the details. The summer before, we went to a hotel recommended by friends, but it wasn't good because the food was terrible. The four of us have been playing cards together for a long time: Dekko, Strafe, Cynthia, and me. They call me Milly, but my real name is Dorothy Milson. Dekko got his nickname at school because Dekko Deacon sounds nice. He and Strafe went to school together, so we call Strafe by his last name, like the teachers did. We're all about the same age and live near the town where the Malseeds lived before moving from England to Ireland. We always think it's a coincidence. 'How very nice,' Mrs. Malseed said, smiling to welcome us again this year. She seems to know when guests are about to arrive because she's usually waiting in the big hall that smells of flowers. 'Arthur, take the luggage up,' she told the old porter. 'Rose, Tulip, Lily, and Geranium.' These are the names of the rooms for us. Mrs. Malseed painted flowers on the doors instead of using numbers. In winter, when not many people come to Glencorn Lodge, she takes care of details like that, and her husband does the repairs. 'Well, well, well,' Mr. Malseed said, coming into the hall from the kitchen. 'A hundred thousand welcomes,' he greeted us in the Irish way. He smiled with his dark brown eyes twinkling, making us feel special. Everyone smiled, and I felt that our holiday had really started. Nothing had changed at Glencorn, everything was good. Kitty from the dining room came out to greet us. 'You look younger every year, all four of you,' she said, making everyone laugh. Arthur led us to the rooms, carrying as much of our luggage as he could and then coming back for the rest. After dinner, we played cards for a while but not too long because we were tired from the journey. In the lounge, there was a man alone and a French couple. There were other people at dinner because in June Glencorn Lodge is always full. From where we sat by the window, we could see some people walking on the lawns and others taking the path to the seashore. In the morning, we'd do the same: walk along the sands to Ardbeag and have coffee at the hotel there, then come back in time for lunch. In the afternoon, we'd drive somewhere. I knew this because over the years, we developed this routine. Since we first came here, we all fell in love with the beautiful landscape.'"
FCE_67,B2,"**Keeping the Holiday-Makers Happy**
Sarah Sutherland-Pilch is a 24-year-old from West Sussex. She works as a chalet girl in Val d'Isere, France. This is her second year doing this job. People call her by her nickname, Pilch. She works for a company that provides cooking and cleaning services for visitors who come to ski and stay in chalets, which are wooden houses typical of the area.
Sarah studied French and History of Art at Oxford Brookes University and graduated last summer. She says being a chalet girl is not a career, but a fun way to spend a year or two before starting a more permanent job. 'It's a good way to meet people. I meet successful people every week,' she says.
Sarah does not live in the chalet. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks about a mile to the chalet, which can host up to 18 guests each week. She has her own breakfast before preparing breakfast for the guests. 'They get porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants.' After breakfast, around 9:30 a.m., Sarah cleans up and either makes afternoon tea for the guests or cleans the rooms, which she says is 'the worst part of the job.' By 11 a.m., she is ready to go skiing. She skis as much as she can. 'On a good day, we can ski until 4:30 p.m.'
Sarah returns to the chalet to prepare dinner and takes a shower before starting, but she does not sleep. 'It's bad if you do,' she says. Dinner is a three-course meal served at 8 p.m., and coffee is usually ready by 10 p.m. Sarah cleans up after dinner and loads the dishwasher. 'There's nothing worse than a messy kitchen in the morning.' Sometimes she chats with the guests, other times they prefer to be left alone. 'Good guests can make a week great, but some weeks are not as good.'
Sarah meets her friends at the chalet where she lives, and they go out around 11 p.m. 'We usually start at Bananas, might go to G Jay's, and maybe end at Dick's T-Bar,' she says. But Sarah never stays out too late on Saturday night because Sunday is her busiest day. 'A terrible day,' she says, 'when you don't want to cook breakfast with a headache.'
On Sunday, work starts earlier because breakfast for departing guests must be ready by 7 a.m. After the guests leave, Sarah cleans quickly. 'We clean everything - clear breakfast, strip the beds, get everything ready.' If she hasn't done the week's shopping on Saturday, she does it now. Around 3 p.m., after cleaning, Sarah prepares tea for the new guests. 'They arrive around 4:30 p.m.' Sometimes they are confused and have many questions. 'I think it's the mountain air,' she says.
Between tea and dinner, Sarah takes guests who need boots or skis to the ski shop and gets a ride back to the chalet from the ski shop staff. Then it's time for dinner again and maybe a drink later, but not always. 'Sometimes I'm so tired I just go to bed early,' she says."
FCE_27,B2,"Miss Rita Cohen, a small, pale-skinned girl, came to Seymour's factory one day. She looked much younger than Seymour's daughter, Marie, but said she was six years older. Rita wore overalls and big shoes, and her pretty face was surrounded by curly hair. She was so small and young-looking that Seymour found it hard to believe she was studying at the University of Pennsylvania. She was doing research on the leather industry in New Jersey for her Master's degree. 
A few times a year, someone would call or write to Seymour to ask if they could see his factory. Sometimes, he would help a student by answering questions on the phone or giving a short tour if they seemed serious. Rita was almost as small as the children from Marie's third-year class. Years ago, they visited the factory to see how gloves were made. Marie's favorite part was the laying-off table, where men shaped and pressed gloves over steam-heated brass hands. These hands were very hot, shiny, and stood straight up from the table. Marie called them 'pancake hands' because they looked flat.
Rita asked Seymour, 'How many pieces come in a shipment?' He replied, 'Between twenty and twenty-five thousand.' She took notes and asked, 'Do they come directly to your shipping department?' Seymour liked that she was interested in every detail. He explained, 'They come to the tannery. The tannery is a contractor. We buy the material, and they make it ready for us to work with. My grandfather and father worked in the tannery here in town. I did too, for six months, when I started in the business. Have you ever been inside a tannery?' Rita said, 'Not yet.' Seymour offered to arrange a visit for her, saying, 'They're primitive places. The technology has improved, but it's not much different from hundreds of years ago. It's tough work. Tanning is said to be the oldest industry, with remains found from six thousand years ago in Turkey. The first clothing was just skins tanned by smoking them. My father is the leather expert; you should talk to him. He can talk about gloves for two days. Glovemen love the trade. Have you ever seen anything being made, Miss Cohen?' Rita replied, 'I can't say I have. I saw my mother make a cake when I was a child.' Seymour laughed. Rita made him laugh. She was eager to learn, like his daughter Marie, who was taller and fairer than Rita but had the same intelligence and curiosity. Seymour decided, 'I'll show you the whole process. We'll make you a pair of gloves, and you'll watch them being made from start to finish. What size do you wear?'"
FCE_71,B2,"'Is it a tough job? Chris Arnot asks four people with dream jobs if they are as wonderful as they seem. A. Raquel Graham Raquel Graham calls from the taxi taking her to the airport. She can't meet me tomorrow because her boss wants her to be in Los Angeles instead. When you're a personal assistant to a pop star, you have to travel around the world quickly. Raquel loves her job and gets along well with her boss. There's just one small problem - she doesn't like flying. 'On a nine-hour trip to California, I usually take sleeping pills to help calm me down,' she says. Her worst experience was flying on Concorde. 'It felt so closed in with those tiny windows.' When she's not traveling, she works in offices in Manchester and London. She has to do some boring paperwork - organizing the diary, attending meetings with lawyers and accountants, planning schedules, and making more travel arrangements. She didn't apply for the job. She met the manager of a pop group by chance, which led to a job offer. She took a secretarial course at night school at the same time. Five years later, she was in the right place at the right time when her boss needed a PA. B. David Brown David Brown has been an accountant and a golf caddy, a person who carries a golfer's bags. Overall, he preferred being a caddy. Well, you would too if golf was your passion. There were some downsides, though. A small flat fee is given, plus a percentage of the winnings. The average earnings are between £25,000 and £35,000, and much of that goes on travel and hotels. He was 31 when he first caddied for the golfer, Greg Norman. 'You're not just carrying bags. You're giving advice, using your knowledge against the weather, and trying to understand the course.' His accountancy skills were recently recognized by European Tour Productions when they made him a statistical data administrator. From cards brought in by the caddies, he compiles and analyzes the statistics of each day's play. The results are wanted by TV commentators, golfing magazines, and the golfers themselves. C. Martin Fern Martin Fern is the editor of the 'Food and Drink' pages of a daily newspaper, and one of his easier tasks is to try the food in the best restaurants. What does he think about restaurants that charge very high prices? 'For those who can afford it, it's up to them,' he says. 'I'd rather spend £120 on a meal I'll remember for the rest of my life than buy a microwave.' It was his talent as a cook that led to the offer of a food column from a friend who edited a Saturday Review. For Martin, who was then a creative director of an advertising agency, it was a useful extra income. He was 42 when another newspaper called to offer a full-time job. 'It meant a 50% cut in guaranteed income,' he says. 'But it was a chance to turn my passion into a profession.' He still does all the cooking at home and tries to keep his waistline under control by cycling a couple of miles to the nearest tube station. D. Dick Prince 'I started writing children's stories about 20 years ago,' says Dick Prince, one of Britain's most popular children's writers. 'Before that, I always loved words and enjoyed using them, but my writing was mainly poetry. Then I had this idea for a story. I had been a farmer and knew the problem of chickens being killed by a fox. So I wrote a kind of role reversal story called The Fox Busters, which became my first published children's story.' Where do his ideas come from? 'Well, it's not easy, I have to work at them,' he says. 'That is what I usually do in the mornings. I'm not up with the dawn, I'm afraid. After lunch, I spend another couple of hours typing out the morning's scribbling - all of which I do with one finger on an old portable typewriter rather than on one of those awful laptops. I get between 50 and a hundred letters a week, and that is the part about being a writer that I enjoy the most. I do try to answer them all, but nowadays I have some secretarial help.'"

In the lumberyard by the lake, where trees were made into boards for building, there was an old two-story brick building. Around it were big piles of soft sawdust. These golden piles covered the yard all the way to the blue lake. That afternoon, with nothing else to do, all the boys followed Michael up a ladder to the roof of the old building. They sat with their legs hanging over the edge, looking at the lake. Suddenly, Michael said, ""I dare you to jump down,"" and without thinking, he jumped off the roof and landed on the sawdust, laughing. ""I dare you all!"" he shouted. ""You're all cowards,"" he said, trying to get them to follow him. Laughing, he watched them from the roof, looking scared, but one by one, they jumped and got up smiling with relief. In the hot afternoon sun, they lay on the sawdust, telling jokes. Then one boy said, ""Let's go up and jump again."" They weren't very excited, but they all went up and started jumping off again until only Michael was left. The others were below, smiling and calling, ""Come on, Mike. What's wrong?"" Michael wanted to jump and join them, but he stayed on the roof, nervous, with a silly smile, wondering why it seemed so far down this time. At first, they thought he was joking, but then they saw him clenching his fists. He tried counting to ten and then jumping, but it didn't work. He tried taking a deep breath and closing his eyes. After a while, the boys started laughing at him; they were tired of waiting, and it was almost dinnertime. ""Come on, you're a coward. Do you think we'll wait all night?"" they shouted. When he didn't move, they started to leave, still shouting. ""Who started this? What's wrong with you?"" he called. But he stayed on the roof, looking sadly at the ground. He was alone for almost an hour while the sun, like a big orange ball, slowly set beyond the lake. His clothes were wet from sweating nervously. Finally, he closed his eyes, slipped off the roof, fell heavily on the sawdust, and lay there for a long time. The yard was quiet; the workers had gone home. As he lay there, he wondered why he couldn't jump, then got up slowly and walked home, feeling very ashamed and wanting to avoid everyone. He was so late for dinner that his stepmother said coldly, ""You're old enough to come home on time. If you won't come home, you should stay in tonight."" She was a strong woman with fair skin, a little grey in her hair, and a patient smile. She spoke with controlled anger, but Michael, with his dark, sad face, hardly heard her; he was still thinking about the boys laughing at him."
FCE_44,B2,"**Careers Advice**
Are you unhappy with your job but unsure how to change it? Kitty Doherty offers some helpful advice. Many people who want to change their job are turning to careers advisers. You will need to write a short history of yourself and take some tests called 'psychometrics'. After the tests, you get a summary with career suggestions and possible retraining options.
I decided to try Career Analysts, a big company that gives career advice. Taking the careers test felt like being back in school exams. I was with about ten people, answering questions quickly. I had to remember it wasn't about passing or failing. The tests included finding mistakes in lists of names and numbers and matching similar shapes. After the tests, I talked with an adviser who gave me a report with his observations and recommendations. I agreed with most of his conclusions, though I was surprised to learn I did poorly in scientific and technical tests. I was glad to hear I made the right choice with journalism.
Changing your career doesn't always mean a big change. Last March, Donna Laney, 25, lost her job as a marketing manager at an insurance company. Her friends suggested she visit Career Analysts. 'Losing my job was a chance to look at my career and skills,' says Donna. Some results surprised her. 'I didn't know I had a talent for design. But I had to consider the cost of retraining,' she says. Other ideas included taking a year off to work in the Far East. 'I decided to use my current skills and move to a job better suited for me. Now, I work as a Public Relations officer. Career Analysts helped me see what I wanted to do. I've recommended them to friends who are also happy with the service.'
Some people feel they wouldn't have made changes without help. A visit to Career Counselling Services led Juliet Greene, 26, to make big decisions. 'After working at a bank for six years, I found my job boring and wanted a new challenge. I didn't know what to do, so I went to Career Counselling Services with an open mind. The tests showed I was interested in sciences,' she says. 'I had four sessions with an adviser. The third session was recorded, which was helpful because you forget things you say. After the fourth meeting, I decided to study geology and plan to start a degree course this year. The advice was worth the fee. I'm much happier and more positive now.'
However, careers advice doesn't work for everyone. Amanda Margetts, a 24-year-old sales representative, says: 'I didn't know where to go in my career. I thought a careers adviser might suggest something new. Although I got many ideas, I rejected them because they required a big salary drop or a lot of retraining. I wasn't told anything new about myself,' she says. 'You have to give the adviser a lot of personal information, and I felt a friend could have given me similar advice.'"
FCE_22,B2,"**Fun at the Dentist's?**
If you visit W. Lloyd Jerome's dental office in the center of Glasgow, you will see bright, modern paintings on the walls and a stylish blue couch where patients sit while he checks their teeth. Jerome says, ""Fifty percent of people only go to the dentist when they are in pain, instead of going for regular check-ups. That's because they are scared."" To change this, he has tried to make a place where people are not afraid. That's why he decided not to wear a white coat. He thinks people connect white coats with pain. Jerome believes dental treatment should happen in a relaxed, interesting, and even fun atmosphere.
This is surprising for many people who think dental visits are painful or very formal. Jerome says, ""If people are relaxed, entertained, and treated well, they will forget their past bad experiences."" One of his new ways to help people relax is using virtual-reality headsets. ""We were the first dental office in Britain to use them, and they are very popular. The headsets are used for the first check-up, where the patient sits comfortably on the blue couch and watches a film about underwater wildlife while I look at their teeth. Then the headset shows a special camera view, giving the patient a tour around their mouth."" Surprisingly, most patients enjoy this part of their visit.
Another important thing is that the office smells more like a perfume shop than a dentist's. Today, it smells like orange. Jerome explains, ""When people walk in, I want them to know with all their senses that it's not like going to the dentist's. Smell is very important. The usual dental smell can make people nervous if they are scared of dentists."" I found the gentle smell in the office very nice.
Although he is known as Glasgow's most fashionable dentist, Jerome wants to say that he takes his work very seriously. The relaxation techniques are important, but the quality of the treatment is the most important thing. For example, Jerome uses a special tool that sprays warm water on the teeth to clean them, instead of scraping them. It feels a bit strange at first, but as long as people are relaxed, it is not painful at all.
Five years ago, Jerome went to the United States to learn about dental techniques. ""One thing I learned there was that when you make it easier for the patient, you make it easier for yourself,"" he explains. He sees his patient-focused attitude as the start of a slow change towards less formality in the traditional British dentistry profession.
At that moment, a patient arrives. Jerome quickly goes over, offers him a cup of tea (herbal or regular), asks him what video he'd like to watch, and gently leads him to the chair. The patient seems to enjoy this special treatment, and it's no surprise. The office feels more like an elegant beauty salon than a regular dental practice."
FCE_39,B2,"**Bitter Water Hits the Big Time**
Chocolate, which started in South America, is now a big business around the world. At Easter, people in Britain spend over £230 million on chocolate. Eight percent of all chocolate is bought at this time. Only at Christmas do people eat more chocolate. Although chocolate was made in factories starting in the last century, the cacao plant was first grown by the Aztec, Toltec, and Mayan civilizations in Central America over three thousand years ago.
The cacao tree is a tropical plant found in Africa, South and Central America, the West Indies, and South-East Asia. The fruit of this tree is the size of a melon and contains 20-40 seeds. When dried, they become cacao beans, which are used to make chocolate. In English-speaking countries, they are often called cocoa beans. This is a misspelling from the 17th century when they were also called cacoa and cocao beans.
The Aztecs used cocoa beans as money and to make a drink called xocoatl, which means 'bitter water' in their language, Nahuatl. The Aztecs flavored the chocolate drink with spices and used it for ceremonies and to welcome visitors. The Spanish liked the drink better with cinnamon and sugar, but it took another century for the recipe to spread to the rest of Europe. In the late 17th century, chocolate houses were opened in Europe's capital cities, where people gathered to drink chocolate.
Until the last century, chocolate drinks were made from solid blocks of chocolate melted in hot water. But in 1826, CJ van Houten from the Netherlands invented chocolate powder by removing most of the cocoa butter from the crushed beans. The chocolate bar as we know it began in 1847 when a Bristol company, Fry and Sons, mixed cocoa butter with pure chocolate liquor and sugar to make a solid block you could eat. A Swiss company then added milk solids, creating milk chocolate.
At the start of the 20th century, French companies dominated the British chocolate market. In 1879, the English company Cadbury named their Birmingham factory Bournville (ville is French for town) to add some French style. But then Cadbury's famous Dairy Milk bar, first called Dairymaid in 1905, became popular. Clever advertising linked it to the healthy qualities of milk from the English countryside, making it a rival to the more luxurious French brands.
Now, chocolate consumption in Britain is about four bars each week. This has made manufacturers look for new ways to attract customers. The latest idea is the 'extended line', where a chocolate bar becomes an ice cream, a soft drink, or a dessert to tempt those who are tired of regular snacks.
Meanwhile, cacao farmers are still affected by a drop in cocoa bean prices at the end of the 1980s. Since most cacao farmers work on a very small scale, many had to stop farming. Perhaps you could think of them as you enjoy your next chocolate bar."
FCE_18,B2,"**THE SHELL ARTIST**
Peter Cooke is 83 years old and has become very skilled in his art. He still wants to try new things like making paper and working with feathers. But for now, he is happy to focus on making beautiful and unique objects from shells, a skill he has perfected over the last ten years. 
As he shows me around his apartment, he says, ""Tell me if I am boring you."" But Peter is not boring at all. He is very enthusiastic and charming, and his work is beautiful. He points to some shell-covered ornaments above his fireplace and says, ""I won't mind if people don't buy them because I love them. I never planned to sell my work. Some friends visited me five years ago and said, 'You should have an exhibition. People need to see these. We'll talk to a gallery owner.'""
This led to an exhibition in London, where 70% of his pieces were sold. His second exhibition opened yesterday. The pieces are expensive, with some costing around £2,000, but Peter doesn't mind if his fireplace is empty. There are 86 pieces in the exhibition, with prices starting at £225 for a shell-flower in a crystal vase. Peter says he doesn't set the prices and is open about them. He believes no one else in the world makes work like his. The gallery owner told him, ""One day you'll stop, and everyone will want your pieces because there won't be any more.""
Peter wishes he had started this work earlier in life because he could have made even more wonderful things. Although he still has ideas, he feels more physically limited now. However, his work is far from the usual shell crafts found in seaside shops. He creates boxes covered in tiny shells, pictures made from shells, and baskets of realistic flowers.
Peter has his own method and uses materials he finds. He uses cardboard from laundered shirts for flower bases, a special glue from a sail-maker, and washing-up liquid to clean the shells. He says, ""I have an idea of what I want to do, and it just does itself,"" but his attention to detail and color is impressive.
Peter's search for beautiful, tiny shells has taken him to places like France, Thailand, Mexico, South Africa, and the Philippines. He only collects dead shells and defends himself against people who accuse him of harming beaches. He says, ""When I collect shells, I hear people crushing them with their feet faster than I can collect them. The sea also breaks them up. I would never collect shells with living creatures in them, but once they are empty, why shouldn't I collect them?"" His argument is convincing, especially when you see the beauty of his work."
FCE_62,B2,"**The Schoolgirl Model**
When 15-year-old Kira Langer is not traveling to amazing places and appearing on magazine covers, you will probably find her studying for her school exams. Jane Laidlaw finds out more.
""I'm afraid Kira will be a little late,"" the receptionist at the agency told me. ""Oh, fine,"" I said, ""no problem."" I was trying to convince myself that all the bad things I had read about models were not true, but words like difficult, vain, and unintelligent kept coming to my mind. And now she was going to be late. How late? An hour? Three hours? Maybe she wouldn't come at all. What if she decided a visit to the hairdresser's would be more fun than talking to me? If she was late, she would be rushing. She could be in a bad mood and refuse to answer my questions.
But when the winner of the Looks magazine supermodel competition walked in, she was smiling, relaxed, and apologetic, and she was with her mother. Kira was not dressed in expensive designer clothes but in a simple black dress and trainers. There was no sign of a selfish attitude; she was just a very friendly, very tall, very pretty girl. All models under the age of 16 must take an adult with them whenever they work, she explained. Apart from looking very young, her mother was a normal mum - clearly proud of her successful daughter.
Kira seems a bit surprised by her new fame, which makes sense since it was not planned. It was her older sister who decided that she should enter the model competition. ""She saw the competition and said I should go in for it,"" Kira remembers. ""I said no, but she sent some photos in anyway."" When the call came to tell her that she was a finalist, she was at school. Being selected for the final gave Kira the confidence to go through with it, and she performed perfectly. She won easily, and the Select model agency in London immediately offered her work.
Kira now finds that one of the hardest things she has to do is manage her two separate lives. But her friends and teachers have become used to having a star among them. ""They're really proud of me,"" she says. However, a few unkind people at her school are rude about her success. ""They say I have too high an opinion of myself."" This kind of remark must be hard for Kira to deal with, since there can't be many people as successful as her who are less self-important. But she says, ""They assume that because I've suddenly become a model, I can't stay the same. But the only thing that's changed is I've become more confident - not in a bad way, but I'm able to stand up for myself more.""
As a busy model, her social life is obviously affected. The Select agency can call at any time and tell her that she is wanted for a job the next day. ""If my friends are going out together, I can't say I'll come, because I don't know what I'm doing the next day. I can't really make plans, and if I do, they sometimes get broken, but my friends are good about it. They don't say, 'Oh, you're always going off modeling now, you never have time for us.'""
Kira has the looks, ability, and support to have a great career ahead of her. Not many people can say that before they even take their school-leaving exams. I am about to finish the interview with the girl who has it all, and I ask what she would like to do as a career if she didn't have the outstanding beauty that seems certain to take her to the top of the profession. She pauses and replies, ""I'd like to do what you're doing."""
FCE_49,B2,"'Father and Son Start Gold Rush Terence and Chris Madden have traveled from Canada's cold north to the hot climate of Africa to find valuable metals. The father and son team - one an explorer, the other a mineral expert - think their mine on a Welsh mountain might have up to 10,000 ounces of gold. After ten years of digging in the Welsh hills, they believe they are very close to a five million dollar gold vein. 'As we dig, we are finding high levels of gold; now we just need to dig a few more meters to where it is concentrated,' said Terence, 68, from Liverpool. The pair have dedicated their lives to finding gold. Their search began after the father read about gold worth millions of pounds in the 'Dolgellau gold belt', an area around the Welsh town with the same name. While reading old mining journals and newspapers at the Welsh National Library in Aberystwyth, father and son chose the best area of land to study. Since they first cleared away the plants and found bits of gold in the rocks, they have spent the past ten years getting permission for their work from the owners, taking samples of the earth, and removing old cars and rubbish. They then started digging out 150 tonnes of greenstone rock to make a tunnel and a 10-meter shaft. Now they are running out of money. Having spent their savings chasing their dream, they need to find someone to invest £50,000 in the project to dig the mine a few more meters to where the gold is. Chris Madden says, 'At the moment, this looks doubtful although we've got quite a few people we can contact.' As word spread through the valleys last week about the dig, the magic attraction of gold started to interest the locals as well as the gold diggers. Dolgellau relies on tourists, and residents are cautiously hopeful. 'It would encourage more people to come here if they are right,' said Peter Woolven, manager of the Royal Ship Hotel, 'but if these two find gold I hope millions of people are not going to come and dig up the hillside.' The Welsh gold industry has declined a lot since its peak in the late 1880s, when thousands worked in hundreds of mines around the countryside. One of the last remaining mines at Clogau-St David's, which made wedding rings for the Queen and the Princess of Wales, closed a month ago. Now, however, individual gold-diggers are returning. George Hall, another prospector, plans to dig a tunnel deep into the hill on the other side of the ridge from the Maddens. 'Searching for gold is very emotional,' said Hall, 70. 'It's adventurous and exciting, the wonder of uncovering hidden treasure. Maybe I'll be lucky this time.' '"
FCE_31,B2,"**IN HOT WATER**
Rachel Mills is a scientist who loves exploring the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She works at Southampton University as a lecturer and researcher in marine geochemistry, which means she studies the chemical processes in the sea. When she is not teaching, she goes on dives to study underwater volcanoes. She uses a small steel vehicle, about the size of a car, to dive three kilometers down into the ocean. Inside the vehicle, space is very tight, and she can touch the two pilots next to her. They cannot stand or move much and must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can last 16 hours: three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours collecting rock and water samples, and three hours to return to the surface. If there is an emergency, they can press a panic button to release a small escape vessel that quickly rises to the surface, like a ping-pong ball in water. However, no one has tested it yet, and it might not be a pleasant ride.
Rachel remembers her first time in the vehicle. She was on a ship's deck with an instructor who explained the emergency procedures, including what to do if the pilot had a heart attack. They wanted to see how she would react in such a small space. Now, Rachel has made six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian crew to a site five days' sail west of the Canary Islands. There, on the ocean floor, are many underwater volcanoes with chimneys blowing out black smoke. The Russian team was placing scientific equipment to study the effects of a program that would drill a 150-meter hole through a volcano.
When Rachel is not at sea, she works in her office at the Oceanography Centre in Southampton. She spends two-thirds of her time teaching, which she enjoys, but she does it to support her research on ""black smokers."" These are underwater volcanoes where water comes out of the rock and looks like black smoke. The water flows at one meter per second and is 350 degrees hot. Rachel was only scared once, during a dive with an American team. They were towing equipment when there was a sudden explosion. The shock waves hit their vehicle, and she thought she was going to die. But nothing happened, and they were relieved to be safe.
Diving to the deepest part of the ocean is an adventure for Rachel. Every time she looks out of the porthole and sees the chimneys, she feels a sense of wonder. She is at the bottom of the sea, seeing something no one else has seen before. After studying the black smokers for three years for her PhD, seeing them in real life was an amazing experience."
FCE_58,B2,"I was dirty, smelly, hungry, and somewhere under all that, suntanned. It was the end of my Inter-Rail holiday. My body couldn't take any more. My mind couldn't handle any more foreign timetables, money, or languages. ""Never again,"" I said, as I stepped onto home ground. I said the same thing the next year. And the year after that. All I had to do was buy one train ticket, and because I was under twenty-five, I could spend a whole month going anywhere I wanted in Europe. Ordinary beds are never the same once you've learned to sleep in the corridor of a train, the rhythm rocking you into a deep sleep. Carrying all your things in a backpack makes you have a very simple approach to travel, and encourages incredible wastefulness that can lead to burning socks that have become too smelly, and getting rid of books when finished. On the other hand, this way of looking at life is entirely in the spirit of Inter-Rail, for common sense and reasoning can be thrown out of the window along with the paperback book and the socks. All it takes to achieve this carefree attitude is one of those tickets in your hand. Any system that lets young people travel through countries at a rate of more than one a day must be pretty special. On that first trip, my friends and I didn't know the possibilities of this type of train ticket, thinking it was just a cheap way to get to and from our chosen campsite in southern France. But the idea of non-stop travel was too tempting, for there was always just one more country over the border, always that little bit further to go. And what did the extra miles cost us? Nothing. We were not completely uninterested in culture. But this was a first holiday without parents, as it was for most other Inter-Railers, and in organizing our own timetable we left out everything except the most immediately available sights. This was the chance to escape the guided tour, an opportunity to do something different. I took great pride in the fact that, in many places, all I could be bothered to see was the view from the station. We were just there to get by, and to have a good time doing so. In this, we were no different from most of the other Inter-Railers with whom we shared corridor floors, food and water, money, and music. The excitement of travel comes from the sudden reality of somewhere that was previously just a name. It is as if the city in which you arrive never actually existed until the train pulls in at the station and you are able to see it with your own tired eyes for the first time. Only by actually seeing Europe, by watching the changing landscapes and seeing the differences in attitudes and lifestyles, can you really have an accurate picture of the continent in your mind. Everybody knows what is there, but it is meaningless until you view it yourself. This is what makes other people's holiday photos so boring. While the train trip won't allow you to discover anything new in the world sense, it is a valuable personal experience. Europe is a big place, and Inter-Rail gives people the best opportunity to recognize this ... though in our case it didn't happen immediately."
FCE_37,B2,"'It is very disappointing to arrive at an airport in another country and find out that your baggage is missing. At best, you will have to wear the same clothes for hours or days until the airline finds your luggage. At worst, you might be in a different climate and have to wear clothes that are not suitable. Airlines do not often say how many bags they lose, but it is common for regular travelers to lose their luggage at some point. Even the best airlines make mistakes, and no airline can promise that your checked luggage will be on the same flight, especially if you have to change planes. 
Airlines ask passengers to check in early to give enough time for baggage to be loaded onto the plane. Minimum connecting times (MCTs) are the shortest times needed to transfer between flights, and these are also longer to allow for baggage transfers. Usually, the system works well. But extra security checks and air traffic problems can delay flights and cause the baggage system to fail. Human error or accidents, like a torn destination label, can also cause problems. These issues can be worse at large airports, called 'hubs', because they handle many bags. For example, last year, London's Heathrow airport had over 41 million passengers, with nine million changing planes. British Airways alone had two million transfer passengers at Heathrow, mostly moving between Terminal 1 and Terminal 4. Even efficient airports like Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Singapore, and Zurich have bad days. The risk of losing baggage is higher at some airports. In the United States, Miami airport is known for losing luggage when passengers connect to flights to Latin America.
To avoid losing your luggage, choose direct flights when possible and check in early. If you must change planes or want a cheaper flight, try to fly with the same airline. Allow more time for connections by taking an earlier flight to the transfer airport, and label your luggage inside and out with your home and holiday addresses. Include the flight numbers. If your luggage still goes missing, contact the airline official in the baggage hall and fill out a property irregularity report (PIR) before leaving the airport.'"
FCE_2,B2,"'The Kingfisher Wildlife photographer Charlie James is an expert on the kingfisher, a beautiful blue-green bird that lives near streams and rivers and eats fish. Old trees hang over the stream, shading the shallow water. The main colors are soft greens, mud browns, and the different yellows of sunlight, as gentle as the sounds of water in the breeze. The bird moves quickly through the scene, like a flash of light and motion. It disappears in a second, but the image stays in your mind, its power bigger than its size. Charlie James loved kingfishers from a young age. He cannot explain exactly why he is so drawn to this little bird. The kingfisher is part of many legends. In Greek myth, the kingfisher was a moon goddess who became a bird. Another story says the kingfisher flew so high that its top became the blue of the sky, and its bottom was burned by the sun. There is some truth in this story. Even though kingfishers look blue, their feathers have no blue pigment. Instead, the structure of their feathers reflects light and makes them look blue. This is why a kingfisher can look bright blue or rich green, depending on the light. It's no surprise that some wildlife photographers love them. The colors and the fact that kingfishers can be watched from a hideout make them a favorite subject. Charlie James's first hideout was an old blanket he put over his head while he waited near a kingfisher's favorite spot. The bird came back in minutes and sat just a meter away. But it took him four years to get his first good picture. During this time, the European kingfisher became very important in his life. He spent as much time as he could by a stream full of kingfishers. But school took away time with the birds, so he missed classes and did not do well in school. However, his interest in the kingfisher, the only one of its family to breed in Europe, was noticed. At 16, he was hired as an advisor for a nature magazine. He then worked as an assistant to the editor and later became a freelance wildlife film cameraman. Now, he wants to make the best kingfisher film. 'No speech, just beautiful images that say it all,' he says. 'I like to photograph parts of kingfisher wings ...' He stops speaking, thinking of the bird's colors that still excite him. His photos show some of his feelings, but Charlie knows there is more to his relationship with the kingfisher than his work can show.'"

Anne Manson, 30, got a big chance when she asked to watch conductor Claudio Abbado's practice in Vienna. She ended up replacing an absent assistant and was later asked to help with another opera. ""I had to lead the first rehearsal for Abbado. No, I wasn't nervous. I always felt comfortable in front of an orchestra."" Anne, who is from America, works with a London opera company that focuses on modern music. She is also becoming known in other European countries, thanks to support from the British Arts Council. Since her first opportunity, she has helped Abbado with several projects.
**B. ANDREW CONSTANTINE**  
Andrew Constantine, 31, says the hardest part of being a conductor is convincing people to give you the right chances. He won a big competition in 1991 after failing in two others. Looking back, he thinks the timing was perfect: ""If it had happened earlier, I might have disappeared."" The competition gave him many chances to perform and work as an assistant to a famous conductor. However, he worries about being known only for the competition: ""If in three years my name is still linked to it, I'll be concerned."" But orchestras like the English Chamber Orchestra, which hired him after the competition, are inviting him back. ""If this doesn't happen, your career can fall apart.""
**C. WASFI KANI**  
Wasfi Kani, who started Pimlico Opera, enjoys the long practice time needed for opera. ""The music deserves four weeks of attention,"" says Kani, who began conducting seriously in her late twenties. After university, she worked in London's business area until Pimlico Opera became fully professional two years ago. Starting lessons with Sian Edwards was a key moment for her. ""I saw her conduct and realized she was my size. I had always been taught by much bigger people, which makes a big difference."" She likes the complexity of opera: ""There are many arguments, and you have to consider the singers' personalities.""
**D. ROGER VIGNOLES**  
""Conducting was a surprise for me, but it's very interesting,"" says Roger Vignoles, 48. It's not a strange move for him, though. He started as a musician with an opera house and worked with good conductors. Last year, he was asked to direct Handel's Agrippina from the piano at a festival, something new for him. ""It was easier than I thought. I knew the music well and what I wanted it to sound like. I tried my best to get the performance I wanted. People respect my musical ability. I'm learning from all my experiences, both in music style and performing. Now, I'll do whatever people ask to find out what I enjoy.""

In 1986, conductor Simon Rattle noticed a young assistant conductor, Wayne Marshall, and told his agent about him. Marshall, now 32, soon found himself conducting a musical in London on short notice, which was challenging. He even had to deal with musicians reading newspapers during the show: ""I was tough with them. I always gave a clear beat and got the best result I could. Many musicians don't seem to need advice from a conductor. But I'm not afraid to say what I want. If people see you're worried, it gets worse. I've never formally studied conducting, and no book tells you how to do it, but people have been kind to me. I am determined and know what I like."""
FCE_23,B2,"**Theme Parks in Britain**
If you want to take children to a theme park, there are many options in Britain. We asked five families to try some of the best parks.
**Fun Island - The Burns Family**
Last year, we visited a big theme park in the US, so we thought Fun Island might not be as exciting. But we were surprised! The park is great for young children, so our three-year-old had fun too. The kids loved the Crocodile Ride and the Giant Wheel. There is a special dodgems ride for very young kids, which was a big hit. For older kids, there are scarier rides like Splash Out, where you jump into a pool! After five hours, Steve and I were tired, but the kids wanted to stay longer. Our only complaint is that the park could have a better atmosphere and scenery. However, the staff are very helpful, and the park is clean, well-organized, and safe.
**Wonderland - The McMillan Family**
None of us had been to a theme park before, so we didn't know what to expect. We thought Oscar might be too young, but he loved it. He enjoyed the Mountain Train and Little Land, which has small models of famous buildings. The older kids liked the ferris wheel and driving toy cars on a road. We spent six hours there and appreciated the places to rest. The landscaping is beautiful, and the staff are friendly. There is something for everyone, including adults.
**Adventure World - The Jeffree Family**
After seven hours, we still had more to see. The children loved the Big Top Circus with its amazing trapeze act. We went on the Terror Line, and although the girls were scared, they enjoyed it. Their favorite ride was Running River, where you think you'll get wet, but you don't. Toy Land is fun for younger kids. The children wanted to try the new ride, Fear Factor, but they were too small for it. The park is well-designed, so even waiting in line isn't too boring. It's very clean, and the staff are great. On one ride, I couldn't sit with both girls, so a staff member offered to go with one of them.
**The Great Park - The Langridge Family**
We arrived at 1 p.m. and were disappointed that the park closed at 5 p.m. This is a great park for younger children because the rides aren't too scary. I'm usually scared, but I had fun. We all loved Exotic Travels, a boat ride that starts slow and then gets exciting. We waited 30 minutes for Lightning River, and it was over quickly! I didn't go on the Big Leap, but it looked fun for those who are brave. If the children were older, they might find it a bit boring, but they were the right age and loved it.
**Fantasy World - The Break-all Family**
The park says there is 'No Limit to the Fun,' and we agree. Europe's tallest roller-coaster, the Rocket, is very scary, according to Ben. Jennie thought the Hanger, where you hang upside-down 30 meters above the ground, was even scarier! There are about a dozen main rides, and the older kids went on them many times. Sarah was too small for some rides but enjoyed the Long Slide. The staff were mixed; some were great with young children, but not all were friendly. You need a full day to enjoy Fantasy World. We couldn't tell the kids we were leaving early!"

Christine Hogan runs a computer-aided design business with a yearly income of over £200,000 and has four full-time employees. She says, ""My customers are friends."" Christine and her husband moved from London to the countryside when their children were young. She wanted a job she could do from home. Before marriage, she worked with computers, so her husband suggested starting a computer-aided design business. It required a lot of money, and the beginning was tough. Christine was careful with spending and always informed the bank manager if she might overspend. Working from home saves money, and she can work in the evenings if needed. The business remains small, and local customers usually pick up their work.

Maggy Sasanow designs greeting cards from home. She says, ""I enjoy being independent."" Maggy studied art at university and wanted to work in a museum, but after marrying and moving to the countryside, she couldn't find such work. She started her own business, creating 50 different greeting cards sold to museums. She works in a large room upstairs. A downside of working from home is the constant household tasks, like mowing the lawn. Her business grows through word of mouth, without advertising. People send work from London because she is cheaper than other artists. Although she misses exchanging ideas with others, she finds more advantages than disadvantages.
**C. Delia Turner**  
Delia Turner has a curtain-making business that has faced ups and downs. She started eight years ago when the business was growing, and her income increased from £24,000 to £80,000 in two years. She managed six full-time workers but had to let them go due to economic decline, which was hard because jobs are scarce in the area. Now, she makes curtains at home with her husband's help and hires women who work from their homes. Delia is ready to lower prices when needed and explore new opportunities.
**D. Tessa Strickland**  
Tessa Strickland manages the editorial and production side of her children's book publishing business from her farmhouse. She moved to the countryside three years ago for financial reasons and because she loves the country. Tessa enjoys working when she wants. Most of her income comes from deals with Australia, the Far East, and North America, so she takes calls at odd hours. The challenge is having the discipline to stop working. She publishes children's books from different cultures, collaborating with authors and artists. Initially, she felt lonely because all her professional experience was in London.
**E. Meg Rivers**  
Meg Rivers runs a cakes-by-post business and a shop with a yearly income of £250,000, employing six people, some part-time. She started ten years ago at home, interested in health, making fruit cakes with quality ingredients. Friends and relatives began requesting cakes, and soon she was sending them across the country. Seven years ago, she rented a small building where everything is made, with a baker, assistant, and professional cake decorator. Meg now manages the business side and doesn't bake. Her biggest challenge has been the financial side, as they didn't have much money to start with."
FCE_1,B2,"**Meet the Amazing Watkins Family**
The Watkins family is special because they are all involved in music. The sons, Paul and Huw, are talented musicians and composers, and their father, John, makes musical instruments. 
When Paul was ten years old, he needed a cello. His parents, John and Hetty, found that buying one was very expensive. John, who was a schoolteacher in South Wales, decided to try making one himself. He took evening classes at the Welsh School of Instrument Making for about three years. After making a few violins and violas, he made his first cello for Paul. It was so good that Paul used it until recently. John now makes violins full-time and even sold one to a famous American musician, Jaime Laredo.
Paul and Huw started playing music when they were young. Paul first played the piano and then became interested in the cello. He was inspired by a cellist in his father's music group. Huw, on the other hand, chose to play the piano and compose music. He admired Paul's success and wanted to achieve his own.
Paul, now 28, won a major music competition with his father's cello and became the principal cellist of the BBC Symphony Orchestra at age 20. He recently started using a very old and valuable cello, a Francesco Rugeri, which is on loan from the Royal Academy of Music. Paul will soon perform on television with this cello, but he won't be able to watch it because he has a concert the same night. Huw, now 22, will also be busy, as his String Quartet will be performed in London for the first time.
John and Hetty are proud of their sons and try to keep up with their busy musical careers."

Gareth says a warden needs common sense and must be good with people because they work with farmers, visitors, conservationists, and builders. Gareth grew up on the Lleyn Peninsula and worked on his parents' farm until he got married. About 80 people wanted the job of National Trust Warden for the Lleyn Peninsula. Gareth got the job because of his local knowledge and farming experience, even though he didn't have formal training. He still helps on his parents' farm, which helps him understand farmers' problems. His farming background also helps him with the physical work like building fences, planting trees, and making walls. Since joining the Trust, Gareth has learned more about nature conservation. He remembers collecting flowers and bird nests as a child and realizes now that farming has changed the countryside. He says it's not the farmers' fault because they followed government advice. When Gareth started, farmers and conservationists disagreed, but now they talk and understand each other better. Gareth's work includes conservation, allowing public access to Trust land, planting trees, and meeting with tenant farmers. He makes sure jobs are done well and cheaply. He enjoys seeing projects finished, although he spends a lot of time on paperwork. Gareth loves his job, even though he is always working. He likes talking to the public, but some people annoy him when they act like they own the place. If you have common sense and like outdoor work, you might want to be a warden like Gareth. But don't expect a job on the Lleyn Peninsula to open up soon!'"
FCE_55,B2,"**The Netball Captain**
In our series on women in sport, Suzie Ellis met England's netball captain. Kendra Slowinski is the captain of England's netball team. When I met her, she had a typical day before next month's World Championships: teaching at a local school and then training in the supermarket car park. I asked her, ""Don't you get strange looks?"" She replied, ""I'm too focused on my movements and my feet to notice anything else. I might see cars slow down, but that's all.""
""My whole life now is about being my best for the Championships,"" says Kendra. ""I'm on a strict schedule to be as fit as possible."" These are her fourth World Championships, and they will be the biggest ever, with 27 countries taking part. ""We'll have home support, which is special,"" she says. ""It's important to improve netball's reputation in this country. Playing here means more pressure. A home crowd will expect us to start with a good game.""
Their first game is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. ""As far as I know, we have always beaten them, but they'll be exciting to play. They have lots of skill."" The England team is currently ranked fourth in the world. But, as Kendra points out, the World Championships will be tough. ""You have to push yourself to play each day, there's no rest between games. In a series, you can still win if you lose the first game. But the Championships are different because there's only one chance.""
In the fifteen years since she started playing at the top level, the sport has become harder and faster. On the court, players are more aggressive. ""You don't train so hard not to win,"" says Kendra. ""But once the final whistle blows, you become a different person. We're all friendlier after the game.""
Netball is also more scientific about fitness testing. ""We must think and train like world-class players,"" says Kendra. ""As captain, I need a strong mental attitude and to lead by example. I support and encourage the team.""
""From the start, my netball career has been carefully planned,"" she says. ""I decided some time ago that this competition would be my last as a player."" She will likely coach young players in the future, but now she is focused on her last big event. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she might have a tear in her eye."
FCE_50,B2,"**SPECIALIST MUSIC SCHOOLS**
How can parents help a child with great musical talent? It is not always easy to know the best way to support their gift. Some parents might not notice their child's needs until the child becomes frustrated and behaves badly. Most schools can help children who are good at academic subjects, but musically talented children need special support that regular schools might not offer, especially if music is not a main focus there. These children, and those encouraged by parents or teachers, might benefit from attending a specialist music school.
There are five specialist music schools in Britain. These schools are quite new and aim to create a supportive environment for talented children aged seven to eighteen. Here, they can develop their skills with the help of professional musicians. At these schools, children spend one third to half of their day on music activities, like individual lessons, playing in orchestras, singing, conducting, and learning music theory. They also practice for several hours a day in special rooms, sometimes with a teacher. The rest of their time is spent on a limited academic program, focusing on important subjects like English, maths, basic sciences, and languages. Students can also study more subjects if they want.
All five British specialist schools are independent, with small classes and many teachers. Most students live at the school full-time, which means they spend their important growing years with others who have similar interests.
What are the downsides? One big issue is the cost; fees are high (PS12,000-PS17,000 a year for boarders). However, schools try to help parents of very talented children with scholarships and financial aid. Also, not all parents want to send their children to boarding school, especially at a young age. School directors often question if it is wise to admit children as young as seven into such a strict environment. They do say their main goal is to help children become well-rounded individuals.
There is a risk that separating musically talented children early can cause stress. Musical talent might fade during teenage years, and the pressure to succeed can lead to a feeling of failure. But specialist schools watch each student's progress closely and offer help if needed. Many former students feel they gained a lot from the excellent music teaching, but some worry about the limited academic program, which is less important than music activities. Many musically talented young people are also very smart and can handle academic challenges, so they might feel unhappy if their academic needs are not met.
For these reasons, it might be better to wait until the child is old enough to decide if they want a specialist education. Children who are also good at academics might do well in a less specialized school, like one with a strong music department, or by combining regular school with music training at a junior music college. These colleges offer Saturday morning lessons with great teachers and group music experiences. However, this option might not work for families who live far from big cities like London."

Artist Susan Shepherd is famous for her flower paintings. Her large garden around her house gives her many ideas for her art. The garden is full of her favorite flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some plants grow wildly and spread seeds everywhere. The garden has a nice mix of colors, shapes, and structures, thanks to the previous owners who loved gardening. They left plants that Susan liked, and she also got their gardener, Danny. Susan says, ""It was really his garden."" They worked well together. At first, Danny didn't agree with some of Susan's ideas, but when she explained she wanted to paint them, he understood.
Susan likes to paint detailed pictures of single plants rather than the whole garden. Sometimes she paints groups of plants where they are, but usually, she picks them and takes them to her studio. She says, ""I don't set the whole thing up at once."" She paints one flower at a time, which can take a few days, and then adds more flowers. Sometimes, it takes a couple of years to finish a painting.
Her busiest time is spring and early summer when tulips and poppies bloom. ""They all come out together, and you're so busy,"" she says. She also enjoys watching the flowers change as they age. For example, tulips change shape and open up when left in water. At first, they seem boring, but they twist and turn over time.
Susan has always loved plants. She studied botany in school and collected wildflowers. She didn't like garden flowers back then because they looked fake to her. She was fascinated by wildflowers growing in difficult places like rocks or cliffs.
Today, her garden has many plants from faraway places, but they fit well in her garden. She has a relaxed attitude towards her garden, like a kind aunt who lets children play freely as long as they don't cause harm. With two exhibitions coming up and many flowers to paint, she finds it hard to work in the garden. She now has an extra gardener, but she knows that to stay connected with her art, ""you have to get your hands dirty."""
FCE_34,B2,"**Keeping the Holiday-Makers Happy**
Sarah Sutherland-Pilch, a 24-year-old from West Sussex, works as a chalet girl in Val d'Isère, France. This is her second year doing this job. People call her by her nickname, Pilch. She works for a company that provides cooking and cleaning services for visitors who come to ski and stay in chalets, which are wooden houses typical of the area.
Sarah studied French and History of Art at Oxford Brookes University and graduated last summer. She says being a chalet girl is not a career, but a fun way to spend a year or two before starting a more permanent job. ""It's a good way to meet successful people,"" she says.
Sarah does not live in the chalet. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks about a mile to the chalet, which can host up to 18 guests each week. She has her own breakfast before preparing breakfast for the guests. ""They get everything - porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants."" After the guests finish breakfast, around 9:30 a.m., Sarah cleans up and either prepares afternoon tea or cleans the rooms, which she says is ""the worst part of the job."" By 11 a.m., she is ready to go skiing. She tries to ski as much as possible. ""On a good day, we can ski until 4:30 p.m.""
Sarah returns to the chalet to prepare dinner and takes a shower before starting, but she does not nap. ""It's a bad idea if you do,"" she says. Dinner is a three-course meal served at 8 p.m., and coffee is usually ready by 10 p.m. Sarah cleans up after dinner and loads the dishwasher. ""There's nothing worse than a messy kitchen in the morning."" Sometimes she chats with the guests, other times they prefer to be left alone. ""Good guests can make a week great, but some weeks don't go as well.""
Sarah meets her friends at the chalet where she lives, and they go out around 11 p.m. ""We usually start at Bananas, might go to G Jay's, and maybe end at Dick's T-Bar,"" she says. But she never stays out too late on Saturday night because Sunday is her busiest day. ""A tough day,"" she says, ""when you don't want to be tired while cooking breakfast.""
On Sunday, work starts earlier because breakfast must be ready by 7 a.m. After the guests leave, Sarah cleans quickly. ""We clean everything - clear breakfast, strip the beds, get everything ready."" If she hasn't done the week's shopping on Saturday, she does it now. Around 3 p.m., after cleaning, Sarah prepares tea for the new guests. ""They arrive around 4:30 p.m. Sometimes they are confused and have many questions. I think it's the mountain air.""
Between tea and dinner, Sarah helps guests who need boots or skis by taking them to the ski shop and then gets a ride back to the chalet. Soon, it's time for dinner again and maybe a chat with friends, but not always. ""Sometimes I'm so tired I just go to bed early,"" she says."
FCE_12,B2,"'Changing lives with a Stranger Mandie Currie, a zoo-keeper, spent the day in the offices of the magazine Marie Claire. 'Choosing what to wear for my day at Marie Claire was difficult because I usually wear a uniform at work. First, I went to a photo studio, then to see new fashion items, all before lunch. The zoo is a calm, peaceful place - and here I was rushing around when I could be sitting quietly with an animal. Some of the fashion team seemed quite stressed - my job doesn't really get stressful. At a fashion shoot in the afternoon, it made me laugh to think that I'd usually be cleaning cages or handling rats. I'm interested to see how magazines work, but I really enjoy my job at the zoo so I'll stay there.' Alice Cutler, a fashion assistant at Marie Claire, spent the day at London Zoo. 'I arrived at the zoo in my leather boots and dark blue trousers. The zoo gave me a green polo shirt to work in - which was good, as I got very dirty. As I touched one of the elephants, I thought Mandie would probably be packing up clothes in the cupboard. By five o'clock, I smelled bad but I'd had such a great day. When I stop working in fashion, I could see myself working with elephants - but maybe in Africa.' Karen Hodson, a nurse at Hammersmith Hospital, went on location with the television gardening programme Ground Force. 'I was very excited about meeting the team, and Alan Titchmarsh, the programme presenter, was really nice. One of the things I liked was the chance to be outside. Depending on my shifts, I sometimes never see daylight. Even though it was hard work, it was great fun. I thought I was pretty strong but I felt weak compared with the rest of the team. My idea of landscape gardening had not included hard work or careful planning. I was more an enthusiastic than effective gardener, so I don't plan to leave my other job.' Charlie Dimmock, landscape gardener with the TV programme Ground Force, worked a shift at Hammersmith Hospital. 'I made beds and gave out tablets. I expected to faint when I was doing some jobs, but I was surprised to find that it didn't bother me. The friendship among the nurses is great, and it felt very 'girlie' compared with my normal male environment. I feel my job is a real waste of time compared with nursing. My day at the hospital was not exactly pleasant but it left me with a great sense of satisfaction.' Lucy Harvey, a personal trainer, spent the day with the airline Ryanair as a member of the cabin crew. 'I changed into the uniform, and the moment I put it on I felt completely different - people suddenly look up to you. Before the flight, our supervisor told us about safety, what to do if someone had a heart attack - which I knew about from my fitness training. When the passengers boarded the flight to Paris I gave out magazines. Everyone stared at me and I felt very self-conscious. On the return journey, we had 80 schoolchildren on board who wouldn't sit still. I wished I was back in the gym with one sensible adult to look after.' Sonia McDermott, an air hostess with the airline Ryanair, spent the day as a personal trainer in a gym. 'I was worried about doing this swap as I don't do any exercise. I was amazed at how much attention you give to one person. In my job, you meet 130 passengers four times a day. I was very surprised at lunch to see that some of the trainers didn't eat very healthily, but they all drink lots of water. I wouldn't swap my job for this. However, it has inspired me to join a gym and try to be a bit healthier.''"

**A. Andrea Thompson - Newsreader**  
I fell in love with the south of France a long time ago and try to go back often. There's a local train from Cannes along the coast that crosses into Italy. It takes you past amazing sea views. No matter the weather or time of year, it is always beautiful. Out of the other window, you can see some of the best gardens and homes in France. You feel like you are looking into the lives of the rich and famous. The travelers are always lively because there is a mix of tourists and locals, all enjoying the breathtaking journey.
**B. Raj Patel - Explorer**  
I have enjoyed many train journeys, but my favorite is the Nile Valley Express, which goes across the desert in northern Sudan. When I was young in South Africa, I missed a family train trip from Cape Town to the Kruger National Park because I was too young and troublesome. When I moved to England as a teenager, I still hadn't traveled by train. London Waterloo was the first real station I saw, and its great glass dome amazed me.
**C. Betty Cooper - Novelist**  
I am grateful to one train in particular: the Blue Train, which took my husband and me on our honeymoon across France to catch a boat to Egypt. On the train, my husband gave me a pink dress, which I loved. Someone said pink is good for the brain, and I've worn it ever since. What I remember about the journey is how lovely it was to travel through France and then by boat up the Nile to Luxor. It was the perfect way to relax after the wedding.
**D. Martin Brown - Journalist**  
We were working on a series of articles about a round-the-world trip and had to cross a desert in an African country. There wasn't a road, so we took the Desert Express. The timetable was unreliable - we were just given a day. We heard the driver would wait for days if he knew people were still coming. When it appeared, hundreds of people climbed into and onto the carriages - people even traveled on the roof for free. During the night, the train crossed some of the most beautiful landscapes I have ever seen. It was like a dream, like traveling across the moon.
**E. Arisu Mezuki - Actress**  
Most people form their favorite train memories as children, but not me. I grew up in Singapore and Cyprus, where I saw very few trains. It wasn't until I was a teenager that trains became important to me. I made a film featuring a railway in Yorkshire. Most filming was on an old, unused line maintained by volunteers. That's where my love for steam trains began. When we weren't filming, we rode the train, and when I went back last year, it was like time had stood still. Everything was still there, even the gas lights on the station platform!"
FCE_8,B2,"'Want to get published? If you are thinking about where to send your story, our expert Margaret Stubbs has the advice you need. Readers of this magazine often ask, 'I have written this story/book. Can you tell me who to send it to?' The first thing they need to know is that they should research their markets and learn about publishers while improving their writing skills. Turning words into something you can sell requires a lot of knowledge about the 'writing game'. Whatever kind of writing you do, you need to know about the markets you are aiming for. There are several ways to do this, but the best one is by reading everything relevant you can find. Use your local library and visit local bookshops and newsagents. Reading widely will help you understand what kinds of writing publishers are accepting at any given time. This knowledge must be updated as new publications appear, editors change jobs, and magazines change direction. New titles come and go all the time. Publishers are always looking for new writers; as writers, we have to make sure we give them what they want. At first, you may not be sure what you want to write. Let's say you want to write short love stories. The first thing you must do is find out which magazines use love stories, a rather limited market these days, and get as many recent copies as you can. Then, learn about the kind of stories they are buying, paying attention to who the readers are. These readers expect different things from their magazine, and the editor is only interested in meeting their needs. Writers often send me their stories saying, 'This has been rejected three times - please tell me if I am wasting my time ... do I stand a chance at all?' As a former teacher, I would never discourage anyone. But it is unlikely that the work is ready to be published; so I try to give an honest opinion, but always with a positive viewpoint. The problem is that most new writers are too eager to send their work out, usually long before they are ready to enter the market. If you have only written one story or one article, it is not likely to be published. That almost never happens. When you read about 'success', you usually find that the person has been in the publishing trade or journalism for some years before their current success. When you finally send off some of your work for the first time, immediately start on more work while you wait for a reply; write ten more stories, twenty even. Each one will be better than the last, and you will start to think of yourself as a writer, and both your fluency and your confidence will grow. Don't throw any of them away—improve them instead. Also, I advise not showing your work to anyone else, especially in the early stages. Remember that every successful writer has had many rejections before succeeding. Do everything you can to advance your career as a writer. See if there's a creative writing course near you. If not, try joining a local writers' group to gain ideas and confidence from mixing with other aspiring writers. Think of yourself as a writer and practice writing—every day if possible.'"
FCE_4,B2,"'No Title On the last day of a bad year, I was leaning against a pillar in the Baltimore railway station, waiting for the 10.10 train to Philadelphia. There were more people than I expected. The station didn't feel as airy and clean as usual. Elderly couples with matching luggage filled the benches, and college students sat on the floor with their bags. A grey-haired man was walking around, talking to strangers one by one. He looked well-off: tanned skin, nice sweater, and a soft, beige coat. He asked a woman sitting alone a question, then approached a girl near me. She had long blond hair, and I thought I might like to talk to her. The man asked, 'Are you travelling to Philadelphia?' 'Well, northbound, yes,' she said. 'But to Philadelphia?' 'No, New York, but I'll be ...' 'Thanks, anyway,' he said, moving to the next bench. Now he had my full attention. 'Ma'am,' I heard him ask an old lady, 'are you travelling to Philadelphia?' When she said, 'Wilmington,' he didn't say anything, just moved on to a couple with matching luggage. I stood up from my pillar and moved closer, pretending to look at the train platform. I was going to Philadelphia. He could have asked me. I understood why he didn't. I probably seemed unreliable. He glanced at me quickly and then moved to the bench at the other end. He looked stressed. 'Please!' he said to a woman reading a book. 'Tell me you're going to Philadelphia!' She lowered her book. She was around thirty-five, older than me. A school-teacher type. 'Philadelphia?' she said. 'Yes, I am.' 'Could I ask you a favour?' I stopped a few feet away and looked at my left wrist. (I don't own a watch.) Even without looking, I could tell she was cautious. The man must have noticed too, because he said, 'Nothing too difficult, I promise!' They announced my train. People started moving toward Gate E, the older couples pulling their wheeled bags like big pets. I heard the man talking. 'My daughter's flying out this afternoon for a study year abroad, leaving from Philadelphia. I put her on a train this morning, stopped for groceries, and came home to find my wife upset. My daughter forgot her passport. She called from the station in Philadelphia; she didn't know what to do.' The woman clucked sympathetically. I would have stayed quiet, waiting to see where he was going with this. 'I told her to stay there. I would find someone here to take her passport.' A likely story! Why didn't he go himself if it was so urgent? 'Why don't you go yourself?' the woman asked. 'I can't leave my wife alone for that long. She's in a wheelchair.' This seemed like a poor excuse, in my opinion. Also, it was too much bad luck for one family. I looked at them. The man was holding a packet, not a plain envelope, which would have been logical, but a padded envelope the size of a paperback book. Aha! Padded! So you couldn't feel the contents! And from where I stood, it looked stapled shut. Watch yourself, lady, I thought silently.'"
FCE_30,B2,"**Gary and Me**
John Moore, a restaurant owner, writes about his relationship with his son Gary, who is a famous TV chef. 
I believe everyone gets a chance in life. My son, Gary, got his chance with cooking, and my chance was to run a restaurant. When I heard about the opportunity, I quickly went to see the place. It was in very bad condition, but it was perfect for what I wanted. Starting this business reminded me of my childhood. I remember my mother going to work in a factory, and I was upset because I was left alone. So, I thought, 'We need time for family life.' My wife took care of the children and did all my accounts, while I ran the business. We lived above the restaurant then, and we always made sure to have meals together. This was good for our children, Gary and Joe. They are both very confident. From a young age, they would come down and talk to our regular customers. This gave them a great start in life.
Gary was a lively child. When he was about seven, he tried to jump into a corner bath like it was a swimming pool and knocked himself out. When he was older, he had to work for pocket money. He started with small jobs, and by the age of ten, he was in the kitchen every weekend, so he always had money at school. He was disciplined. He used to wake up even before me in the morning. In a family business, it's for the family, and it was nice to see him helping out. Gary wasn't very good at school, but he was great in the kitchen. By the age of 15, he was as good as any of the men working there, and sometimes he was even in charge. He would make over a hundred meals, and I knew he would go into catering because he had talent. So when he told me, 'Dad, I need to do work experience for school,' I sent him to a friend who has a restaurant.
Gary recently started playing the drums and now has his own band. I wonder what will happen to his cooking if the music becomes successful. My advice to Gary is: if you try to do two things at once, you might not succeed in either, so focus on what you know you can do well. He understood when I said, 'Gary, if you want to achieve something in life, you need to do it by the age of 30. If you haven't done it by then, it's too late.' Gary went to catering college at 17, and on his first day, he and the other new students, who are usually beginners, were given a morning's work. But within an hour, Gary had chopped all his vegetables and sliced all his meats. He had prepared everything. That's my son! In the end, he was helping other people.
None of us can believe how successful Gary's TV cooking show has become. I'm very proud of him. I've always told him that if you want something, you have to work very hard for it because no one gives you anything. He saw the opportunity he was given and took it with both hands. You talk to your children as they grow up, and if they remember even ten percent of what you tell them, you should be happy. The things Gary says and does make me think he must have listened sometimes."
FCE_7,B2,"Finding a good flat in Dublin at an affordable price was very difficult. The best way was through personal contacts: if you knew someone who knew someone leaving a place, that often worked. But if, like Jo, you had just arrived in Dublin, you had no personal contacts, no one to tell you about a vacant bedsit. So, you had to stay in a hostel and search. For Jo, Dublin was a big unknown. She felt she was stepping into the unknown when she took the train to work there. She didn't question why she was going. Everyone at her school assumed she would leave. Who would stay in a small, boring town? That's all she heard for years. Everyone wanted to leave, see life, and have a real existence. Some of her classmates went to towns like Ennis or Limerick, where family would help them settle. But no one from Jo's year was going to Dublin. She was going alone. Jo's mother thought it would be great if she stayed in the hostel permanently. It was run by nuns, so she would be safe. Her father hoped they kept it warm; hostels were known for being cold. Jo's sisters, who worked as waitresses, thought she was crazy to stay a whole week in a hostel. But Jo didn't know they were still thinking and talking about her as she answered an ad for a flat in Ringsend. It said, 'Own room, own television, share kitchen, bathroom.' It was close to the post office where she worked and seemed too good to be true. Please let it be nice, let them like me, let it not be too expensive! There wasn't a queue because it was more 'Third Girl Wanted' than 'Flat to Let'. The 'own television' part made Jo wonder if it was too fancy for her, but the house looked ordinary. It was a red-brick terraced house with a basement. The flat was upstairs. A cheerful girl with a college scarf, who was obviously not chosen, was coming down the stairs. 'Desperate place,' she said to Jo. 'They're both awful. Common as dirt.' 'Oh,' said Jo and continued climbing. 'Hello,' said the girl with 'Nessa' on her T-shirt. 'Did you see that snobby girl leaving? I can't stand her type.' 'What did she do?' asked Jo. 'Do? She didn't have to do anything. She just looked around, made a face, and said, ""Is this all there is? Oh dear, oh dear,"" in a posh accent. We wouldn't have her here, would we, Pauline?' Pauline wore a very colorful shirt, almost as bright as her hair. Pauline was a punk, Jo noted with surprise. She had seen punks on O'Connell Street but hadn't talked to one. 'I'm Jo, I work in the post office and I called.' Nessa said they were about to have tea. She brought out three mugs; one said 'Nessa', one said 'Pauline', and the other said 'Other'. 'We'll put your name on it if you stay,' she said kindly."
FCE_43,B2,"'Behind the dolphin's smile People love dolphins. We like to see them in seaside marinas, films, and TV shows. But the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society says dolphins are in trouble. Mark Simmonds talks about the decline of dolphins. Dolphins are special to us. They are very intelligent, understand human feelings, and make us dream of freedom in the wild seas. TV has made us love them more. First, there was Flipper, and now there's Darwin from Seaquest. However, these happy images hide the truth about dolphins living in polluted and overfished seas. The number of North Sea harbour porpoises (a type of dolphin) has dropped by up to 89,000. You might think such popular animals are protected by law and live in special marine areas. But this is not true, and not having plans to protect them could become a big wildlife problem. There are forty different kinds of dolphins worldwide. In northern Europe, the most common dolphins are the striped, the common, the bottlenose dolphins, and the smaller harbour porpoise. The first two usually live far out in the sea. They are seen only in small groups, quickly passing ships, and we know little about them. The large grey bottlenoses and harbour porpoises used to be common near European coasts. Bottlenoses are very social and were found on the Channel coast and in river mouths in Britain, like the Thames. Now, they are only found in the Moray Firth in Scotland and Cardigan Bay in Wales. The few that remain show skin injuries, indicating stress. Dolphins' complex habits make it hard to know why their numbers are falling. Overfishing, which is reducing the world's fish stocks and threatening local fishing industries, also threatens porpoises and dolphins. Porpoises need to find food quickly. If fish are removed by fishing, they may not survive long enough to find food elsewhere. They can also get caught in fishermen's nets, which they cannot see. Many modern fishing methods use huge nets that float or are pulled quickly through the sea. Recently, hundreds of dead dolphins have washed up on the beaches of France and Cornwall. Marks, ropes, and cuts on their bodies show they died because they were caught in these nets. Waste and other substances in the sea can build up in dolphins' bodies. For example, pesticides dissolve in fat, so dolphins can digest them, and they build up in their bodies. Female dolphins then produce milk rich in pesticides, passing the poison to their young. There is a case of a young dolphin being poisoned and killed by its mother's milk. But perhaps the most controversial threat to dolphins is human disturbance. Dolphins live in groups and get information about their world through sound. In the sea, noise pollution from ships, oil wells, and more is transmitted four times more efficiently than in the air. This may disturb dolphins in ways we do not yet understand.'"
FCE_51,B2,"**GETTING FIT**
Exercise is very important for your mind, body, and spirit. It helps you stay balanced when life feels busy and stressful. You might think, ""Oh no, another article about fitness!"" But there are many good reasons to exercise, and not many reasons not to. 
Exercise makes your muscles stronger and changes your body shape quickly. It helps you stand or sit with good posture, which means holding your body correctly. This can stop muscle problems that might cause injuries. Exercise also helps your heart, lungs, and blood circulation. 
You might have heard these reasons before and feel bored. But did you know exercise can help with depression, tiredness, and stress? It can also help with some medical conditions. 
There are many types of exercise you can try, like aerobics, jogging, or lifting weights. But be careful not to train too hard or with too much weight, as this can cause injuries. Start slowly and carefully. If you are unsure, ask your doctor what is best for you.
Good posture is important too. It affects how you look and feel. A stiff or slouching body can be unattractive and have less energy. If you slouch, imagine a balloon pulling your head up to the sky. This helps you stand straighter and breathe better. It also makes your body look slimmer.
Stretching your muscles makes you more flexible and helps prevent injuries. Stretching should be part of your exercise routine and should be done slowly and carefully. 
The best exercise routine includes a good warm-up, stretching, an energetic workout, and a cool-down period."
FCE_11,B2,"**IN THEIR NATURAL HABITAT**
What makes film-makers Amanda Barrett and Owen Newman leave their home comforts for months? They are looking for the perfect shot. In the jungles and plains of East Africa, two of the hardest people to find are producer Amanda Barrett and cameraman Owen Newman. They are currently in the Ngorongoro Crater, which has had six months of almost continuous rain, causing many problems. Newman explained that they had to buy an expensive tool so that whenever one of their vehicles gets stuck in the mud, Amanda can pull him back to safety. Their teamwork has created some of TV's best wildlife films, like their amazing film on leopards. Even while this film about Africa's shyest cats was being shown, they were already back in the wild, this time following another shy animal, the jackal. This is common in television partnerships. Travelling film-makers have been going around the world to film exotic wildlife since television began. I talked to Newman about their partnership while he was at a safari lodge. 'We do have occasional arguments but we get over them quickly,' he says about his colleague. Neither of them sees themselves as the leader, and he says they get along well because they both see the animals in a similar way. 'When we are moving, we have to set up our tents each night. But this time we have a more fixed camp, and since we start at 5 a.m. each morning, we make the tea the night before and keep it warm in a vacuum flask.' The rest of their daily food is pre-packed meals heated by whoever is available. 'It's not unusual for us to be out for up to eight weeks at a time, so food can be a problem,' says Newman. It can be a tough life, but being alone in such remote areas allows them to get close to the animals. Newman remembers filming a family of lions where one lioness would greet their car as part of her routine. Newman first worked with Barrett in 1988 on a film called 'The Great Rift', and two years later they filmed Arctic foxes together. Since then, they spend four months on location to gather enough material for each half-hour film. Before they start, they must submit a script for approval. 'Amanda and I had a good working relationship from the start,' says Newman, 'because we shared the same ideas and vision. We want to make films that are rich in atmosphere, show the true spirit of the place and animals, and touch people's hearts. I believe if you can make people feel something, that is better than just making them think.'"
FCE_14,B2,"**The Netball Captain**
In our series on women in sport, Suzie Ellis met England's netball captain, Kendra Slawinski. Kendra is the captain of England's netball team. When I met her, she had a typical day for the weeks before next month's World Championships: teaching at a local school and then training in the local supermarket car park. I was surprised about her training place. 'Don't people look at you strangely?' I asked. 'I'm too focused on my movements and my feet to notice,' she said. 'I might see cars slow down, but that's all.'
'My whole life now is about being my best for the Championships,' says Kendra. 'I'm on a strict schedule to get as fit as possible.' These are her fourth World Championships, and they will be the biggest ever, with 27 countries taking part. 'We'll have home support, which is special,' she says. 'It's important to improve netball's reputation in this country. Playing here means more pressure. A home crowd will expect us to start with a good game.' Their first game is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. 'As far as I know, we have always beaten them, but they are exciting to play. They have lots of skill.'
The England team is currently ranked fourth in the world. But, as Kendra points out, the World Championships will be tough. 'You have to push yourself to play each day, there's no rest between games. In a series, you can still win if you lose the first game. But the Championships are different because there's only one chance, and you have to be ready.'
In the fifteen years since she started playing at the top level, the sport has become harder and faster. On the court, players are more aggressive. 'You don't train so hard not to win,' says Kendra. 'But once the final whistle blows, you become a different person. We're all friendlier after the game.'
Netball is also using a more scientific approach to fitness testing. 'It's essential that we all think and train like world-class players,' says Kendra. 'As captain, I think it's important to have a strong mental attitude and lead by example. I see my role as supporting and encouraging the team.'
'From the start, my netball career has been carefully planned,' she says. 'I decided some time ago that this competition would be my last as a player.' She will probably coach young players in the future, but now she is focused on her last big event. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she might have a tear in her eye. Her loyal supporters will be with her every step of the way."
FCE_63,B2,"'In hot water Rachel Mills is a scientist who spends a lot of time at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. Rachel Mills teaches and does research in marine geochemistry, which means she studies the chemical processes in the sea. She is a lecturer at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she isn't teaching, she goes into a steel vehicle, a small underwater exploration vessel, and dives three kilometres down into the Atlantic Ocean to study underwater volcanoes. 'Inside,' she says, 'space is so small that I can touch the two pilots. They are used to these conditions, which mean we can't stand up or move and we must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can last for 16 hours - three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours gathering rock and water samples, and then three hours to get back to the surface.' 'If anything happens, and you need to get to the top quickly, you can hit a panic button. The outside drops away, leaving a small escape vessel that goes up fast, like a ping-pong ball in the bath. No-one's tested it yet, but I don't think it would be a nice journey.' 'I didn't know how I would react the first time I got into the vehicle. It was on the deck of a ship, and I got in with an instructor. He talked me through the emergency procedures, including what to do if the pilot had a heart attack! They were testing me to see how I would react in such a small place.' Now Rachel has made six dives. Last year she dived with a Russian crew. 'We went to a site five days' sail west of the Canary Islands in the Atlantic. Here, on the ocean floor, is a large area of underwater volcanoes, their chimneys blowing out black smoke. It is where the Atlantic Ocean comes alive. The Russian team was dropping off some scientific equipment there to study the effect of a multi-national programme that would make a hole 150 metres through a volcano.' When she isn't at sea, Rachel is in her office at the Oceanography Centre, Southampton. 'Two-thirds of my salary comes from teaching, which I love, but I do it so I can continue my research into the ""black smokers"". This is another name for underwater volcanoes - water comes out of the rock and looks like black smoke. This pours out at a rate of one metre per second and at a temperature of 350 degrees.' 'The only time I've been frightened was when I first went down with the Americans. We were towing equipment on a 50-metre rope when suddenly there was an explosion. There was a big bang as the shock waves hit our vehicle, and I thought, ""I'm going to die."" We stared at each other in silence, waiting. When it didn't happen, we couldn't believe it. The relief was incredible - we were still alive!' 'It's such an adventure diving down to the deepest part of the ocean. Every time I look out of the porthole and see those chimneys, there is such a sense of wonder. Here I am on the bottom of the sea, and no-one else on this planet has ever seen them before. I had studied the black smokers for three years for my Ph.D. When I got down there and saw them for real, it was such an amazing feeling.'"
FCE_56,B2,"**Interview Tips**
First impressions are very important. Studies show that people form opinions about us in the first few minutes of meeting. They notice how we dress, our eye contact, our body movements, how fast or slow we talk, our volume and tone of voice, and the words we use.
Mary Pearce studied to be a teacher. She says, ""I worked hard to earn my degree. When I graduated, I was very confident."" She applied for a job at a nearby primary school and got an interview with the Head Teacher. ""I noticed a small hole in my jacket that morning,"" she remembers. ""I would have changed, but I knew it would make me late, and I think it's important to be on time."" Mary didn't get the job. Her friend, who also teaches at the school, told her the Head Teacher said, ""If someone doesn't take the time to present her best image at an interview, what kind of teacher is she going to be?""
Simon Grant, a hotel manager, says, ""Interviewees who look like they care about themselves are more likely to care about their jobs. People think it's what's inside that counts, but in an interview, you should try to look your best."" Many people forget the importance of having a professional image. For example, Janet Goodwood worked for ten years as an administrative assistant in a large accounting firm. When the office manager retired, she applied for the position but didn't even get an interview. ""I thought it was a mistake, so I asked the Director of Personnel what happened,"" she says. ""He told me I didn't fit the image of an office manager. He suggested I improve my wardrobe before I applied again for promotion. I was shocked. I do a very good job, and the way I dress shouldn't make any difference.""
Movement and gestures also affect an interviewer's first impression. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian found that 7% of any message about our feelings and attitudes comes from the words we use, 38% from our voice, and 55% from our facial expressions. When our facial expressions and words send different messages, the listener will believe the non-verbal message more. So make sure your words match your body language. Mixed messages will confuse the interviewer.
It is also important not to seem too desperate for the job or too eager to please. When Sheila Rice, a marketing specialist, applied for a promotion, her interview went so well she was offered the job immediately. ""I was delighted,"" she recalls. ""But I reacted with too much enthusiasm. Once the boss saw how excited I was, he knew I wouldn't turn him down. So, he offered me a lower salary than I hoped for. I'm sure I could have got more if I had controlled my excitement.""
Finally, what we say and how we say it will help in an interview. David Artesio, the manager of an employment agency, suggests learning about the company before the interview. ""The annual report, for example, will tell you about the company's work. Mention an area that interests you during the interview. This will give a positive note and show your interest in the company."" Business consultant Marian Woodall suggests having a few questions ready and avoiding long, confused sentences. As she says, ""Poor communicators talk in paragraphs. Successful communicators talk in short sentences and even in highlighted points."""

**The Farmer**
Matt Froggatt used to work as an insurance agent in London, but now he runs a sheep farm. ""After 14 years in business, the City became boring and no one was having fun anymore. I didn't plan to leave for another five or ten years, but then I lost my job unexpectedly. I didn't get a big payout, but it was enough to start the farm. My big break came when I met the head chef of a local hotel with one of the top 20 hotel restaurants in the country. By supplying them, my reputation grew, and now I also sell meat by mail order. I'm happy not to be in an office anymore, but it's surprising how little has changed: I still work 80 to 90 hours a week and sell a product.""
**The Painter**
Ron Ablewhite was a manager in advertising but now works as an artist. ""Painting started as a hobby, but I found it more exciting than my job. Taking redundancy and becoming an artist seemed logical. The career counsellor I spoke to was surprised because most people in their mid-forties need to work for money. But we married young, and our children didn't need our support. It was a big change. We moved to the north of England, where we didn't know anyone. We left our friends, but they still visit us.""
**The Hatmaker**
After working for five years as a company lawyer, Katherine Goodison started her own business in her London flat, making hats for private clients. ""Being a lawyer was fun and paid well, but the hours were terrible. I didn't want to become a senior partner and work even more, so I left. Some people said I'd get bored, but that never happened. The secret is to have deadlines. In fashion, there are always collections and seasons, so there's always a lot to do. I feel happier and less stressed now. I miss socializing with colleagues, but I love being responsible for my product. If I do a bad job, it's my fault. You care more when your name is on the product.""
**The Masseur**
Paul Drinkwater worked in finance for 16 years before becoming a masseur at the Life Centre in London. ""I started in financial markets at 22, making deals. I liked the excitement, but the work wasn't rewarding. I almost lost my job in 1989, but I quit and traveled for a year to figure out what I wanted to do. I was interested in health, so I visited top gyms and talked to the owners. I knew I needed qualifications to change careers, so I took massage courses. Then I got part-time work at the Life Centre. I have no regrets. I used to feel out of control, but now I have peace of mind and control over my life. That's the best part."""
FCE_6,B2,"'Dedicated to their sports Four young sports stars talk about their lives. A Darius (runner) I've always loved sports. I tried many different ones, but I was best at football and athletics. When I was 14, I had a chance to join a professional football club, but I chose athletics instead. My biggest moment was when I competed for my country in the youth team and won a medal. Unfortunately, it didn't get much media attention, which was disappointing. I hoped to get some sponsorship because training is expensive. I train at home all winter and then go to Florida for three weeks before the season starts. It's fun there - the athletics facilities are great, and the nightlife is good too. But you have to be disciplined. If friends ask me to go out the night before training, I have to say no. I wish I didn't, but dedication is important in this sport. My main goal is to get to the next Olympics - that would be amazing. B Gabriel (surfer) The surfing community is small, so you meet the same people at competitions. Professional surfers are serious, and the best waves are often at dawn, so you have to avoid late-night parties. I don't mind that much, but I love sleeping in, and I usually have to give that up too. But it's worth it because, without dedication, I might not have won the National Championships last year. After a win, I make sure to have a big night out, and if there's prize money, I'll go somewhere nice. The sacrifices are worth it because winning the championship got me a job presenting a surfing series on TV. I guess I'm a bit of a celebrity now. C Dieter (yacht racer) With five guys on a boat, we have a lot of fun. We're traditional and always celebrate a win in style. Some say we act childishly when we're out, but we don't look for media attention. Sometimes reporters care more about where we celebrate than how we did in the race. I'm away for eight months a year, so it's nice to come back, go out with friends, and do normal things. You can't focus on the sport all the time - it's not healthy. I'm known in sailing, but I've only been recognized in the street a few times. I'd hate to be a big celebrity. I get nice letters from people asking for signed pictures, and I reply to every one. It takes time, but it's worth it. D Tomas (tennis player) It's great to walk on court and feel the crowd's support. At the last tournament, it got a bit crazy with people crowding around. Still, I enjoy being recognized by fans when I'm out shopping. But it has downsides. My last girlfriend didn't like it when I got attention from female fans. Tennis players travel a lot, and that's why we broke up, I think. It was hard, but you have to make sacrifices in any sport; you have to be serious and professional. It doesn't bother me much. I'm happy to focus on my game now and enjoy other things in life after I retire, because that happens early in this sport.'"
FCE_33,B2,"**Young Shoppers**
Shopping in a supermarket with children can be very difficult for parents. One mother says, ""They want everything they see. If it's not the latest sugary breakfast cereal, it's a Disney video or a comic. Usually all three. I can't afford all this stuff, and if I agree to their demands, I feel guilty about buying and feeding them unhealthy things. But I also feel bad for saying no all the time, and I get upset even before we leave home. I try not to take them shopping, but then I worry they won't learn how to make their own choices. I can't win.""
Research shows that children ask to buy something every two minutes during a supermarket trip. More than £150 million a year is spent on advertising directly to children, mostly on TV. This amount is likely to grow, and supermarkets are where this advertising works best. Children often don't understand why their parents say no to buying things, and arguments about sugar being bad for teeth are not convincing compared to the attractive TV ads.
Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says, ""Most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, but these ideas are not always correct. It's good for parents and children to talk about food because if children only learn from TV ads, they get a one-sided view. Parents don't like competing with advertisers and having to disappoint their children.""
The Independent Television Commission, which controls TV ads, does not allow advertisers to tell children to ask their parents to buy things. But, as Dibb points out, ""The purpose of advertising is to make people want to buy something. So even if they can't say, 'Tell your mum to buy this,' the goal is still the same.""
A big stress for parents shopping with children is deciding which requests to agree to and which to refuse. One mother says she talks a lot with her children about food and advertisements. Her son is critical of ads, and they look at labels together. She says, ""I've talked about it so much that my son thinks all ads are rubbish. We have less conflict in the supermarket now because the children don't ask for things I won't buy.""
Parents also admit they are not always consistent in their responses. Mike, a father of a seven-year-old son and a three-year-old daughter, says, ""We refuse to buy sweets for him because they're bad for him, while we buy double cream and chocolate for ourselves. It's nice to buy good things, and it's normal for children to want that too. But I still get annoyed by their demands. It depends on how I feel. If I'm in a good mood, I'm more likely to say yes. It's hard to be consistent.""
Supermarkets could help reduce parent-child conflict by removing sweets from checkout areas or providing play areas for children. Although parents might spend less because their children are not with them, the idea of shopping without a child's demands might attract more customers."
FCE_20,B2,"**Five-star luxury with modern technology**
The five-star Merrion Hotel has just opened in Dublin. It took almost two years to convert four large eighteenth-century houses into this hotel. This allowed them to install the latest technology for both staff and guests. General Manager Peter MacCann wants his staff to know guests by name, but he uses the hotel's computer system for details about guests' preferences. This system, which cost £250,000, helps treat returning guests in a special way. For example, if a guest asks for certain music CDs during their first stay, those CDs will be ready for them on their next visit. 
Guests often complain about room temperature, so the hotel has a high-tech system to control it. Guests can change the temperature themselves within three degrees of the normal 18°C. Additionally, the front desk can adjust each room's temperature between 14°C and 25°C. 
Business travelers will appreciate the technology in their rooms. MacCann expects that up to 65% of the hotel's business will come from this market. Each room has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that also works as a photocopier and printer, and a video-conferencing facility. The hotel has prepared for future technology changes by installing extra cables and renting TVs, so they can be easily updated. DVD recorders can also be upgraded when needed.
Despite all this technology, the rooms are designed to be comfortable and welcoming. The hotel has 145 large, well-furnished bedrooms, a swimming pool, gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a beautiful garden. The food must be excellent, and Chef Patrick Guilbaud, whose Dublin restaurant already had two Michelin stars, has moved his restaurant to the Merrion. This move benefits both him and the hotel. He has a new, modern kitchen and better parking facilities. The hotel gains a popular restaurant without financial risks.
With advanced technology and a skilled staff, the Merrion Hotel is likely to succeed."

Emma Marsden asked six women who live life to the fullest to share how they do it.
**A. Jeanette Kupfermann - Journalist and Author:**  
""I think it's excitement. I need to do something challenging. When I'm learning something new, I feel a lot of energy. Anything with rhythm gives me energy too. Right now, I'm learning flamenco dancing. Dance is wonderful and gives you energy. I think you feel tired if you're bored or feel life has no purpose. Doing something useful, even if it's small, gives you energy.""
**B. Linda Kelsey - Magazine Editor:**  
""I have a lot of work, but I enjoy it all. I love being at work; it's not a chore. If you enjoy something, it doesn't make you feel down, even if you're tired. I need a lot of sleep, so when I get it, I feel great. When I only get six hours of sleep, I feel a bit tired. I know exercise gives me energy, but it's hard to find the energy to do it! I do a yoga class once a week before work and try to do a workout at home. After exercise, I feel much better. I feel low in the office between 3 and 5 in the afternoon, so I think it's good to eat something then.""
**C. Annie Nightingale - Disc Jockey:**  
""I don't eat healthily to get energy. I think it's natural enthusiasm and being positive. I can't stand negative people. I'm quite naive - I think we should all enjoy life and live in the moment. Enjoyment comes first. You need to achieve things and set goals. I enjoy my work, and the last two years have been exciting. In my job, there are many lively young people, and you can't help but feel their energy. I love being busy with work and having a crazy life. I'm very sociable. I enjoy taking photos, but I'm not sure if I'm good at it. I rush to get them developed and can't wait to see them. I've also started writing words for imaginary songs - it's just for fun and helps me relax when I travel a lot.""
**D. Floella Benjamin - Author and Children's TV Presenter:**  
""My energy comes from the things I do and enjoy. I believe in what I'm doing at work and at home with my family. Being positive about life helps. That's why I love working with kids; they give so much and are naturally strong. Energy is like a natural chemical that starts when you talk to others - try smiling at people and feel the joy when they smile back. It's much better than feeling sorry for yourself. I try to eat healthily and don't smoke or drink, but I don't have an exercise plan. The most energetic I get is running around and playing with the kids.""
**E. Deborah Moggach - Author and Playwright:**  
""I love making a garden out of a wasteland. I did that once. The garden was all concrete - I broke it up and added a lot of soil. It was better than any workout or tennis. Another thing that gives me energy is knowing someone wants to read what I'm writing. I find it hard to write if no one is interested. I also like sneaking into a farmer's land or a wood. If I'm caught, I say, 'Oh, what a wonderful wood, I didn't know it was private,' and so on. I like it because it's childlike.""
**F. Katherine Monblot - Therapist:**  
""I believe you must be interested in and respect what you do in life. I like to take risks and get bored quickly, which keeps me motivated. Doing things you don't want to do makes you tired. I used to be on various committees and didn't like the demands on my time. You only have a certain amount of energy, so use it for the things that are most important to you."""
FCE_45,B2,"**ICE SKATING**
Ice skating has been around for thousands of years. Archaeologists have found skates made from animal bones. People used these bone skates until iron skates were introduced in Scandinavia around 200 AD. In Scandinavia, the upper classes thought skating was an important skill. In the early 1900s, skating was stylish and calm, but at the 1924 Winter Olympics, 11-year-old Sonja Henie showed a more athletic style, making skating more popular. Today, skating combines art and athletics, making it both graceful and physically challenging.
For beginners, balance and control are very important, and you can only go faster as you get better. Your body position helps with balance. Keep your legs slightly bent and knees bent to keep your weight centered; this means your body leans a little forward. Relaxation is very important in skating. To start, your heels should almost touch, and your feet should point outwards. Push forward with your back foot and make a small movement with the other foot. It's quite easy, right? As you practice, you can slowly make your movements longer.
Learning how to fall is one of the first skills for a skater. Even the best skaters fall. To fall without getting hurt, try to stay relaxed. This way, the impact with the ice is softer. To get up, use your hands to kneel, then stand. Once you can move on the ice confidently, you can try different styles like figure skating, freestyle, distance, speed, and pair skating. The best way to start is to learn figure skating and then basic freestyle. Most ice rinks offer guidance, so you can quickly learn the basic moves and then the turns, jumps, and spins of freestyle.
If you watch good or professional skaters, you will see how relaxed they are and how easily they move. To achieve this, you should practice exercises regularly. Skating with a stiff body can be dangerous, so warm-up exercises should include those for the legs, back, and shoulders, focusing on the ankles and knees. After a long or hard session, do the same exercises to avoid stiffness.
Skating improves balance, coordination, relaxation, and movement. It helps your heart and lungs and makes your body stronger. Combined with swimming or jogging, it is a great program for overall health and fitness."

FCE_29,B2,"'It's true - we're all getting taller Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy after school. 'What do you want to be?' asked the teacher. 'The flagpole on a ship?' The teacher had a point because Chris, even at fourteen, was almost two metres tall. Today, at 228 cm, he is Britain's tallest man. Every decade, the average height of people in Europe grows by another centimetre. Every year, more tall people are born. Interestingly, this does not mean we are becoming a new super race. In fact, we are returning to what we were like as cavemen. We are losing the effects of generations of poor diet, with big changes. 'We are only now beginning to reach our true potential,' says palaeontologist Professor Chris Stringer. 'We are becoming like Cro-Magnons again - the people who lived on this planet 40,000 years ago.' For most of human history, our ancestors got their food from many sources: women gathered herbs, fruits, and berries, while men hunted animals. One study found that they based their diet on 85 different wild plants. Then about 9,000 years ago, farming was invented, with big consequences. Most of the planet's green places have been taken over by farmers, so just three carbohydrate-rich plants - wheat, rice, and maize - provide more than half of the calories we eat today. This poor diet has had a bad effect on human health and body size. Over the centuries, we have lived on soups, porridges, and breads that have left us underfed and underdeveloped. In one study in Ohio, scientists found that when they started to grow corn, healthy hunter-gatherers became sickly, underweight farmers. Tooth decay increased, as did diseases. Far from being a blessing, corn was a public health problem, according to some anthropologists. However, farming spread because a piece of farmed land could support ten times the number of people who had lived off it as hunter-gatherers. The fact that most people relying on this system are poorly nourished and stunted has only recently been addressed, even by the world's wealthier nations. Only in Europe, the US, and Japan are diets again reflecting the richness of our ancestors' diets. As a result, the average man in the US is now 179 cm, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm. It is a welcome trend, though not without its own problems. Heights may have risen, but the world has not changed much. A standard bed-length has remained at 190 cm since 1860. Even worse, leg-room in planes and trains seems to have shrunk rather than grown, while clothes manufacturers are constantly having to change their range of products. The question is: where will it all end? We cannot grow forever. We must have some upper limit. But what is it? According to Robert Fogel, of University, it could be as much as 193 cm - and we are likely to reach it sometime this century. However, scientists add one note of caution. Individuals may be growing taller because of better nutrition, but as a species, we are actually shrinking. During the last ice age, 10,000 years ago, humans were slightly rounder and taller - an evolutionary response to the cold. (Large, round bodies are best at keeping in heat.) Since the climate warmed, we appear to have become slightly thinner and smaller, even when properly fed. And as the planet continues to heat up, we may shrink even further. In other words, the growth of human beings could be offset by global warming.'"
FCE_57,B2,"**Studio Audiences**
What is it like to be in the audience when a TV show is made? Cosmo Landesman found out. Studio audiences are a common part of TV life, but they are still a mystery to many of us. When we see them excited on game shows, we wonder - who are these people?
Some people think studio audiences are not very important. Even people who work in TV sometimes don't respect them. One cameraman said they are treated 'like cattle'. I thought studio audiences were just people who wanted to be famous for a moment. But there is no typical studio audience. They come from all backgrounds and jobs. TV shows try to get different people for different programs.
People who like watching TV at home often don't understand why anyone would go to a studio. Why get tickets, travel far, and sit for hours in an uncomfortable studio to watch something you can see at home? One idea is that people hope to be seen on TV for a second. I didn't believe this until I talked to Angela. She said she came for a chance to be on TV. Another idea is that people are curious to see behind the scenes. But most people said they came because 'a friend gave me a ticket'.
Few of us have been in a studio audience, but we think we know what it's like. You sit close to strangers, and someone shows cards that say APPLAUD or LAUGH, and you clap or laugh. This might be true for some shows, but not all. One studio manager said, 'We hope a show is good enough not to need these signs.'
Is there a real difference between being in a studio and watching TV at home? For Claire, sitting in a studio is 'more exciting'. Charlotte liked feeling part of live TV. 'Last year I saw my favorite comedian. At home, you miss a lot.' I missed seeing live actors because I could only see the back of someone's head. The opening scenes were so far away that I watched the show on a studio monitor.
Going to a studio might not be the best way to watch TV, but that's not the point. For most people, it was just fun and a free night of entertainment."

**Bruce**  
I don't like wild landscapes. I like places with people. When I travel, I prefer lovely villages with old temples, not empty deserts. When I was eight, I went to school in England. On Saturdays, I cycled to the village of Lastingham in its beautiful valley. Cycling was a break from school. I loved exploring the hilltops, valleys, and old villages. I am from Scotland, so the landscape felt familiar but different. I still visit there today. I used to write about my adventures in my diary. That was my first try at travel writing, which later became my career.
**Sophia**  
There is a small train that goes from Hythe to Dungeness, run by volunteers. I always travel first class because it doesn't cost much more. The scenery is not amazing. The train goes across Romney Marsh with its sheep and next to a canal. But I always look forward to when the train goes through back gardens. For a few moments, we can see people doing everyday things like making tea or washing dishes. I see myself as a woman in a tiny train, looking into other people's homes. I like the ordinary landscape. Just fields, sheep, and a distant grey sea. It makes me look closely to find something special.
**Matthew**  
The Hartland Peninsula is a remote and beautiful coast. The beaches are hard to reach and have many rocks, so there are not many people. Some brave surfers come, but most visitors enjoy the sea's beauty. The coast faces the Atlantic and is known for shipwrecks. There are walks along the coast and trips inland through valleys with oak trees, ferns, and wildflowers. We stay in simple accommodation with a family in the village of Southole.
**Annette**  
My favourite place in England is the Trough of Bowland, a wide-open moorland perfect for hiking. There are not many people living or visiting there. It's an unknown, empty, and remote area, and I like the feeling of space. I found the area by chance when I was a student, and since then, I visit every year, either alone, with my boyfriend, or now with my son. It has changed little since my first visit. Having a child makes these visits more special. It makes me sad that he is growing up in a city.
**James**  
I bought Glenthorne, my favourite house in Britain. I wanted peace and to reconnect with my English roots. I grew up in Sri Lanka, but at twelve, I went to school in Devon, in the west of England. I used to cycle around the moors and village backstreets. We had a story about a place we would never cycle past: if you went down the driveway, you'd never return. That place was Glenthorne. It's the place of my dreams. It's a magical, secluded, romantic house. You can't hear anything except the sea, wind, and birds."
FCE_42,B2,"**HAPPY HUNTING GROUND**
We are a family that loves animals and enjoys being around them. One afternoon, my daughter called me at work. She was excited because she found a pine snake. ""Can we keep him?"" she asked. I said, ""Yes, but only for one night."" We had a special tank for animals we found, so we could look at them and read about them in our natural history book.
I got home late and started cooking when I heard my sons shouting, ""Oh, Mother! Help! Do something!"" I ran to their room. The problem was with Domino, our cat, and Bianca, a white mouse I got for Mother's Day. Domino had the mouse in his mouth and was running around the room. The room was full of furniture and children, and Domino was trying to find a way out to enjoy his catch. I jumped into the chaos and tripped over something, landing on the floor.
As I thought about stopping Domino, I saw the snake. It was escaping from its tank. The snake was moving across the floor. The room was full of noise with the cat, mouse, kids, and even the dog barking. The pot in the kitchen boiled over, so I quickly turned off the gas and came back to the room. I managed to catch Domino by the tail and saved the mouse, which was wet but not hurt. Interestingly, the same mouse was caught by the cat three more times but lived a long life.
Feeling confident after saving the mouse, I looked at the snake. It didn't have any weak points. I sat on the floor like a snake-charmer, trying to calm it down. Slowly, the snake relaxed and rested its head on its body. I carefully picked it up and took it to the garden. I wanted to let it go near a tree. When I let go of its head, expecting it to attack, it instead moved over my shoulders like a scarf. It seemed comfortable there.
We stood in the garden, with the snake around me. My eldest child, DJ, said, ""You know what it is, Mum? You're nice and warm, and the shed isn't."" The children helped me encourage the snake to move on. Slowly, it climbed up the wall and disappeared over the roof. As the last part of its tail vanished, my three-year-old, Clay, said, ""Boy, that was one big snake!"""
FCE_59,B2,"'Write me a letter! In our fast world of phones, fax machines, and computers, the old art of letter writing might disappear. But for me, getting a letter is special. There is the excitement when it arrives, the pleasure of seeing who it is from, and the enjoyment of reading it. I have been writing letters for as long as I can remember. It probably started with the little notes I wrote to my mother. She always made me write my own thank-you letters for Christmas and birthday presents. It didn't matter how short or messy they were, as long as they were letters. When I left home at 18 to study medicine in London, I wrote once a week, and so did my mother. Sometimes my father wrote, and it was always fun to get his long, funny letters. Most letters from home were about everyday events with my parents and their friends. We also made phone calls, but I remember the letters most. There were also letters from my boyfriends. When I was young, I often had boyfriends who worked or studied far away, so we stayed in touch by writing. Instead of hurting the relationships, writing letters seemed to make them better. I found I could express myself more easily in writing than by talking. I love the letters that come with birthday or Christmas cards. Notes are nice, but it's even better to have a year's worth of news! And it's even better when it's an airmail envelope with beautiful stamps. My overseas letters come from Mangala in Sri Lanka, someone I trained with over 20 years ago. I have a penfriend in Australia and another in Vancouver. Then there's the lady who writes to me from France. If we hadn't started talking in a restaurant on the way home from holiday, if my husband hadn't taken her photo, and if I hadn't asked for her address, I would never have been able to write to her. More importantly, if she hadn't replied, we would have missed out. Now, we write to each other regularly. I can improve my French (she speaks no English); we have stayed at her home twice, and she has stayed with us. My biggest letter-writing success was this summer when my family and I stayed with my American penfriend in Texas. We had been writing for 29 years but had never met. Everyone was surprised that a correspondence could last so long. The local newspaper even wrote about it on the front page. I am happy that my children are continuing the tradition. Like my mother, I make them write their own thank-you letters. My daughter writes me little letters, just as I did to my mother. She and my son have penfriends in Texas, organized by my penfriend. I strongly encourage readers not to let letter writing become a 'lost art'.'"
FCE_54,B2,"**Careless Tourists Damage Ancient Rock Art in the Alps**
In the French Alps, there are tens of thousands of ancient pictures carved into rocks at Mont Bego. These pictures are very old, about 4,000 years, and show cows with horns, fields, and gods and goddesses. Scientists are worried because these 36,000 drawings are being damaged quickly. They fear that future generations will not be able to see them.
The site is popular with tourists, but some visitors are careless. They leave graffiti on the rocks, step on the drawings, and even break off pieces to take home. Some people rub the drawings to make them clearer for photos, which damages them. Others scratch their own drawings or names into the rocks.
Experts have different ideas on how to protect the drawings. Henry de Lumley, from the Museum of Natural History in Paris, thinks the best way is to stop people from visiting the site, except on guided tours. He believes this will save the site and allow research to continue. However, Jean Clottes, chairman of the International Committee on Rock Art, disagrees. He thinks this idea is too strict and will upset local people. He believes they should try other ways to protect the site.
David Lavergne, a regional architect, also wants to keep the site open. He says the area is too big to stop all damage, and they don't have enough money to hire guards. He suggests charging a fee to visit the site.
Annie Echassoux, a researcher, is worried because tourists can now reach the site more easily by hiring vehicles. She thinks the area should be roped off and guides provided. She insists that money must be found to protect the site because it is a historic area. If nothing is done, the drawings might be lost forever."
FCE_32,B2,"**Young Shoppers**
Shopping in a supermarket with children can be very difficult for parents. One mother says, ""They want everything they see. If it's not the latest sugary breakfast cereal, it's a Disney video or a comic. Usually all three. I can't afford all this, and I feel guilty about buying unhealthy things. But I also feel bad for saying no all the time, and I get upset even before we leave home. I try not to take them shopping, but then I worry they won't learn how to make their own choices. I can't win.""
Research shows that children ask to buy something every two minutes during a supermarket trip. More than £150 million a year is spent on advertising to children, mostly on TV. This number is likely to grow, and supermarkets are where this advertising works best. Children often don't understand why their parents say no to buying things, and they find it hard to believe that sugar is bad for their teeth when the ads are so convincing.
Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says, ""Most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, but these ideas are not always right. It's good for parents and children to talk about food because if children only learn from TV ads, they get a one-sided view. Parents don't like competing with advertisers and having to say no to their children all the time.""
The Independent Television Commission, which controls TV ads, doesn't allow advertisers to tell children to ask their parents to buy things. But, as Dibb says, ""The goal of advertising is to make people want to buy something. So even if they can't say, 'Tell your mum to buy this,' that's still what they want.""
Some parents find it stressful to decide which of their children's requests to agree to and which to refuse. One mother says she talks a lot with her children about food and ads, so they don't ask for things she doesn't want to buy. Parents also admit they are not always consistent. Mike, a father of two, says, ""We say no to sweets because they're bad for him, but we buy chocolate for ourselves. It's nice to buy treats, and it's normal for children to want them too. But I still get annoyed by their demands. It depends on my mood. If I'm feeling good, I'm more likely to say yes. It's hard to be consistent.""
Supermarkets could help reduce conflicts by removing sweets from checkout areas or offering play areas for children. Even if parents spend less because their children aren't with them, the idea of shopping without a child's demands might attract more customers."
FCE_65,B2,"'Climbing Walls Once, climbers only went to mountains. Now, people can climb anywhere, indoors or outdoors. The crowd is silent. High above them on the climbing wall, hanging upside down by two fingers, is the French climber Francois Lombard. He is competing in the World Cup Climbing Championships at Birmingham's National Indoor Arena. This arena is more famous for the TV show Gladiators, but both events have one thing in common - The Wall. This is possible because of new technology. Before the mid-1960s, climbers practiced on cliffs where there were good climbing spots. In winter, they either climbed in cold weather, walked, or climbed on snow and ice in Scotland. As climbing became more popular, climbers needed to stay fit. When cliffs were not usable, they used brick or stone buildings to practice. This helped them keep their fingers strong and avoid boredom. Soon, sports centers started building walls for climbing, using bricks with special edges. Many of these early walls were inspired by Don Robinson, a physical education teacher. In the mid-1960s, he built a climbing wall at Leeds University. Robinson used natural rock set in concrete blocks for the wall. Many climbing walls like this were built in sports halls in the 1970s, but they had problems. These walls could only be vertical, while real cliffs have overhangs and angled rocks. Also, once built, the walls couldn't be changed, and climbers got bored. In 1985, a Frenchman, Francois Savigny, created a material shaped like real cliff holds. These could be attached to any wall and changed when climbers wanted something new. French companies also started using panels on steel frames. Concrete was too heavy for overhanging walls, but steel frames could be built anywhere. This system gave climbers endless new holds.'"
FCE_61,B2,"'So you want to be an actor? If you tell someone that you want to be an actor, they will probably say it is 'risky'. Acting is indeed a risky career. There are more actors than there are jobs for them. When you decide to become an actor, some friends might say you are crazy, but others might think differently. Everyone will give you different advice. It is a personal choice, and only you can be responsible for your dream. There are no easy ways to become an actor. There are no exams to pass, and no guarantee that you will succeed after your training. It depends on luck and talent. However, there is always a need for new faces and talent, and acting can be exciting and glamorous, with the chance of big rewards. People often ask what talent is. I think it is natural skill plus imagination. It also involves courage and belief in what you are doing. Why do people want to act? It is hard to explain. In theatre, the important thing is the connection between the actor and the audience. This connection is what drives actors to perform. If you ask actors how they succeed, they might just shrug. They know some things about themselves and their techniques, but they do not take success for granted. They know they are only as good as their current job, and fame might not last. Disappointment is an actor's biggest enemy. Last month, you might have been out of work, doing other jobs. Suddenly, you get an audition, but you might not get the part. Actors do not like to talk about their chances. They find ways to handle the stress of auditions and possible rejection. Nobody likes being rejected. Remember, from the first moment you try for a part, you are saying you are available, willing, and hopefully talented enough. It is up to you, because if you do not care enough, no one else will.'"

'The flagpole on a ship?' The teacher had a point because Chris, at fourteen, was already almost two meters tall. Today, at 228 cm, he is Britain's tallest man. Every decade, the average height of people in Europe grows by another centimeter. Every year, more very tall people are born. Interestingly, this does not mean we are creating a new super race. In fact, we are returning to what we were like as cavemen. We are losing the effects of generations of poor diet, with big changes. 'We are only now beginning to reach our true potential,' says palaeontologist Professor Chris Stringer. 'We are becoming like Cro-Magnons again - the people who lived on this planet 40,000 years ago.' For most of human history, our ancestors got their food from many sources: women gathered herbs, fruits, and berries, while men added meat from hunting animals. One study found that they based their diet on 85 different wild plants. Then about 9,000 years ago, farming was invented, with big consequences. Most of the planet's green areas have been taken over by farmers, so just three carbohydrate-rich plants - wheat, rice, and maize - provide more than half of the calories we eat today. This poor diet has had a bad effect on human health and body size. Over the centuries, we have lived on soups, porridges, and breads that have left us underfed and underdeveloped. In one study in Ohio, scientists found that when they started to grow corn, healthy hunter-gatherers became sickly, underweight farmers. Tooth decay increased, as did diseases. Corn was a public health problem, according to some anthropologists. However, farming spread because a piece of farmed land could support ten times the number of people who had lived off it as hunter-gatherers. The fact that most people relying on this system are poorly nourished and stunted has only recently been addressed, even by the world's wealthier nations. Only in Europe, the US, and Japan are diets again reflecting the richness of our ancestors' diets. As a result, the average man in the US is now 179 cm, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm.

FCE_5,B2,"**Onto a Winner**
Two brothers are finding that their childhood game is good for business. Dave and Norm Lagasse, two brothers with big beards in their forties, are sitting in their simple home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA, and remembering their childhood. In front of them is a wooden board with round plastic pieces. They are playing the old game of pichenotte, which they say is unique. Their grandfather, Lucien Rajotte, a grocer from Quebec, Canada, brought the game to the USA and taught it to his family. Soon, the family played the game almost every weekend and holiday, and as Dave says, they were 'having the best time ever'. The family later moved to New Mexico, but they kept playing with Grandpa's pichenotte board, made from old wooden food crates. Visitors were often curious because the game was unknown in southern USA.
Three years ago, Dave noticed the old pichenotte board was damaged and decided to make a new one. It turned out beautifully. A relative saw it and wanted one, then a friend wanted another. To see how much interest there was, the brothers took one of Dave's new boards to a sports bar in Santa Fe. 'People started to watch,' says Dave, 'and say, ""No way I'm playing that silly game."" Then they'd sit down, and soon you couldn't get them up from the table!' When people asked about the game's origins, Dave did some research. He found out the game probably started in India, where a similar game called 'carroms' exists. It was adapted into a game called 'squails' in Britain, and British people took it to Canada a century ago. Pichenotte is the French-Canadian version that developed in Quebec.
Pichenotte, played by two to four people, is a game of skill. Each player gets 12 pieces or 'pucks'. They 'flick' these across a wheel-like board using one finger. Flicking a puck into a small hole is worth 20 points. Three rings around the hole are worth 15, 10, and 5 points. Eight small posts are obstacles. The game usually lasts two minutes. Seeing how popular the game was at the Santa Fe bar, the Lagasses made more boards and took them to markets and craft fairs. Crowds gathered, money was exchanged, and the game's popularity grew. Championships started, and a trophy called the 'Lord Pichenotte Cup' was created. As the game became more popular, the boards sold quickly. The brothers decided to make pichenotte their full-time business. They set up a workshop in their garage and started making boards. They have made over 450 so far. Each board is made of birchwood and mahogany, weighs 12kg, and is 1cm thick. Norm says, 'They're very durable, as they have to stand up to lots of use.' They sell for $595 each on the brothers' website. There are no professional pichenotte players or TV coverage yet, but the brothers hope their garage will one day hold a luxury car instead of tools and wood. Until then, they enjoy playing the game they hope will make them rich."
FCE_41,B2,"**WELCOME TO THE MODEL VILLAGE**
When you first enter the Model Village, it is hard to believe that a few years ago this was just a piece of empty land, covered with wild plants. For many years, people thought this land was useless. But one man, with the help of his wife, turned it into the beautiful place you see today. Many tons of soil and clay were moved to change the flat land into the landscape you see now. Machines like bulldozers helped, but a lot of hard work was also needed. After shaping the land, about 1,000 tonnes of topsoil were added to create the lawns, flower beds, and rock gardens.
Hundreds of trees and shrubs were planted in the Model Village. These plants had to be chosen carefully because they needed to survive the salty air from the sea and strong winter winds. Most plants came from local garden centers, but some were brought from places as far as Canada and New Zealand.
The whole village was the idea of Colin Sims. He made over 100 models by himself over nine years, starting from when the village opened in 1972. The models are made from different materials like stone, concrete, treated wood, and plastics to last in all weather. At first, Colin needed help from experts to understand how materials would last over time, but he soon became an expert himself.
You will see that the models are all made to the same scale, with great attention to detail. This was done with patience and special building techniques. The Model Village is very popular and known for its high quality. The techniques used here are now used in other model villages in England and are even taught in some schools.
All the model buildings show traditional British architecture and are not based on one real place. One of the most impressive buildings is the Manor House, a typical 13th-century stone building with a brick tower. It is based on manor houses found in the West Country. As you walk around, you will also see the Castle, St Mary's Church, a zoo, and a mini golf course, which is the newest addition.
Please stay on the paths during your visit and do not touch the models; a small mistake can mean hours of repair work for us. You can take photos from the paths. Dogs are welcome if they are on a short lead. To make your visit more fun, you will find buttons in front of some working models. Press them to see the models move.
At the end of your visit, we would love to hear your thoughts. We are always planning new models, and your ideas can help us make the village more interesting. We also want to know if any models are not as good as the others, so we can fix them. We hope you enjoy your visit and come back again. Don't forget to tell your friends about us."
FCE_69,B2,"'Every week, British tabloid newspapers show pictures that invade people's privacy and break the newspaper editors' rules. Sometimes pop stars pose for photographers, but this is not common. Usually, these pictures hurt famous people when their private moments are shown on the front page. However, very few people ask the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) for help. The PCC is an organization that deals with these issues. These pictures are rarely in the public interest. Do private photos of pop stars help solve a crime? How did a picture of a famous actress on a hotel balcony protect public health and safety? The actress has complained about long-lens photos before. Since she was in a hotel, where she should expect privacy, she had a good reason to complain, but she didn't. It is surprising that the PCC did not investigate this. They should also look into a recent story about a pop star's love life. The pop star, like the actress, did not make a formal complaint. Shouldn't the PCC take action on these and other unfair stories? At first, this seems like a good idea. It would lead to many decisions against newspapers. These decisions would be reported by other newspapers and on TV and radio. The public would not support the newspapers, and editors would have to stop publishing such material. Even photographers would be affected, as it would not be worth their time to hide and take pictures of celebrities. If the PCC decided to act like a 'police officer', there would be problems. How would it decide to start an investigation? Should it ask the victim to complain? And if the person still refused, should it continue anyway? Also, celebrities and royalty might expect every story about them to be investigated and be upset if it wasn't. The role is too big. How could the PCC watch all of the British press: national, regional, and magazines? There is also the embarrassment to think about. Even if someone's privacy is invaded, would they want the embarrassment of an investigation? Most people probably just want to forget it and move on. Some might have other reasons for staying quiet. There might be a worse story they have kept from the press, and they worry it might come out if they complain. In other words, even the PCC might become the enemy. A British comedian also suffered from the press when he and his wife were secretly photographed on their honeymoon in the Caribbean. He didn't complain then, or later, when he and his family were photographed during a holiday. He was afraid that the newspaper, News of the World, would show the pictures again with a new story about his 'anger', saying it was just a joke and that, as a comedian, he should have a sense of humor. This fear is understandable. People think they will be targeted again if they challenge the tabloids. It is hard to find an easy solution to this serious problem.'"
FCE_38,B2,"Many people give advice to college graduates looking for their first job. This article is about moving to a second job. We are not talking about those looking for a second temporary job while searching for a permanent one. We are also not talking about those leaving a bad job in the first few weeks. Instead, we are focusing on those who are taking a real step in their career, choosing a job that matches their goals now that they have some experience and skills. What kind of job should you look for? It depends on your long-term goals. You need to ask yourself if you want to specialize in a certain area, move up to higher positions, or change to a different field. Whatever you decide, choose your second job carefully. You should plan to stay in it for two to three years. This job will be important when you apply for your next job. It should show that you are serious about your career. Most importantly, it should help you grow and give you more responsibility. If you want to travel, now is a good time to do it. You can do temporary work when you return and then find your second job. Future employers will be glad to see that you have traveled and are not likely to leave again. Juliette Davidson spent her first year after leaving St. Aldate's College working for three lawyers. It was a great first job because they were very supportive. She learned about office work and improved her computer skills. However, there was no chance to move up. One day she quit, bought a plane ticket, and traveled for a year. Juliette now works as a Personal Assistant to Brenda Cleverdon, the Chief Executive of Business in the Community. 'In two and a half years I have become more skilled and my job has really grown,' she says. 'From the start, my boss wanted to help me develop. My job title is the same, but my duties have changed. I have moved from mainly typing and phone work to doing most of the correspondence and budgets. I also handle different questions, from company chairmen to people wanting to start their own business. Brenda includes me in all her work and gives me specific projects and events to organize.'"
FCE_17,B2,"**Confident People: What's Their Secret?**
Confident people might seem like they were always confident, but most of them learned it because they needed to. Nina Hathway talks to five people about how they became confident.
**A. Jenny**
When I left school, I was very shy and thought I would always be that way. When I was 25, I helped at my daughter's school. I was nervous, but I did well. Someone suggested I take a university course. I was scared on my first day, but my confidence grew, and I became more outgoing. Working at the school changed my life and helped everything else fall into place.
**B. Michaela**
Four years ago, my father got sick, and I had to run the family business. I was scared and acted too aggressive at first. I thought confident people were like that, but I learned that confidence means believing in yourself. If work is too much, I don't feel bad about leaving some tasks for the next day. When faced with something hard, I remind myself I have nothing to lose. Fear makes you less confident, so I talk to myself to overcome those fears.
**C. Lisa**
People think I'm confident, but the calmer I look, the more scared I am. In TV, looking confident is important. Interviewing people taught me that everyone gets nervous in important situations, and we feel better when we talk to someone friendly. My mom once told me, 'Who's looking at you? Everyone's worried about themselves.' I remember this. You gain confidence by facing your fears. I was nervous for my driving test, but I passed. After that, I felt I wouldn't be that scared again.
**D. Barbara**
My confidence comes from enjoying my work, but I've built it over the years. If you learn from mistakes, you're more confident next time. I work hard and am liked at the restaurant, but not everyone likes me. I don't let that bother me. You have to like yourself for who you are. My company offers training courses, which have boosted my self-esteem. They also encourage setting small goals. It's better to achieve something small than aim too high and get nothing.
**E. Kim**
After college, I worked as a secretary and was too scared to speak in meetings. Eventually, I started speaking up. When I first worked in politics, I was nervous about speaking in public. I told myself, 'People do this every day, so you can too.' I found it helpful to write notes, like a comfort blanket. Everyone gets nervous about public speaking. The secret to confidence is telling yourself, 'Nothing is impossible.'"
FCE_47,B2,"'Visit to Malaysia Paul Forster goes to a kite-flying festival and spends a nervous night in the forest. Adnan Ali smiled as I gave him his torn kite. 'You have to keep it,' he said, 'it's traditional - if the line breaks, finders are keepers ... and anyway, I have plenty more.' He showed me a pile of beautifully decorated kites at his feet. All were exactly 120cm wide and long, made of tissue paper and split bamboo. We sat next to them in the shade of the trees behind the Beach of the Seven Lagoons in Kelantan, and watched Malaysia's biggest kite festival. In the center of the beach were 10 platforms, where helpers held up the kites, and a row of competitors holding the lines of their kites waited for the countdown. When the whistle blew, the crowd cheered and the kites flew up like rockets. More than 500 men and boys had entered the competition, which lasts for five days every year. Each person entered four different designs, judged on decoration, stability in the air, and flying efficiency. 'Flying kites isn't so difficult,' said Adnan, 'but making them takes real skill. Visit me at home and I'll show you how it's done.' I accepted his invitation. At his house, I drank cold milky tea and ate fish crackers in a large room. As it got dark, he told me to come again the next day to help rebuild his kite, but I couldn't. Instead, I explored the southern part of the state, driving towards Kuala Lumpur, into mountains with thick rainforest. I took a wrong turn and the road ended at a river. A boat was waiting to take people across. Nearby, a small sign caught my eye. It pointed up a path into the forest and read: 'Jelawang Jungle 3 km.' Before starting, it would have been useful to know that most of this distance was uphill, steep, and slippery. When I got to the track, I found a man waiting with a flask of tea. This was Baba, who looked after a tented kitchen and some bamboo huts. I decided to stay there, trying not to think about insects under my thin mattress. The night was completely dark, full of different sounds. A waterfall roared nearby and many living things moved and squeaked. In the morning, there was a great view over five ranges of green mountains. In the afternoon, it rained. First wind, then lightning hit the treetops. Seconds later, I was soaked. Sliding downhill, I wondered how the big butterflies avoided the huge raindrops. I also thought about my car being swept away (it sometimes happens) and the chance of drowning if I opened my mouth. Luckily, the car was still there, covered in mud, at the bottom of the track. No one is a stranger for long here. Back in Kota Bahru, Kelantan's capital, everyone asked me questions: 'Where are you from?' 'How old are you?' But they were very friendly. Kelantan might be best known for its kites, but I remember it more for its human kindness.'"
FCE_48,B2,"**What kind of shopper are you?**
We all go shopping, whether we like it or not. But there are different types of shoppers. Do you know which type you are? Abby Edwards asked some people ...
**A. Melanie, 22, dancer**
I'm a shopping addict - I can't spend enough money! When I have cash, I'm out shopping, and it makes me happy. I find it hard to walk past sale signs. My boyfriend is the same, so we often shop together. We're an addicted couple!
**B. Brenda, 40, office manager**
I'm a reluctant shopper. My husband does most of the food shopping because he cooks and knows what he likes. I don't spend much time shopping for clothes. I take my 6-year-old son and 14-year-old daughter to buy clothes, but I don't enjoy it because we all have different tastes. I don't spend money on myself often, so when I do, I feel guilty and rarely tell my husband how much I've spent. I always say I spent less because the real price sounds shocking.
**C. Juliet, 28, personnel manager**
I only shop for essentials. I hate shopping and only go when I really have to. When I do, I know what I want and won't settle for anything else. I find shopping tiring, and there's always something I'd rather be doing.
**D. Anita, 35, TV producer**
I like to look around sometimes, but I usually know what I want and where to find it. I don't waste time and get in and out quickly. I do have some mistakes at the back of my wardrobe, so maybe I'm a careful shopper who sometimes gets it wrong!
**E. Lizzie, 41, secretary**
I don't enjoy shopping at all. I really dislike shopping for clothes because I can never find what I want or anyone to help me. The shops are too noisy, everything is messy, and I find it a nightmare. Luckily, I rarely have to shop for clothes because most of my clothes are given to me. For food shopping, I go to the local supermarket once a week and finish quickly!
**F. Lisa, 22, actress**
I'm probably a happy shopper. Sometimes I go out to look around the shops with my friends, and we often end up buying things. I don't usually have a specific item in mind, but if something catches my eye, I'll buy it.
**G. Suki, 26, art gallery assistant**
I'm a careful shopper - I like going, but I don't buy much. I usually know what I want and rarely go crazy. Sometimes I shop to cheer myself up, but I often feel worse because I've spent too much!
**H. Ann-Marie, 29, nursery worker**
I love shopping, but only on certain days and never on a Saturday because it's too busy. I'd say I'm a careful shopper. I always have a good idea of what I want, and I never buy things immediately. I look in other shops to find a better bargain - it takes me ages!
**I. Linda, 32, restaurant manager**
I'm an unwilling shopper. Maybe because I work in the city centre, the shops have lost their attraction for me. When I have to shop, I drag myself out, but I don't try things on because it's too much trouble. Clothes I buy don't always fit, but I don't mind too much. I'd rather make a few mistakes than go into shops and make a lot of effort!"
