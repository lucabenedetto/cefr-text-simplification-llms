CPE_15,C2,"'Garbage in, garbage out Charging families for each bag of rubbish they produce seems like a good idea for the environment and makes sense economically. But it might not be. In many developed countries, the routine of collecting household waste is similar. Regularly, rubbish bags or bins are collected by a special truck and taken to a landfill. Economists find this process strange because, in most places, it is free. Households pay for this service through local taxes, but a family that fills four bins pays the same as an elderly couple that fills one. However, the cost of disposing of rubbish is not zero. The more rubbish people throw away, the more collectors and trucks are needed, and the more local authorities have to pay for landfill fees. This is a basic economic problem: if rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish. The obvious solution is to make households pay for the extra cost of disposing of their waste. This would encourage them to throw out less and recycle more, assuming local governments provide recycling facilities. But as Don Fullerton and Thomas Kinnaman, two American economists, discovered, this logical approach can have unexpected and sometimes disappointing results. They researched several American towns and cities that started charging households for rubbish. The most common system is to sell stickers or tags that people attach to rubbish bags or cans. Only bags with these labels are collected. In a study, Fullerton and Kinnaman looked at a scheme introduced in July 1992 in Charlottesville, Virginia, a town of about 40,000 people. Residents were charged 80 cents for each tagged bag of rubbish. This might seem like a sensible use of market forces. However, the authors concluded that the scheme's benefits did not cover the costs of printing materials, commissions to sellers, and wages for the people running the scheme. True, the number of bags or cans fell sharply by 37%. But this was mainly due to the 'Seattle stomp', a method where people crammed more garbage into each container by jumping on it. Machines at landfill sites compact waste better than individuals. The weight of rubbish collected, a better measure of disposal costs than volume, fell by only 14% in Charlottesville. In 25 other Virginian cities without a pricing scheme, used as a control group, it fell by 3.5% anyway. Less pleasing, some people resorted to illegal dumping rather than pay for rubbish removal. This is hard to measure directly, but the authors estimate that illegal dumping may account for 30-40% of the reduction in collected rubbish. The one positive outcome was a 15% increase in recycled materials, suggesting people chose to recycle (which is free) rather than pay for rubbish collection. But the fee might not be the main reason for the increase, as many citizens were already recycling voluntarily. In a more recent study, Fullerton and Kinnaman explored the economics of rubbish in more detail. One conclusion is that pricing does reduce the weight of rubbish, but not by much. On average, a 10% increase in sticker prices cuts the quantity by only 0.3%. This figure is lower than in other studies covering fewer towns, but is it surprising? To significantly reduce rubbish, people would have to buy less of almost everything. A small tax on weekly garbage is unlikely to make a big difference. If that's the case, it might be worth considering whether other factors, like income and education, are just as important as price. In richer towns, for example, people throw out more rubbish than in poorer ones and have less time for recycling. Should we conclude that charging households for rubbish is a bad idea? Not at all: free disposal is too cheap. But the effects of simple policies are often complex. Detailed economic models are often needed to understand them. And sometimes, the results are not as expected.'"
CPE_19,C2,"Theodore Zeldin explores how our work life might change. Do you feel respected and appreciated at work? Today, just having a successful career isn't enough. Many professions feel undervalued, and even famous individuals often feel bitter. Loving your job used to be enough to be envied, but now you must consider how your job affects you personally, your mind, character, and relationships. This is important because no matter how skilled you are, if your work makes you boring or unable to talk to others outside your field, or if you're too busy to gain wisdom or use your imagination, then status or money won't make up for your shortcomings as a person.
I am exploring how work can prioritize personal fulfillment, rather than just shaping us for industrial needs. Work should be more than creating wealth; it should be a fulfilling lifestyle, helping us discover hidden talents and meet diverse people. However, this doesn't mean eliminating unemployment, as educated people want jobs that are enriching and meaningful. A career should be like a work of art, with a fulfilled person at its center.
Even middle-class jobs aren't as appealing as they once were. Doctors are often more stressed than their patients, accountants worry about ethics, architects rarely use their creativity, and administrators are stuck in bureaucracy. Middle managers, once proud of their status, are losing confidence. Meanwhile, companies and public institutions are downsizing. Efforts like decentralizing decisions and rewarding performance haven't gained employee commitment. In Britain, only 8% of employees strongly feel their values align with their organization's.
I am investigating various jobs to see how they shape or harm people. I've studied how different cultures expand human potential and create courage. I've looked at happiness, love, friendship, and respect, and now I'm focusing on finding more satisfying ways to work. Many experts focus on extending the life and income of companies, but we also need to evaluate ourselves as people and decide who we want to spend our lives with. How many of us feel truly alive at work? How many are like part-time slaves, theoretically free to leave but actually trapped by our qualifications and careers, working not to improve ourselves but because we see no other choice?
Take hotel workers, for example, as 10% of the workforce is in the 'hospitality industry'. There's a lot of unused potential. Many intelligent and lively people accept low prestige, low pay, and long hours because hotels haven't been rethought since the days of the Ritz. A hotel isn't just a place for travelers to sleep; it's like a mini United Nations. People from around the world meet in hotels but often pass each other silently. Many hotel staff are foreigners eager to learn a new language and culture, but they have only superficial interactions with guests. Hotels could be cultural centers, connecting guests with the city and each other. Hoteliers could use the skills of the students they employ, rather than just giving them basic tasks. If they considered their staff's true ambitions, they'd see many other services hotels could offer. But accountants often limit this by focusing on one main activity to maximize profits. It's time to rethink this from a human perspective, not just a financial one, and move beyond traditional categories.
For me, work is a relationship. Now that many people want more than just obedience and see work as a way to express independence, they should have the chance to design their own jobs and choose their colleagues and even customers, within practical and profitable limits. This means they need to communicate beyond professional jargon, with minds that might seem different at first. Everyone knows communication is important, but it's different from conversation. Traditional conversation is different from the new kind of conversation people miss today. This is a more personal interaction that creates respect and helps understand others, often changing you in the process. It's more than just relaxing; it's a powerful way to create equality. Every time you have such a conversation, the world changes a little bit."
CPE_24,C2,"**BROADCASTING: The Social Shaping of a Technology**
The term 'broadcasting' originally referred to the act of spreading seeds by hand over a large area. This agricultural metaphor suggests planned growth and a rich harvest if conditions are right. It implies a central source of seeds, or resources, meant for wide distribution and reproduction. The question is why a new technology that could send words and pictures electronically was organized in a way that fit this metaphor.
Television, like the telegraph and telephone, is a form of communication. However, from the start, it was seen as a centralised 'mass' medium. Broadcasting to private homes from a central source matched the socio-economic structures and lifestyles of modern societies. Other forms of organization were tried but remained just experiments.
Two lesser-known alternatives show what television could have been in a different social context. In the early 1930s, radio amateurs in Britain experimented with two-way television as a possible replacement for the telephone. Popular science magazines published articles on building TV transmitters and receivers. However, in 1938, the British Radio Manufacturers Association set standards that pushed these grassroots efforts aside. Thus, the chance for a more egalitarian form of television communication was lost.
Broadcasting was linked to strong economic interests and the structures of modern societies. Despite the efforts of TV amateurs, television in the USA in the early 1930s was mainly a medium for public viewing, often seen as a competitor to the film industry. In Britain and Germany, public viewing was how most people experienced television. While grassroots, two-way television was unlikely to succeed, public viewing systems in several countries in the 1930s posed a potential challenge to the domestic use of television. However, this threat did not materialize.
Manufacturers saw the potential for mass sales of home TV sets once prices dropped. With the rise of consumer society from the 1920s, the dream of the home as a center for entertainment became possible for many in Western countries. This trend is now global. There is a link between social modernization and the structure of broadcasting. As societies modernized, centralization of capital and power increased, and traditional communities broke up, leading to new ways of life. People became more mobile and isolated, making centralised broadcasting an effective way for governments to reach citizens and create a sense of national community.
Broadcasting became the dominant form of radio and television due to these structured processes and interests. However, broadcasting also played a role in democracy by providing equal access to information necessary for informed participation in society. Television is changing, and the term 'broadcasting' may become outdated. If so, this metaphor will refer to a specific phase of audio-visual technology during a centralised period of social modernization."
CPE_13,C2,"**Clutter**  
Sometimes it feels like no matter how many things you own, you never feel safe. It's normal to want a home that meets your needs, but sometimes the desire to get more things goes too far. Modern advertising is designed to make us feel insecure. The message is often: if you don't have this, you're not good enough. To see how much you're influenced, try not to read any ads next time you walk down the street. These expensive ads influence us in powerful ways without us noticing. We see them everywhere—on TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, T-shirts, the internet—all telling us to buy more.
**Caves**  
Research centers and universities around the world have spent years studying caves, focusing on their origins, water systems, and biology. Caves are a small but mysterious part of nature, sparking our curiosity and desire to learn. This has led to a lot of research. In places where caves affect our lives, studies have increased. However, exploring caves requires physical skill, so cave research is often done by both scientists and amateurs who enjoy visiting caves for fun. This creates a unique overlap between professional and amateur cave studies.
**Weather Watch**  
Many observant people, using only their senses, laid the foundations of meteorology, which has developed into the advanced science we have today. Satellites and electronic tools send us endless weather information quickly, and computers solve complex math problems faster than humans can. Meteorological theory uses long words that can be confusing to non-professionals. It might seem like there's no room for simple weather knowledge, but that's not true. Human experience is still crucial in turning data into weather forecasts. Human observations can provide unique insights that help professionals understand the atmosphere."
CPE_16,C2,"**MUSIC AND THEATRE**
Until recently, I believed opera was mainly theatre. Now, I think it's more about music. After working at a national opera house, I learned that music is the priority in opera. This makes sense, but I come from the theatre world, where the spoken word and the actor are most important. In theatre, there is no one directing the action once it starts, and the audience usually understands the language spoken on stage.
In musical performances, like concerts or operas, many people, including myself, may not have a deep understanding of music. Some might feel embarrassed by what they don't know, but most are amazed by the performers' skills. A brilliant singer or a perfect orchestra is easy to admire. Even a good musician shows the results of years of hard work. Watching top-class music is like watching a sports event; we see athletes doing something similar to us running for a bus, but they do it much better.
Theatre audiences have different expectations. They often don't understand an actor's skill and aren't as impressed by something that seems close to what they could do. They don't usually applaud when an actor finishes a long speech, although they often ask, ""How do you learn all those lines?"" This doesn't mean theatre audiences are more generous or less demanding than music audiences; many are the same people. It suggests that in theatre, audiences and performers meet on more equal terms, no matter how challenging the material is.
The question is, should music learn from theatre about this relationship? I think yes, because a different approach can change the concert-goer's experience. Live music is naturally theatrical, full of emotion and drama, and it can go wrong, engaging the listener's imagination as part of a group. However, music presentations often emphasize the difference between performers and listeners, which can feel hierarchical. Also, audiences sometimes interrupt performances by clapping at the wrong times, which can disrupt the flow of the music.
Is there a solution? Yes, much is being done to attract new audiences to concerts and operas and to make 'serious' music more accessible. I remember a special event, Jonathan Dove's community opera ""In Search of Angels,"" which moved from place to place in a cathedral and then into the town. It was a high-quality musical experience, where professional musicians played a central role, and it was life-changing for many in the audience, who also participated.
I wish music had more of the risk and boldness that theatre can show. Sometimes, this comes from using unusual locations, which can surprise both performers and audiences. It might be uncomfortable, with poor acoustics or cold temperatures, but theatre audiences have learned to be adventurous in such spaces. I know most plays are performed in a traditional way, similar to concerts. However, I believe something should change in music conventions. My only authority is as an enthusiast: I love theatre and spend as much time and money as I can on music. I want both to succeed and for more people to enjoy them as much as I do."
CPE_21,C2,"**Sand**
While I admire sand's amazing ability to be turned into useful things like glass and concrete, I am not a big fan of it in its natural form. To me, it is mainly an annoying barrier between a seaside car park and the water. It blows in your face, gets into your sandwiches, and hides important things like car keys and coins. When you are wet, it sticks to you like plaster and cannot be removed, even with a strong hose. But, strangely, as soon as you step onto a beach towel, get into a car, or walk across a clean carpet, it falls off you. For days after, you find piles of it on the floor every time you take off your shoes, and more of it spreads around when you remove your socks. Sand stays with you longer than many illnesses. No, you can keep sand, as far as I am concerned.
**Lock and Key**
The search for a safe home, for privacy and security, has existed since humans first built permanent homes. The wooden beam behind the door may have been replaced by an electronic lock activated by a plastic card with more combinations than there are atoms in the universe, but the desire to keep out the 'bad guys' remains. The appeal of a lock and key is partly psychological. Recently, some companies have tried computerized locking systems, where smart cards, swiped through a 'reader', control electronic locks with a digital command. But people don't like them. You might accept it at work, but at home, everyone wants the comfort of turning a physical key in a lock. As a result, when one locksmith company developed a new electronic system, they made sure to include a real metal key in the device.
**Modern Art**
I was nervous about visiting the new Tate Modern gallery because, like many people, I can't understand modern art. I know I quite like some of it, especially furry things, neon light sculptures, and large photographs. Maybe if I knew more about it, I'd have an opinion on more things. Then again, you're not supposed to approach it like a school essay. The point is not to understand art, but to let it communicate with you. This is a great idea, but it never worked for me. However, this new gallery has tried to give visitors a real insight into the reasons behind the works. The first thing I noticed were the labels, proper labels that put a work in context and actually told you what it was trying to say. Instead of staring blankly at the pictures as I used to, these bits of information helped me understand."
CPE_46,C2,"**Every Picture Tells a Story**
Adapting novels into films often means reducing, condensing, and deleting parts of the story. This can be frustrating for writers but also enlightening. When I worked on a script, I realized how much dialogue and description from the novel could be left out while still conveying the same message. This doesn't mean the original text was unnecessary. It's about the different ways each medium engages the audience and uses repetition. In novels, repetition helps readers remember character traits and who is speaking. In stage drama, speech often imitates real conversation, sometimes using language that seems redundant but serves to connect speakers. In some modern plays, this redundancy is extreme, making the dialogue seem like it’s just for show, leaving the audience unsure of the message.
**Watching Movies**
Watching movies can transport you into another world, making you forget reality for a while. During the film, it feels like what you do doesn't matter. But when the lights come back on, you're back in the real world. This feeling of unreality makes it hard to take movies seriously as art. In the past, many people, including our parents and teachers, saw movies as just entertainment, not art.
**The Film Studios**
The Leiper Film Company studios were a mix of different buildings, with a confusing layout. There were a few permanent landmarks like the Script Department, but most rooms looked the same and were hard to find. The studio had no clear main entrance, which made it confusing for newcomers. However, strangers were rare because the studio didn't encourage them. Employees, who knew their way around, worked together to create films that offered audiences an escape from everyday life.
**Film-makers**
Many people dream of making movies. Bookstores are full of guides on scriptwriting and film production, and universities offer courses. Competitions offer cameras like the one Robert Rodriguez used to make El Mariachi, a film that cost $7,000 and made him a famous director. Rodriguez's success story is a dream come true. He recalls thinking he had only a few years to make his breakthrough film, comparing himself to famous directors like Orson Welles and Steven Spielberg. In the past, filmmakers took time to develop their skills, often starting with small projects. Directors like John Huston and Fred Zinnemann only made their mark later in life. Today, without studio support, aspiring filmmakers often have to be independent and resourceful."
CPE_3,C2,"In those days, council houses covered the western side of the city: rows of crowded, dull homes in orange half-brick or pale white stucco. In summer, chemicals from the May and Baker factory, two miles away, filled the air with a strong smell of sulphur. The most common sight in that part of Norwich early in the morning was a paperboy wrinkling his nose in disgust as he walked up to someone's front door. Most of my early life is a blur. But I do remember sitting, or maybe balancing, near an upstairs window, watching the houses fade into the distance. Later, there are other vague memories - faces I can't name, my mother ironing towels in a house that I don't think was ours, snow falling over the turrets of the great mansion at Earlham. It's no surprise that my mother appears in these early memories. I remember her as a small, precise, and often angry woman, though I never understood why she was angry, so I couldn't do anything to make her happy. Even as a child, when I went with her to the small shops in Bunnett Square or on longer trips into the city, I sensed her unusual personality. She was the most solitary person I have ever known, as alone in a room full of people as on a moor. She also had a strict sense of propriety uncommon on the West Earlham estate, which sometimes led to furious cleaning or handwashing and instructions to 'behave properly'. As a moral code, this was beyond my understanding: even now, I'm not sure I get it. Specifically, it meant not walking into neighbors' gardens or damaging their rose bushes; it meant sitting quietly for long periods in the dining room, with your hands folded, listening to radio programs my mother liked; it meant - oh, many rules and restrictions. Over time, other figures appeared in these strict early scenes. Despite her solitude, my mother had friends. There was Mrs. Buddery, who was obsessed with the Royal Family, Mrs. Winall, who said nothing except to agree with the main speaker, and Mrs. Laband - livelier than the others, and somewhat disapproved of by them. It was only later that I realized how poor their company was; they formed a sad and depressing group, talking about bad legs, the cold weather, and ungrateful children, a category I often felt I belonged to. Looking back, it felt like a heavy weight, made up of the West Earlham houses, my mother and her friends, and the need to 'behave properly', was on my shoulders, and that I had to grow up quickly to free myself from it. This was easier said than done. Growing up in West Earlham at this time followed a set pattern. Until you were five, you stayed at home and got in your parents' way (I remember boring days, when I was about four, playing on a rug in the front room while my mother sat coldly in an armchair). Then, the September after your fifth birthday, you went to Avenue Road infants school, half a mile away towards the city. The lucky few had a mother with a rickety bike and a child seat - these were strange contraptions made of cast-iron with makeshift safety straps. As far as I remember, my mother left me in the care of other children in the street for this journey. If I remember anything about these early years, it's the summer holidays, those days when you caught glimpses of the world outside West Earlham: an old man who lived next to Mrs. Buddery and told stories about his time in the Merchant Navy; a charity fete once, at a house far away on Christchurch Road, where a kind woman gave out lemonade and tried to interest me in something called the League of Pity - a kind of junior charity, I think - only for my mother to dismiss it, saying its organizers were 'only after your money'. My mother often talked about people having selfish motives, and she had a deep contempt for politicians. If she thought of the House of Commons - and I'm not sure she could imagine such a thing - it was like a fancy post office where rich people opened letters full of five-pound notes sent by a gullible public. No doubt I exaggerate. No doubt I overlook her good qualities and focus on her flaws. But there was little kindness in my mother; it had all been drained from her. To be fair, my mother wasn't unaware of her role in my education. Occasionally on Sundays, she would take me - in my 'good clothes' - on the 85 bus to the Norwich Castle Museum. Here, hand-in-hand, cautious but aware of the free entry, we would walk through rooms of paintings by the Norwich School of Artists. My mother wasn't entirely against this activity, and eventually, she almost formed opinions on the various subjects. I remember her stopping once in front of a painting of a Roman soldier in full battle gear to say, 'Well, I wouldn't like to meet him on a dark night!' I recall this as the only time my mother tried to make a joke."
CPE_10,C2,"**Philadelphia Avenue**
I walked down Philadelphia Avenue on the side with odd-numbered houses. The evening was getting darker, and the air was thick with a light, prickly drizzle. This made my walk feel secretive and sheltered. I knew this side of the street well since childhood. Our neighbors were the Matzes and the Pritchards, and there was Han Kieffer's grocery store. My first playmates, all girls, lived in the Kring's and the Pottses' houses. Even if I didn't know everyone by name, each house was familiar to me, like the little grooves in the sidewalk that guided rainwater to the street. These grooves marked my path when I used roller skates or my scooter. As the street went downhill, the houses seemed to get simpler, with lower porches and smaller front yards. Over the years, changes happened: wooden porch railings and pillars were replaced with wrought iron in a style that seemed Southern or Spanish. In Shillington, some houses I remembered as homes became stores, and some stores, like Pep Conrad's and Han Kieffer's, became homes again. I wondered how people lived in those spaces that used to be shops, with the lingering smells of merchandise.
**Bachelor Fads**
Furniture designer Rick Gilbert lives in a flat that used to be a curtain warehouse. It has typical loft features like exposed brickwork and large doors, which were used to bring in curtains from trains on the nearby railway. However, Gilbert didn't want an open-plan space for both practical and aesthetic reasons. 'In my last place, living and working spaces were combined. It was hard to relax or start work when everything was in view.' So, he divided the space near the entrance with a large sheet of corrugated plastic. 'It hides the office, creates a hallway, and leads the eye to the kitchen in the middle of the flat. I wanted the kitchen to be a neutral area, where I can either cook for friends or make coffee for clients.' To balance the modern look of the plastic screen and stainless steel kitchen, Gilbert used light wood for the floors. While his flat has futuristic chairs and sofas, it also has sentimental and homely furniture from his parents or bought from markets.
**Bruce Chatwin**
Was Bruce Chatwin trying to escape or explore? His romantic and wandering lifestyle has become a mystery in literature. Chatwin's life and work were full of secrets, subtle connections, and sometimes lies. Despite this, he was a brilliant and unique writer. His first book, ""In Patagonia,"" published in 1977, is a remarkable work of imagination. It is a travel book that changed travel writing, with the excitement of a thriller, the charm of romantic fiction, and the deep insight of extraordinary literature. Even in this book, Chatwin mixed fact with fiction; he would change or even ignore reality to make a story more interesting or to highlight the book's theme—that through travel, one could discover entire histories that seemed to exist just to captivate future explorers.
**Swimming**
Warm rain poured from the gutter during a midsummer storm as I hurried across the lawn behind my house and took shelter in the pool. Swimming back and forth, I kept my eyes just above the water. Each raindrop created a small, bouncing fountain that turned into a bubble and then burst. The best moments were when the storm grew stronger, drowning out the birdsong, and a mist rose from the water as if the pool was reaching up to meet the darkening sky. It was during this heavy rain in the summer of 1996 that I started thinking about a long swim through Britain. I wanted to follow the rain as it traveled across the land to the sea, to escape the monotony of swimming laps, always turning back like a tiger pacing in a cage. Most of us live in a world where more and more places and things are labeled and explained. This is turning reality into something visual. That's why walking, cycling, and swimming are rebellious activities. They help us reconnect with what is old and wild by getting off the beaten path and breaking free from the official version of things. A swimming journey would let me explore parts of our world that, like darkness, misty woods, or high mountains, still hold mystery."
CPE_67,C2,"'CRYING Charles Darwin thought that humans cry for no clear evolutionary reason. He was probably wrong. More recently, scientists have noted its social importance. Psychiatrist John Bowlby emphasized crying's role in forming bonds between mother and child. Many think that tears, especially in children, show helplessness. But why adults cry is harder to understand. The sound of crying seems less important than the visual signal it sends. In early human groups, crying might have helped build trust and social connections. Tears can also have other reasons. We might cry to show sympathy for those facing injustice. Additionally, tears can come unexpectedly, to our embarrassment, when we hear inspiring music or speeches. We might cry during a sentimental movie, but interestingly, this happens more often with others than when alone. The social role of crying seems clear, but research continues.'"
CPE_27,C2,"**The Heat is On**
We all know about global warming, but how much warmer will the Earth get, and how will it affect us? Many people have an idea of what global warming is, but its consequences are uncertain. A warmer climate will likely change the weather worldwide. Since the atmosphere is connected to everything on our planet, changes in climate will significantly impact plants, animals, water, and soil. Humans rely on these natural resources to produce food, build cities, and support billions of people. Any changes to these resources are serious.
The challenge is understanding how the world will change and what causes these changes. Over the last 100 years, human activities have increased the levels of certain gases in the atmosphere, which are linked to global temperatures. These increased levels are likely affecting the global climate, but our limited understanding of the global heat balance makes the future uncertain. We do know that greenhouse gas levels have changed in line with global temperatures over the past 40,000 years, suggesting a strong connection. Evidence shows that the Earth's surface has warmed by about 0.6°C over the past century. Most scientists believe this warming is not natural and is partly due to human pollution.
Research has focused on predicting the effects of higher global temperatures using computer programs called general circulation models (GCMs). These models use physics and chemistry to analyze climate factors and predict past, present, and future conditions. However, they are simplifications and have limitations. Despite these challenges, most agree that the rate of climate change will be faster than ever before. GCMs suggest that by 2100, the average global temperature could rise by 1°C to 3.5°C, sea levels could rise by 15-95 cm, and precipitation patterns could change. Extreme weather events like heatwaves, floods, and droughts may become more common.
Climate change can affect the locations of ecosystems, like forests and grasslands, and the species they contain. This impacts resources we depend on, such as food, water, and human settlements. Some effects may be irreversible and harmful, but not all. Some impacts could be beneficial. For example, in Australia, warmer temperatures have increased wheat yields by reducing frost damage.
However, many predicted effects of future warming are not beneficial. Small climate changes can affect water availability, especially in dry regions or areas with existing shortages. The Mediterranean Basin has seen less rainfall and changes in seasonal patterns. Glacial changes will affect ice, vegetation, wildlife, and human structures. The Arctic ice cover might melt completely, easing marine transport but increasing iceberg risks.
The most dramatic effect of global warming could be rising sea levels due to ocean expansion and melting ice. With about half the world's population living in coastal areas, the consequences could be severe. Cities like London, New York, and Tokyo might face significant flooding. Many people could lose their homes, creating environmental refugees. Small, low-lying island nations could be most affected, potentially disappearing entirely, which would be devastating for their people and cultures, as well as for countries that would need to accommodate displaced populations."
CPE_66,C2,"'Mission to Mars Wanted: a middle-aged, married couple for a 501-day round trip to Mars. Applicants must be physically and emotionally strong. This will be the profile of the first astronauts to go to Mars if multi-millionaire Dennis Tito's plans to launch a capsule on 5 January 2018 succeed. The capsule will take the crew to about 160 km above Mars. The spacecraft will use Mars's gravity to return to Earth without using more fuel, as saving fuel is important. The 2018 date is set because the next time Mars and Earth align for a launch is in 2031. It's a normal order, but there is a rush to create systems with new technologies. If these can be ready in time, the spacecraft might succeed. But even if it never leaves Earth, the efforts to reach these goals will still be valuable for future missions.'"
CPE_44,C2,"**Aesthetics**
Sometimes, the very existence of art can make it hard to understand aesthetic theory. This is because art is often seen as just physical objects like buildings, books, paintings, or statues, separate from human experience. However, the true essence of art lies in what it does to our experiences. This misunderstanding can hinder our understanding of art.
Moreover, the perfection and long-standing admiration of some art pieces create conventions that block new insights. Once an art piece becomes a classic, it often gets disconnected from the human conditions that created it and the effects it has on people's lives. When art is separated from its origins and its impact on experience, it becomes difficult to grasp its broader significance, which is what aesthetic theory tries to address. Art is often placed in a separate realm, disconnected from other human efforts and achievements.
A key task for anyone writing about the philosophy of fine arts is to reconnect art with everyday experiences. Just like mountains are part of the earth, art should be seen as part of human experience. Geographers and geologists show how mountains are connected to the earth, and similarly, those who study art should show how it connects to life.
To truly understand art, we need to temporarily set aside the art objects themselves and focus on the ordinary experiences that we don't usually consider aesthetic. We must approach the theory of art indirectly. Just as one can enjoy flowers without knowing plant biology, understanding art requires looking at the basic experiences that capture our attention and bring us joy.
Many people enjoy things like movies, jazz, and comic strips without considering them as art. This is because art is often seen as something that belongs in museums and galleries. However, the desire for enjoyable experiences finds expression in everyday life. Even those who criticize the museum view of art often still separate art from ordinary experiences. The best appreciation of art happens when it is closely connected to everyday life."

In popular imagination, lions hunting for food are seen as a marvel of teamwork: in the fading light of sunset, a group of stealthy cats emerges from the shadows like trained hunters and surrounds their unsuspecting prey. Lions seem to be the perfect social animals, putting aside disagreements to work together for a common goal - their next meal. However, after many years of observing these animals in the wild, we have a different view. When we began our research in 1978, we wanted to find out why lions hunt together, raise cubs, and scare off rivals with loud roars. If an animal's success is measured by how many surviving offspring it produces, then cooperation might not always be beneficial: if an animal is too generous, its companions gain at its expense. So, why didn't the evolutionary rules of self-interest apply to lions? We thought we could solve this in two to three years. But lions are very good at doing nothing. To the list of inactive noble gases, like krypton, argon, and neon, we would add lions. It has taken various research methods to uncover clues about their behavior. Since wild lions can live up to 18 years, the answers to our questions are only now becoming clear.
**Pop Music Review**
The release of Bedrock's third album was more than just a milestone for a talented but previously unstable band. ""New Life"" started a movement that changed the style of rock music in this country for the rest of the decade. Gone were the serious angst, plain clothes, and loud guitars of the past; in came a lighter mix of melodious local styles. A combination of social observation and strong anger mixed easily with the sound of fairground organs and northern brass bands. Humor and irony were prominent, as were voices that didn't hide their origins. The album showed Bedrock as skilled collectors and observers, and a clever team of songwriters. At their most obvious, they playfully explored traditional English themes like sunbathing and Sunday afternoons. But the album's real strength was in the gentle, sad depths it reached on tracks like 'So Low', a beautiful tune loosely based on weather, and 'To the Brink', a ballad that allowed no joking. The beauty of ""New Life"" is its consistently high quality - 16 tracks with no filler, an unmatched record in the era of long CDs.
**Extract from an Autobiography**
As a child, I was always fascinated by stories of 'The Sibyl', those wise women who had great influence in the ancient world. At first, I only knew of one from a story my mother told me. An old woman from Cumae offered Tarquin, King of Rome, nine books for 300 gold pieces. He refused, and she burned three of them, offering him six for the same price. When he refused again, she burned three more books. He bought the remaining three for the full 300 gold pieces. I realized even then that there was a deep truth in the story - a lesson in salesmanship and life. I was sometimes a lonely only child. I would ask to play with other children and be refused. My mother told me to do something so interesting that all the other kids would want to join me. It worked. It was another lesson I've never forgotten. When I was given the chance to write a travel book, I had to find something I was interested in, something relevant to my life. I'm a reluctant traveler - I sent my editor a long list of places I didn't want to go. In the end, I'm only interested in ruins because I like traveling through time in my mind.
**What Becomes of Your Manuscript?**
When you submit your manuscript, it will likely join a pile waiting for someone to sort through it before it topples over - the so-called slush pile. This person is usually either a junior in the editorial department (under 18) or an experienced person who comes in a few mornings a week and is paid by the hour. Neither has much influence, but they are on your side and want to find something original - the junior to make a name and acquire an author if they are lucky, the experienced person to justify continued freelance work. If they think your novel is promising, they will pass it to a more senior editor, and eventually, it will be discussed at an acquisition meeting. The editor supporting your novel will need to justify accepting it based on its quality and potential sales, and also whether you seem to be a long-term prospect (which you will have assured them of in your letter). Additionally, they will consider how promotable you are - an important factor - when a new novel needs all the help it can get. For this reason, publishers often like to meet a potential author before finalizing the offer."
CPE_39,C2,"**Advertising on Trial**
If you worked in an advertising agency in the early 1990s, you might have faced the toughest time in your career. The recession was severe, lasting longer and hitting harder than expected, especially in industrialized countries. In Britain, 1991 saw a decline in GDP, high interest rates, reduced consumer spending, over half a million job losses, and 75,000 homes repossessed. Every business was affected, with some industries like vehicles and construction seeing a 30% drop.
Advertising professionals were not the only ones losing jobs, but those who remained employed felt significant pressure. They were expected to support company profits while working with smaller budgets. Despite these challenges, the importance of marketing grew. Companies began focusing more on producing what customers wanted rather than what was convenient for them. This shift increased the status of marketing professionals but also added to their responsibilities.
Marketing is often seen as a solution to all problems, and with about half of marketing budgets spent on advertising, the pressure is on advertising professionals. The 1980s were a good time for advertising, but the 1990s brought a downturn. This was partly due to the economic climate, but also because companies started questioning the value of advertising. Without clear evidence of its benefits, many companies doubted the return on their investment.
Client companies demanded better strategies, targeting, creativity, and media placement from advertising agencies. They wanted the best people working hard to produce outstanding work. This meant advertising professionals had to do more with less, facing the same challenges as their clients.
Several factors made creating effective advertising difficult. Some were due to the recession, like debates over production costs and a reluctance to take risks. Other challenges included demographic changes, the growing power of retailers, changing consumer needs, the rise of sponsorship, stricter legal restrictions, and the challenge of advertising abroad.
These issues forced advertisers to reconsider the effectiveness of their work. The pressure to increase the success rate of advertising was higher than ever. However, finding help was difficult. Companies and agencies were too busy managing these challenges to share their strategies, and those who succeeded were reluctant to reveal their secrets. Conferences and seminars offered some insights, but available books on advertising often failed to provide practical guidance. They tended to overestimate the quality and value of advertising work, which did not help those responsible for it."
CPE_18,C2,"**The Lure of the Kitchen**
When I was at university, I decided I wanted to be a chef. Among my peers, this was an unusual choice. Cooking was not one of the popular jobs that most of us wanted. On the surface, it seems like an unattractive profession. Chefs are known to have tough lives: the work is long, stressful, basic, and poorly paid. But these factors didn't discourage me. I was unhappy at university. The work was difficult, and the social scene felt closed and self-important. Being a chef seemed like the perfect escape from intellectual and social pretensions. It promised a seriousness and honesty that I found missing in my college life. However, my desire to cook wasn't just a reaction to being a student. It also represented an artistic ideal. My first glimpse of this ideal came when I ate a meal at a famous London restaurant. It was eye-opening. I still clearly remember my starter. I finished that meal wanting to thank the chef who made it. I felt happy and light for days afterward. After this, I developed a strong desire to learn the secrets of this amazing art. I turned my student life into a long preparation for entering the culinary world. My history degree became a hollow distraction from my true path. I got my real education in a random and incomplete way by reading cookbooks, exploring markets and delicatessens, and making extravagant meals.
**Extract from a novel**
The school's swimming instructor was a former drill sergeant, small and muscular, with tattooed arms. When I asked him to teach me how to dive, he told me to sit on the pool's edge, put my hands above my head, and roll forward, pushing myself off with my feet. I practiced that move until the hour was up. The next visit, he had me standing upright and diving off the edge. The instructor was strict, and every time I surfaced, he looked at me with disapproval: 'Don't look down, look up!' 'Keep your legs straight.' 'Point your toes, I said!' The next week, I went up onto the high board. It was a fixed board, and its front edge bent slightly downward. It seemed very high as I stood there, trying to gather my courage. Gradually, the echoing voices disappeared, and I felt as if I were wrapped in silence. I waved my arms vaguely as I'd been taught, tried to look up, not down, and launched myself into space. For a brief moment, I was flying. When I hit the water, I crumpled awkwardly, and my legs were all over the place. The instructor looked at me with contempt and shook his head. But even he could not lessen my joy. That's what they mean by 'free as a bird,' I thought.
**The Traveller**
For those of us who value a comfortable bed, running water, and the likelihood of living at least until tomorrow, the idea of the traveller seems both puzzling and fascinating. These are people who have given in to the dangerous allure of the unknown, who actually choose to risk their lives by climbing the steep and icy face of a mountain prone to avalanches; who sail alone in fragile boats through towering seas; who will eat maggots and river insects if nothing better is available and who can live, day and night for months, in the shadow and promise of the unknown. It is easy to dismiss such people as oddities - as indeed they are - to be placed among the truly eccentric: hermits, freefall divers, or even writers. Their existence cannot be denied, but the strange, uncomfortable world they inhabit lies far outside our everyday experience and can be dismissed, we tell ourselves, as irrelevant. We can shrug our shoulders and return thankfully to our world of microwave ovens and answering machines, glad that the only risks to our health are predictable ones, like making a dangerous dash across a city street.
**SAILING**
Jonathan Raban is afraid of the sea, saying it is not his natural environment, which is probably why he spends so much time on it. He does not claim to be a world-class sailor, though he is clearly a competent one. His main reason for sailing is that, being a writer, he likes to write about having sailed. Sailing is sure to provide exciting events and achievements for him to write about. Raban's small boat carries an electronic device that instantly gives sailors their position to within a few meters, anywhere on the earth's surface. Although he strongly approves of this instrument, there is more than a hint of old-fashioned thinking in Raban's attitude to other sea-faring aids. He believes the invention of the compass was a disaster, causing a 'fundamental rift in the relationship between man and sea.' Raban argues that since it came into use, perhaps a thousand years ago, it has become the main focus of the steersman's attention, with the result that he no longer has to study the waves and feel the sea. And the ocean, once a place with all sorts of things happening in it, is now reduced to just a space. Since his job is merely to keep steady on a course, the helmsman can be replaced for long periods by an autopilot. This may be why Raban had time to look so carefully at the waves."
CPE_62,C2,"**Holiday Reading**
Summer gives us two great joys: leaving home and reading books. These joys are closely linked. Books help us feel more connected to the world. We can relate our experiences to those in books from long ago or faraway places because there are fewer human types than there are people. In books, we find our own thoughts and feelings. Authors can describe situations we thought were unique to us, or express our thoughts with clarity we can't achieve. What is unclear in us is clearly expressed in their words, especially if the book is from a different place or time. We feel thankful to these authors for helping us understand ourselves. Through reading and travel, we break free from routine. Our eyes are most open during our first days in a new place, or when reading a great book. Books help us notice things we ignored before. We become aware of the sky's colors, a friend's hypocrisy, or a hidden sadness we didn't know we had.
**Author's Note**
These travel reflections were published as articles in the Observer newspaper over seven years. I have restored some small cuts made by the editor, but added little else. I corrected a few mistakes, but only if they were important details. I could have made more changes, but that would never end. For example, in the second article about China, I thought the Hong Kong dollar would stay strong, but it fell a year later. If I changed the article to predict this, it would no longer be a report from that time. Like any traveler, I was there at that moment, unaware of the future, trying to understand what had already happened. This is the story of mass travel: the world opening up to people with no qualifications except the price of a ticket. But I believe my fellow travelers were not blind. Even a postcard can have a purpose.
**Ecotourism**
If there were awards for misused tourism phrases, 'ecotourism' would win. The term appeared in the early 1980s, reflecting a rise in environmental awareness. Tour operators realized travelers wanted to believe their trips wouldn't harm the environment. It became a popular marketing term. Now, 'ecotourism' includes anything from living with remote tribes for two weeks to a one-hour boat trip in Australia. Any tour involving culture, nature, wildlife, or adventure is labeled ecotourism. The original motives were good, helping people make informed choices. But without regulations or a clear definition, travelers are lost in an ecotourism jungle.
**Transylvanian Journey**
I lost my notebook from my Transylvanian journey for 50 years, but found it by luck. It helped me write about that time, but not as much as it should have. In Transylvania, I had an easier time than expected, staying in hospitable country houses for weeks. When I stopped moving, I stopped writing, thinking there was nothing to record. I was slow to start writing again, and sometimes only took notes instead of writing a full story. Worried that details might be out of order, I added many disclaimers. But then I realized this book wasn't a guidebook, so I let the story tell itself without too many warnings."
CPE_49,C2,"**Fashion**
Fashion is often thought of as a modern idea, linked to the capitalism of the 19th and 20th centuries. However, many fashion historians argue that fashion, in terms of style and design, has a long history. They often start with the rise of markets and trade in the 16th and 17th centuries. As societies have become more complex, populations have grown, and new technologies for making different types of clothing and accessories have been discovered, the meanings of clothing have also become more complex. Today, it is hard to say exactly what any piece of clothing or accessory means. For example, a man's suit, which seems to be a symbol of uniformity, can have very different meanings in different situations and to different people.
**Writer**
Reports of publishers fighting over new manuscripts have given a false idea of what life is like for most novelists. For those of us not at the top of the best-seller lists, there are two ways to make a living. The smartest among us write in the evenings and have other full-time jobs that are secure even if the book doesn't become a hit. Others, like me, do various literary jobs, such as teaching, running workshops, and writing articles like this one. I've heard of a writing job at a chocolate factory, but I've never had such luck. Still, by juggling part-time jobs, using credit cards, and often relying on the generosity of people mentioned in Acknowledgements, the novel gets written.
**Sudden Fame**
The small venues we were playing at around the country were starting to sell out, and extra security was needed to manage the growing number of screaming fans. We had to use secret entrances to the places we performed to avoid being mobbed. On the few nights we weren't working, it was hard to leave the house without being chased by fans. In just a few days, we became celebrities. Our fans watched our every move, and our management and others took care of all our needs. Even though I was always shy, this was replaced by a strange over-confidence that only naturally shy people in similar situations can understand. In short, I was emotionally overwhelmed."
CPE_31,C2,"**Music - The Challenge Ahead**
Technological advances are changing our lives at work, home, and during leisure. Susan Hallam talks about their impact on music in Britain. In the late 20th century, there were more ways to listen to music through radio, TV, records, tapes, CDs, videos, and new multimedia methods. However, live music performances and full-time jobs for musicians have decreased. It seems clear that access to music will keep growing because it meets many human needs. National events always include music, and for individuals, it offers many activities, both formal and informal. A society without music is hard to imagine. The question is not if there will be music in the 21st century, but what kind it will be and if people will still want to learn musical instruments.
I believe people will continue to learn instruments. The music industry is a big source of income in Britain, and musical skills will remain important for jobs, especially in media. Besides job opportunities, playing an instrument may help develop skills early on. Research in the USA suggests that listening to or making music can improve spatial reasoning, a part of intelligence. Although these results need more confirmation, studies in Europe show that group music lessons can improve social relationships in school and help young children and those with behavioral issues concentrate better. Further research is exploring if playing an instrument can help develop skills that can be used in other areas. For example, regular practice might help with good study habits and focus, and playing in concerts might teach punctuality and organization. For these reasons, there will likely be a demand for music lessons in the short term.
What about the long-term future? Will there be a change in focus, and if so, in what direction? I think two things are likely. First, the types of music people listen to will become more varied, with new genres mixing different styles. Second, technology will be used more in composing and performing music, making it easier for people to compose without needing technical skills. However, this might further reduce the need for live performances and musicians focused only on them. Alongside this trend, more people of all ages will want to participate in making music. These activities will likely be community-based and reflect local musical traditions.
To prepare for this future, the music profession needs to change. Instrumental teaching must adapt to allow more people to learn different instruments throughout their lives. This will affect the music curriculum and how progress is measured, requiring them to stay relevant for a wider audience and include more musical skills. Training musicians will be crucial. They need to motivate and teach learners of all ages, work with large and diverse groups, and develop communication, social, entrepreneurial, and management skills for community work. This is a big change from traditional methods and will require accountability. Positively, it offers a chance to show the high quality of music education available.
Finally, we need to raise the profile of music. Music is vital in our lives but often taken for granted. Everyone in the music profession should work together to change this."
CPE_58,C2,"**The Actor's Craft**
Actors sometimes face criticism and mockery. This often happens when they talk about their work in interviews, as required by their film or theatre companies. They might benefit from the approach of dancer Pavlova, who, when asked to explain her dance, replied, ""If I could tell you, I wouldn't dance it."" Instead, actors often fall into using clichés or get caught up in gossip. Paul Scofield once wrote to a friend, saying that an actor's work is only alive and interesting when performed. Discussing it makes it seem empty and theoretical. Acting has no strict rules, except perhaps being heard clearly. With each new play, actors start fresh, learning and growing with the characters and the writer's insights. Once a play ends, actors feel empty until the next project. This emptiness is evident in any discussion about theatre work.
**A Review of Hamlet**
Adrian Lester's portrayal of Hamlet is a balance between youth and adulthood, marked by simplicity and confidence. His command of the text and his self-control elevate him to a top-level actor. Lester plays a tense young man, driven by a hidden anger, with a sharp wit and humor that make him both intimidating and endearing. His performance is subtly brilliant. Notice how his body language, like his stiff arms, suggests a character ready to come to life. Handy's portrayal of Horatio gives a similar impression of being moved by an inner force. This raises questions about acting and behavior: Is acting an imitation or a creation of real behavior? What drives these characters, both morally and physically? This is a key question in theatre.
**One Director's Approach to Rehearsal**
This director's rehearsal process begins with ""dropping in."" The stage manager projects the script onto a screen. Actors sit quietly, absorbing the words. When it's their turn, they look at the screen, understand the first phrase, think about its meaning, wait for the impulse to speak, and then speak. For example, with the line, ""Queuing all night, the rain, do you remember?"" actors breathe, let the thought sink in, and visualize a scene, like waiting in line for a concert. They find the impulse to speak, which the director calls ""The pathway to the line."" Impulses can come from outside or within. Actors should look into the eyes of their scene partner and consider their character's situation. The director encourages actors to approach with an open mind and trust that something will happen.
**The Perfect Theatre**
The perfect theatre should make you feel that your presence matters. Attending a live performance is an event, and the staff should recognize this. It's off-putting if the staff treats it as just another job. The theatre should create a connection between the performer and the audience. No audience member should feel they have a poor view of the actor. It's important that they are close enough to hear, see, and feel connected to the stage. The size and shape of the auditorium matter. It should complement the human voice and body. If the auditorium is too large, it can overshadow the actors. Many late nineteenth-century theatres got this right by designing spaces that embrace the stage. I prefer theatres with a sense of history, like worn steps in a church, which suggest layers of human presence. Regarding plays, you can't please everyone. You can't predict what the audience will want. When you go to the theatre, you want to see something unexpected, something you couldn't imagine at home."
CPE_37,C2,"**Paul Simon and Rock and Roll**
In the 1950s, rock and roll was mainly popular among young people. However, its real importance was the big impact it had on middle-class and older people. It also set the stage for the next group of rock stars, who listened to it with amazement, knowing that this new, exciting music would be a big part of their lives. For Paul Simon and other young people in the US, the main way to hear this fresh and exciting music was through Alan Freed's radio show, Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party. Freed's show was a must-listen for many future rock stars. Like young John Lennon, who listened to Radio Luxembourg in Liverpool, Paul Simon was captivated by the music from Freed's show. He was ready to move from just listening to music to creating his own.
**Snow Adventure**
There was no clear path, but I thought I would be safe if I walked carefully. The wind was strong, pushing me as I slipped on the icy ground. Suddenly, the snow beneath me gave way. I fell into a hole about four feet deep. The snow had formed a thin layer over a gap between two rocks, which melted and left a fragile crust that I broke through. I pulled myself out, feeling shaken and worried, thinking about what I would have done if the hole had been much deeper. I leaned against a pine tree sticking out of the snow to assess my situation. In an hour, I had only covered about half a mile. It was clear I needed to change my plan.
**Understanding Qualitative Research**
There are many books now that try to guide researchers on qualitative research. While a lot is written about collecting data, these books often do not explain how to analyze the data. There is a lot of mystery around how researchers analyze their data. So, we asked different social scientists who have done qualitative research to talk about the methods they used. The goal was to share insights into the process of analyzing qualitative data, not to create a guidebook for new researchers. This involves making hidden processes more clear. While this might seem easy, we found it quite challenging. We allowed our contributors to present their work in different styles, including personal stories and more formal approaches."
CPE_2,C2,"**Screen Learning**
A few days ago, I saw my six-year-old eating noodles in a funny way. He was pulling them up with his teeth and trying to look fierce. ""I'm a little dinosaur,"" he said. He was acting out a scene from a TV show, so I asked him what he remembered about dinosaurs. The answer was, not much. Many people are eager to use the internet and computers for learning, but is learning from a screen effective? One writer shared his experience with an interactive program he tried with his son. The father read the words carefully, while the son played with the pictures. ""If he had spent ten minutes with a book, he might have learned something,"" said the father. Television, as my son and his noodles show, is a medium that suggests ideas rather than teaches them directly. Research shows that learning happens best in an environment where there is dialogue with teachers or parents. It needs guidance. Using new technology to teach children is fine, but formal education still plays a big role.
**Hollywood**
By 1918, most of the world's film-making had moved to Hollywood. Locals didn't like it, seeing their area of Los Angeles changed by these newcomers. But eventually, they accepted it because of the success it brought. Success in Hollywood is measured by box-office earnings. Hollywood knows a good film when it sees one: it might make a star, but it must make money. In less than a century, Hollywood grew from a small village to a town as famous as New York, Rome, or Paris. Physically, it has changed a lot: a century ago, you would walk through orange groves to the village store. Yet, in some ways, it is still like a village - small-minded, with limited views - just a part of Los Angeles. For those who live and work there, the main topic is films: how much they have made, who is dating whom, who has been betrayed, who is working on which project. Successful people often try to leave: to work there, but live elsewhere. Yet it is still the place where almost everyone in show-business eventually goes.
**Photography**
Photography was created by nineteenth-century artists as a new art form. These artists wanted a lasting, accurate record of their surroundings, and they found it. The new combination of light, lens, shutter, and a surface with light-sensitive chemicals created images more lasting and detailed than paintings. This worried other artists; after their initial excitement, art critics claimed that photography was not art. They said photography was too tied to the real world and relied too much on machines to be considered a creative act. Despite the critics, photographers knew they had found a new art form. They used their tools like other artists use brushes and pencils - to interpret the world and show a vision of nature and people.
**Book Illustration**
During the black-and-white era of book illustration, it was common for every children's book to have illustrations. This included many novels for older readers, which later had fewer illustrations as print runs became shorter. Children's publishing was active, but often low-budget, leading to some routine and mediocre work. However, the best artists always did their best work. The black-and-white archive is a mix of junk and treasure, a great place for research or browsing. The real treasures are likely to be shown again, either through reissues of books or new publications about the artists. There are signs that interest in this period is returning, and publishers may see the potential for a series of classic children's book illustrations, either as reprints or new editions using the original artwork."
CPE_68,C2,"**Blogging: Sharing with the World**
Some time ago, a website warned about the risks of public check-ins—telling everyone online where you are. The message was clear: you might think you're just saying, ""Hey, I'm here,"" but you're also letting everyone know you're not at home, including people you might not want to meet. This highlighted the potential downsides of sharing too much online. The internet offers many chances to share our lives with a global audience, promising things like wealth and fame. So, we dive into the online world, sharing confessions, photos, and stories. But soon, we realize it's a crowded and risky place, and we might get lost.
Feeling worried? Maybe, but don't lose hope. This future has a guide, created by early internet users. In the early days of the web, they explored these challenges. They lost jobs, made and lost friends, and dealt with the ups and downs of fame—long before social media existed. These early bloggers have already experienced what many of us are now facing. Before we forget their stories, it's worth learning from them. As the saying goes, those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.
In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started posting on the ""WWW,"" as it was called then. The web was mostly used by students, scientists, and a few curious teens like him. It was invented at CERN in Switzerland to help researchers share their work. But Hall saw it as a chance to share his life. He created a detailed online autobiography with words, photos, and art. In January 1996, he started a daily blog, and many people were drawn to his bold use of this new medium. Hall's approach was clear: if you crossed his path, you might appear on his site; no topic was off-limits. While it was the work of an exhibitionist, there was also a beauty to his project that some might call art.
One day, visitors to Hall's site found it replaced with a video titled ""Dark Night."" His story unfolded; he had fallen deeply in love, but when he wrote about it online, he was told, ""either the blog goes, or I do."" Sharing his life online made people not trust him, he argued. The blog ended, but the issue remains. Sharing online is great, but if you expect it to make people like you, you'll be disappointed.
In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a web worker in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job at a software company. One day, a colleague anonymously sent her blog's address to all the company's vice presidents, including those she had mocked, and she lost her job. Experts call this the ""online distribution effect"": the feeling that we can say things online that we wouldn't say in person. But our online and real lives are connected. Ignoring this can lead to serious mistakes.
Armstrong's story ended well. Though upset, she stopped blogging for a while, got married, and restarted her blog, focusing on her family. Now, she's a successful ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing supports her family. Once an example of online mistakes, she has become skilled at sharing wisely. Armstrong learned an important lesson: just because the web lets us say anything, doesn't mean we should."
CPE_23,C2,"**Enough Sleep?**
Many people today feel tired all the time. In busy and wealthy countries, more people are experiencing sleeplessness and anxiety. In the USA, research shows that 40 million Americans have chronic sleep problems. In Britain, some popular novels feature characters who can't sleep or are set in sleep research labs. People are interested in sleep, its patterns, and sleep problems. A main concern is that people need more sleep. A leading sleep researcher says, ""People cut back on sleep when they're busy. They wake up early to avoid traffic.""
A sleep researcher conducted an experiment where he let people sleep up to 14 hours a night for a month. It took them three weeks to settle at about eight-and-a-quarter hours of sleep, showing they needed more sleep than they were getting.
In Europe, a university in the English Midlands has a sleep research lab. They study things like how tiredness affects sailors, how airport noise affects sleep, and the dangers of driving when tired. They find volunteers through student newspapers, pay them £5 an hour, and ask them to change their sleep patterns. Dr. Louise Reyner reassures participants who worry about electrodes on their heads, explaining that the lab is more interested in physical responses.
In a dark room, there is a motorway simulator. Participants come at 2 pm, after a short or no sleep, and are asked to drive while answering questions. The road seems endless, the sun is bright, and the air is warm. Many deny they will fall asleep, but Dr. Reyner has a video of one trying not to. At first, he sits upright, eyes fixed on the road. Then he starts blinking more and more, his head nodding. Each nod gets heavier, and the blinks turn into 10-second blackouts. He wakes up suddenly, but by then, the car has veered off the road. Coffee might help; two cups can make someone a safe driver for over half an hour, even with no sleep. Dr. Reyner suggests using tablets, energy drinks, and caffeinated gum, especially for shift workers.
What do we know for sure about sleep? Humans, like other mammals, sleep in a daily cycle. During sleep, they go through four stages, from light to deep sleep. Dreams usually happen in the lightest sleep, and the brain stops the body from moving to prevent injuries. Beyond this, there are theories. Some say sleep repairs the body, restores muscles, or rests the brain's creative part. But these might also happen when awake and relaxed, so no one is sure. Scientists agree that women sleep about half an hour longer than men and that older people need less sleep, but they don't know why.
When asked about the purpose of sleep, some researchers say, ""Sleep is a way to travel through time without getting hurt."" Sleep patterns may have been different in the past. A history professor found that between 1500 and 1850 in Britain, people had different sleep routines. They went to bed at nine or ten, woke up after midnight for an hour, and then had a ""morning sleep."" This time was used for thinking, remembering dreams, or even stealing. The poorest benefited most from this quiet time, free from daily work. By the 17th century, with more artificial light, the rich started sleeping in one long stretch, which is more efficient. The industrial revolution made most people work longer hours in lit buildings, changing sleep patterns for everyone except some rural people.
Outside Europe and America, the old sleep pattern was common until recently. In some non-western cultures, there are no strict bedtimes. People sleep for a few hours, then get up again. Continuous sleep is not the norm. In some tribal societies, noise, fire supervision, and predator watch make uninterrupted sleep impossible. It seems people everywhere need more sleep."

I was wearing very expensive cowboy boots, each costing 800 dollars, standing on the rocks in the Arizona desert. I had the full cowboy outfit, but I knew I wasn't a real cowboy. I looked at the Arizona mountains and realized I didn't belong there. I had flown in from Denver early in the morning, thinking I might look like a cowboy. But when I saw a real cowboy at the Phoenix airport, I knew I didn't fit in. He was wearing a sweaty T-shirt, needed a shave, and was carrying a dirty bag. He looked at my new boots, raised an eyebrow, and walked away.
I used to be a racing driver, and I loved it. But I don't race anymore, and I don't know what to do now. I thought I could be a commentator for racing events, but there are already many former drivers doing that. I also tried to start a business selling classic cars, but it didn't work out because nobody was buying.
Being an ""ex"" anything is hard. People don't want to hear stories about almost being a champion. Even if I had been a champion, people would only listen for a short time. I don't want sympathy because I had a good career and made money. But I miss racing, the thrill of driving fast cars, and the excitement of being famous. Now, I have a lot of free time, and the phone rarely rings.
I looked at the sky and noticed some small birds in a cactus. They seemed to be telling me to leave. I realized I had a lot to learn about life outside of racing."
CPE_1,C2,"**Vancouver**
In the past ten years, hundreds of thousands of people from around the world have moved to Vancouver, in western Canada. In the evenings, residents like to walk down the city streets, and if you join them, you will probably hear a different language every few steps. People come to Vancouver for its mild weather, beautiful location between the ocean and the mountains, clean and safe environment, and educational and job opportunities. Although some people complain about how quickly new buildings have appeared, it's clear that the new residents and growing tourism have helped the city improve. Locals used to call Vancouver 'Terminal City' because it was a gateway to other places. Even though the name is not used as much now, Vancouver is more of a gateway than ever.
**Putting Pen to Paper**
Journalists like me are usually not good at writing letters. Some say this is because we don't like writing something we won't get paid for, but I don't think we are that focused on money. It's more likely that because we always try to make a big impact in our work, we lose the natural flow of a letter. Real creative artists, who don't focus on the impact (even if they rewrite a passage many times), don't have this problem. I think the true test of a real artist is their natural understanding of the effect of their words. When Shakespeare wrote some of his famous lines, he probably didn't think about how the mix of long words made them powerful, but it showed he was a great writer.
**Supermarket Opening**
In the past, the opening of a new supermarket in Britain was a big event. You could expect a soap opera star, a radio DJ, or a minor royal to come and cut the ribbon. Now, new branches open so often that celebrities are no longer needed. Why pay a famous person when anyone can open it for free? Last week, waiting pensioners didn't care who opened the new Superbuy branch, as long as they were at the front. One customer, who knew someone working there, said the first five men would get a bottle of aftershave, and the first five women, a bunch of flowers. This information quickly spread through the crowd, making those at the front feel pleased and the latecomers envious."
CPE_53,C2,"**Citizen Kane**
When the film *Citizen Kane* was finally released in 1941, it faced a lot of controversy. The release was delayed because distributors were worried about the reaction of William Randolph Hearst, who was thought to be the subject of the film. Despite receiving mostly positive reviews, the film was not a commercial hit. It was television that later brought it back to public attention. *Citizen Kane* is perhaps the most influential film, inspiring many to become filmmakers. This is even more impressive because it was Orson Welles's first film. Welles said its success came from not knowing what he could or couldn't do, so he just did what he wanted. He had a great team, including cameraman Gregg Toland, screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, and special-effects expert Linwood Dunn. When Welles and Mankiewicz decided to create a story about a newspaper magnate similar to Hearst, Welles saw it as a perfect opportunity for himself as both director and actor, and he took it with great enthusiasm.
**Dermot and Carmel**
Dermot noticed that Carmel seemed a bit strange that morning. He mentioned twice that he might be late and might stop by the golf club on his way home to chat with someone. Carmel nodded as if she hadn't really heard or understood. ""Will you be all right? What are you going to do today?"" he asked. She smiled and said, ""Funny you should ask that. I was just thinking I had nothing to do all day, so I was going to walk downtown and look at the shops. It feels almost sinful to just idle away the day."" Dermot smiled back. ""You're entitled to enjoy yourself. And as I said, if I'm late, I won't need anything to eat. So don't go to any trouble."" ""No, that's fine,"" she replied.
**Title Race**
Human nature can be quite amusing. A recent study showed that job titles are a major cause of envy and unrest at work. A survey by a top recruitment firm found that 90% of employers and 70% of employees agree that titles create divisions among colleagues. Surprisingly, the survey revealed that 70% of office workers would prefer a more 'motivational' or 'professional' job title over a pay raise. If our desire for impressive titles is so strong that it surpasses even basic greed, we are in a difficult situation. In today's world, no one wants to be seen as subordinate. The titles being discussed focus on skills (like specialist or coordinator) but are really just euphemisms."
CPE_55,C2,"'The Vienna Assignment I was in Vienna to take photographs. That was usually why I was anywhere at that time. Photographs were more than just my job; they were a big part of my life. The way light fell on a surface always sparked my imagination. A single picture could capture the essence of a time, place, city, or person, and this idea was always in my mind. Any day, any second, I might take the perfect photograph. There was always a chance, as long as I had film in my camera. Finish one roll, load another, and keep looking with open eyes. That was my way of life. It had been for a long time. I almost succeeded once when a photo of a smoke plume from a burning oil well became popular worldwide. It was a brief moment of fame, just luck, really. But they say you make your own luck, both good and bad. I went freelance after that, which seemed like a smart move, but life outside photography took some wrong turns. The mid-nineties weren't as successful as I had hoped when my famous image appeared on the cover of Time magazine. That's why I was in Vienna, instead of somewhere more newsworthy. But I was still taking photographs and getting paid for it. It didn't seem bad to me. The assignment came by chance. I had done the London photos for a coffee-table book: Four Cities in Four Seasons - London, Paris, Rome, Vienna. It was a European project that paid me well to capture my home city in spring, summer, autumn, and winter. I added my own style to daffodils in Hyde Park and the heat haze in Piccadilly. I accepted that the best of my work might be ignored. It was just a picture book, not meant to challenge anyone's views or make them see instead of just look. After a cold snap over Christmas and New Year, I handed in my London-in-winter photos and learned that the Austrian photographer, Rudi Schussner, had left the Vienna job for reasons I didn't need to know. Instead of hiring someone new, they offered me the job. The Austrian publishers liked my work, and I was available, unlike the French and Italian photographers. I was happy to go. Things at home weren't great. A week in snowy Vienna didn't need to be a compliment to my skills for me to accept quickly. They put me up at the Europa, in the heart of the old city. I had last been to Vienna for a weekend with my wife: a busy tour of palaces and museums. It was hot, hectic, and not very memorable. I hadn't taken many photos. Alone, in a cold January, it was going to be different. I knew that as soon as I got off the shuttle bus from the airport and saw the pinky-grey light over the snow-covered roofs. I was going to enjoy myself and take great pictures. The first day, I didn't even try. I rode the trams around the Ringstrasse, getting on and off to feel the city's moods. The weather was set, frozen like the grand baroque buildings of the old empire. I hadn't seen what Schussner had done with the other seasons. I didn't want to. This was going to be my Vienna, not his. And it was going to reveal itself to me. I just had to wait. A photograph is a moment. But you have to wait for the moment to come. So I waited and looked until I could see clearly. Then I was ready. The next morning, I was out at dawn. Snow overnight meant Stephansplatz would be pure white and almost empty. I hadn't figured out how to capture the cathedral in one shot. Its spire stretched like a giraffe's neck into the sky, but at ground level, it was massive, sitting heavily in the city center. Probably there was no way to do it. I'd have to settle for something partial. In that weather, at that time, it could still be magical. But then, there's always been something magical about photography. It seemed that way to the nineteenth-century pioneers before the chemistry was understood. Pictures develop and hold by their own magic. You can watch a blank sheet of paper become a photograph in a dark room. Even when you know why it happens, the mystery remains. That stays with you forever. Perhaps that's why what happened at Stephansplatz that morning didn't really surprise me.'"
CPE_50,C2,"**Kinetic Art Rejoice**
Something amazing has happened: London's serious Hayward Gallery has become a place of wonder. This change wasn't due to a big-budget, flashy show, but rather a unique look into a nearly forgotten part of the last 60 years. A new exhibition explores the history of kinetic art, which is art focused on movement, in the twentieth century. It shows that creating artworks that move by themselves or explore movement has been an ongoing, though often unnoticed, theme in some of the most interesting creative work of this century. The exhibition, curated by Guy Brett, who has studied this subject for a long time, includes a wide range of paintings, drawings, documents, and films on kinetic art. These are presented with little text, allowing visitors to enjoy making their own connections and discoveries.
**David Hockney**
Hockney's art attracts many people who might not usually be interested in art. This could be because his work is figurative and easy to understand, or because it offers an escape from everyday life. Some people might be more interested in Hockney's charming personality and witty comments, which make him popular in the media. Some critics think Hockney is just an overrated minor artist. However, one could argue that he seems minor because being popular is not always accepted today, not because his work lacks depth. Hockney himself knows his limits and believes it's irrelevant to dismiss his work because it doesn't fit an abstract idea of greatness. He doesn't claim to be a great artist and knows that only the future can truly judge his importance.
**Window-shopping - an art exhibition**
In recent years, I've seen many contemporary art exhibitions, some brilliant and some mediocre. What bothers me are shows that push a hidden agenda, suggesting a common attitude among certain artists. Sometimes this works, revealing new trends in seemingly unrelated work. But often, it feels like a forced concept. As a curator, I wanted to create a show that was the opposite of this. With seven artists, I took over a space in an empty warehouse. 'Window-shopping' was meant to be a collection of individual artworks connected only by the fact that they claimed to be art. Sam Cole's knitted cats chased each other on a toy train track, while Matthew Crawley's video camera experiment flickered and disappeared on a monitor. These works didn't fit into a themed exhibition, but why not? They didn't interfere with each other and, through their contrast, added something to each other. I haven't made any big statements about contemporary art, but maybe there aren't any to make about an activity where artists set their own rules.
**Art History**
People who enjoy paintings sometimes hesitate to analyze them, fearing it might spoil their experience. Some say that art historians, who focus on theory, ignore the pleasure of looking and the act of creativity. This idea is like thinking that knowing a recipe's ingredients and cooking method takes away from the taste of a dish. Enjoying something doesn't mean we can't also understand it deeply. In fact, knowing more about what we are viewing might increase our pleasure. Moreover, pleasure is complex. How we experience it can be questioned and is influenced by history. Our preferences are shaped not just by our genes or personalities but by societal values. While no one wants to downplay the importance of instinctive responses to art, the idea that intellectual understanding undermines sensory enjoyment is an outdated belief."
CPE_25,C2,"**Metals**
Stone Age people might have become interested in metals because they wanted to decorate themselves. Imagine sitting by a river, waiting for a fish or just relaxing, when one of our early ancestors found a shiny yellow pebble and picked it up. It didn't feel like a stone, but it was attractive. This is how gold might have become part of their lives. Gold is easy to shape, so it quickly became a popular material. Copper might have been discovered by accident too. Once people realized how useful copper tools were, they eagerly searched for copper ores and ways to extract the metal. This is how metalworking became one of the skills that improved their lives.
**St Ives**
We were silent as we carried our bags down the winding, cobbled lane leading to the town center, struggling against the strong wind and trying to avoid the icy waves crashing over the promenade. The streets were empty, and the shutters on every waterfront cottage were tightly closed against the storm. We had watched the weather get worse as we arrived in St Ives on the small single-track railway. As the dark grey skies closed in, visiting Cornwall in the off-season without a car no longer seemed like a good idea. I had convinced my friend to join me with promises of walks along the beautiful Cornish coast and cozy evenings by open fires.
**Computer Modelling**
The challenge with studying the past is that it is gone. The people who lived through peaceful times and hard times are long dead. The reasons they settled in certain places or moved elsewhere, and how they formed families, villages, and cities, are forgotten. Archaeology gives us some clues, but we can't test our ideas with experiments on past cultures. We can't watch a replay of history. However, maybe we can. Computer modelling lets us recreate ancient landscapes and environments and fill them with virtual communities. These digital creations have some of the needs and abilities of real humans. We can set rules for behavior and create social groups. Then we can change conditions, like reducing rainfall or increasing population, and see how this digital society reacts."
CPE_34,C2,"**Vervet Monkeys**
Cheney and Seyfarth describe a day when the dominant male vervet monkey in their study group noticed a strange male nearby. This stranger wanted to join the group, which could mean the dominant male might lose his position. To prevent this, the dominant male used a clever trick. Whenever the stranger tried to approach, he gave an alarm call that vervets use to warn of a leopard. This scared the stranger back into the trees. This tactic worked until the dominant male made a mistake: he gave the alarm call while casually walking across open ground himself.
**What Cats Catch**
In a survey in the English village of Felmersham, residents collected prey caught by their cats. Over a year, seventy cats caught over 1,000 prey items. An American professor estimated that, based on these figures, cats in Britain might be killing 100 million birds and small mammals each year. However, this calculation is not accurate because most cats live in towns and catch less prey than rural cats. The important question is whether these numbers are sustainable. The answer seems to be yes, as many people feed birds in winter, and gardens provide nesting sites, keeping bird populations above natural levels. The survey showed that cats are significant predators but not devastating to Britain's bird population.
**Buffalo's Day**
Buffaloes are very important to marsh people and are well cared for. Each morning, the buffaloes, who sleep near their owners, slowly move to the reed beds beyond the open water. They stand on the edge, groaning about the day's work, until the leader finally steps into the water. Once in the water, they seem to forget their purpose and wallow for a while. Eventually, they swim away, appearing almost submerged, with only their noses above water. They spend the day among the reeds, grazing on green shoots at eye level.
**PICASSO, Pablo - The Soles, 1940**
In early 1940, while staying in the fishing port of Royan, Picasso painted several fish still lifes. One painting shows a fishmonger's slab with a crab and a pair of scales holding two or three soles. Despite their situation, the sea creatures appear alive. The painting is complex, with overlapping and interlocking transparent planes. The thin, delicately brushed paint and cool colors create a calm, underwater world. However, this calm is disturbed by an impending battle between the fish and the crab. The sharp forms of the fish and crab, along with the scales, suggest a sense of menace and hidden violence, giving the painting a symbolic edge."
CPE_12,C2,"Photography
Over the last 150 years, photography has been used to capture all parts of human life and activity. In this short history, photography has grown in its ability to capture time and space, allowing us to see brief moments and visualize both large and small things. It has shown us images from faraway places on Earth, distant parts of the solar system, and the social issues of modern life. Photography has become one of the most important ways to express the human experience.
However, using images to record events has a much longer history. The earliest examples of pictorial recording date back to the Upper Palaeolithic period, about 35,000 years ago. We are not sure why early cave paintings were made—whether they recorded real hunting events, served as magic to increase animals for hunting, acted as religious symbols, or simply decorated living spaces. But images seem to be deeply connected to human culture.
Throughout history, people have questioned how accurate visual images are and their role in society. The idea that ""seeing is believing"" has always given special importance to images. When photography was invented in the mid-19th century, it promised to provide a truthful visual record automatically. The camera, working like the human eye, was seen as a machine that could capture a fixed image, very close to what we actually see. This chemical fixing of the image was considered a natural phenomenon.
Because of the camera's perceived realism, it was thought that everyone could understand photographs, leading to the idea of photography as a ""universal language."" For example, in 1933, photographer August Sander said that even the most isolated people could understand a photograph of the sky. However, with the rise of global communications in the late 20th century, we need to ask if photography can truly cross cultural differences. Is photography as tied to cultural norms as language is?
Photography is often seen as providing clear evidence, making it seem transparent and blurring the line between our perception of the world and its photographic representations. It is common for someone to show a photograph and say, ""this is my grandson."" Since its invention in 1839, photography and attitudes towards it have changed greatly. Photography has moved from being a simple record-keeper to becoming historical documents that reveal much about the people and society that created them.
I aim to show that the camera is not just a silent recorder of events and that photography does not just reflect culture. It can also inspire social and political change. For example, the cultural changes of the Italian Renaissance were influenced by new visual representation methods. Similarly, photography has played a major role in creating the media culture of today, while also showing the harsh realities of the world."
CPE_26,C2,"**How to Write Poetry**
Teaching someone how to write poetry is like walking through a minefield: you need to be spontaneous, but one wrong move and your certainties can explode. Claiming to know everything is risky, so I suggest that for beginners, no advice can replace reading a lot, writing often, and freeing your imagination and spirit in a productive way, without causing chaos. Some people need a stable life to write a poem; others can write even when they are unhappy. Some follow a schedule; others wait for inspiration. All methods are valid, as long as they are not just copying a set formula. The key is to find your own voice, listen to it, nurture it, and let it grow until it can stand on its own.
**The Short Story**
In a short story, there is no space for too many characters, long narratives, or lengthy flashbacks. Flashbacks should be brief and only used if necessary to clarify an issue. A good way to do this is through a quick memory in the main character's mind, which can help move the story forward. Dialogue is more useful than many new writers realize. Two characters talking can show two sides of a question faster than explaining it from one person's view. It also keeps the story concise and interesting. Overwriting can ruin a short story, but brevity should not make it feel like a summary. Conflict and action must be strong, and every word should matter in a small space.
**Screenplays**
If you know how to play chess, you can understand how to write a screenplay. Most chess players make moves without knowing what will happen next. We might see one or two moves ahead, which feels like an achievement. As we learn more, we realize chess is about long-term strategy, not just short-term tactics. We start to see the whole game, not just individual moves, and patterns emerge, like openings and end games. In chess and screenplay writing, the more you practice, the more you understand its complexities.
**Looking at Writing**
Charles Darwin noted that humans naturally speak, as seen in children's babbling, but no child naturally writes. Language exists in all societies, past and present. Languages change but do not become better: English is not more complex than ancient languages. All healthy children learn their language without formal lessons. When children lack a common language, they create one. Writing, however, has been invented only a few times in history, in complex societies, and has slowly improved over time. Until recently, most children did not learn to read or write; even today, many struggle. A group of children is unlikely to invent an alphabet. Children are naturally inclined to speak, but reading and writing are skills that must be taught. We need to understand how writing works, how children's minds work, and how to connect the two."
CPE_8,C2,"I have never started a novel with more doubt. I call it a novel only because I don't know what else to call it. I have little story to tell and I don't end with a death or a marriage. Instead, I leave my reader uncertain. This book is about my memories of a man I met only occasionally, and I know little about what happened to him in between. I could invent details to fill the gaps and make my story more complete, but I don't want to do that. I only want to share what I know. To protect the privacy of people still alive, I have given them made-up names and taken care to ensure no one can recognize them. The man I am writing about is not famous. He might never be. When his life ends, he might leave no more trace than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the water's surface. Then my book, if read at all, will be read only for its own interest. But maybe his chosen way of life and his unique character will influence others, so that, long after his death, people might realize he was a remarkable person. Then it will be clear who I am writing about, and those who want to know about his early life might find something useful in my book. I think my book, despite its limits, will be a helpful source for my friend's biographers. I don't claim that the conversations I recorded are exact. I never took notes, but I have a good memory for what matters to me, and though I have put these conversations in my own words, they truly represent what was said. I mentioned earlier that I have invented nothing, but I have taken the freedom that historians take to put words into the mouths of people in my story that I did not hear myself. I did this to make the scenes more lively and realistic. I want to be read, and I think I am right to make my book engaging. The smart reader will easily see where I have used this technique, and he is free to ignore it. Another reason I started this work with worry is that the people I write about are from another culture. It is very hard to know people, and I don't think you can really know anyone but your own countrymen. People are not only themselves; they are also the place they were born, the home they grew up in, the games they played, the food they ate, the schools they went to, the sports they played, and the poets they read. These things make them who they are, and you can't know them just by hearing about them; you can only know them if you have lived them. You can only know if you are them. And because you can't truly know people from another country except by observing them, it is hard to make them believable in a book. I have never tried to write about anyone but my own countrymen, and if I have done so in short stories, it is because you can describe characters more briefly in them. You give the reader broad hints and let him fill in the details. In this book, I don't claim that my characters are as they see themselves; they are seen, like my main character, through my own eyes."
CPE_4,C2,"**POETRY RECITALS**
Throughout history, the world of literature often seems confusing to those experiencing it. It is only later that we can see clear patterns and recognize important figures. Today, poetry is especially complex, with many different styles and opinions about how poetry should be presented, criticized, and taught. There is a general debate between two groups: 'literary' poets, who write poems to be read on the page, and 'popular' poets, who prefer performing their poems to an audience. This division is not strict, and public poetry readings have become more common over the past twenty years. These events happen in various places, like small town halls, schools, colleges, and arts festivals.
For 'pop' poets, who write their work to be performed, public readings are beneficial. Their poems are often simple and easy to understand in one hearing, but may seem less impressive when read on the page. On the other hand, poets who focus on crafting their work with deep thought and complex rhythms might not be fully appreciated by an audience hearing their poems for the first time. The risk is that these poets might choose to read only their simpler works to connect quickly with the audience, which might not represent their best work.
Listening to poetry readings cannot replace reading poetry on the page, but it can be a fun and educational experience. Hearing poets read their work can help listeners understand the emphasis and rhythm intended by the poet. It is helpful if the audience can follow along with the text or is already familiar with the poems. The main reason for popular poetry recitals, sometimes mixed with music, is to make poetry enjoyable and accessible to everyone, not just a select few."
CPE_30,C2,"**Oral History**
Historians are increasingly using oral evidence, but this method has challenges. It's unrealistic to think that someone's story is a perfect reflection of the past. During an interview, both the historian and the person being interviewed influence each other. The historian chooses who to interview and what topics to cover. Even if the historian just listens, their presence can change how the person remembers and talks about the past. The final account is shaped by the historian's social position and their way of understanding history, which can affect the informant. Historians must acknowledge their role in creating new evidence. However, the challenges don't end when the historian leaves. The informant's memories might be influenced by other sources, like the media, or by nostalgia and later life experiences. Emotions and attitudes can make a story convincing, but they might not be from the time being discussed.
**Animal Science**
There are two main ways to study animal science: focusing on physiology or on the whole animal. Physiologists study how the body works, like how nerves and muscles create behavior. Those who study the whole animal look at the behavior of the entire animal and what affects it. Within this approach, psychologists and ethologists are different. Psychologists usually work in labs with animals like rats and pigeons to study learning. Ethologists study natural behaviors in animals, often in the wild. Although these fields are merging, physiologists often claim their methods are more basic. However, understanding nerve cells alone isn't enough; we also need to study behavior as a whole. Describing a bird's nest-building by nerve cells is like trying to read a book with a microscope.
**The Social Sciences**
New social science students face a challenge: they must learn both the content and the methods of their subject. They need to understand the knowledge in textbooks and how this knowledge is gathered and organized. These two parts are closely linked. Since we all experience social life, social sciences might seem like common sense. But textbooks show that each social science goes beyond common sense. Each focuses on a specific part of social life, uses specific methods, and has its own concepts. These concepts form the 'logical basis' of the subject, helping social scientists go beyond everyday understanding and distinguishing each discipline.
**Classical Architecture**
In Ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was more than just building structures. The Roman architect Vitruvius said architecture involves order, arrangement, proportion, symmetry, propriety, and distribution. He used Greek terms for some of these, likely from an earlier Greek source. Utility and function aren't part of his definition, though he later discusses the best designs for different purposes. Initially, the focus is on aesthetics, viewing architecture as an art. Classical architecture has complex origins. There was a long history of simple constructions in Greece and Italy that didn't meet Vitruvius' artistic standards. These basic forms contributed to later sophisticated designs. Despite its elaborate appearance, a classical temple is essentially a simple, single-roomed structure."
CPE_7,C2,"The two sisters kept Lily's driving a secret from Chen for a while. Lily would drive around the allotments, the railway line, and the gasworks, even jumping a small bridge with all four wheels off the ground, which was her only mistake. She would finish her drive near the gasworks, surrounded by the smell of sulphur. Surprisingly, Chen found out and was amused by his wife's secret driving. ""So you can really drive, Lily? Well done!"" he said. Mui thought men were strange; Chen should have been upset, but instead, he was excited and started planning a trip with Lily. They decided on a Monday at the start of next month, the quietest day of the week, to leave early and return by midday, so they wouldn't lose any customers. Meanwhile, Lily would practice driving around the allotments. Mui, despite her doubts, bought a road map and got a ten percent discount, which impressed Chen. Lily, however, felt a bit insulted by Mui's lack of trust in her navigation skills.
Within an hour of leaving home, they were looking at the English Channel. Lily drove perfectly. Even Mui, sitting in the back ready to give directions, had to admit this. On the road, Lily overtook a few slow vehicles with great skill, and Mui kept quiet about her concerns. Chen even applauded. After passing through the gasworks of a seaside town, they drove along the empty promenade. Lily parked in a small street with many empty parking spaces. She wasn't sure about the road markings and preferred to pay a fee rather than risk being towed or fined. Maybe this caution would reassure Mui. On the way, Lily noticed her sister's tense face in the mirror, which she used often. It might be best not to mention worries that Mui hadn't thought of. Lily locked all the van doors and checked each one. ""Don't worry,"" Chen joked. ""No one will want that old van."" The sisters were annoyed. Lily accused Chen of being ungrateful, and Mui scolded him for being too easily fooled by appearances. Surprised, Chen took Man Kee ahead to look at the sea. He sat his son on the railing and held him. Man Kee was a warm, responsive child. He put his small hand on his father's sleeve. In that moment, Chen decided to raise his son his way. Man Kee would learn about business and own many restaurants. The sight of the sea made Chen feel thoughtful as he planned his son's future. He saw a ship on the horizon and used a telescope to look at it. At first, he couldn't find it, but then he saw it: a small, rusty tramp steamer. He lifted Man Kee to the eyepiece. ""Do you see the ship, Son?"" he asked. ""It's a special ship for us. It's small and old, but we know it's the ship that will take us home when we're done here. It will take you to your homeland, which you've never seen."" Chen kissed Man Kee's head. Lily and Mui joined them. Lily put her arm around Chen. ""The little old ship,"" Chen said. ""Let your mother see, Son."" Man Kee didn't want to let go of the telescope, and when he finally did, the view was gone. By the time Chen found another coin, the ship had disappeared over the horizon, and Lily only saw seagulls in the ship's wake."
CPE_43,C2,"**THE WELL**
I had read somewhere that if you looked up from a deep hole, you could see the stars during the day. I convinced you to help me test this idea. You watched as I pulled up the well bucket, steadied it on the wall, and climbed in. I asked you to lower me down. I didn't think about how much heavier the bucket would be with me in it, or that you might not be strong enough to hold it. You tried to hold the handle as I pushed the bucket off the well's edge, but I fell immediately. You screamed and tried to stop the handle, but then you let go. I fell into the well and hit my head. At that moment, I didn't realize I had sort of succeeded in my plan. I saw strange lights, like the stars and planets you see in cartoons when a character gets hit. At first, I was dazed, then scared, then relieved, and finally angry at you for letting me fall and worried about what Mother would say. You called down to ask if I was okay. I was about to shout back when you called again, sounding more panicked, which stopped me. I lay still, watching you through my eyelashes. You ran off to get help. I quickly climbed out of the well and hid in the shadows near the moat bridge. I could hear worried voices from the castle. Mother and Father came out with you and old Arthur. Mother was shouting, and Father told Arthur to use the winch. You looked pale and shocked. I felt a mix of excitement and fear. Then I noticed the trail of water drops I had left from the well to where I was hiding. I was horrified that no one had seen them. Father was shining a flashlight into the well. The drops shone in the sunlight. I couldn't believe no one noticed them. Mother was screaming, a sound I had never heard before. It shook me deeply. What should I do? I had gotten back at you, but now things were more serious than I expected. It had gone from a clever idea to a big problem that wouldn't go away without someone, probably me, getting in trouble. I regretted not thinking it through. From a plan to a disaster in minutes. Then I had an idea. I gathered my courage and came out of hiding, pretending to be weak and dizzy. I cried out softly, then louder when no one heard me. I stumbled and fell dramatically on the cobbles. Sitting up, comforted by my crying mother, I pretended to be relieved and said I found a secret tunnel from the well to the moat. I claimed I crawled and swam through it to escape. I think they almost believed me until Father asked me to repeat the story. I hesitated, and his eyes narrowed. Trying to cover up, I said the tunnel collapsed after me, so there was no point in checking it. I said the well was dangerous and I barely escaped. Looking into my father's eyes, it felt like looking into a dark tunnel with no stars. It was like he saw me for the first time, and I saw how my story looked to an adult. My words stopped. ""Don't be ridiculous, boy,"" he said, with more contempt than I thought possible. He walked away. Arthur looked at me, regretful and troubled, shaking his head. Not because I had a scary adventure and wasn't believed, but because he saw through my lie and worried about my character. His pity was as harsh as my father's words, confirming their judgment of my actions. It affected me deeply."
CPE_51,C2,"**REMOVAL DAY**
Susan, a widow, is moving out of her family home now that her children are grown. The moving van had ""Removers of Distinction"" written on it, and Susan noticed that everything special about the house was being packed away. Fred, the removal man, was carefully wrapping fragile items, while his team was less gentle. The house was beautiful, with four floors and a view of a small harbour. Susan remembered the years spent there with her children, Robert and Francesca, who were now adults and helping with the move.
Robert was making sure Susan didn't mention the piano, while Francesca insisted on handling it herself, as she was the only one she trusted with their precious Steinway piano. Fred, the removal man, commented that Susan didn't seem like she was going to cry, which surprised her. Fred explained that many people cry when they see their home being taken apart, but they feel better once they reach the new place.
Susan remembered when they first moved in. The piano was the first thing brought in, but it got stuck on the stairs. Her late husband, Peter, solved the problem by hiring a builder to remove a window and using a crane to lift the piano inside. This process was expensive, and they couldn't afford to tune the piano for months. Peter had said the piano would stay there forever, but now it was time to move.
Susan was worried about the piano getting stuck again, but it was too late to warn the movers. As the piano was carefully carried down the stairs and out the door, Susan, Robert, and Francesca were relieved and started laughing. They laughed so much that they cried tears of joy, not sadness, as they left the house for the last time."
CPE_11,C2,"**Online Literary Criticism for Everyone**
Is do-it-yourself literary criticism just harmless fun? From the beginning, the idea of open access to the Internet was a key principle. In theory, anyone could publish or share content online. In practice, some technical skills were needed, especially in the early days. However, one area that truly opened up to everyone was literary criticism. By visiting Amazon.com, the first popular online bookstore, anyone could write book reviews. Amazon's approach allowed anyone to share their opinion on a book and rate it up to five stars. This seemed like a great idea because it provided free reviews for Amazon and gave potential buyers insights from other readers, not just publishers or professional critics. Other online bookstores also offered similar features, but Amazon, with over 80% of the online market, attracted the most reviews and, therefore, the most issues.
This open review system led to some problems. Thousands of reviews were submitted daily, making it impossible to check them all. Amazon had a team of editors to ensure reviews followed guidelines. Reviews with just one word, personal attacks, obscenities, spoilers, or references to other reviews were not allowed. However, reviewers were anonymous, and inappropriate reviews were only removed if noticed by Amazon's team. This allowed for some mischief. For example, authors could give their own books positive reviews. Lev Grossman, an author, was upset by negative reviews of his first novel and wrote several positive ones himself. His trick worked until he revealed it in an article, and the fake reviews were removed.
Authors could also comment on their books through a special link. Most authors used this to encourage readers to buy and enjoy their books. Some even shared their email addresses for direct communication. However, Amazon did not verify if the comments truly came from the authors, except for famous ones. A lesser-known writer once pretended to be John Updike, calling himself 'talented but over-hyped,' but this was quickly removed as a fake.
The real drama came from reader reviews. When James McElroy's book ""We've Got Spirit"" was published, it was praised by the mainstream press. However, people mentioned in the book felt betrayed and used Amazon's page to express their anger. Many critical reviews appeared but disappeared after a few days. Despite such incidents, Amazon saw the high number of reviews as good for business. Reviews were meant to be a 'forum to talk about a book,' not a chat room, so bestselling books were closely monitored to ensure reviews followed the rules. This meant that silly reviews were more likely to be found on less popular books. For example, ""The Story about Ping,"" a children's book about a duck, inspired humorous reviews because 'ping' is also a term used in Internet technology. One review humorously compared the book's plot to Internet architecture.
Despite some silliness, most reviews on Amazon were serious. They provided a surprisingly accurate indication of whether a book was worth buying. The writer George Orwell once said that reviewing too many books meant inventing reactions to books one didn't care about. This makes the democratization of the review process seem like a positive development."
CPE_14,C2,"**Art in Modern Times**
In the last two hundred years, people have started to think that every artist must rebel against the art of their time. Art is often praised for being unique, revolutionary, or even shocking. We admire artists whose work was not appreciated a hundred years ago. However, when it comes to contemporary art, we often hesitate and say that an artist has gone too far, claiming that what they do is no longer art. The media often express these thoughts for us, and we tend to agree because we expect art to be puzzling and new. This expectation is so strong that we overlook the old themes, methods, and virtues present in modern art. We want artists to be different from the rest of us, with special talents and energy that cannot be contained by conventions. In the past, people would commission art for specific purposes, making it a part of everyday life. Today, we leave artists to their own devices and get annoyed if they try to be more relatable.
**Picture This**
I will describe a situation and then ask an important question about it. I hope it doesn't seem too mysterious. But if it does, that's modern art for you. Here's the situation: An artist chooses a piece of text from an art book. The text talks about the variety of pictures, asking, ""What are they all about?"" and then concludes, ""There is no end to the number of different kinds of pictures."" This might sound childish, but stay with me. The situation gets more complex. The artist asks someone to make a canvas, stretch it, and prime it. Then, he takes it to a sign painter and asks them to write the chosen text on the canvas. He instructs the sign painter not to make the lettering flashy or charming. The sign painter follows these instructions. On a white canvas, in simple black letters, he writes the text. So, my important question is: Is the finished product a painting?
**Underground Encounters**
At the Mercury Gallery, London until 26th June
It is often believed that for commercial success, a painter should stick to one profitable style. Collectors expect artists to continue in the same direction, and trying something new is often met with disappointment. Gallery owners prefer safe choices, and the art-buying public may feel insecure and need consistency. Some artists break this pattern and succeed, like Picasso and Hockney. Eric Rimmington is another artist trying something new, and it remains to be seen if he will succeed. His new show moves away from the still lifes he is known for to paintings of the London Underground. Railways have always fascinated Rimmington. From his drawings in the 1980s of the railway land at London's Kings Cross Station, it was a natural step to explore the underground world. These sketches have inspired ""Underground Encounters,"" an exhibition of 40 paintings and drawings that capture the unique magic of this underground world designed for people on the move.
**Extract from a Novel**
I have come to this island with a few books. I am not sure why I use the word 'escape.' The villagers jokingly say that only a sick person would choose such a remote place to rebuild. So, I have come here to heal myself, if you want to put it that way. Apart from the old peasant woman who comes from the village on her mule each day to clean the house, I am completely alone. I am neither happy nor unhappy; I feel like I am floating in the cloudy mixtures of memory. I spoke about the uselessness of art but did not mention its comforts. The comfort of the work I do with my mind and heart lies in this: only in the silence of the painter or writer can reality be reorganized, reworked, and shown in its true form. Our everyday actions are like a rough covering that hides the beautiful pattern beneath. For us artists, there is a joyful compromise through art with everything that hurt or defeated us in daily life. This way, we do not avoid destiny, as ordinary people try to do, but fulfill it in its true potential—the imagination. Otherwise, why should we hurt one another?"
CPE_63,C2,"**Family Business**
""Look here, it's no good!"" said my Dad. We were driving back to London. My father, with my brother Maurice, had just picked me up from the fancy girls' school I attended. He had also just sat through Parent's Day, where I received the Latin prize and the prize for doing best in my final exams. He had a long talk with my headteacher, and now we were heading home for the holidays.
""What isn't?"" I asked, though I had guessed what he was thinking from his unusual silence. He was usually a talkative man. ""You can't fool me. You'll do what you want now,"" he said. ""With all those certificates, I was told you will get a scholarship to Oxford.""
""So?"" I said, trying to be bold. ""Mightn't that be useful?""
""I also hear,"" he continued, and I knew a confrontation was coming, ""that you want to be a barrister. A barrister of all things!"" My father knew a lot about barristers and the law.
""I just said that,"" I replied. ""I couldn't think of anything else to say!""
""And apparently,"" he went on, ""you have the right personality - you can quickly understand a lot of information, you can talk well, and you enjoy performing.""
""I don't know about that,"" I said. ""All I know is what I see in TV dramas.""
""Be that as it may,"" he continued, ""I feel your heart's never going to be in the business now. Obviously, you'll go to Oxford University, and after that, I can't see you wanting it.""
The problem was that, like many children of family businesses, I felt trapped by family expectations. I could see different careers open to me, and I wanted to explore them. At the same time, I didn't want to upset my father. I wasn't as scared of him as Maurice was - I was the favorite - but I found him intimidating.
""It's too soon to know,"" I said weakly.
""I tell you you're not going to want to join us,"" said my father, who was often right about such things, ""and it's a pity because you've got the gifts - the brains, the nerves, the vision.""
""There's still Maurice,"" I said, sulking. My father snorted. We both knew Maurice hated the business.
""Anyway,"" I continued, ""you could always use me as a sort of consultant.""
My mother wasn't around to help - she had died early in my childhood, and my father had raised me and Maurice. Maurice was two years younger than me, and because he was motherless, I got into the habit of taking care of him. It wasn't a hardship. I loved Maurice. Because the business was successful, we lived in luxury - a big house in London, posh schools, nice clothes, parties, theatres, operas. My father knew all kinds of people - politicians, actors, businessmen - and our house was full of interesting conversations.
""I tell you what,"" my father continued. ""You can help us out during holidays until you leave Oxford, and then if you decide to leave us, you can. It will give you some pocket money and be a real help to me.""
""OK,"" I said, relieved to avoid immediate decisions and especially the depression and sulks my father would fall into if I opposed him. This was how he controlled us.
So it happened. In my last term at school, and then during university vacations, I helped out, never more than twice a year, and always on the safer tasks. I became one of the smarter students, with a little house of my own, a small but powerful white car, designer clothes, and a black dress with a Paris label that I planned to wear for my final exams.
In my last term, my father came to see me and took me to a village for a meal and a chat. There were only a few weeks to go. My tutor predicted I would get a First Class degree (in Law), and I knew that if I stayed focused, he might be right. I felt confident and concentrated.
This was not to be. My father told me that, in about a week, he needed me to do one last task for him, that it was the most important business the family firm had ever attempted, and that he would make it worth my while.
""But Dad,"" I protested, ""I've got my final exams coming up, and I just need to concentrate on that. It's really important that I do well, and I don't want to think about anything else right now.""
I could tell that such pressures were beyond my father's imagination (or was he somehow jealous of my life away from him?) and that he would see a refusal from me as a betrayal in his time of need.
That was not all. As he described the task, I saw more clearly than ever before the determination of my father - the clarity and resourcefulness with which he approached his work, the energy, the perfect self-control. In his way, he was a sort of genius, and I respected that in him. It made my own plans and hopes seem less important.
""All right,"" I said. ""I'll do it."""
CPE_56,C2,"Simon Costello realized that buying the house in Pembroke Square was a mistake within a year of moving in with his wife, Lois. They could only afford it by being very careful with money, which made it a bad decision. At first, it seemed like a good idea because Simon had many successful cases, and Lois had returned to her job at the advertising agency shortly after their twins were born. She even got a raise, bringing her salary to thirty-five thousand. Lois was the one who pushed for the move, arguing that their flat wasn't suitable for a family, and they needed more space, a garden, and a place for an au pair. These needs could have been met in a less expensive area, but Lois wanted more than just space. She felt that their old address, Mornington Mansions, wasn't suitable for a rising barrister and a successful businesswoman. 
To save money, Lois decided that one of them should use public transport. Since her job was on the other side of London, Simon had to be the one to do it. The crowded tube ride made him resentful, and he often thought about his grandfather's house in Hampstead, where he had stayed as a boy. His grandmother believed in giving the tired breadwinner peace and comfort after a long day. But times had changed. Lois made it clear before they married that her career was as important as his. Their lifestyle depended on both of their salaries.
Now, their situation was threatened by Venetia, who had come to their office in a bad mood. She accused Simon of knowing that a client, Brian Cartwright, had bribed jurors in a case four years ago and that Cartwright had given shares to Simon's fiancée before the trial. Simon denied it, but his denial sounded unconvincing even to himself. He felt guilty and remembered the fear of punishment from his school days. Venetia didn't believe him, and he wondered why she was so angry. He questioned her right to judge him and worried that if the rumor spread, his career would be ruined."
CPE_36,C2,"I chose this place to live, thinking I would be anonymous among people who didn't mind if the rented houses were falling apart or if the gardens were overgrown. But I was wrong. People in the shops soon start to recognize you. The roses next door remind me that the gardens were once loved. Usually, I stay inside trying to forget that it's summer, but tonight, I'm watching the birds fly between the treetops and roofs. I cleared some space in the garden for a chair, and my arms are scratched from the plants. It's a small London garden where plants must grow tall to survive. 
My upstairs neighbor, Jaz, leans out of the window. She's written several unpublished books, and as an English teacher, I sometimes have to pretend to like them. I have her latest one now. 'How's the work going, Jaz?' I ask. 'In no other job do you have to explain yourself so often,' she replies. Then she offers to bring a drink down. I don't want Jaz in the garden, and I realize it looks messy. The only way to the garden is through my flat, and Jaz is knocking on my door. 'You're on holiday now,' she says, sitting in the chair. 'I should've been a teacher - writers don't get holidays. They say those who can, do, and those who can't, teach.' And some can't do either. 'What plans for the holidays?' she asks. 
I feel anxious about the school year ending. Empty days. Hot pavements. The walk to the shops. The park with its fountain, and loneliness beside me on the bench. 'Actually, I'm going to Stonebridge tomorrow. Can you feed the cats?' I ask, my heart racing. 'Of course,' Jaz says, knowing she would be around. 'Where will you stay? A nice B and B?' 'No, I'll stay with my oldest friend, Ruby, at the Rising Sun. We've known each other since we were eight.' It's not true, but I often deal with fiction. 'Going back to your roots. So what do you think of my book?' Jaz asks about her manuscript, The Cruelty of Red Vans, which is half-read on my desk. I like the title and tell her so. I decide to be honest. 'Let me give you a tip,' I say. 'What?' she asks, offended. 'Try writing about nice people for a change, people who try to be good.' 'Teachers!' Jaz responds like a rebellious student. 'I keep a journal where I write something good about each day,' I say. 'Keep a journal! Nice people! Get a life, Ann.' 
Oh, I've got a life. I have my work, and I go out sometimes, reading on the tube. When we go inside, my calm kitchen reassures me. Then I remember my school geography teacher, Miss Tarrantine, who was about my age now, winking as she said, 'I've had my moments.' We nearly died laughing."
CPE_6,C2,"**Heritage**
Heritage is important because it connects people and communities to the past. We often feel connected to our personal heritage, knowing about our grandparents and their lives. Beyond personal stories, there is a need to learn about our past to understand our future, both individually and nationally. Heritage gives us a sense of continuity, helping us find our place in history. Just like inheriting genes, we inherit culture passed down through generations. Even if there are parts of our national heritage we don't like, it is still ours, and it feels good to belong to something. Heritage teaches us a lot and is essential for our well-being, influencing everything from customs to material culture. In the past, we connected with our heritage through stories from our ancestors. However, Western industrial society disrupted communities, causing much of this oral tradition to be lost. Now, places and buildings help us learn about our past. It is crucial to preserve these links to honor our ancestors' identity.
**The Fens**
I started writing a novel called ""Waterland,"" where the landscape of the Fens in England became important. People often ask why I, a Londoner with no personal connection to the Fens, chose to write about it. The simple answer is that I picked the Fens because they seemed plain and empty, a perfect setting for my story. However, I learned that the Fens are neither flat nor empty. They are as English as any other part of England but also strangely unique. It's surprising that in the middle of England, there is a region that feels foreign to many English people, even though other unique areas of Britain have become part of the nation's cultural heritage. The Fens are both empty and full, cultivated yet wild, open yet mysterious. My research for the novel wasn't extensive; I haven't visited places like Wisbech or Prickwillow. As a fiction writer, I prefer imagining worlds rather than seeking documentary proof. Imagining the Fens has its own logic because, as Edward Storey's book shows, the Fens are not just a landscape but a state of mind.
**Museums**
Museums need to make their collections accessible. In the past, this meant putting items in display cases with long labels that were hard to understand. Today, accessibility means more. Displays should be lively and interesting, using techniques to capture visitors' attention and emotions. Museums should also reach out to the community. For example, they can provide loan boxes of objects for teachers or use similar materials to help elderly people with memory loss. Museums focus on real artefacts and specimens, not replicas. They offer encounters with authentic items that existed and had meaning in history. This is their strength and what sets them apart from heritage centers, theme parks, books, and digital media. Museums that embrace this challenge and offer exciting displays, catalogues, and outreach programs will find that virtual history can actually help them by increasing interest in the real items that only museums can provide.
**Architecture and Environment**
The desire to preserve things is not new, but changes in our towns happen quickly and affect us all. This makes some people want to preserve everything, while others think more about the nature and future of towns. It can be argued that people who have lived through events like world wars are more inclined to preserve things because stability becomes important. If there is a psychological need for preservation, planners should consider it. Change is not bad if we learn to manage it. Physical changes in our towns reflect social changes, like changes in population, welfare, and demands."
CPE_33,C2,"**Einstein**
If you ask someone on the street to name a scientist, they will probably say Albert Einstein. His face is often used in ads for smart products, like computers and encyclopedias. Most people don't know much about what Einstein did, except that he created theories called 'relativity'. These theories are famous for being hard to understand and for making strange predictions that seem to go against everyday experiences. Einstein was part of a big change in scientific thinking, which started modern science in the 20th century. Scientists were trying to describe the universe better by studying how matter and natural forces interact. Einstein made important contributions by rethinking the basics: time, space, matter, and energy. Before him, scientists followed Isaac Newton's idea that stars and planets moved in a fixed space and time. Einstein changed this idea, saying that time and space are not fixed but relative.
**Young Readers**
When we were children, Lydia and I didn't trust books that won prizes because we thought they would be 'worthy', which to us meant 'boring'. Our mother didn't like our attitude and often hinted at her disapproval, but our father would happily give us small amounts of money to encourage us to read these books. He would also sneak in a few good books among our Christmas and birthday gifts, marking them with 'This Book is NOT Literature'. Although we ignored most of his choices as 'boys' books', he did manage to introduce us to some good short stories and, once, a famous collection of poems.
**Language**
In 1851, Jacob Grimm wrote that 'The origin of human language is truly secret and marvellous'. This mystery has led to many strange ideas. In 1928, Charles Caller claimed that early humans might have made sounds like ""meuh"" when they sensed danger. ""Meuh"" sounds sad. Humans in dangerous lands with scary animals made desperate noises, and languages have kept some of these sounds, like malaria meaning ""fever"" or the Latin mors meaning ""death"". Because of such odd ideas, many people avoided the topic, thinking it was for eccentrics. But recently, the origin and evolution of language have become important research areas. Language likely developed in East Africa about 100,000 years ago. It was mainly used for friendly communication and was important in power struggles. Sharing information was probably not its original purpose, contrary to philosopher John Locke's idea of language as a 'great conduit' for sharing knowledge."
CPE_20,C2,"'Writing Reviews Frank Kermode explores the art of writing reviews from a writer's perspective. Most reviews are created and shared under conditions that make them have a very short lifespan. There are deadlines and strict limits on their length. Once published, they last only as long as the newspaper or magazine they appear in—maybe a day, a week, or at most a month. The temporary nature of reviews often defines their literary value. Many people, including the writers themselves, often think that reviewing is a job done out of necessity, like needing extra money, or because they can't spend all day working on a novel or a serious book. However, reviewing is a skilled and complex task. It's one thing to be concise and fair in a short newspaper review, and quite another to manage a longer piece in an international journal without losing focus. The fifteen hundred words of a leading article in weekly magazines present challenges of both short and long reviews. Length isn't the only factor. Reviewers must consider their audience, from casual weekend readers to those deeply interested in the subject. A reviewer needs to know a lot about many topics and must write in a way that intelligent readers can understand and enjoy. This often means that reviewers also write other things besides reviews. The American novelist John Updike, who isn't very fond of criticism—calling it 'hugging the shore'—still enjoys writing reviews between his major novels. He collects all his reviews, even the short ones, into books with modest titles. Some might think that less famous writers should accept the temporary nature of their reviews, but if they can, they should be allowed to enjoy some permanence and recognition, especially if they believe some of their best writing is in their reviews. I feel this way about my own work. My main job has been academic, and most of my serious books are academic, the kind professors like and are expected to write. However, in the English-speaking world, there isn't a strict separation between reviewing and literary study, so it's common for the same people to do both. The days are gone when academics criticized professors for writing reviews, or for wasting time, or for not respecting their institutions. Complaints from non-professors that professors are taking their jobs are also less common now, partly because there is much more reviewing work available, and partly because the pay is often low. I believe these arrangements benefit both readers, who can trust that the reviewer knows what they're talking about, and professors, as it helps keep them grounded. It also reminds them to communicate clearly with non-professors. When talking among themselves, they might use complex language, but when addressing intelligent non-professors, they need to be clear. Finally, despite its importance, reviewing must be a secondary job. You can only do it well if you are also doing something else well.'"
CPE_40,C2,"Ralph unlocked the door to his apartment and, as he entered the dark, still hallway, he felt a brief moment of doubt about owning it. Even after three years, this feeling sometimes came over him when he returned home alone at the end of the day. When he first bought the flat, he would come home eagerly, often as early as possible, wondering what the flat had been like while he was away. It felt like a welcoming place to him, where he was in control. He thought he should worry about things like intruders or leaks, but the flat always seemed to be waiting for him, either tidy or messy, depending on how he left it. Over time, he started to see it as just another part of himself, a space filled with his thoughts and feelings. He became frustrated that it couldn't change. Sometimes, there would be a small pile of letters by the door or the answering machine would be blinking with messages. He was thankful that the windows hadn't been broken or the flat damaged, but he wondered what it would look like if it were. From his dull office on Holloway Road, Ralph often looked forward to his evenings alone at home. Once he left the office and started his bus ride home, he felt more like himself and didn't need to be alone anymore, though he often forgot this when planning his social life. At his desk, he longed for time alone with his things, but once he got home, he felt empty and waited for a sense of self to return. Instead, he felt a deep emptiness, making him think that doing work he didn't like had changed him, moving him away from who he thought he was. He would read or listen to music at night, but now he questioned why he did these things. His sense of direction was unclear, and his thoughts and feelings seemed lost. There was a time, he thought, when he didn't feel so powerless, when he might have escaped if he had realized his own value. But he had been eager to settle into something and followed the first path that seemed right. After university, he tried to make a plan for his future, but he found he only wanted to survive quietly. He applied for jobs he heard about from friends, following their paths without imagining a job that would make him happy. He went to his only job interview gratefully and didn't think to question the position—a vague editorial role at a free local newspaper. He was relieved to have a pleasant conversation with Neil, his boss, and didn't think about the long meetings he would face daily. Neil offered him the job on the spot, saying Ralph was the only graduate who applied, which Ralph took as a compliment at the time."
CPE_45,C2,"**Goat Racing**
I was about to see goat racing on Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. I pushed through ice-cream vans, crowds of people, food stalls, and loud music. Everyone was moving towards the racecourse, and I tried to find a good spot. A section was set up as a course for the race. It wasn't like big racecourses, but people stood on either side of the track where the goats would run. It was hard to keep the goats in order because they are known to eat almost anything.
**Canoe Trip**
As the day ended, I started to worry about the night. The canoe was too wet to sleep in, and we hadn't seen any villages or huts since morning. In the dim moonlight, we used our torch to see the cliffs, but the batteries were dying. We put in new ones, but they didn't work. We couldn't find a place to camp. A few miles later, Lesley thought she saw a light, and we got hopeful, but it was just moonlight on the waves. Soon, we heard the loud noise of fast water, but we couldn't see what was happening. Time seemed to stop as we continued.
**How to be Presentation Perfect - we answer your questions**
I am not good at making presentations, but as a managing director, I have to present to my colleagues and major shareholders. How can I improve my presentation skills and confidence? You are not alone. Presenting is a different skill from running a company, but many senior executives need to be good at it. To convince your audience, you must believe in what you are saying. Show your belief with passion and enthusiasm. This means you need to prepare well. Test your ideas in advance and ask colleagues to think of tough questions the audience might ask. Start with something everyone agrees on and build towards your conclusion."
CPE_64,C2,"Some activities cannot be rushed; they take the time they need. If you're late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you rush making mayonnaise by adding oil too quickly, it will curdle. If you pull too hard on a tangled fishing line, the knot will get tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some tasks are done very quickly, while others take longer—seconds, minutes, hours, days, or even years. Some mental tasks can be sped up, like solving puzzles or doing math in your head. But others cannot be rushed, or they will fail, like the mayonnaise, or get tangled, like the fishing line. Saying 'Think fast; we need the results' can be as unwise as trying to sleep in half the time. We learn, think, and understand in different ways, and these ways work at different speeds, suitable for different tasks. 'He who hesitates is lost,' says one proverb. 'Look before you leap,' says another. Both are true. Generally, the mind has three processing speeds. The first is faster than thought. Some situations need an immediate reaction. When my motorbike skidded on a wet road in London, my brain and body quickly reacted to keep me safe, and only afterward did my conscious mind catch up. A concert pianist or an Olympic fencer doesn't have time to think about their next move. This fast physical intelligence can be called our 'wits'. Then there is thought itself: the kind of intelligence that involves figuring things out, weighing pros and cons, building arguments, and solving problems. A mechanic fixing an engine, a scientist interpreting results, or a student working on an assignment all use this type of thinking, which relies on reason and logic. We often call this intelligence 'intellect'. Someone good at solving these problems is called 'bright' or 'clever'. But there is another, slower mental process. It is often less clear, more playful, or dreamy. In this mode, we are thinking deeply or being contemplative. Sitting by the sea, lost in the sound of the waves, or just before sleep, we are in a different mental state than when planning a meal or writing a letter. This slow, seemingly aimless way of thinking is just as intelligent as the faster ones. Allowing the mind time to wander is not a luxury to cut back on when life gets busy. On the contrary, slow thinking is an important part of our mental abilities. We need the slow mind as much as the fast one. Some problems are better solved with a slow mind. Some mysteries can only be understood with a relaxed, open mental attitude. Recent studies show that slower, less deliberate thinking is good for understanding complex or unclear situations. Deliberate thinking works well when the problem is clear. When deciding where to go on holiday, the options may be obvious. But when we don't know what to consider or which questions to ask, or when the issue is too subtle for conscious thought, we need the slow mind. If the problem is how to manage a difficult team at work, or whether to change careers, it might be better to sit and think than to search frantically for answers. This type of intelligence is linked to creativity or even 'wisdom'. Poets have long known the limits of conscious thinking and have tried to develop these slower ways of knowing. Philosophers have written about the parts of the mind beyond conscious thought. Only recently have scientists begun to study these slower ways of knowing. The field of 'cognitive science' is showing that the unconscious mind can do many interesting and important tasks if given time. It can learn patterns too subtle for normal consciousness, understand complex situations, and solve difficult issues better than the conscious mind."
CPE_29,C2,"**Surviving in a Foreign Land**
I have been warmly welcomed. It's a friendly and well-equipped base camp in a very isolated place. At any time, there are about forty people - scientists, students, weather experts, satellite trackers - in a close community where everyone helps out. My basic French is just enough to communicate, but not to have casual conversations. I miss the subtle meanings, and my phrasebook is useless at breakfast. This isn't a practical problem for me, but at first, it affected my self-confidence. I found myself slightly dreading mealtimes. I would hesitate, worried about which table to choose, scared of the silence when I spoke, anxious like I haven't been since my first weeks of school. I still smile awkwardly or panic when people talk to me. I think the reason for this occasional sadness isn't about losing company or communication; it's because I've lost the social advantage that my ability to talk has always given me.
**Elliot**
When I first met Elliot, I was just a young author like any other, and he didn't pay much attention to me. He never forgot a face though, and when I saw him here or there, he shook hands with me warmly, but didn't try to get to know me better. If I saw him at the opera, for example, and he was with someone important, he tended not to notice me. But then I had a surprising success as a playwright, and soon I noticed that Elliot was more interested in me. One day, I got a note from him inviting me to lunch, and I thought he was testing me. But after that, since my success brought me many new friends, I started to see him more often.
**Alfred Hitchcock**
The film director Alfred Hitchcock always said he didn't care about the story of his films or the acting, but he did care about the photography, the soundtrack, and all the technical parts. For Hitchcock, it wasn't a message or a great performance that moved the audience; he believed people are excited by pure film, no matter their cultural background. So, if a film is made correctly, in terms of its emotional impact, the Japanese audience should scream at the same moment as the Indian audience. Hitchcock's view of himself was always clear, logical, and hard to argue with. He was a man of reason and a genius craftsman who liked to hear an audience scream. He didn't deal with speculation, abstract ideas, or intellectual hints, and his view of his own film characters was not deep. He focused on film, pure film, and the most precise, calculated beauty of what a strip of film can do to an audience."
CPE_57,C2,"**Amateur Astronomy**
Astronomy has changed a lot in the last 50 years. About 30 years ago, there were not many charts or catalogues. Telescopes were basic, and there were few books on how to do astronomy. Today, you can buy many types of telescopes and equipment. Electronic calculators and computers have changed how we make charts and analyze observations. This might be the best time for amateur astronomy. However, some things have been lost. Now, you might need to travel 80 km to find a sky as clear as it was in cities 50 years ago. During the day, airplane trails can turn into clouds, making it hard to observe the sun and stars.
**Too Much Choice**
Today, society has too many choices. There are too many things to do and too many options. People always want the newest product or service, and technology makes changes happen faster. New products come out quickly, making it hard to keep up. This can cause stress and make life feel disconnected. More choices mean more stress and less time. People are now looking for 'simplexity'—simple things that bring meaning in a complex world. But simplifying life is hard when there are so many products and services. There are more types of detergent and breakfast cereals than we need, and more software updates and phone plans than we can follow.
**McAndrews Hotel**
Every summer, we spend two weeks at McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. It is a family tradition started by my grandmother, and it is very important to us. Nothing can interrupt this ritual. The guests at McAndrews are similar: old-fashioned and maybe a bit snobbish. I do not like the rude behavior of shop assistants today, which is seen as being equal. I dislike overly friendly waiters who seem like they might slap you on the back. I know most of the other guests' names because they have been coming here since they were children, like me. But I can be sure that when I see them in the hotel, we will only exchange polite greetings. Such respect for privacy is rare in hotels today."
CPE_9,C2,"**Othello**
The move of an outstanding production of Shakespeare's play *Othello* from Stratford to London gives me a chance to correct a harsh review I wrote when the show first opened last spring. At that time, I said Ray Fearon was too young for the main role and criticized his acting. I still believe that changing the age difference between Othello and Desdemona alters the tragedy, but I take back my criticism of Mr. Fearon's excellent performance. In fact, the entire cast is excellent. Unforgettable scenes include Cassio's competitive games with other young officers, which become dangerously intense, and the moment when Iago starts to lose control and struggles to regain it. I dare anyone not to be moved to tears during the scene where Emilia helps Desdemona get ready for bed. The pace and tension throughout the play are amazing. Don't miss this production.
**Lake Vostok**
In the center of Antarctica, nothing moves. On the edges of the continent, there are many penguins, seals, and birds. But on the large white plateau inside, life cannot survive. Except, that is, in a huge hidden area of freshwater called Lake Vostok, which is under nearly 4 kilometers of ice, right below the coldest place on earth. The water has been cut off from air and sunlight for up to 25 million years. Biologists are eager to explore its mysterious depths and find out what strange organisms live there. Geologists and glaciologists are also very interested. For two years, researchers from around the world have been planning how to uncover the lake's secrets, and if they succeed, the next few years will be known as the decade of Lake Vostok.
**Scientists**
There was an interesting discussion on the radio last week. It seems that a group of scientists are getting very excited about what motivates them to be scientists; the phrase ""because it's there"" comes to mind. We all know it's the age-old search for knowledge, the desire to understand everything from atoms to black holes. But these scientists want to know why we want to know all of this in the first place and why science can't explain our curiosity. Surely, it's more important to know whether what we scientists are doing is right, rather than getting stuck in debates about the purpose of it all. I would have thought that the key issue here is not why we pursue it, but to recognize that science is a tool, and we are the ones who should decide how, where, when, and why to use it."
CPE_42,C2,"**Food**
Our connection with food is very basic and fulfilling. Many people who love cooking buy cookbooks like this one. Often, we think that cooking is only worth it for special occasions or complex dishes. But that's not true. You can make a delicious soup by simply putting some chopped carrots, a leek, celery, and a few herbs into water. This is much more satisfying than buying a packet or opening a can. Instead of buying a chocolate mousse with too many preservatives and additives, you can make a delicious dessert in five minutes that both adults and children will enjoy. Cooking is also a way to show care and love by bringing your own creation, no matter how simple, to the table. Sharing food is full of symbolism and meets our deep human needs, which is why all our celebrations, like birthdays, anniversaries, and engagements, happen around tables. No one would have a takeaway for a wedding or anniversary party! And few people would want to discuss a business deal over canned soup.
**In the Elevator**
This morning, Alistair tried to tidy up his office, but papers were still everywhere. Tax forms were overflowing from desk drawers and boxes, waiting for a day when he felt like filing them. He also had extra paperwork from owning an apartment building. Books and journals were near the new bookshelves but not organized. As the elevator took him to his floor, he knew Mallory would be on time for their meeting. She would knock on his office door exactly on the hour. She was very precise about time and neatness. How would she react to the mess? She might think his office had been vandalized. He could pretend to be shocked when he walked in behind her. Mrs. Wilson, his cleaning lady, arrived while he was trying to clear some space on the carpet. He smiled at her hopefully as she unlocked his apartment door. Her eyes showed she had no intention of cleaning his office. She believed he was from somewhere far away, not from her world in Brooklyn.
**Karen**
Karen wanted to be different from her mother, which led her to create her own story of strength. In her story, there were important moments, like when she was twelve and her brother accidentally hit her in the eye with a golf club. At first, she thought she was blind, but the bone protected her, as the doctor later told her. The club missed her eye, and she only needed a few stitches. When she opened her eyes in the doctor's office and saw her mother talking about miracles and small mercies, she felt she was saved for a reason.
**Miss Fogerty**
Miss Fogerty was walking quickly across the wet grass of the village green, feeling both excited and sad about what she had just seen. It's exciting to be the first to know something important, especially in a small community, and Miss Fogerty's life was usually quiet. But she was very sad about Dr. Bailey's condition. He had been her doctor for many years, and she appreciated his care for her yearly laryngitis, which was her only health issue. His best quality, she thought, was making people feel he had plenty of time and truly wanted to hear about their worries. This quality made him very loved by the village. He always gave his time, knowledge, and humor, and in return, he received great loyalty and affection."
CPE_59,C2,"**Joanna's Lessons**
Joanna MacGregor is a busy concert pianist. So why has she decided to write books for young children learning the piano? Even someone who is completely tone deaf would be moved by a Joanna MacGregor performance. Watching her play complex pieces is like seeing a pianist push human limits. But even her amazing skill wasn't enough to impress one small boy at a recent concert for kids. Like the rest of the audience, he heard pieces in every style from her wide range of classical, jazz, ragtime, blues, techno, African, and more. He watched her play inside the piano, a trick that usually amazes kids. Then, when she invited questions, he asked, ""Can you play Match of the Day?"" Many experienced pianists might be stumped by such a request, but for Joanna, it was fun. ""In his eyes, until I played that, I wasn't a proper pianist."" Of course, she played it and probably remembered the experience for her next children's concert.
MacGregor is unusual among top concert pianists because she is interested in how young children learn the piano. She has just published her own beginner piano book for children: *Joanna MacGregor's Piano World*. She managed this despite her very busy schedule. She seems to be at almost every festival this summer. Tomorrow, she will be part of an all-day event with young composers and artists. She also runs her own recording label, Sound Circus. She admits she often wants to start new projects with other artists. So why take on the extra work of writing a book? ""People who know me are surprised. But I think the first lessons are very important. The music profession often focuses on the top level, on the idea of a child prodigy. Most people's interest in music is more ordinary. I find that more interesting!""
In creating her books, MacGregor uses her own experiences. Between ages 18 and 25, before she had concert engagements, she taught beginners the piano. But most importantly, she grew up with many children coming to her home for piano lessons from her mother. ""I was playing around on the keyboard, and there were all these other children wanting to play all kinds of music - classical, jazz, pop, improvisation. I wasn't part of a system that forced exceptional talent. I grew up with the idea of making music available to everyone.""
Just as everyone should learn to swim or speak a little French, she believes everyone should try learning the piano. Some kids have a natural talent and learn quickly. She is interested in the others: those who progress at different speeds, enjoy it for a while, but often give up. This can happen at any stage. Some kids find the beginning too hard. Others quit later when the pressure to succeed increases. ""I worry that some people use music, like sport, to make their children achieve things, rather than just enjoy it. Children stop because they feel they can't meet their parents' expectations.""
Her own training manual raises a question. Does she think poorly of existing piano books or teaching quality? ""I'm reluctant to criticize others' teaching or books,"" she says. She admits her books, though colorful and attractive, are not the only ones designed to make learning fun. Her special idea for engaging young beginners is to include a storyline in the books and CDs. The challenge is to make learning interesting. From the first lesson, there are accompaniments in different styles for a teacher or parent to play with the child. For kids whose parents aren't pianists, the accompaniments are on the CDs. Learning should be pure fun, MacGregor insists. ""You have to let them improvise and give them a reason to play at both ends of the keyboard and use the pedals.""
As children progress, bigger challenges appear. They need encouragement to read music instead of relying on their ear. MacGregor, who relied on her ear as a child, understands this. But she believes practice is the most important factor. How can children be encouraged to play a passage again and again? She admits she didn't practice seriously until she went to the Royal Academy of Music, where she needed to practice for difficult contemporary pieces. Now she loves it. The eight hours a day she practices are the core of her musical life, more important than performances. ""I have great sympathy for people who find it hard. I don't think people talk about it enough."" The secret, whether you practice for twenty minutes or five hours, is to know what you want to achieve, she says. Other tips: reward yourself - play the whole piece, even with mistakes. And mix hard with easy."""
CPE_54,C2,"**Writing by Hand and on Screen**
Dr. Johnson once said, ""What is written without effort is in general read without pleasure."" This means that good writing is often difficult to create. When I look back at my handwritten school essays, I notice there were very few mistakes. Today, I would rewrite them many times. I think this is because writing by hand was physically hard. Writing slowly made me think more carefully. Since it was hard to change or erase, I wrote with care. On the other hand, using a computer can lead to careless writing. Many writers find that the time spent fixing early drafts on a computer is about the same as the time spent writing by hand. Also, emails, unlike handwritten letters, can be emotionally heavy. Some say that emails have brought back the art of love letters. Many of these messages are now sent online, where before there was only casual talk. That's a good thing. At least these emails are written in some form of English and grammar. But words on a screen can feel dull. Writers often don't realize the power of written words and may exaggerate. Words typed quickly lack the care and personality of handwriting.
**The CD**
I put down my cup and looked at the CD. The case was not impressive, but the shiny disc inside was interesting. ""Wonderful little things, aren't they?"" Mr. Warriston said, coming back into the room. I agreed and carefully handed the disc to him. ""It's amazing they can hold seventy minutes of music,"" he said, turning on the hi-fi device. He pressed a button, and a small drawer came out. He put the disc in, pressed the button again, and the tray went back in. ""Some people say they sound sterile, but I think they..."" ""Do you have to turn them over, like records?"" I asked. ""What? No,"" Mr. Warriston said, standing up straight. ""No, you only play one side."" ""Why?"" I asked. He looked confused, then thoughtful. ""You know,"" he said, ""I have no idea. I don't see why you couldn't make both sides playable and double the capacity..."" He looked at the machine. ""You could have two lasers, or just turn it over by hand... hmm."" He smiled at me. ""Yes, good point."" He nodded at my wooden chair. ""Anyway. Come on, let's get you sitting in the best place for the stereo effect, eh?"" I smiled, happy to have asked a technical question Mr. Warriston couldn't answer.
**Books versus Electronic Text**
When comparing books and electronic text, author Malcolm Bradbury was right when he said that if matches had been invented after lighters, we'd be amazed at the improvement. Many people, excited by new technology, say that electronic text is a change as big as the invention of printing and that it is almost complete. They forget that changes in how we think take a long time. This kind of talk falls into the trap of thinking our generation is the most important in history. For example, a book from 1979 said, ""The 1980s will see the book as we know it begin a slow and steady slide to oblivion."" So far, this prediction is wrong. Reading long texts on a screen is so unpleasant that most people don't do it. Also, the way information is organized on computers encourages people to read only small parts. Some people say this leads to new ways of storytelling, but there's nothing new about reading non-linearly. Many books, like religious texts, dictionaries, and poetry collections, are not read from start to finish. What's new is that computers don't encourage reading a whole text. 
**The Office**
Charles walked into the office and saw a perfectly organized space. The carpet was clear of the papers that had covered it since it was put down, and the desk was dark wood, just as he remembered from the auction five weeks ago. Neat file-holders were being placed in drawers. Twelve years of trade journals filled the shelves on one wall. Kathleen struggled to close the filing cabinet and then turned to him. ""You have to switch to computers, Charles. This is too much."" ""Hello, Kathleen. Oh, this is amazing."" He admired the room and its antique furniture. He wasn't thinking about a computer or any other machine in it, not even a pencil sharpener. ""Simply amazing,"" he said, avoiding the topic of computers. Over the two years he had known her, they had this conversation many times. She couldn't understand why he resisted technology when he was so good with computers and had even published an important paper on computer skills. She had inspired that paper. With a keyboard, she could change any software into something new and exciting."
CPE_32,C2,"""You don't take sugar, do you?"" shouted his secretary. She wasn't really asking, since she had been making Lancelot coffee for many months. Her excuse for forgetting was that he wasn't usually supposed to be there. But now, he was there all the time. He realized that staying away would lead to chaos. He thought about how he had gone from being a valued advisor, meeting authors and playwrights over lunch, to a stressed worker with no parking space at work. ""This came,"" she yelled, waving a manila folder before putting it in front of him. ""From that guy in Los Angeles. You said you wanted to see it."" A typed label read: ""A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert."" Below it, it said ""An Expanded Synopsis."" Lancelot did not want to see the word ""synopsis."" He wanted to see ""A First Draft."" He had already seen a synopsis of this book and didn't want to see another, even if it was revised. Ian Cuthbert had been given a large advance for this book when Lancelot bought the company. Ian was one of several old friends Lancelot had made the mistake of commissioning books from. Ian was proof that a person with a difficult personality would become even more unpredictable. Lancelot skipped the introduction, which he had read many times, and looked at the synopsis. He recognized almost every phrase. He closed the folder and put it aside. Clearly, Ian's manuscript would never come. The synopsis lacked the brilliance Ian was supposed to have, and it had a tone of lost conviction. Lancelot remembered stories of a famous author whose last book was published incomplete after his death, coaxed from him chapter by chapter. But in that case, the payments were small parts of an advance that was never given. Ian's advance had been huge, a reversal of the business principle that authors must deliver a manuscript to be paid later. Lancelot, who studied modern languages at Oxford, remembered when Ian was the most promising talent in a Cambridge full of promise. Ian's peers had taken over British theatre quickly. But Ian's energy made theirs look lazy. He wore his coat like a cape and talked about famous writers as if he knew them. Yet, Ian's creative talent stayed hidden. While others succeeded, Ian withdrew. At his peak, he was difficult to work with. Appointed to edit an arts magazine, he was overwhelmed by opportunities. The magazine used up its budget without publishing. His contract with a fashion magazine produced little except stories about his high salary, which increased to make him produce more, then anything. At editorial meetings, Ian was witty but harsh, criticizing others' ideas. Ten years later, he was unreliable. Lancelot was close to admitting that ""A World History of the Short"" was a mistake from the start."
CPE_65,C2,"'England's breakfast revolution The importance of a good breakfast is clear according to health experts, but historically, breakfast is a relatively new concept in England. In medieval times, breakfast is rarely mentioned in literature. There are some references to travelers eating at dawn before long journeys, and to the sick having breakfast for health reasons, but most people did not eat breakfast unless they were royalty or nobles. However, in the sixteenth century, breakfast gradually became common. Some writers say this was because food was more available. However, they may not have considered other important social changes. For example, new work patterns might explain why breakfast became more important, as people started working set hours, often very early. So, having a meal in the morning became necessary and was no longer just for the wealthy.'"
CPE_61,C2,"**Photography**
When a photographer takes a picture, they choose what to show based on their skills, personal views, and cultural norms. In this book, we will explore how these factors influence the style, content, and expression of a photo, and how viewers perceive and react to these images. For instance, a newspaper reader might think they understand the photos they see. But instead of just accepting the photo as it is, we might ask if it truly shows the scene as it was. Or does it reflect the photographer's perspective? Is the exact moment captured important, or should the photo be seen as a symbol of a situation in the world?
**More than a Game**
For me, sport is more than just a game. The most successful athletes have complete self-confidence. You need to focus completely if you want to succeed in sports. There's only one way to be the best, and you have to ignore everything else. Sport is tough, and no one will do it for you. It's either succeed or fail. Sport has taught me discipline and determination, but it also shows the value of teamwork. My sport lets you shine individually, but it's also a team game, so you must balance both. It's like life - you can succeed alone, but you must remember others around you. Sport has given me a lot - not just money. It has opened opportunities and shown me things around the world that others might never see. But you also have to give up a lot for these benefits.
**Tuning In**
Some experiences are so vivid that they stay clear in our memory. For me, one such moment happened one night in California years ago. I was awake, listening to a mockingbird singing beautifully from a hidden spot in a tall tree in the neighborhood. I don't usually have trouble sleeping, but the bird's amazing singing kept me awake. As I listened to its complex melodies, I felt drawn into a new artistic world. To follow the bird's patterns, I used my knowledge of jazz and Indian classical music. The bird made me feel like I was hearing an incredible, spontaneous musical performance. I reacted with amazement as each surprising musical variation came through the open window where I lay listening, until I finally fell asleep."
CPE_52,C2,"'People have always had strong feelings about birds. But what do these feelings say about us? Paul Evans explores this idea. There's a noise coming from the greenhouse as a small brown bird hits the glass. It's a wren, a bird often seen as a sign or message. Is it trying to tell me something, or is it just trapped? Both could be true, depending on how you see it. Wrens have been part of British culture for a long time. In medieval times, people believed the direction a wren flew could predict their luck. Today, wrens are still popular in British art and homes. Even if old beliefs have faded, wrens still hold a place in our hearts. A forest without wrens feels empty. This is because folklore about birds has been important to people for a long time. In the past, people depended on nature for survival and developed stories to explain the world around them. These stories can change over time. For example, the red kite was once a common bird in London, seen as helpful because it cleaned the streets. But later, it was seen as a pest and almost disappeared, except in Wales. Now, red kites are protected and have become symbols of conservation in Britain. Our connection to birds goes back to early human history. Early humans watched birds closely because they could warn of danger or changes in weather. Birds also connected people to their dreams and the supernatural. When we think about why birds matter to us, we also think about what it means to be human. Birds represent flight, song, and freedom, which we admire and envy. Some people might say these feelings are outdated, but they are still part of us. That's why birds are now seen as indicators of environmental health. In Britain, 30 bird species are endangered, which is sad not only because we lose these birds but also because we lose part of our culture. Birds like the skylark, turtle dove, and lapwing have deep cultural meanings, representing love and magic. Losing them is a cultural loss. However, birds not mentioned in stories or literature are often ignored. Folklore is important because it keeps stories alive and connects us to the past. These stories have a power that scientific terms can't match. They bring out feelings and memories buried under modern life. Whether we watch birds on TV or in our gardens, the joy we feel can't be fully explained by science. Birds are fascinating in ways we don't completely understand, and the stories we tell about them help us interpret their messages. The wren in the greenhouse creates a link between the present and a distant past, holding a mystery that keeps us curious.'"
CPE_28,C2,"**Maps**
A map's main purpose is to show the relationships between points and features on the earth's surface using distance and direction. In the past, distance was often described in terms of time, like ""a day's journey by river,"" which told more about how easy it was to travel through the area than the actual distance. Direction was less important for travelers who mainly wanted to know ""Where do I go from here?"" and ""How far is it?"" Because of this, written travel guides were popular for a long time. Even today, some maps, like those of railway systems, might not show true directions. Early maps used signs to show important landmarks, and these signs varied in size to show their importance. The symbols used depended on the map's purpose and location, so understanding these symbols is key when studying old maps.
The history of map-making, or cartography, is about improving the accuracy of distance and direction and adding more details to maps. Cartography has used other sciences to help with this. For example, instead of using shadows or stars to find direction, people used the magnetic compass, which allowed for more precise measurements. As knowledge of the world grew through exploration, attempts were made to map it more accurately. Astronomers found that the earth is slightly flattened at the poles, which led to more precise mapping of large areas.
Over time, the needs of map users changed. Travelers and merchants were no longer the only users. Soldiers, especially with the use of artillery, needed accurate maps to understand the terrain. This led to the invention of contour lines. Archaeologists, historians, and modern geographers also had specific needs, leading to maps showing things like geological layers and land use. The recognition of maps' value in many sciences has led to a modern revival of cartography.
The development of maps has not been a smooth or continuous process. There have been times of slow progress and times of rapid development, with old ideas sometimes existing alongside new ones. Cartographers often knew what was needed for progress but had to wait for better tools to apply their ideas. Since it was easier to copy old maps, and because of the investment in printing, map publishers were often slow to adopt new ideas. Therefore, maps should not be taken as perfect evidence of the knowledge and techniques of their time.
The many maps we have today are the result of much human effort and thought. They are a valuable record for studying human history. This makes the study of historical cartography both fascinating and educational."
CPE_35,C2,"
I was invited into a young man's drawing room, a calm and cultured space surrounded by a messy cluster of rooms where the less active family members stayed. Moving from the kitchen to his parlour felt like going from economy to business class. This room had the largest collection of records I had ever seen, the first stereo record player and tuner I had come across, and surprising evidence that a teenager had spent money on Georgian wine glasses, pictures, and furniture. His name was Andrew Lloyd Webber. He had won a scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford, to study history, and he had nine months before starting. During this time, he wanted to become England's answer to the composer Richard Rodgers. My own dreams were just as wild; I wanted to be a pop star for reasons like women, money, and fame. The difference between Andrew and me was that my dreams were not life or death to me, though it's easy to say that now. They might have become so if I had failed. So, when Andrew suggested a new crazy ambition for me, to become as famous a lyricist as Oscar Hammerstein, I had no problem trying it. This was partly because within ten minutes of meeting, he was at the piano playing three tunes he had composed—I could tell he was very good. As he confidently played selections from shows he had written and produced at school, I was reminded of the best show albums from my parents' LP collection. He needed a new lyricist for the outside world. I had little to impress him with, other than instant praise for his music and a real, released seven-inch single of a song I had written (both words and music) that an unknown pop group had recorded three months earlier. We parted, promising to meet again and write something together. I was still more interested in the music charts than in West End theatre, but on the bus back to my flat, I told myself I had just met someone with rare talent and determination, and I would be crazy to miss out on being his partner, as he was clearly going to take the musical theatre by storm, probably soon. And even if we failed to challenge the top musical composers, we could try to compete with the Beatles and Rolling Stones later. The Everly Brothers had just made a comeback and would need new material. The next day, back at my desk in the office where I was training to become a lawyer, the certainty I had felt about a life in show business with Andrew Lloyd Webber had faded a bit. I would continue to look at small ads in Melody Maker for groups needing a vocalist and write a few more simple songs that wouldn't show my voice's limitations, but it was still likely that I would eventually pass my exams and become a respectable lawyer by the time I was twenty-five. By then, I would have surely grown out of pop music, as my father had confidently predicted I would by the time I was twenty-one. This was worrying—if he was right, I only had a few more months of enjoying it. But in the meantime, I felt I had nothing to lose by seeing Andrew again. It would be fun to see a musical with him and write lyrics that imitated musical lyricists rather than pop stars. Andrew was a fascinating person who talked about Good Food Guides and Victorian architecture, besides supporting Leyton Orient football team. I wasn't convinced by the idea for a musical he had been working on for the past year, but in 1965, I was rarely convinced about anything. His talent was unquestionable, and he claimed to have all the contacts. I was soon back in his drawing room. The idea was the life of Dr. Thomas Barnardo, the nineteenth-century philanthropist who founded the orphanages that bear his name. His story was worthy, but it didn't truly inspire me. The hero was too perfect, at least in Andrew's version, and the project was unoriginal, owing too much to Lionel Bart's hit show, Oliver. On the other hand, Andrew's belief in his score's brilliance was infectious and not totally unjustified. What did I know about musicals? As David Land, who later became my agent for over twenty-five years, memorably said, if there's a demand for one hamburger bar on the block, there is room for two. We could be the second hamburger joint. I started working with great enthusiasm, especially for the songs meant to be funny. Andrew outlined the plot, played me the tunes, and often gave me the title, most of which had probably been thought up by his previous lyricist friend. I skipped a day at the solicitor's office, pretending to be sick, to write my first batch of theatrical lyrics. I didn't know it that day, but I had changed careers."
CPE_5,C2,"**Language**
Humans have a special ability: we can communicate with each other using language. Language is so important to us that it's hard to imagine life without it. If you see two or more people together anywhere in the world, they will probably start talking. Even when alone, people often talk to themselves, their pets, or even their plants. I like to think of language as an 'instinct'. This means that people know how to speak naturally, just like spiders know how to spin webs. Spiders didn't learn web-spinning from a genius spider or need special training; it's something they just do.
**Climate and Weather**
Climate and weather, created by the air around us, have a big impact on where animals and plants live. Climate can shape the look of landscapes. For example, warm and wet climates all year allow tropical jungles to grow, which have a huge variety of species. On the other hand, cold and windy areas have fewer living things. Weather patterns, which together form the climate, are caused by large masses of air moving and mixing. The atmosphere is always in motion. Some of this movement is because the air is on a spinning Earth, and since air is light, it doesn't move as fast as the Earth. The sun is an even more important cause of air movement.
**Coffee**
As a bar-person, I had to serve drinks and, more importantly, make coffee. In Lygon Street, Melbourne, a restaurant's success can depend on its coffee. I went through several days of intense coffee-making training, learning a lot about cleaning and maintaining the restaurant's shiny espresso machine. I also learned the key steps to making a perfect cup of rich, frothy cappuccino. By the end of the first week, I realized that making good coffee was harder than it seemed, and I thought I might be moved to simpler tasks like cleaning ashtrays. Fortunately, my boss was patient. ""Making coffee is both an art and a science,"" he said, ""and you need time to learn how to do it well."""
CPE_41,C2,"**Art on TV**
Why does television often fail with programs about visual arts? Painting and sculpture seem perfect for TV because the camera can show a whole artwork and then zoom in on details. However, few TV series successfully show both the enjoyment and complexity of viewing art. A good example of this issue is Robert Hughes's series, ""American Visions,"" about American art. Hughes is a trustworthy critic with a strong personality, and he had almost eight hours to introduce British viewers to American art, which is often ignored by British galleries. I expected the series to focus on great artworks, but instead, it was about how American history and culture are shown in its art and architecture.
**Dealing in Metals**
For 20 years, I worked as an international metals dealer and became known as a speculator. Metals markets are less regulated than others. With some luck, a willingness to take risks, and a good understanding of the market, it's possible to make a lot of money. Risk-taking is a key part of the industry. This adventurous culture fits well with a free-market global economy. However, free-trade economists who thought the market would keep the price of scarce metals stable have found the opposite. More minerals are being extracted, and the cost of raw materials is decreasing. Considering inflation, the prices of most metals are about half of what they were 20 years ago. Recently, I was asked to investigate claims against a multinational company that benefits from these cheap raw materials.
**Extract from a Holiday Brochure**
Abaco and its offshore cays are part of the 700 islands of the Bahamas, stretching from Florida past the Tropic of Cancer to Cuba. Each island has its own character and offers something unique. To get around the islands and cays of Abaco, a boat is essential. If your accommodation doesn't include one, don't worry. There are many ferries and water-taxis. You can also rent a boat if you prefer to travel independently. Sailing is the most popular way to get around here. Abaco is called 'The Sailing Capital of the World' for a good reason. The calm, naturally protected waters are perfect for fishing, diving, snorkeling, and swimming. The cays and their beaches stretch for 200 miles like a string of pearls. It's not only at sea that treasures can be found. At night, the lights of the restaurants and cafes of Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay sparkle."
CPE_69,C2,"**Build Your Own Bamboo Bike at the UK's First Workshop**
The Bamboo Bike Club, run by engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan, offers a unique experience: a weekend course where you can build your own custom bamboo bike frame. Located in Hackney Wick, east London, this is the only bamboo bike-building course in the UK. 
Bamboo is becoming a popular material for bike construction, with companies like Calfee Design in California and Bamboo Bikes in Yorkshire leading the way. However, their ready-made frames can be expensive, costing around $2,995 or £1,868. James and Ian wanted to make bamboo bikes more affordable and accessible, so they spent years developing their idea in a shed in Brecon, Wales. They realized they didn't just want to sell frames; they wanted to share the joy of making something unique and sustainable. 
The Bamboo Bike Club is more of a community project than a business. James works with wind turbines, and Ian is a civil engineer, so they run the club alongside their full-time jobs. Their courses are popular, offering a computer-designed custom bike frame and a fun weekend of bike-building at a competitive price.
On the first day of the course, participants learn how to select bamboo for strength and form strong joints. The process involves gluing bamboo tubes in place to create the bike's frame. Alloy tubes are used for parts that need extra strength, like the handlebars and wheel forks. James and Ian guide participants through the process, ensuring quality and offering help when needed. 
Most participants enjoy the challenge of building their own bike, and many are engineers. For those less experienced, Ian reassures that mistakes are part of the process, and it's easy to try again with a new piece of bamboo. Each piece is pre-checked for quality, allowing participants to focus on the aesthetics of their frame.
On Sunday, the focus is on building the lugs, or wraps, using hemp bindings and epoxy resin to create strong joints. A final polymer coating makes the bike waterproof, and it's ready for wheels, brakes, gears, and other personal touches. The finished bike is strong and durable, comparable to metal bikes. Ian and James have tested their bikes extensively, proving their durability.
While bamboo bikes may look a bit rough compared to professional frames, they have a unique charm. James and Ian believe that the individuality of each bike is what makes them special. The ride quality is impressive, with bamboo's natural ability to absorb vibrations providing a smooth experience. 
The cost of building your own bamboo bike at the workshop is less than £500, making it an affordable and rewarding project."
CPE_38,C2,"**Self-help Books**
Dione Reverend was just an editor at Random House in New York when she first saw a manuscript by an unknown pop psychologist, Dr. John Gray. ""I took one look at the title and knew it would be a number one bestseller,"" she says, laughing, and she was right. Dr. Gray is now a multimillionaire, and Dione Reverend has her own company. Dr. Gray's book on how to improve communication between men and women is a key part of the growing self-help industry. This industry claims to help Americans improve their lives, but it also benefits from their desires for self-improvement. It supports the New York publishing world. In Britain, the genre is also popular, with many books that are dramatic and exaggerated. However, many self-help books are rejected for being too similar to others or too specific. Editors focus on marketability, asking questions like, ""How promotable is the author? What's the 'hook'? Is it universal enough?"" Dione Reverend says that a catchy title is crucial, as it helps reach people.
**Autobiographies**
There is an unspoken agreement between an autobiographer and the reader that the truth is being told. However, this agreement is often not fully kept. Writers may leave out shameful actions or thoughts, or things they consider unimportant. Some writers believe that inventing stories can better capture the truth about themselves than sticking strictly to the facts. Others may call their book an autobiography to make readers believe it is true, even if it is fiction. This can be done without any intention to deceive.
**Dashiell Hammett's Detective Stories**
Detective stories have been explained as a reflection of the conflicts in late nineteenth and early twentieth-century society. These stories are like allegories. The crime represents human impulses like lust or greed, and solving it symbolizes restoring order in society. In Hammett's stories, society is shown to be corrupt even after order is restored. The detective and the criminal understand each other and are comfortable with each other. The private detective is both a crook and a competitor. His mission is sometimes affected by his understanding of the criminal, and sometimes his desire to punish is increased by his own doubts.
**Science Writing**
Stephen Jay Gould is considered today's greatest scientific essayist. To discuss his writing, I met him at the Grand Hotel, where he was staying while promoting his new book. Neither of us felt comfortable there. Gould said he couldn't write about such a place because he didn't know the culture. Understanding the culture is important for a successful writer. Science is like its own civilization, and only scientists can effectively present it. If you don't understand the community and its rules, you will struggle. Gould advises never to write down to the reader. ""You can simplify the language but must never simplify the argument. Once readers feel patronized, your piece is dead."""
CPE_17,C2,"**Air-conditioning**
At Cannons Gym, a popular spot for City of London workers during lunch, the air feels very cold. To cope with this summer's unusually high temperatures, the gym has used a lot of air-conditioning. In fact, when it's not busy, the gym feels as cold as the Arctic. This is an example of how modern society often misuses air-conditioning. It has become a key part of work and leisure, showing how humans can control or change the climate. However, many air-conditioned buildings could use other ways to stay cool. They could use natural light and ventilation and have thicker walls that absorb less heat during the day and release it at night. These ideas might seem simple, but they can be very effective and would greatly reduce the need for air-conditioning.
**Sundials**
It is probably not a coincidence that the start of a new millennium has brought renewed interest in sundials. Sundials are tools used to tell time based on the sun's position. A hundred years ago, they were important for keeping time accurately. As clocks and watches became more advanced and reliable, sundials became garden decorations—romantic and interesting, but outdated in a modern technological age. Now, interest in them is growing again. David Harber, a maker of sundials, believes their charm comes from their connection to the planets. He says there is a magical moment when a sundial starts working. They are calm, romantic objects that remind us of our place in the universe.
**Paint Your Own China**
My idea of china-painting came from a visit long ago to an arts and crafts show where serious-looking older women showed how to paint delicate flowers on a teacup with skillful brushstrokes. It was fascinating because each stroke created a perfect petal or leaf. Their hands were steady, the paint never smeared, and it seemed these women had either practiced for years or had a natural talent for precision. Remembering this, I wondered what kind of people would join a china-painting class. Would even beginners show natural artistic skill? In reality, the atmosphere was not intimidating at all. The students were there to have fun, and even the teacher did not want to paint petals on teacups with the quick precision I had seen before."
CPE_47,C2,"**The Wrong Country**
Uncle chose a package holiday for Keith and Dawne at a good price: a flight from Gatwick Airport and twelve nights in Venice, the beautiful city, staying at the Pensione Concordia. When they went to the travel agency to book, the clerk told them that the other people in their package were a school group from the south coast, all learning Italian. But something went wrong. Either at the travel agency, the check-in desk, or in a computer, a small mistake happened. Dawne and Keith ended up in a hotel called the Edelweiss, in Room 212, somewhere in Switzerland.
At Gatwick, they gave their tickets to a girl in the yellow-and-red Your-Kind-of-Holiday uniform. She checked their details and said everything was fine. An hour later, they were surprised to hear elderly people on the plane speaking with North of England accents. Keith thought there might have been a cancellation, or maybe the Italian class was on another plane. They ordered drinks and relaxed.
When they landed, a stout woman with glasses told everyone to stay together. There was no mention of an overnight stop in the brochure, but when the coach reached its destination, Keith thought it was just a stopover. It was almost midnight, and they were too tired to question their right to the beds they were offered. But the next morning, when they realized they were staying there for the whole holiday, they were worried.
""We have the lake and the water birds,"" the receptionist explained with a smile. ""And we can take the steamer to Interlaken."" ""There's been a mistake,"" Keith said calmly, trying to stay composed. He could feel Dawne's nervous breathing beside him. ""We were supposed to be in Venice, at the Pensione Concordia."" ""I don't know that name, sir. This is Switzerland."" ""A coach is supposed to take us on. An official said so on the plane. She was here last night, that woman."" ""Your group is booked for twelve nights at the Edelweiss Hotel. To change now, sir, if you've changed your minds—"" ""We haven't changed our minds. There's been a mistake.""
The receptionist shook his head. He didn't know about any mistake. ""The man who made the booking,"" Dawne said, ""was bald, with glasses and a moustache."" She gave the name of the travel agency in London. ""Is there a problem?"" a woman asked, smiling at Keith. She was the stout woman he had thought was an official. They had seen her talking to the girl at Gatwick. On the plane, she had walked up and down the aisle, smiling at people. ""My name is Franks,"" she said. ""I'm married to the man with the bad leg.""
""Are you in charge, Mrs. Franks?"" Dawne asked. ""We're in the wrong hotel."" She repeated the name of the travel agency and described the bald-headed clerk. Keith interrupted her. ""It seems we joined the wrong group. We reported to the Your-Kind-of-Holiday girl and left it to her."" ""We should have known when they weren't from Dover,"" Dawne added. ""We heard them talking about Darlington."" Keith made an impatient sound. He wished she would let him do the talking.
""We noticed you at Gatwick,"" Keith said. ""We knew you were in charge."" ""And I noticed you. I counted you, although you probably didn't see me doing that. Now, let me explain. Your-Kind-of-Holiday sends people to many places, with different holidays at different prices. There are villa holidays for adventurous under-thirty-fives, treks to Turkey, and treks for singles to the Himalayas.""
""What I'm trying to say is that all tickets and labels look similar, the yellow with the two red bands."" Mrs. Franks laughed. ""So if you just followed others with the yellow-and-red label, you might end up in a wildlife park! But of course,"" she added kindly, ""that couldn't happen in a million years."" ""We're not meant to be in Switzerland,"" Keith insisted. ""Well, let's see, shall we?"" Mrs. Franks suddenly walked away, leaving them standing. The receptionist was no longer at the desk. They could hear typing.
""She seems kind,"" Dawne whispered. Keith wasn't listening. He tried to remember everything that had happened: giving the girl the tickets, sitting down to wait, the girl leading them to the plane, the pilot's voice welcoming them, and the air hostess checking seat belts. ""Nice to have some young people along,"" an elderly man's voice interrupted Keith's thoughts. ""Nottage is the name."" The old man's wife was with him, both looking like they were in their eighties. They had slept well, she said, the best night's sleep in years, thanks to the lakeside air. ""That's nice,"" Dawne said.
Keith walked out of the reception area, and Dawne followed him. Outside the hotel, they didn't mention the irony of the situation. On their first holiday since their honeymoon, they ended up on a package tour with elderly people, when the whole point was to escape the needs and demands of the elderly. Uncle had said so himself when they tried to persuade him to join them."
CPE_48,C2,"'HE WAS A PEOPLE PERSON American executives are adopting the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton as a model of good management. Eluned Price reports. Many people in Britain know who Sir Ernest Shackleton was and have a general idea of what he did. In America, however, he has only recently become well-known. The Wall Street Journal described Shackleton earlier this year as 'an Antarctic explorer whose achievements went largely unnoticed for most of the 20th century,' which might be an exaggeration. But now Americans are showing great interest in him. Biographies and accounts of the voyage of the Endurance are being produced and are expected to sell quickly; the American Museum of Natural History is organizing a large exhibition, and Columbia Tristar is making a film about Shackleton's life. Some American managers have also adopted Shackleton as a role model. His admirers share stories of his achievements with admiration; they find lessons in leadership and communication from his life, and they refer to each other as 'speaking Shackleton'. The determined and resourceful Shackleton, with his reindeer sleeping bag (fur inside) and blubber-stove, has become a model for modern management consultants. Jim MacGregor, the managing partner of Abernathy MacGregor Frank in New York, chose Shackleton as a role model years ago. His firm specializes in 'communication aspects of mergers and acquisitions and corporate crises'. For example, 'this firm's plant blew up' or 'half the workforce has to go'. While Shackleton did work in public relations for a Glasgow steel company, it might be hard to see the connection between surviving on the last bit of albatross in freezing temperatures and managing a crisis in a company. 'Even if a company handles its crises well, it can still cause problems by communicating poorly about what it's doing,' says MacGregor. 'Shackleton is a model for management because of his qualities as a leader and communicator. He had his values in order. He was at his best when he and those dependent on him had a lot to lose -- like their lives. One of the most interesting decisions Shackleton made was to turn back when only 97 miles from the South Pole. That decision explained his credibility for the next expedition: the lives of his men were most important.' This refers to Shackleton's expedition to reach the South Pole in 1908 when, 97 miles short of their goal, with unexpected delays using up their supplies and limited time to return to their ship, Shackleton made the brave and difficult decision to turn back. In a crisis, says MacGregor, people want to know someone is in charge. While today managers often avoid responsibility, Shackleton was ready to take it. His 1914 expedition became legendary. His ship, the Endurance, was trapped for nine months in the ice and was finally crushed by ice floes. When it sank, Shackleton told his men, 'we should all eventually reach safety provided that you continue to do your utmost and to trust me'. From all the accounts and diaries they kept, it is clear that there was never a time that the Boss was not in charge. 'Shackleton thought everything through, planned for every possibility, kept his men informed, and asked for their opinions,' says MacGregor. 'He was adaptable, willing to let go when something was lost and start anew. We've built an effective set of principles here that Shackleton illustrates. Clients can relate to his story without feeling they're being criticized.' Shackleton believed that an explorer needs optimism, physical endurance, and patience. 'One of the hardest things to do in desperate situations is to do nothing, especially in America, a culture that is strongly against letting time solve problems,' says MacGregor. 'If you buy bonds and guess wrong on the interest rates, you hang in there and eventually you'll get your money back. To ""fix it"" and sell would mean a huge loss. Similarly, don't be afraid to change your plans if they're not working. If a new product is a failure, don't keep selling it.' Shackleton led by example. On the voyage back from the Endurance, he noticed Hurley, the expedition photographer, without gloves. He forced his own gloves on Hurley, saying if he didn't put them on he would throw them overboard. Someone else remembered him doing the same thing with a biscuit when they were near starving on the 1905 expedition: 'He said he'd leave it in the snow. Millions of pounds couldn't have bought that biscuit.' As Caroline Alexander, author of Endurance, the human account of that expedition, says: 'The public appetite for heroic endeavor is increasing. Shackleton shows that there is nothing heroic happening now. Everything else falls away and he is left standing, the true embodiment of the ideals that we long for nowadays.'"
