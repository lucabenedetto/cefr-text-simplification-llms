Some time ago, there was a website that talked about the risks of public check-ins. It said that if you post something online, it can be seen by a lot of people. This website confirmed that there can be downsides to sharing your life online. However, it also said that there are a lot of benefits to sharing your life online. For example, you can gain wealth and fame.
The website also talked about the early days of the internet. In the early days, people could use the internet to share their work and personal information. One of the first people to use the internet to share his personal information was a young man named Justin Hall. Hall started a blog and wrote about his life. His blog was popular and many people read it. However, Hall's blog was also controversial. Some people thought that he was being too personal.
The website also talked about the risks of sharing your personal information online. For example, if you share your address or phone number online, people may be able to use that information to harm you. If you share your personal information online, you should be aware of the risks."

A long time ago, some scientists started a campaign to warn people about a movie called What the Bleep Do We Know? which showed that there is a lot about the universe that we don’t understand. The movie made some pretty amazing claims, but some scientists felt that it was not credible. They argued that the evidence was not strong enough to support the claims made in the movie. However, the movie did inspire some people to learn more about science and the universe. It also made people realize that the universe is much stranger than we could ever imagine.

Writing novels is a challenge, while writing short stories is a joy. It is like planting a forest or a garden. The two processes complement each other, creating a complete landscape. Writing novels is like planting a forest, and writing short stories is like planting a garden. The two processes complement each other, creating a complete landscape.
Since the beginning of my career as a fiction writer, I have fairly consistently alternated between writing novels and short stories. I write novels and short stories in different ways. It takes me about a week to get a short story into some kind of decent shape.
I find writing short stories a necessary change of pace and a way to experiment. They are like soft shadows I have set out in the world, faint footprints I have left behind. Short stories are like guideposts to my heart, and it makes me happy as a writer to be able to share these intimate feelings with my readers."

Science is a powerful force that has greatly impacted human life. It has improved our lives and presented challenges. It has also inspired artists and thinkers. Science has its beauty and its dangers. It has been used to explain the universe and to cure diseases. However, science is not perfect. It is constantly changing and evolving. Scientists come in many colors, and their work is often characterized by conflict. The history of science is filled with examples of scientific change and progress. Science has also been used to control nature. We have the ability to manipulate the future, and science plays a big role in that. We need to be aware of the power and potential dangers of science. We also need to be prepared for the future that science will bring."

From around 2015, sales of ebooks had started to decline. This led to doubts about the long-term potential of ebooks in the publishing industry. Some people feared that ebooks would kill print books. However, there is evidence to suggest that digital and print can coexist in the market. The idea of the disappearing book is powerful because it tells us much more about the mixture of exhilaration and fear we feel about innovation and change in general.
The emergence of new technologies often leads to fears about the demise of existing media. This is because we create emotional bonds with different media as they become a core part of our life. As a result, the emergence of a new technology can cause us to adjust our bond with something that has become an integral part of our day-to-day life.
The spread of the printing press and the shift from silent to sound movies have stimulated nostalgia for older forms of media. This is because we often long for what we used to know, but no longer have. As a result, entire industries develop around retro products and older technologies."

Every day, I wake up early, brush my teeth, make coffee, and write about how some of the greatest minds of the past have approached their work. I write about the details of their daily lives, such as their sleep, eating, working, and worrying. I hope to provide a new perspective on their personalities and careers.
I also talk about my own struggles with creativity and productivity. I have concerns about how to do meaningful creative work while also earning a living. I have tried to provide examples of how a variety of brilliant and successful people have confronted similar challenges.
The book's title is Daily Rituals. My focus in writing it was really people’s routines. I believe that a solid routine can be a well-worn groove for one’s mental energies and help stave off the tyranny of moods.
As much as possible, I have let my subjects speak for themselves, in quotes from letters, diaries and interviews. I have also included some of my own thoughts and ideas about creativity and productivity."

Howard became a palaeontologist because he was interested in dinosaurs. He studied delicate creatures revealed on the surface of grey rocks. He worked on his doctoral thesis and got a job as an Assistant Lecturer at Tavistock College in London. He often found himself contrasting the orderly nature of his professional life with the anarchy of private concerns.
One day, his briefcase was stolen. He was fuming and returned to the college. He made an explanatory phone call and postponed the lecture. He reported the theft to the appropriate authorities and then went for a restorative coffee. He joined a colleague who was entertaining a visiting curator from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. And thus it was that Howard learned of the recently acquired collection of fossils, as yet uncatalogued and unidentified."

Charles Spence is a professor of experimental psychology at Oxford University in the UK. He has studied how the senses interact to form our perception of flavour. Through his studies, he has influenced what we eat and drink. He has also studied how food is experienced with others.
Spence has written a book called The Perfect Meal, which is packed with insights that are fascinating to anyone in possession of an appetite. It includes information about how much we eat when eating with others. It also includes information about how music and sound can affect taste.
Spence's lab is un-space-age. It has soundproof booths and stacks of ancient-looking audio-visual equipment. He can afford to work more creatively with cooks because he keeps his overheads low.
Spence is currently helping famous brands through reductions in salt and sugar. He points out that it is in their interests to help loyal customers stay alive for longer."

Our brains are very busy these days. We have a lot of information to deal with, including facts, pseudo facts, and rumours. We also do more things than ever before. Thirty years ago, travel agents and salespeople helped us with our travel and shopping needs. Now we do most things ourselves. We’re doing the work of many people while still trying to keep up with our lives, our families, our careers, and our hobbies. Our smartphones have become an important part of our lives. They help us do many things, but they also make it harder to focus.
Multitasking is a powerful and dangerous illusion. It makes us demonstrably less efficient. It also increases the production of stress hormones and makes it harder to learn new information. Lots of multitasking also requires decision-making. It turns out that decision-making is also very hard on our brains. We rapidly spiral into a depleted state in which, after making lots of insignificant decisions, we can end up making truly bad decisions about something important."

In a zoo in Sweden, a chimpanzee named Santino spent his nights breaking up concrete into pieces to throw at visitors during the day. Was he being spiteful? In caves in the US, female bats help unrelated fruit bat mothers if they can’t find the right birthing position. Are they being caring? Fifty years ago, people thought that animals had behaviours that produced measurable outcomes, and science recorded those outcomes. But recently that has partially changed. Thanks to research into the behaviour of bats, chimps, and other animals, emotions of animals have gone from being a taboo area of investigation to being tentatively explored. The new research has started a debate about whether animals can be said to have consciousness and conscience. If animals do have consciousness, what does it mean for the production and consumption of beef? The observations may not be disputed, but the interpretation of them is. There are different views on what the new research means for the future of humanity and our relationship with animals. Some people believe that we should stop eating meat, while others believe that we should re-evaluate our view of animal cognition. Ultimately, the question of whether animals have consciousness and conscience is a philosophical one, and there may not be a definitive answer."

Critical thinking is a way of interacting with what we read or listen to in order to have a deeper understanding. It involves analyzing, evaluating, and judging information based on its relevance, accuracy, and credibility. Although technology can help us store and process information more easily, it can also make it more difficult to think critically. One of the main concerns is the amount of poor yet charismatic thinking that is available online. It can be overwhelming to reason with so much misinformation and biased information. Additionally, the constant barrage of visual media can make it difficult to focus on a single task and reflect on ideas. However, there are also some benefits to using technology for critical thinking. For example, games such as Sim City and Civilization can teach decision-making and analytical skills. It is important to understand the subtleties of how technology affects thinking and analysis in order to make the most of its benefits and minimize its negative effects."

When Matthew Crawford is not writing or thinking about how we ought to live, he works as a motorcycle mechanic. He wrote two books about the benefits of manual trades and philosophy. He was inspired to write his latest book when he was shopping and noticed that advertisements popped up on the credit card machine. He says that these demands on our attention are becoming increasingly difficult to avoid.
Crawford is concerned about the impact of technology on our ability to think and communicate. He argues that technology has created the perfect vehicles for our self-obsession. He says that we are more conscious of other things we might be doing and that this has a social impact.
Crawford's proposed solution has two parts. First, we need regulation of noise and distraction in public space. More importantly, he advocates skilled practices as a way of engaging with the world in a more satisfying way."

What do you do for a living? It's a common question that we often answer in a few words. However, if you're a philosopher, it's slightly harder to deal with. Philosophers are no different from the masses, but the misconception that they are is persistent. One reason for this misconception is that philosophers have established themselves as people who judge the activities of others and celebrate intellectual life. Another reason is that the discipline of philosophy has grown increasingly removed from lived experiences. To fix this trend, philosophers need to be more accessible to the public. More recently, I've begun to feel that the title 'ethicist' is insufficient to capture my area of inquiry, because ethics is commonly asserted as being connected to formal codes, values and laws.

Foodies, gourmands, chefs and others who love food might expect that reflecting on what and how we eat can contribute to culinary pleasure. However, philosophical discussions of food have often been about other topics, such as the acquisition of knowledge or the pursuit of pleasure. Food is inherently social and cultural. It is shared with those in our communities and provides us with dining companions and infrastructure. Ethical issues related to food include what we should eat and the extent to which cooking in restaurants and in the home differ. Cooking in the home is often more intimate and inclusive, while cooking for a living has different obligations. Food and dining can also play a role in bridging cultural gaps. We can come to appreciate others by learning to enjoy their food and forge personal bonds with people from other cultures by coming together to eat."

Rob Daviau is a US designer who creates legacy board games. He felt that traditional board games were no longer entertaining or challenging enough, so he started to wonder how board games might evolve. He adapted a classic board game called Risk and created a new version called Risk Legacy. Unlike previous board games, decisions made during gameplay had a permanent impact. Players might have to rip up cards, deface the board, or open packets containing new rules. The games play out over the course of a fixed number of sessions and long-held grudges become woven into the fabric of the game.
Legacy board games were never expected to go mainstream, but most players love the concept. They see it as one of the biggest advances in game design for several years. The legacy format draws on video games and the demand for episodic entertainment fuelled by popular TV series."

Once upon a time, there was an octopus named Inky who lived in New Zealand. One night, Inky managed to escape from his tank and swim into the Pacific Ocean. It was a story that was shared online and was very popular. One of the things that makes this story so fun is that it involves anthropomorphism, which means treating animals like humans. Octopuses are especially good at anthropomorphism because they are very intelligent creatures. They can open jars, recognize faces, and use coconut shells as armor.
Anthropomorphism is often thought of as unscientific, but Dr. Frans de Waal, who studies primates, argues that it is not. He says that anthropodenial, which is the opposite of anthropomorphism, has too often characterized our attitudes toward other species. Animals have been observed exhibiting many of the key behaviors that were thought to distinguish humans from animals.
De Waal believes that we are emerging from a dark period where animals were not treated well. He also points out that the most effective tests of animal intelligence are designed with a species’ particular traits and skills in mind."

Once upon a time, there was a technology called robotics that has the potential to change the world. Robots have already been used in the automotive and manufacturing industries for many years. Experts say that the use of robots is going to increase rapidly in the next few years. This will have a big impact on many different industries.
For example, there is a robot called the Hadrian X that can lay 1,000 bricks in one hour. And there is a robot called Tally that roams supermarket aisles alongside human shoppers. These robots can do things that humans can do, but they can also do things that humans cannot do.
The use of robots is going to create new jobs, but it is also going to displace some jobs. Experts say that we need to prepare for the changes that robots will bring. We need to learn new skills and adapt to new technologies.
With the development of new technologies, such as motion control, sensor technologies, and artificial intelligence, there will be new types of robots that can interact with humans in even more sophisticated ways. These robots will have the potential to change the way we live and work."

Because it's there, the mountaineer George Mallory is said to have said about why he wanted to climb Mount Everest. Climbing can be a very rewarding and challenging activity. There are many reasons why people climb. Some people climb for the feeling of freedom it produces. Others climb for the sense of accomplishment and satisfaction that comes from completing a climb. Still others climb for the opportunity to develop important virtues such as courage, humility and respect for the environment. Climbing can also be a very meditative and mindfulness practice.
There are a few things that make climbing unique. First, climbing is a very physical activity that requires strength, endurance, and agility. Second, climbing is a very mental activity that requires concentration, focus, and problem-solving skills. Third, climbing is a very rewarding activity that can provide a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction."

Alfred Brendel was a famous pianist who was known for his intellectual and disciplined personality. He wrote and played a great deal, but taught very little. He had a unique ability to listen to his own playing and understand what he needed to improve.
Brendel met a young boy named Kit Armstrong a few years ago. Kit was a talented musician who was able to play remarkably well and by heart. Brendel recognized Kit's potential and decided to take him under his wing. He taught Kit how to read music properly and helped him develop his skills.
Now, at the age of 80, Brendel is still active and continues to inspire young musicians. He believes that learning to read music properly is helped by the fact that you try to write something yourself. He also encourages young musicians to listen to their own playing and be sensitive to sound.

I have worked hard to improve my skills, and I know that with practice, anyone can achieve great things. I also want to help others, so I use my money to make things a bit easier for the people around me.

It was because of Sam Carter that we were living at Reef Point. Sam was my father’s agent in Los Angeles. He found a cheap place for us to live. The beach had been deserted since the warm weather had been blanketed by sea fogs. Reef Point was seldom patronised by the casual day tripper. There were a lot of people at the beach now. My father was hard at work trying to write a script to a deadline. I moved out onto the beach, taking a book to read, and Rusty for company. Rusty was my dog. We had a lot of fun playing together. Sometimes though, there were things that he had obviously not dug up – a new sneaker, a bright beach-towel. We had been swimming that day. The sun was setting and it was getting cooler. We sat watching the surfers. They had been at it all day, but it seemed they would never tire. One surfer in particular caught my eye. She had a style that made all the others look like clumsy amateurs. But now she seemed to decide to call it a day and rode in on a final wave.

When John Maloof bought a box of old photo negatives at an estate auction, he discovered the mystery of Vivian Maier. Maier was a street photographer with a keen eye for capturing compelling images. Maloof has amassed an archive of Maier’s life and work, which includes her cameras, film, prints, negatives, movies, and audiotapes.
Maier was born in 1926 and spent much of her childhood in France. She returned to New York in 1951 and came to Chicago to work as a nanny. Maier was a private person but had strong opinions about movies and politics. She was also knowledgeable about theatre and movies.
Maier’s work is the purest form of art. None of it was done for any commercial reason. Her images lean toward women, children, the old, the poor, and the abstract.
Maloof often wonders if he’ll ever work his way through all the negatives. He had no real interest in photography until he discovered Maier’s work. Inspired by her architectural shots, Maloof actually went out on the street and began to take his own pictures."

As a boy, Jonny Kinkead loved to play the guitar. He learned to play his brother’s guitar when he was eleven and the bass guitar when he was sixteen. He also built his own guitars. Although the bass was the first instrument he built, he and his brothers had long been doing essentially the same thing with other items.
Jonny’s bass guitar turned out well, but he didn’t think of it as a career. He was also into painting and sculpture. He chose to study architecture at university but dropped out because he was too individualistic. He then decided to focus on his passion for sculpture and guitar-building.
Ever since then, Jonny has made guitars for a living. He has a lot of skill and passion for his work. He believes that developing a career is more straightforward for today’s new guitar-makers in the UK. He also feels that there is no satisfactory substitute for trial and error."

Any discussion of English conversation often begins with the weather. It is a traditional part of English conversations. When two English people meet, their first talk is usually about the weather. Most commentators try to explain why the English are so obsessed with the weather. They fail because they start with the wrong assumption. They assume that English people talk about the weather because they have a keen interest in the subject. However, this is not true. Our conversations about the weather are not really about the weather at all. They are a form of 'grooming talk'. This is like what monkeys and apes do when they groom each other's fur. There are certain fixed contexts in which weather-speak is used. It can be used as a simple greeting, as an ice-breaker leading to conversation on other matters or as a 'default' or 'filler' topic when conversation on other matters dries up."

The silence on Centre Court at the Wimbledon tennis championships is very quiet. You can bounce the ball and hit it, and you hear the echo of your own shot. The trimmed grass, the rich history, the ancient stadium, the players dressed in white, and the respectful crowds all combine to enclose and cushion you from the outside world. The quiet of the Centre Court is good for my game. It helps me to focus on the point I’m playing and to shut everything else out.
The silence of the Centre Court is broken by a sudden noise when a point’s done: applause, cheers, people shouting your name. You hear them, but as if from some place far off. You don’t register that there are fifteen thousand people hunched around the arena, tracking every move your opponent and you make. I am so focused I have no sense at all that there are millions watching me around the world as I play Roger Federer in the 2008 Wimbledon final – the biggest match of my life.
I had always dreamed of playing at Wimbledon. My uncle Toni, who has been my coach all my life, had drummed into me from an early age that this was the biggest tournament of them all. By the time I was 14, I was sharing with my friends the fantasy that I’d play there one day and win. Before 2008, though, I’d played and lost, both times against Federer – in the final there the year before, and the year before that. The defeat in 2006 had not been so hard. I went out onto the court that time just pleased and grateful that, having just turned twenty, I’d made it that far. Federer beat me pretty easily, more easily than if I’d gone out with more belief. But my defeat in 2007 left me utterly destroyed. I knew I could have done better, that it was not my ability or the quality of my game that had failed me, but my head. I wept after that loss. I cried incessantly for half an hour in the dressing room. Losing always hurts, but it hurts much more when you have a chance and throw it away."

A young Englishwoman named Jane Goodall arrived in Africa in early 1957. She spent most of her life in Africa and became known for her work as a scientist, activist, and environmentalist. She was a pioneer in the study of chimpanzees and her work has had a significant impact on the way humans think about themselves.
Goodall's early childhood showed hints of her future accomplishments. One day, she crawled inside a henhouse to find out how hens lay eggs. This incident demonstrates her curiosity and determination.
Goodall's most significant contribution to the field of anthropology is her long-term study of wild apes in Gombe State, Nigeria. Her book, ""The Chimpanzees of Gombe,"" is considered to be the single most authoritative work on chimpanzees. Her research has revealed important information about chimpanzees, such as their diet, social behavior, and tool use.
Goodall's work has been widely praised for its contribution to the field of anthropology. She has been called ""one of the Western world's great scientific achievements."" Her achievements have also inspired many people to learn more about chimpanzees and the importance of conservation."

People often ask me how I became a cartoonist. Cartooning is a dream job that many people have. But most people eventually give up on their dreams and consider more realistic professions. The idea that you can support yourself financially by sketching the sort of doodles commonly found in high school notebooks is silly. Yet, some people do exactly that. To become a cartoonist, you don’t need a university degree or much money. You just need your brain, your hand and something that makes a mark. If you feel that doing anything else would be impossible, then cartooning might be the right job for you. But it’s a tough job, so be prepared for that.

Twenty years ago, I was moving house and throwing away a lot of old stuff, including an electric guitar that my dad had bought me for my 16th birthday. I felt sad that I was throwing away something that was important to me. I took the guitar to the rubbish dump and was about to put it on a pile of rubbish, when a young man came up to me and asked if I was going to throw it away. I said yes and he asked if he could have it. I gave it to him and felt sad that I had done something wrong.
A few months later, I received an email from a stranger who said he had found my guitar. I was surprised and happy to hear that my guitar had been found. I contacted the stranger and he offered to sell me the guitar back. I bought it back and felt like I had been given a second chance.
I started playing the electric guitar again and I felt like I was back in my teenage years. I remembered my parents presenting me with the guitar and I felt like I was playing it for them. I also remembered the feeling of playing the guitar when I was first learning. It was a lot of fun and I felt like I was a rock star."

There has been a lot of talk about sleep lately. Sleep is very important for our mental, physical, and social well-being. It seems that people who have the hardest time sleeping are the ones who most appreciate how important sleep is. Dreams are important too. They help us find new patterns and create combinations that break through our usual habits of thinking.
When you wake up in the morning, the sleep you sacrifice is mainly REM or 'Rapid Eye Movement', the most dream-rich stage of sleep. Our most vivid, memorable and emotionally powerful dreams occur mainly in the stage of REM just before we wake up in the morning.
Dreams are where we bring things together in fresh, often surprising ways. They draw on stores of knowledge from the past and present to find new associations. When people are awakened out of REM and asked to say what comes to their minds in response to a certain word, their responses are more original than when awoken from other stages of sleep."

It was twenty years ago that Susie Ray left London for a small coastal town in south-west England. She is a copyist artist who can reproduce the richness of an early-20th-century impressionist masterpiece as easily as the brilliance of a 16th-century Caravaggio portrait.
Susie has been in great demand since her 30 years as a copyist artist. She has painted the works of numerous great artists, including Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh. Her reproductions are so faithful that art experts mistake them for the originals.
However, Susie has always been open about what she does. When she reproduces an old masterpiece, she will make it look as authentic as possible. But she will put her own signature on the back of the canvas.
Susie has also been teaching younger painters. She stresses the importance of learning to draw and to represent things accurately. She also emphasises how much she’s studied to be able to do what she does."

He has already climbed five of the Seven Summits and might actually do it before his teenage years are over.
There are some concerns about taking a young climber up Everest. Many people think that a young climber might not be emotionally strong enough or have enough experience. But Jordan's parents believe that their own experience as climbers will help them guide their son safely.
Jordan is motivated by his goal and is focused on achieving it. He knows that he has to play the media game if he wants to inspire others. This means blogging, sitting for photo shoots and giving interviews. He has to offer something spectacular. Like climbing Everest."

When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, it's probably not classical music they're listening to. Most people our age can name a few pop groups, but few of us know who Brahms was. I have just started doing a music degree, but the people on my course know no more about classical music than anyone else our age. If you don’t know who wrote the music, you are unlikely to own any recordings of their work. The statistics are depressing for a lover of classical music. Apparently only a small percentage of concert tickets sold last year were for classical music events, and the average classical recording sells a small number of copies. I still find that hard to believe. So, what has caused this decline in interest for a type of music that has lasted for centuries? The simple truth is that classical music just doesn’t hold much attraction for most people, and that is particularly true of teenagers. There are a few reasons why teenagers don’t like classical music. First, the pace and rhythm of classical music are problematic for us. Second, pop music is structurally quite simple and therefore easy to listen to. Third, the subject matter of pop music is more appealing than a lengthy piece of classical music with no lyrics. Finally, the way we listen to music has changed. Nowadays, you can find any music you want at the click of a mouse, and yet the sound track to our lives is rarely classical."

Bonnie Wyndham got out of her mother’s car and looked at Almonside School. She was going to make her mother sorry she had come. Her mother was getting out of the other door at the time, so she didn’t overhear. The school was a funny place with lots of buildings and trees. There was a riding centre where Bonnie could see the horses. The horses were very well looked after. There was a lot of equipment for riding in the riding centre. Bonnie rode a horse named Maverick. She felt like a queen on a horse. She went round and round the paddock. The rhythm was exhilarating.

I met Cody Simpson before. He is a 15-year-old Australian singer who has released a number of successful songs. He started singing when he was seven years old. One day, he posted videos of himself singing on the internet. These videos changed everything. He began getting lots of comments from fans asking for more videos. So, he started recording more videos at home. The responses to his videos were overwhelming. He was a very talented swimmer, but he decided to focus on his music career. He moved to the US to pursue his dream. He is successful now, but he knows that his fame will not last forever.

I woke up early and looked at the river. The ice was shining in the sunlight. I worked hard last week and I proved that I was able to do the task. My grandfather didn’t notice. I saw a boy on the river bank trying to balance on an ice shelf. I was worried about him. I put on my wetsuit and jacket and went to the river. I found a lucky chain that my grandfather gave me.

Mum caught Jess by the arm and asked her to come with her to the study. There was a painting on the table, which was one of Grandpa’s. It was unlike anything he had done before and clearly nowhere near finished. Mum spoke again and said the painting had a name. There was something in her voice that betrayed her enthusiasm. Jess read the words Grandpa had scrawled on the painting. It was called 'River Boy.' The picture was strange and beautiful. There were no animals, no birds, no people. It felt right that way. There seemed no place for living things in this remote vision. Yet for some reason, Jess was captivated, thinking of the coming of autumn after a long, rich summer.

When I woke up this morning, I didn’t mean to damage the carpet. I was trying to find a way of fitting my corner cabinet into a corner. Gran had given me the cabinet when she moved out of her house into a flat. It’s really cute! I keep my collection of shells and fossils and interesting stones there.
The problem was, the cabinet was too tall to fit into the angle between the roof and the floor. If I could only slice a couple of centimetres off the bottom of it... That was when it came to me. If I couldn’t slice anything off Gran’s cabinet, how about cutting a hole in the carpet? It just seemed like the obvious solution. What Dad calls lateral thinking. I reckoned he would be quite pleased with me. He is always telling us to ‘think outside the box’. And that was exactly what I was doing!"

The novel 'The Borrowers' is about a family of tiny people who live hidden in the walls and floors of a house. They secretly borrow things from the normal-sized people in order to survive. When the author asked me to direct a TV adaptation of the novel, I knew it was going to be hard to live up to people’s expectations. The most crucial thing was getting the scale right. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans, so I had to make sure that the actors looked small. I also had to get the costumes right. The costumes were made out of heavy canvas material so that they stuck out in the way that dolls’ clothes do. Unfortunately, the weather was really hot during filming. Most of the action that takes place away from the Borrowers’ home had to be shot with the actors separated from their surroundings. We filmed them in front of a blue screen on an otherwise empty set. It was a challenge for them to react to things that weren’t physically there.

Mom pulls to a stop at the corner of my new school, Palm Grove High school. She looks around nervously, looking for journalists that aren’t there. I tell her everything is going to be fine. She kisses her fingertip and touches my cheek right before I get out of the car. Then she’s off, leaving me alone with this whole new school, whole new situation to deal with.
I walk in the school’s main office and get my schedule. English Literature, first period. Cool, I can deal with that. But I’m late. English is in Room 214, second floor. I studied the map the night before, as I didn’t want to look like a complete buffoon searching for my classes.
When I get to the door, I hear the teacher already taking roll. I slip in undetected and slide into the last desk in the second row. The girl next to me smiles. She scans over my very normal and, might I add, very clever outfit – jeans and a T-shirt. Ha! Nobody will ever suspect me now!
The teacher pauses in the roll taking. ‘Desert... McGraw?’ she says hesitantly. ‘Here.’ The teacher then smiles and introduces herself as Ms. Smigla. She talks a lot and eventually hands us our course outlines. After we review them and she tells us all about books we’re required to read this year, she actually gives us time to socialize!

In the United States, teenage girls are expected to be Student Council presidents and have part-time jobs, volunteer, and excel in all of these fields. Being an American teenager today is challenging. There are a lot of stresses that teenagers have, such as homework, tests, and extra-curricular activities. Many teenagers start their days early and end late, leaving them with little time for leisure activities.
Teenagers have a lot of responsibilities. They have to do their homework, take care of themselves, and help out at home. They also have to deal with the pressure of being constantly reachable. With the introduction of smart phones and social media, students can now take their work on the go and do their homework wherever they happen to be.
Despite the challenges, teenagers are still proving to be resilient and capable. Many teenagers are involved in volunteer work and are making a positive impact in their communities. There is evidence that teenagers are taking the world by storm and are forcing the world forward."

The teenage members of the Earth to Sky Calculus Club live in Bishop, a mountain town in the US, surrounded by wilderness. They have launched over fifty balloons to the edge of space. It's a long-running science project that includes astronomy experiments and backcountry adventures. I joined them one weekend in late spring. They were releasing a high-altitude balloon, hoping to record shooting stars.
As it got dark, the teenagers secured a soft insulated lunch box to the bottom of the balloon. Inside was a camera, an instrument to measure altitude, and a thermometer. Two GPS trackers were mounted on the outside of the lunch box to help the group find it later. They used a gas tank to inflate the balloon and watched it ascend.
After the launch, most of the students went home, but a few stayed to watch the shooting stars. They lay on blankets on the mountainside and gazed at a sky so clear, it was hard to believe you're just four hours from Los Angeles.
The recovery team found the lunch box the next day. It was in a canyon, high on a flat rock, in the middle of a cascading waterfall. The camera hadn't recorded any shooting stars. Sure, it's a bit of a disappointment, but it's also a perfect opportunity to argue over the effects of atmospheric waves, and how they might work above mountain ridges."

When you're travelling by car with your family, even when you're young, you know that you're not 'there yet,' even as you're asking over and over 'Are we there yet?' Once you get there, it's not 'there' anymore, it's 'here'. If you really think there's a chance that you're 'there' yet, you should be asking 'Are we here yet?'.
There are a lot of things to do on long car trips. You can watch DVDs, listen to music, or play puzzles. You can also act as co-pilot and help your parents keep the car running smoothly.
But sometimes, things don't go smoothly. Your sibling might put their foot on your side of the seat or hurl their whole body over into your space. If this happens, you might get angry and start fighting. But your parents will probably be there to help you calm down.
Over the years, your parents have developed strategies for dealing with kids on long car trips. One strategy is to answer the question 'Are we there yet?' with the answer 'No, you're not there yet.' Another strategy is to offer a reward for being quiet.
So once and for all, please note: if mum and dad are still near enough to answer your question, then the answer is: no. You're not there yet."

John and Zuzi Morgan have opened a café in Oxford, UK, where people can enjoy coffee, cake, and board games. They hope that people will enjoy the experience so much that they will want to repeat it. Zuzi explains why they decided to turn their love of tabletop games into a full-time business: 'There’s so much technology. Everybody’s busy on their mobile phones and other gadgets. We wanted to bring people back together in a way that’s not just staring at screens. It’s a natural thing in people. We're supposed to be together and communicating with each other.'
The games that are played in John and Zuzi's café are called Eurogames. They are known for their relatively gentle themes, such as farming and landscape-building. The first game of this type was The Settlers of Catan, which was created by a German designer. Pandemic, a Eurogame in which players must collaborate to solve global problems, was created by a North American, Matt Leacock.
The growth of the video games industry has also contributed to the success of these modern, ingeniously designed board games. Video games and board games have learned a lot from each other. As is evident in John and Zuzi's busy and popular café, tabletop gaming has become more than entertainment. In our increasingly online society, games have become something to be shared, directly and physically, in the real world."

Jamie Scott is a successful music writer and producer. He has written and produced some of the biggest UK hits of recent years. His story is about why endurance and persistence are essential in the music business.
Jamie was born into a family that loved music. His mother was an amazing singer, and he started playing the guitar at a young age. He was influenced by the local radio station that played middle-aged music. He started writing songs when he was 12 years old. At 17, he left school to try to make it as a performer. He was part of a duo with a friend who was a good guitarist. After a few near misses with record labels, he was signed to a music publisher. However, he had to split with his friend because record labels were only interested in him as a solo act.
Writing for others is where Jamie found his success. He has helped many artists to write and produce hit songs. He believes that writing with an eye on the charts is not something to be ashamed of. He is proud of his ability to write classic modern pop songs."

One of the most interesting developments in further and higher education in the UK has been a move to encourage novice students to become involved with research as early as possible. Research is not an exclusive activity for established scholars or scientists. It can also be seen as a natural and fundamental way to build knowledge and skills.
Research approaches and skills are useful not only in your studies but also in employment. They are ways of thinking about the world and going about your own work. As a student, you make a contribution to knowledge. You do not just digest and repeat it, you make it. Making knowledge is based on asking questions, rather than taking things for granted.
Most students have always been a researcher of sorts. You will have been carrying out some elements of research for projects and answered questions at school or in the workplace since your first few days there. You will also have been developing research and enquiry approaches and skills when exploring where to go on holiday, how to grow seeds successfully, how to fix things around the house, how to train your dog, how to find the right kind of music system, and how to buy the right kind of items for your needs online.
Critical thinking is particularly important in research. We need to be able not just to repeat what we’ve read and take everything in as if it was proven fact, but to engage with it, think about it, test it out, identify whether what we’re being told is presented in such a way as to trick us into agreement, or whether it is logical, reasoned and backed by evidence."

Cities have always been centers of intellectual life. They have also been places where people have faced challenges. The modern city is a place of creativity, but it is also a deeply unnatural and overwhelming place. Scientists have begun to examine how the city affects the brain, and the results are alarming. They have found that cities actually dull our thinking, sometimes dramatically so. One of the main forces at work is the lack of nature. Studies have shown that people who can see trees from their windows recover more quickly from illness. Even these fleeting glimpses of nature improve brain performance. The city is so overstuffed with stimuli that we need to continually redirect our attention. Natural settings, in contrast, don't require the same amount of cognitive effort. To improve cognitive performance, people should take walks in natural places."

The mind is a complex thing. It is often thought to be located inside people's heads. However, there is evidence to suggest that the mind is more than just the brain. Things and neurons also play a role in human cognitive life.
From the viewpoint of archaeology, it is clear that stone objects, body ornaments, engravings, clay tokens and writing systems play an active role in human evolution and the making of the human mind.
The mind and the brain became equated because most of what we know about the human mind has been uncovered through isolating people from the material culture they are usually surrounded by in order to study them.
However, this approach often goes unnoticed that much of our thinking takes place outside our heads.
The author's new theory, Material Engagement Theory (MET), explores the different ways in which things become cognitive extensions or are incorporated by the human body.
MET offers a new way of understanding how different forms of material culture, from the stone hand-axe to the latest smartphone, may have provided a powerful mechanism of defining, but also transforming, what we are and how we think."

Photography has significantly changed the course of civilization and the way we perceive the world. It has been especially impactful in the United States, where photography became part of the culture at all levels. Historians believe that photography is arguably the country’s greatest single contribution to the visual arts. It has moved to the centre of US intellectual and aesthetic discourse.
There are several reasons why photography was so appealing to the Americans. Firstly, it was a mechanical process that matched the growing enthusiasm for technology. Secondly, the camera was the perfect tool for representing oneself and showcasing individual and national identities. Thirdly, photography was a way of creating and sustaining an impression of self and family. Finally, the photograph’s inherent realism was aesthetically pleasing.
Photography has also been used by artists in a variety of ways. For example, Andy Warhol used photographs in his paintings, silk screens, and multiples. Artists have incorporated photographs into their work to express themselves creatively and to represent their ideas."

In 1890, William James defined psychology as the 'science of mental life.' It is a complex subject that studies the mind or brain. Although psychologists do study the brain, they do not understand nearly enough about its workings to be able to comprehend the part that it plays in the experience and expression of our hopes, fears, and wishes, or in our behaviour during experiences as varied as giving birth or watching a football match.
Psychology has the same goals as any other science: to describe, understand, predict, and learn how to control or modify the process that it studies. Psychological findings have been useful in fields as varied as developing more effective methods in teaching children to read, in designing control panels for machines that reduce the risk of accidents, and in alleviating the suffering of people who are emotionally distressed.
Although psychological questions have been discussed for centuries, they have only been investigated scientifically in the past 150 years. Early psychologists relied on introspection – the reflection of the individual’s own conscious experience – to find answers to psychological questions. Contemporary psychologists prefer to base their theories on careful observations of the phenomena in which they are interested, such as the behaviour of others rather than on reflections upon their own experience."

In a storehouse in a business park in Michigan, USA, there is a museum of failed products. The museum has a collection of products that were withdrawn from sale because nobody wanted to buy them. The proprietor of the museum, Carol Sherry, sees each product as embodying its own sad story. The museum is a viable, profit-making business. It is a testament to the fact that most products fail. The museum was started by a man named Robert McMath who intended to accumulate a reference library of consumer products. However, his collection ended up consisting mostly of unsuccessful products. The museum is a reflection of the culture of optimism that exists today. People often focus on the positive aspects of things and ignore the negative ones. This obsession with optimism is particularly prevalent in the self-help field. It is important to remember that failure is a natural part of life and that it can be used to learn and grow."

Everyone knows that sports teams have an advantage when they play at home. But does anyone know why? Most of us probably think we do; after all, it seems obvious. But professional sport is changing faster than at any time in its history and much of what we used to take for granted is now open to question.
There are two main reasons why home advantage exists. First, the home team has the advantage of playing in front of their own crowd. This can give them a boost of confidence and make them more likely to win. Second, the home team has the advantage of being able to control the playing conditions. This can also give them an edge in the game.
However, there are some changes that have recently occurred that have made home advantage less effective. For example, travel has become more convenient and the top grounds increasingly resemble one another. As a result, home advantage has declined in all major sports, but not by as much as one might expect.
One possible explanation for why home advantage varies depending on the sport is that it is primarily a team phenomenon. In team sports, winning ultimately hangs on all concerned being team players, which builds confidence in their ability to find each other on the court."

The more I practice, the luckier I get, said Gary Player. This quote is famous and is valued by athletes and their coaches. However, the meaning of the quote is not clear. Player didn’t literally mean lucky, he was speaking ironically. His real message was: ‘The more I practice, the better I get.’ Up to a point. Where that point is, is at the heart of the nature-nurture debate. The debate is about whether talent is born or acquired. There are different opinions on this topic. Some people believe that talent is born, while others believe that it is acquired through practice. However, there is no consensus on this issue. The most important thing is to practice. If you practice a lot, you will improve your skills."

A recent report found that many children living in wealthy countries feel lonely and unhappy. The reason for this is that these children have been spending too much time indoors, watching TV or playing on computers, and have lost contact with the natural world. This is a problem that has been discussed before, and many people talk nostalgically about their own childhood experiences. However, they rarely stop to reflect that they are the ones who have imposed that protective regime on their own children.
There are some good arguments in the book about the relationship between the fear of danger and child-focused consumerism. However, the author's tone is sometimes too extreme and she does not provide enough evidence to support her claims. For example, she argues that children need to have accidents in order to learn to avoid bigger accidents later. This is a dangerous and controversial idea. It is important to remember that children are not always capable of managing risk, and that we should not put them in situations where they are at risk of harm."

I am a research bio-psychologist with a PhD. I have done a lot of school and I am a good problem-solver. But most problems in life cannot be solved with a formula or memorised answers. They require the judgement, wisdom and creative ability that come from life experiences.
Play is the natural means by which adults and mammals have always educated themselves. It is also important for children's development. All mammals, including humans, play when they are young. Children, who have the most to learn, play far more than any other young primates when they are allowed to do so.
Play is voluntary, which means that players are always free to quit. If you can't quit, it's not play. School has become more onerous and adult-directed sports have replaced impromptu games. Our children don’t need more school. They need more play.

In many countries, there are a lot of young people in their twenties who use social media to find work. There are two popular social networking sites that are often used for job hunting: Twitter and LinkedIn. These sites offer the chance for direct contact with potential employers. However, with greater access comes a greater chance to make mistakes. For example, a young jobseeker in the US contacted a senior marketing executive via LinkedIn. The marketing executive was not impressed by the young jobseeker's message and sent a rude rejection note. This incident has made people think more carefully about how they use social media in a professional capacity.
There are a few things you need to do if you want to be successful on LinkedIn. First, you need to explain clearly who you are and what you have to offer.

If humans were truly at home under the light of the moon and stars, we would go in darkness happily. Instead, we are diurnal creatures, with eyes adapted to living in the sun’s light. We have engineered the night to receive us by filling it with light. This kind of control is no different from the feat of damming a river. Light pollution is largely the result of bad lighting design. It washes out the darkness of night, altering light levels and light rhythms to which many forms of life, including ourselves, have adapted.
Light pollution has a negative impact on various aspects of life. It affects migration, reproduction, feeding, and our biological well-being. Denying darkness is futile. It is as essential to maintaining our biological welfare as light itself. The regular oscillation of waking and sleep in our lives is nothing less than a biological expression of the regular oscillation of light on Earth. So fundamental are these rhythms to our being that messing with them is akin to altering our center of gravity.
Living in a glare of our own making, we have cut ourselves off from our evolutionary and cultural heritage – the light of the stars and the rhythms of day and night. In a very real sense, light pollution causes us to lose sight of our true place in the universe, to forget the scale of our being, which is best measured against the dimensions of a deep night with the Milky Way arching overhead."

A company recently announced that it would no longer track its employees’ paid holiday time. The founder of the company was inspired by an internet company that has instigated a similar policy. The company has 50,000 employees and provides a variety of services. The founder stated that employees may take as much leave as they want, as long as they feel comfortable that their absence will not damage the business. However, there are concerns about the practicality of this policy. For example, it could lead to increased guilt and stress for employees, which could in turn lead to a decrease in productivity. Additionally, it could lead to pressure from colleagues and office gossip concerning who was off when, and for how long. The policy could also make it difficult for employees to maintain a healthy work-life balance. Overall, the author remains doubtful as to whether being able to take as much holiday as you want is the true intention or the probable outcome of this policy."

Journal-based peer review is a process that ensures the quality of scientific research papers. It is often seen as a way to prevent the publication of flawed or nonsensical papers. However, the process can also be time-consuming, sometimes delaying the publication of a paper by a year. Preprints, which are drafts of papers that are posted online without having been peer reviewed, are a growing trend that is changing the way scientific papers are published. Preprints bring academics back to the core of research publication, which is the rapid dissemination of new results. They also make it easier for people to critique and discuss papers. Preprints have the potential to improve the scientific publishing process by increasing the visibility and impact of papers. They could also become an effective outlet for negative results.

When I ask my students what a poem is, they usually give me answers like 'a painting in words.' Their answers rarely satisfy me, or them. One day I asked a group to choose an object and write one paragraph describing it empirically, as a scientist might, and another in the first person, from the point of view of the item itself. The exercise led to much amusement and useful discussion.
A poem is a thing made. Poets sometimes compare poems to wild animals or machines. But such comparisons fall apart upon closer analysis. The most productive thing about trying to define a poem through comparison lies not in the comparison itself but in the debate. A poem is a product of writing and rewriting just like an article, story, or novel, yet it never really becomes what they usually are – a thing created in order to become a commodity.
A poem is a home for deep feelings, stunning images, tender reflections and/or biting wit. It can also be a source of inspiration and entertainment. Poems can make us see commonplace things in a new light and can reroute our patterns of thought."

Sleeping is one of my favorite travel pleasures. I sometimes feel a little guilty when I talk about it because I know that my friends have planned their trips very carefully. But I smile encouragingly and don't say much. When I travel, I like to sleep a lot. I often take naps under the hot Caribbean sun or relax in beautiful Italian sheets. When I visited Mexico's Yucatán coast, I was surprised by how much I slept. There were lots of noisy birds in the neighboring lot, but it didn't matter. I could plunge into a sleep that was more profound, dream-filled, and enjoyable than I imagined possible. Sleep is something else too: it's an experience that changes rhythm, sometimes dramatically, from place to place. People obsess about jet lag, but I suspect that the difficulties I experience recovering from long journeys have more to do with local and cultural adjustment than time zones. When I finally fall into the local sleep pattern, I feel I have truly arrived."

In the Red Bull Air Race, twelve pilots race through a series of pylons between 15 and 25 meters high. They negotiate sharp turns, barrel rolls and loops at speeds of up to 370 km per hour. I was invited to find out what it feels like to take part. I had to sign two forms before the flight. The first confirmed that I was in good health, the second that I would empty all my pockets. I also learned that I would have to try to stay orientated throughout the flight. I was told to relax and enjoy the view. Half an hour before the flight, I had a safety briefing in which I was told not to touch anything. By the time we were taxiing down the runway, I was ready to fly. I ignored all instructions received and would not relax and enjoy the flight. This is the cruel paradox of high-speed acrobatic flying. In order to survive it without passing out, you have to keep calm and focused. You have to tense up at the right time and you have to relax at the right time. Panicking is a bad idea. The flight was over in 10 minutes. It had been 'soft' compared to what the pilots endure when they race.

Doug Allan is a wildlife cameraman who films wild animals in cold places. He has filmed many major TV wildlife series. He says that his perfect temperature is -18C. Allan was trained as a marine biologist and commercial diver. Diving was his first passion, where he learned about survival in cold places.
One day, Allan was working in Antarctica when he was asked to film a wildlife documentary. He ended up taking the crew to different places and realized that being a wildlife cameraman ticked all the boxes: travel, adventure, underwater.
Allan says that wildlife filming is full of great successes, but also failures and embarrassments. He has seen a lot of amazing things, but he has also had some setbacks.
Now Allan would like to make his own film about climate change in the Arctic. He says he would be able to make an extraordinary documentary."

In 2004, Pen Hadow became the first person to trek to the North Pole alone and without being resupplied on the way. He made it to the South Pole as well. Now he is back in the Arctic again, preparing for an expedition he says is even more ambitious.
Pen is a skilled explorer. He has to be. This time, however, there is far more at stake. He will set out on a three-month, 1,000-kilometer trek to the North Pole, taking detailed measurements of the thickness and density of the ice. Nobody has ever done this before. The results of his expedition will be of vital importance to the scientific community.
Pen is married to Mary, a horsewoman, who says he has a ‘spine of steel’ and who shares his love of the outdoors. They live in the country with their two children.
Pen is going to be 47 on Thursday. He has done far less training than he’s comfortable with. Why? Because organizational things always seem more urgent.
Pen believes his mission reconnects exploration with the search for knowledge that drove previous generations into the unknown."

I had a break from my training. I was going to do something else. Being a successful Olympian is a great thing. I had the chance to do more writing and TV work, and to speak to businesses and schools. But there wasn’t anything on the horizon to get my competitive teeth into. I knew that I wished to stay in shape, so that I would be in a position to fight for an Olympic place if that dream reignited within me. So I entered marathons and triathlons. That should have been enough, but there was still the TV presenter Ben Fogle’s nagging invitation at the back of my mind. I spoke to some of my rowing colleagues about whether they fancied the race; I didn’t receive any enthusiastic responses. I knew that if I entered the race, even though it is billed primarily as an adventure, I would want to win. Would doing it with Ben give me the best chance of winning it? No. On the other hand, there was part of me that thought the chance to be an underdog with no pressure was appealing. I got in contact with Ben. We spoke about the remaining costs of the race. We felt we stood a better chance than most, but it would still take work to secure it. Of all the ways to earn money as a retired professional sportsman, speaking at business conferences is one of the most profitable. But I find it hard talking about something I’ve done without having another major goal. Participating in the race would mean I wouldn’t just be talking about past achievements. I’d actually be doing something again which I could bring in: rowing across the Atlantic. I learnt a lot while planning this adventure, but one of the biggest lessons was to be thankful for the easy life of a full-time athlete."

Last year, I went to the Arctic Circle in Finland to work with huskies. I was restless and dreamed of Arctic landscapes. I found a small company run by Anna and Pasi. They agreed to take me on as a husky dog handler for the winter season. From December to February, there is plenty of business taking tourists out on sled rides. The dogs are almost hysterical with excitement, straining against the ropes in their desperation to be off. I was able to join the team for three months. The work is very physical and the hours are long. But I am triumphant. I can chop with an axe, hammer a nail, and use a circular saw. 'In the snow.'

On that day, Radcliffe ran very fast and won the race. The press was there to make sense of her extraordinary run. Her time would have qualified her to compete in the men's marathon at the world championships in Paris. Journalists asked her about the benefits of emu oil, which Olympic gold medallist, Cathy Freeman, had recommended. Radcliffe feels that her achievement never really sank in. She was proud of her accomplishment and felt that it was what she was going to do that day.
During the race, her husband and coach, Gary Lough, was in a car with her support team, listening to the radio coverage. Her physiotherapist, Gerard Hartmann, was also there. After 16 kilometres, her agent questioned whether she could keep up such a pace. But Hartmann was not worried. He knew that Radcliffe was very fit and that she could finish the race.
Radcliffe finished the race in under 2 hours 16 minutes. She was very tired, but she was also very happy. She felt that she had accomplished her goal and that she would never forget that day.

When I first started a cookery programme called In Search of Perfection, I was not sure how it would be received. There had been a lot of talk about the food 'revolution' happening in Britain, and I was certain that we had produced a series of programmes that made a genuinely innovative contribution to that. I watched the first programme and was relieved that it was successful. The success of the show paved the way for other fascinating projects, including a book based on my experiences at the restaurant I own. In each project, there is a sense of being on a journey. I wrote several books in a series called 'Perfection', each one accompanying its own TV programme of the same name. In these books, the journey was often a very physical one, with passports and suitcases and itineraries. The latest book in the series is called In Search of Total Perfection. It is about meeting extraordinary artisans and exploring new foods. Despite the book's title, I knew from the outset that I wouldn’t be claiming the recipes were in any way 'definitive'. But I reckoned that, by using my technical skill and scientific knowledge, I could pin down some of the things that made these dishes work."

We were driving to Marrakech when the van broke down and crashed into a field. John got out and opened the bonnet. He stood there for a long time looking at the engine. He said, ""Actually, I haven’t a clue what I’m doing."" Bea was worried. She said, ""We can’t stay here forever."" The field was big. There was nothing much in it, just grass and flowers. We sat on the side of the road and watched John go away. Mum stretched out on the grass. She asked me to tell her a story. I told her about the birds I heard the day before we left London. The tea they brought was very sweet. We stayed at the café all day. When it began to grow dark, Mum made an open-air bed for us in the hotel garden. We slept soundly.

Lucy was talking to two other pianists at the Prague Classical Music Festival. They were older than her and good enough English speakers. They talked about the pieces they were playing, where else they’d travelled recently, and where they were going next. Lucy had not wanted to go to the festival, but she had made it. There had been a party and her dad bought her a white-gold necklace with an L pendant. Her little brother Gus got all caught up in imagining himself at the same festival one day. Grace Chang, her teacher, took Lucy out for a special dinner to strategize a repertoire.
The festival was important to Lucy because it was a chance for her to be somebody. Even if it meant certain people were jealous or thought she was too young to get the kind of attention she did. Being a concert pianist didn't win her any special respect from the kids she’d been at school with. Even her best friend, Reyna, didn't know and wouldn't care that she could nail a Rachmaninov allegro. But in places like this, she knew she mattered."

It's not good to spend too much time online. You need to get out into the real world, said Dad. He's difficult to argue with, so I decided to find out what people who have studied the subject say – and it’s quite interesting. Generally, research shows that most teenagers who use social media have a wide circle of real-life friends, a good sense of identity and belonging, and are developing the essential technical skills we need to be citizens of a digital age.
Social networking has become an integral part of modern childhood. Teenagers don’t consume media – dipping in and out to buy airline tickets or check e-mails as adults do – they inhabit it. It performs a similar function to hanging around at the youth club, as today’s parents used to do when they were younger.
Adolescence is a time when you are asking, who am I? Social networking can help you develop that self-identity. You can post notices about your favourite music or sports, discover what you enjoy, and you are constantly reminded that other people have different ways of looking at things.
Teenagers who use social networking as a creative force will reap the benefits when they become adults and enter the world of work. Collaboration is a real 21st-century skill, and an important part of being employable in a digital age."

When most people think of a family vacation, I guess a road trip through the western states in the US and Canada doesn’t come to mind. However, my parents clearly weren’t looking to put their feet up as they organized our summer vacation this year. My dad seemed to have taken it upon himself to plan the ultimate family bonding trip. We packed a lot of stuff into the car, including suitcases, coolers, and clothing. We set off on our journey and traveled for many miles. We stopped at a town in Oklahoma and learned the rule of the road: cattle get the right-of-way. We also visited a national park and saw a lot of bears. It was a memorable trip.

Rose Frost was sixteen years old and was going to live with her grandmother, Daisy. Her family was separating for two years. Her father had an assignment overseas, and her mother would be joining him, but Rose and her sister Amy were staying in England. Amy was completing her final school courses and would be living under the guardianship of the college Head. It was her last year at school so it would have been unfair on Amy to move. To Amy’s delight, she had been given the best room at the college, with its own kitchen and study area. The free access to the Internet and phone had also not gone unnoticed. Rose was moving to her grandmother’s house. It was only vague holiday memories that Rose recalled of her grandmother, and she had never known her grandfather. Her parents had not been enthused by the idea of her living with her grandma, but Daisy had insisted that it was no trouble. Rose was sensible and very mature for her age. She knew about healthy eating, about keeping fit, and getting enough sleep. But this time Rose had insisted on one thing: she wanted her independence. Living with Daisy would be fulfilling all her needs. But Rose wanted to play music loud if she wanted, and to invite friends over or go out without having to ask permission every time. Surely she could be trusted to do these small things now?

Charlotte Grainger was inspired to write a novel by her primary school teacher. When she was 13, she started writing a novel that is now being published. She feels that her age shouldn't limit her ability to write. The book is a huge achievement and it is well-written. It is about a teenager who takes responsibility for her actions. Charlotte has a theory about teenagers and the way they are portrayed in fiction. She believes that there are three types of teenagers in novels: the outsider, the naïve teenager, and the awkward teenager. She also believes that teenagers can't possibly know who they are because they're not experienced enough to know the truth.

Our instructor, Gareth, told us that speed is our friend, not our enemy. We looked down the ski slope and saw David, who had some experience, skiing off down the slope towards the jump. He hit the approach ramp fast and flew upwards, arms flailing in the air. Something was wrong and we held our breath. He hit the ground and flipped head-first into the snow. Gareth informed us that speed is an unpredictable beast. I had enjoyed messing about on previous skiing holidays, but I wasn’t one of those teenagers who spent their time doing freestyle tricks on ramps and half pipes. I thought it would be fun to try, but I knew I didn’t have the skills to do it. My parents decided to have a winter holiday at a training centre for freestyle skiing in the US. We practised our moves indoors and then headed outside to try them for real. There were more setbacks before I finally landed properly. But I was delighted to have achieved such an elusive goal.

Imagine you're on a rollercoaster in an amusement park. You come to a stop and inhale sharply before the carriage moves slowly upwards. A pause. Then a sharp drop and your stomach is suspended in the air. You hurtle quickly forwards, sharply left, then upside down. Your senses are a blur, you let out a roar of fear that comes from the pit of your gut.
Amusement parks are a huge industry that delivers thrills and escape from reality. To create the perfect ride, there are teams of highly inventive engineers and designers. It's a big challenge to create the perfect balance of pleasure and fear while ensuring that passengers are safe.
The teams behind rollercoasters must piece together a strong narrative, be it a space adventure or a high-paced chase in the jungle, that works with any innovations to create a seamless experience. However, in the end, gut instincts, years of experience and trial-and-error are what work."

At 25, Miranda Ellington has achieved a lot as a choreographer. She creates works for many theatres and dance companies. She also dances from time to time. She is busy, but she enjoys her work.
As a choreographer, Miranda is in a teaching role. She likes working with young students. They are receptive to exploring new ideas. They are hungry for success, but they don’t yet have a clear sense of their strengths and weaknesses.
When Miranda starts working with a new group, she concentrates on the dance steps and the music dictates what she does. If dancers aren’t responding well to a particular composer’s music, that can be frustrating, but she still has to find solutions.
Miranda doesn’t believe in attaching herself to one institution. She has to be prepared to adapt the way she works each time she goes somewhere new.
The conversation turns to the recent documentary on professional ballet dancers and choreographers. The documentary is accurate and shows the hard work and dedication involved in ballet.
Miranda has done a range of work, so I wonder how she sees herself: is she a modern dance choreographer or a ballet specialist? She says she doesn’t like to be labeled."
