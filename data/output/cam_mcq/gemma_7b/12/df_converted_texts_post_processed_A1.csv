Some time ago, there was a website that talked about the dangers of sharing information online. The website said that if you share information about yourself online, it can be seen by people you don't know. This made people think about the downsides of sharing information on the internet.
There are a lot of new opportunities to share information online. You can share photos, stories, and personal information. But you should be careful because the water in the digital world is crowded and treacherous.
In the early days of the internet, there were people who started sharing their lives online. They called themselves bloggers. They wrote about their experiences, their thoughts, and their feelings. Some people liked what they wrote, but others didn't.
One day, a woman named Heather Armstrong was writing a blog about her job. An anonymous person sent the address of her blog to her boss. As a result, she lost her job. This is called the 'online distribution effect'.
We can all learn from Heather Armstrong's story. If you share information online, you should be careful about what you say. The internet is a powerful tool, but it can also be dangerous."

A long time ago, some scientists started a campaign to warn people about a movie called What the Bleep Do We Know? which showed that there is a lot about the universe that we don’t understand. The movie was very interesting, but it didn’t have much evidence to support its claims. Some people thought that the movie was dangerous and should not be seen. Others thought that it was a must-see movie. I couldn’t see what all the fuss was about at first, but when the movie moved on to describe some of the discoveries, I started to see what the fuss was really about. One of the discoveries was that water molecules can be affected by thoughts. This is a very amazing claim, but it doesn’t have much evidence to support it. Before we get too excited, we need to have some decent proof that the effect is real. The movie’s claims were not bizarre enough. They were too easy to believe. If the movie had made more outrageous claims, it would have been more interesting."

I find writing novels a challenge, and writing short stories a joy. Writing novels is like planting a forest, and writing short stories is more like planting a garden. The two processes complement each other, creating a complete landscape that I treasure.
I write short stories because they are quick and easy to write. It generally takes me about a week to get a short story into some kind of decent shape. You can create a story out of the smallest things, and you don’t have to worry about failing.
My short stories are like soft shadows I have set out in the world, faint footprints I have left behind. I remember exactly where I set down each and every one of them, and how I felt when I did. Short stories are like guideposts to my heart, and it makes me happy as a writer to be able to share these intimate feelings with my readers."

Science is a powerful force that has improved our lives and threatened our existence. It has made it easier for us to understand the world around us and has also led to many new inventions. Science has also been used to treat diseases and to help us learn more about ourselves.
Science is not always easy to understand. Sometimes scientists disagree with each other about the best way to explain things. But even when scientists disagree, they are still working together to learn more about the world.
Science has also been used to control the world. In the last two centuries, we have moved from being simply observers of nature to being, in a modest but growing way, its controllers. Concomitantly, we have occasionally disturbed the balance of nature in ways that we did not always understand. Science has to be watched. Non-scientists can no longer afford to stand to one side, ignorant of the meaning of advances that will determine the kind of world that their children will inhabit – and the kind of children that they will have."

From around 2015, books sales started to decline. This made people question the future of ebooks. Some people thought that ebooks would kill print books. But this is not true. Digital and print books can coexist in the market. The idea of the disappearing book is powerful because it tells us about our fears and hopes for the future. It also tells us about our connection to technology. As technology changes, we often feel like we are losing things that we used to have. This is why entire industries develop around retro products and older technologies. For example, people who like reading books often buy old books or e-readers. This should provide some reassurance to those who still worry about the disappearance of print books."

Every day, I wake up early, brush my teeth, and make coffee. I write about how some of the greatest minds of the past made the time each day to do their best work. I also write about my own daily routines and how they help me to be creative and productive.
I have a lot of concerns about creative work and earning a living. I struggle with how to do meaningful creative work while also earning a living. I also wonder if it is better to devote yourself wholly to a project or to set aside a small portion of each day.
I have tried to provide examples of how a variety of brilliant and successful people have confronted similar challenges. I wanted to show how grand creative visions translate to small daily increments; how one’s working habits influence the work itself, and vice versa.
This book is about my daily routines and how they help me to be creative and productive. It is also about the challenges of creative work and earning a living. I hope that this book will inspire you to think about your own daily routines and how they can help you to be more creative and productive."

Charles Spence is a professor of experimental psychology at Oxford University in the UK. He has studied how the senses interact to form our perception of flavour. Through his studies, he has influenced what we eat and drink. He has also studied how food is experienced with others.
Spence has written a book called The Perfect Meal, which is packed with insights that are fascinating to anyone in possession of an appetite. It includes information about how much we eat when eating with others.
Spence's lab is un-space-age. It has soundproof booths and stacks of ancient-looking audio-visual equipment. He can afford to work more creatively with cooks because he keeps his overheads low.
Spence is currently helping famous brands through reductions in salt and sugar. He points out that it is in their interests to help loyal customers stay alive for longer."

Our brains are very busy these days. We have a lot of information to deal with, including facts, rumors, and things that are not true. We also do more things than ever before. Thirty years ago, people used to make our airline reservations and help us find what we needed in shops. Now we do most things ourselves. We have smartphones that help us do all this. But there’s a problem with multitasking. It makes us less efficient. Multitasking can increase the production of stress hormones and make it harder to focus. It also makes it harder to make decisions. We can end up making truly bad decisions about something important. To make matters worse, multitasking requires a lot of decision-making. It turns out that making lots of small decisions takes up a lot of brain resources. We rapidly spiral into a depleted state in which we can end up making truly bad decisions about something important."

In a zoo in Sweden, a chimpanzee named Santino spent his nights breaking up concrete into pieces. Was he being spiteful? In caves in the US, female bats help unrelated fruit bat mothers if they can’t find the right birthing position. Are they being caring? Fifty years ago, people thought that animals had behaviours that produced measurable outcomes, and science recorded those outcomes. But recently that has partially changed. Thanks to research into the behaviour of bats, chimps, and other animals, emotions of animals have gone from being a taboo area of investigation to being tentatively explored. The new research has started a debate about whether animals can be said to have consciousness and conscience. If animals do have consciousness, what does it mean for the production and consumption of beef? The observations may not be disputed, but the interpretation of them is.

Critical thinking is a way of understanding and interacting with what we read or listen to. It helps us to have a deeper understanding of the text or information. There is a belief that argument is a way of finding the truth. Although there’s little debate that information technology complements and often enhances the human mind, there’s increasing concern that the same technology is changing the way we approach complex problems and making it more difficult to really think.
Reading enhances thinking and engages the imagination in a way that visual media such as video games and television do not. It develops imagination, induction, reflection, and critical thinking, as well as vocabulary. However, visual media actually improve some types of information processing.
Many people – particularly those who are younger – wind up underachieving and not making the most of their capabilities. How society views technology has a great deal to do with how it forms perceptions about critical thinking."

When Matthew Crawford is not writing or thinking about how we ought to live, he works as a motorcycle mechanic. He wrote two books about the benefits of manual trades and philosophy. One of his books is about how to cope with modernity. He was inspired to write it when he was shopping and noticed that advertisements popped up on the credit card machine. He realized that these demands on our attention were becoming increasingly difficult to avoid.
Crawford says that we are being prevented from deciding what we want to be at the forefront of our mind by something that we are not aware of. It is becoming more and more difficult to think or spend time remembering conversations we’ve had. And because everyone is trying to protect themselves from the irritation of constantly being interrupted, we close ourselves off and no longer want to do simple things like chat to strangers.
Crawford's proposed solution has two parts. First, we need regulation of noise and distraction in public space. More importantly, though, Crawford advocates skilled practices as a way of engaging with the world in a more satisfying way."

What do you do for a living? It's a common question. If you're a philosopher, it's a little harder to answer. Philosophers are no different from the masses, but the idea that they have access to some mystical truth or enlightenment above one’s fellows is a misconception. One reason is that philosophers have established themselves as people who judge the activities of others and celebrate intellectual life. Another reason is that the field of ethics has colloquially come to refer to applied ethics – a subfield that explores the justice of particular social practices.

Foodies, gourmands, chefs and others who love food might expect that thinking about food can contribute to culinary pleasure. However, philosophical discussions of food have mostly been about other topics, such as knowledge or pleasure. Sometimes, philosophical conversations about food appear to be about other things, but further examination reveals that they explore deeper points. It is interesting to note the case of the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus, who advocated for the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain. Food is also social and cultural. It is shared with those in our communities and provides us with dining companions and infrastructure. Ethical issues related to food include what we should eat and the extent to which cooking in restaurants and the home differ. Cooking in the home is more inclusive, while cooking for a living has different obligations. Food and dining can also play a role in bridging cultural gaps.

Rob Daviau is a designer of legacy board games. He felt that the traditional board games he had played as a child were no longer entertaining or challenging enough. So, he started to wonder how board games might evolve. Could they have a storyline? Could decisions made in one session carry over into another? He adapted a classic board game called Risk and created a new version called Risk Legacy. Unlike previous board games, decisions made during gameplay had a permanent impact. Players might have to rip up cards, deface the board, or at key moments open packets containing new rules. The games play out over the course of a fixed number of sessions and long-held grudges become woven into the fabric of the game.
Legacy board games were never expected to go mainstream. Nevertheless, most players, like Russell Chapman, loved the concept. They see it as one of the biggest advances in game design for several years. The legacy format draws not only on video games but also the demand for episodic entertainment fuelled by popular TV series."

Once upon a time, there was an octopus named Inky who lived in New Zealand. One night, Inky escaped from his tank and went to the ocean. It was a story that was shared online. The story is fun because it is about animals being like humans. Octopuses are very smart creatures. They can open jars, recognize faces, and use coconut shells as armor. They can also play with other animals.
However, some people think that anthropomorphism is not scientific. They believe that animals are not as smart as humans. This is called anthropodenial. Dr. Frans de Waal is a scientist who studies primates. He says that anthropodenial is not true. He says that animals have many of the same skills as humans, such as the ability to think about the past and the future, to demonstrate empathy, and to anticipate the motives of others.
De Waal believes that we are emerging from a dark period where we thought that animals were not as smart as humans. He says that the times are changing and that everyone is learning to appreciate animal intelligence."

Once upon a time, there was a technology called robotics that has the potential to change the world. Robots have already been used in factories and cars for many years. Now, experts are saying that robots will soon be used in many other places.
Many people believe that robots will take over their jobs. However, this is not true. Robots can do some things that humans can do, but they cannot do everything. They also need human help to service and program themselves.
The development of robotics is creating new jobs. For example, there will be more jobs for technicians and programmers. However, there will also be fewer jobs for lower-skilled workers.
In order to prepare for the future of work, we need to invest in education and training programs. We also need to develop new regulatory frameworks to ensure our safety and privacy."

Because there is a place where climbers can climb, the mountaineer George Mallory said that he wanted to climb Mount Everest. People have a desire to understand why anyone would participate in such a dangerous activity. Climbing can give people a feeling of freedom, but it can also be very confining. There is an apparent paradox in many forms of climbing. Climbing can also help cultivate important virtues such as courage, humility and respect for the environment.
When asked why people climb, US rock climber Joe Fitschen argues that climbing is in our genes. It is inherent in our basic makeup to take on challenges and test limits. Climbing also serves a certain practical value – it may help develop the traits and virtues that allow one to flourish and live well in our non-climbing world."

My Granddad's garden was a beautiful place. It was on the bank of a river and sloped gently down towards the water. You couldn't reach the river but you could hear the sound of the water and the birds that sang in the trees above. I imagined that all gardens were like this – a place of escape, peace and solitude.
My Dad was a quiet and withdrawn person. He had a lot of phrases that he liked to use, one of them being 'It's immaterial to me'. He was probably disappointed that he hadn't made more of his life. He left school without qualifications and became apprenticed to a plumber. It wasn't something he was passionate about.
I always wanted to like the piano but it did its best to intimidate me. The only thing I did like about it were the two brass candlesticks that jutted out from the front. I'd walk along the river bank looking for a suitable spot where I could take off the painful sandals and leave them with my picnic while I ventured out, tentatively, peering through the water for any fish that I could scoop up with the net and take home.
One day my father announced, 'They've got a vacancy for an apprentice gardener in the Parks Department. I thought you might be interested.' In one brief moment Dad had gone against his better judgement. He might still have preferred it if I became a carpenter. But I like to feel that somewhere deep down inside him was a feeling that things might just turn out for the best. If I stuck at it."

It was because of Sam Carter that we were living at Reef Point. Sam was my father’s agent in Los Angeles. He offered to find somewhere cheap for us to live. The beach had been deserted since the warm weather had been blanketed by sea fogs. Reef Point was seldom patronised by the casual day tripper. There were a lot of people at the beach. My father was hard at work trying to write a script to a deadline. I moved out onto the beach, taking a book to read, and Rusty for company. Rusty was my dog. We had a lot of fun playing together. Sometimes though, there were things that he had obviously not dug up – a new sneaker, a bright beach-towel. We had been swimming that day. The sun was setting and it was getting cooler. We sat watching the surfers. They were having a lot of fun. One surfer in particular caught my eye. She had a style that made all the others look like clumsy amateurs.

Maier was born in 1926 and spent much of her childhood in France. She returned to New York in 1951 and came to Chicago in 1956 to work as a nanny. Maier was a private person but she had a strong interest in photography. She always had a camera with her and took pictures of people, children, and the poor.

When a novel is described as ambitious, it usually means that it is not successful. However, this is not the case with Eleanor Catton’s book, The Luminaries. The book is set during the 1860s in New Zealand. There has been a series of crimes committed, and a council of 12 men has convened to solve them. The plot is complex. Catton said she set out to write a murder mystery, not a historical novel, but found the past offered more opportunities for complications and misunderstandings for her characters to deal with. The book is long, but it is also exciting and fun to read. Catton is a talented writer who is passionate about her craft and her home country of New Zealand."

Any conversation about English conversation, like any English conversation, usually starts with the weather. It is a traditional thing to talk about the weather when you meet someone. It is also a way to start a conversation and make people feel comfortable.
There are three specific contexts in which people talk about the weather in English. They can use it as a simple greeting, as an ice-breaker leading to conversation on other matters, or as a default topic when conversation on other matters dries up.
It is easy to see why people of other nationalities, and even many English commentators, have assumed that English people must be obsessed with the subject."

The silence on Centre Court at the Wimbledon tennis championships is very quiet. You can bounce the ball up and down on the grass, toss it up to serve, and hit it.

A young Englishwoman named Jane Goodall arrived in Africa in early 1957. She spent most of her life in Africa and became known for her work on chimpanzees. She wrote a book about her research called ""In the Shadow of Man."" It is still popular today. Jane Goodall helped create a new way to study animals. She also helped change the way humans think about themselves.
There are some things that we learned from Jane Goodall's work. First, we learned that chimpanzees eat meat. Second, we learned that chimpanzees create and use tools. Third, we learned that chimpanzees share with humans a similar set of emotions. Fourth, we learned that chimpanzee communities across Africa possess various distinctive cultural traditions.
Jane Goodall's work has been praised by many scientists. She is considered one of the greatest biologists of all time. Even as a child, there were some early indicators of the person Jane Goodall would become. One day, she crawled inside a henhouse to find out how hens lay eggs.

It was twenty years ago that Susie Ray left London for a small coastal town in south-west England. She has a studio with a beautiful sea view. There are a lot of empty frames hanging on the walls, between photographs of her two daughters. Susie is a copyist artist who can reproduce the richness of an early-20th-century impressionist masterpiece as easily as the brilliance of a 16th-century Caravaggio portrait.
She has painted the works of numerous great artists, including Renoir, Monet and Van Gogh. Her reproductions are so faithful that art experts mistake them for the originals. Her clients include galleries and private collectors. Some collectors save on house insurance by storing the original in a bank safe and displaying Susie’s copy.
Susie has always been open about what she does. She believes doing it badly would be letting the artist down. She also puts her own signature on the back of the canvas. She has no regrets about having done it, but she’s glad she eventually found something more rewarding financially."

Jordan Romero is 13 years old and wants to be the youngest person to climb Mount Everest. If he succeeds, he could become one of the most famous teenagers of his generation. Young people are spending more time on computers and games consoles, so Jordan hopes to inspire kids to climb their own mountains. He has already climbed five of the Seven Summits and might actually do it before his teenage years are over.
There are some people who think that taking a young climber up the world’s highest mountain is a bad idea. They say that a young climber might have the necessary physical strength, but they doubt whether a teenager would be emotionally strong enough. And they couldn’t see how a young person could have gained enough experience to develop the good judgment and reactions a climber must have in order to take part in such a project safely.
But Jordan’s parents believe that their own experience as climbers will help. They weigh up the risks all the time, but they think that their son is strong and mature enough to handle the challenge. And Jordan himself is motivated by his goal. He says, ‘I just focus on achieving my goal.’

When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, it's probably not classical music they're listening to. Most people can name a few pop groups, but not many know who Brahms was. If you don't know who wrote the music, you are unlikely to own any recordings of their work. Classical music just doesn’t hold much attraction for most people, and that is particularly true of teenagers. There are a few reasons why teenagers don’t like classical music. First, the pace and rhythm of classical music are not easy for us to listen to. Second, classical music is not structurally simple like pop music. Third, the subject matter of classical music is not as appealing to teenagers as pop music. Finally, the way we listen to music has changed.

Bonnie Wyndham got out of her mother’s car and looked at Almonside School. She was going to make her mother sorry she had come. Her mother was getting out of the other door at the time, so she didn’t overhear. Bonnie was going to the riding centre. There was a nice old building where the horses were kept. The horses were very well looked after. Bonnie treated horses with respect. She rode a horse named Maverick. It was a brown horse with a touch of white. The horse was lively and Bonnie liked that. She rode the horse around the paddock. The rhythm was exhilarating.

I met Cody Simpson before. He is a 15-year-old Australian singer. He has already released a number of successful songs. One day, he started posting videos on the internet. These videos changed everything. He began to get a lot of fans. He was very talented at swimming and surfing. But he decided to focus on his music career. He moved to the US to pursue his dream. He is successful now. He says that success comes from a willingness to say 'yes' to your big break, even when it's a little scary to do so.

I woke up and looked at the river. The ice was shining in the sunlight. I put on my wetsuit and went kayaking. I saw a boy on the river. He was trying to balance on an ice shelf. I was worried about him. I went to the kitchen and got a banana. My mom smiled at me. She said, ""Have a good session, Rex. I admire your determination to keep it up, even on these cold days!"" I smiled back at her. I ate my banana and went downstairs. I stepped into the backyard and hurried towards the boathouse.

Mum caught Jess by the arm and asked her to come with her to the study. There was a painting on the table. It was one of Grandpa’s, but it was unlike anything he had done before. Mum spoke to Jess about the painting and asked her if she knew anything about it. Jess said she had never seen it before. The painting was strange and beautiful. There was a river in the picture. The riverbank was green. There were no animals or people in the picture. Jess felt that the painting was complete. Mum spoke again and said the painting had a name. The name was 'River Boy'. The painting was special to Jess because it was her Grandpa's painting.

When I woke up this morning, I didn't mean to damage the carpet. I was trying to find a way of fitting my corner cabinet into a corner. Gran had given me the cabinet when she moved out of her house into a flat. It's really cute! I keep my collection of shells and fossils and interesting stones there.
My bedroom is small and cosy. It's like a nest. The only problem is, the lack of corners. My bed is in one, and my wardrobe in the other. I'd tried fitting Gran’s cabinet into the angle between the roof and the floor, but it was just the tiniest little bit too tall. If I could only slice a couple of centimetres off the bottom of it... That was when it came to me. If I couldn’t slice anything off Gran’s cabinet, how about cutting a hole in the carpet? It just seemed like the obvious solution.

The novel 'The Borrowers' is about a family of tiny people who live hidden in the walls and floors of a house. They borrow things from the normal-sized people in order to survive. When the author asked me to direct a TV adaptation of the novel, I knew it was going to be hard to live up to people’s expectations. The most important thing was getting the scale right. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans, so I had to make sure that the actors looked small. I also had to get the costumes right. The costumes were made out of heavy canvas material so that they stuck out in the way that dolls’ clothes do. Unfortunately, the weather was really hot during filming. Most of the action that takes place away from the Borrowers’ home had to be shot with the actors separated from their surroundings. We filmed them in front of a blue screen on an otherwise empty set. It was a challenge for them to react to things that weren’t physically there."

Mom pulls to a stop at the corner of my new school, Palm Grove High school. She looks around nervously, looking for journalists that aren’t there. I tell her everything is going to be fine. She kisses her fingertip and touches my cheek right before I get out of the car. Then she’s off, leaving me alone with this whole new school, whole new situation to deal with.
I walk in the school’s main office and get my schedule. English Literature, first period. Cool, I can deal with that. I’m late, though. English is in Room 214, second floor. I hear the teacher already taking roll and slip in undetected. The girl next to me smiles and I give her a fake smile. She scans over my very normal and, might I add, very clever outfit – jeans and a T-shirt. Ha! Nobody will ever suspect me now!
The teacher pauses in the roll taking and smiles at me. She introduces herself as Ms. Smigla and gives us our course outlines. After we review them and she tells us all about books we’re required to read this year, she actually gives us time to socialize. All teachers should realize the importance of this."

In the United States, teenage girls are expected to be Student Council presidents and have part-time jobs, volunteer, and excel in all of these fields. Being an American teenager today is challenging. There are a lot of stresses that teenagers have, such as homework, tests, and extra-curricular activities. Many teenagers start their days early and end late, and they often don't get enough sleep.
Teenagers have a lot of responsibilities. They have to do their homework, take care of themselves, and help out at home. They also have to deal with the pressure of being constantly connected to the world. With the introduction of smart phones, tablets, and social media, students can now take their work on the go with them and do their homework wherever they happen to be.
Despite the challenges, teenagers are still proving themselves to be capable and ambitious. They are taking the world by storm and making a positive impact in their schools and communities."

The teenage members of the Earth to Sky Calculus Club live in Bishop, a mountain town in the US. They have launched over fifty balloons to the edge of space. It's a long-running science project that includes astronomy and adventure. I joined them one weekend to release a high-altitude balloon. They secured a lunch box to the balloon and put a camera, an instrument to measure altitude, and a thermometer inside. They also put two GPS trackers on the outside of the lunch box. They used a gas tank to inflate the balloon and finally, it was time for lift-off. The balloon rose into the sky and the students watched it go. After the launch, some of the students stayed to watch the shooting stars. They lay on blankets on the mountainside and gazed at the sky. There was a meteor shoot across the middle of the sky and a balloon popped in a dramatic explosion. The students will find the lunch box the following day. It was in a canyon, high on a flat rock, in the middle of a cascading waterfall.

Chloe Morgan loves science, especially Palaeontology. She started to be interested in Palaeontology when she was fifteen. She was inspired by her younger brother's interest in dinosaurs. She also found an article about recent discoveries in the field. She knew that this was something she wanted to commit herself to.
One day, Chloe met a professional palaeontologist named Matt Cornelius. He was famous already, despite being quite young. Chloe was nervous at first, but she felt more at ease when he showed so much patience and willingness to listen.
Dinosaurs continue to fascinate us because they speak to the innate explorer in all of us. They are also a great form of time travel.

When you travel by car with your family, even when you're young, you know that you're not 'there yet.' Once you get there, it's not 'there' anymore, it's 'here.' If you really think there's a chance that you're 'there yet,' you should be asking 'Are we there yet? ' And the mums and dads fielding that question over and over every single long car trip.
If you're travelling by car with your family, you can have a lot of fun. You can watch DVDs, listen to music, or play puzzles. You can also act as co-pilot in the passenger seat, map in hand. The driver and co-pilot will keep everything running smoothly and be the on-the-road concierge.
But sometimes, things can go wrong. For example, your sibling might put their foot on your side of the seat or hurl their whole body over into your space. If this happens, you might get angry and yell at your sibling. But don't worry, the driver and co-pilot will help you. They will separate you from your sibling and tell them to stay in their own seat.
So, if you're travelling by car with your family, make sure to ask 'Are we there yet?' and enjoy the ride!"

John and Zuzi Morgan have a café in Oxford, UK, where people can enjoy coffee, cake, and play board games. They decided to turn their love of tabletop games into a full-time business because there is so much technology and people are busy on their mobile phones and gadgets. The games played in their café are called Eurogames. They are known for their gentle themes and easy rules.
There are two main types of Eurogames: co-operative and competitive. Co-operative games are where everyone wins or loses as a team, while competitive games are where players compete against each other. Pandemic is a popular Eurogame that is known for its storytelling ability. It is similar to an electronic game in that you develop your characters, you get new rules and the state of the world changes.
The growth of the video games industry has also contributed to the success of Eurogames. Video games and board games have learned a lot from each other. Now there are more people who are open to the idea of playing games than ever before. Tabletop gaming has become more than entertainment. It has become something to be shared, directly and physically, in the real world."

He was influenced by his mother, who was a singer, and the local radio station he heard in his house. At 17, he left school to try to make it as a performer. He was part of a duo with a friend, but they had to split up when the record labels were only interested in him as a solo act. In the end, it was behind the scenes rather than on stage where he would make his name. He wrote songs for other artists and became one of the main writers in the UK.

Television presenter Helen Skelton has completed many dangerous challenges for charity. She has run a desert marathon and journeyed down the Amazon river in a small boat. For her latest challenge, Helen walked on a high wire, a long thin piece of metal, high above the ground. There was no safety net, only a belt around her waist attached to another wire above. To help her keep her balance and not to fall, she carried a long stick. Helen took lessons from an expert high-wire walker. Although she already had a few circus skills, she quickly discovered that high-wire walking was completely different. The training was hard. Every day started at 8 am with a run up a steep hill; then came an hour of exercises, with another hour of them after her day practising on the wire. Every time she fell on the wire it hurt badly, but she kept a positive attitude. The day of the actual challenge was windy and Helen controlled herself by taking deep breaths as she moved step by step along the wire. The walk took 15 minutes.

I work at a university where my team and I are learning more about water birds, particularly one called the American black duck. We have started using a new piece of equipment called a night-vision scope, which allows us to see the ducks in the dark. We are worried about black ducks mainly because their numbers have fallen hugely. We haven’t had much information about what they do at night, because we simply haven’t had the equipment. But this new ‘scope’ will produce really clear pictures, even on moonless nights, so we’ll be able to find out more and make better decisions about looking after the area where they live based on what we learn. It is very hard work. There are four of us, each working six hours daily. We have studied ducks in different locations, and I have had to take a boat to some sites and make notes on every duck I see. The weather hasn’t helped – some nights are mild, but more often it’s wet. Oh, and it’s so quiet I’ve needed lots of coffee to stop me falling asleep! We’ve only missed one working day so far, because the snow was too deep even for our special snow vehicles. Still I like the challenge of it, especially compared to what the summer will bring – hours in a laboratory, where we’ll look at our results together. It’ll be hard to be stuck inside – but it’s essential to do this. And I wouldn’t change it for anything!

I work as a chocolate taster. I spend my days tasting chocolate and making sure that customers get perfect bars of high-quality chocolate. Every week I receive samples of chocolate from our factory and I have to taste them to see if they are perfect. I also have to taste the raw materials we usually use – the nuts, fruit and so on. I spend days choosing the most suitable ones to go into the chocolate. I have a kitchen where I can test and taste products I make. It’s wonderful to have a private space I can go off to during the day. No two days are the same in this job. Sometimes I am at our food lab and others I’m out of the country buying our raw materials. But that kind of variety, and lack of routine, is something I love about the job.

She says her course is popular because it includes many skills, such as juggling, throwing and catching things, trapeze, and business planning. On the year-long course, students gradually increase the amount of risk they take in each class and parents come along to certain classes to watch progress.
The course also covers business planning. Many previous students set up businesses all over the world, and are happy to share their experiences. Sophia warns, however, it’s not a profession for making money!"

When Vicky Harmiston was a child, her parents gave her and her brother Jamie the freedom to decide what they did in their spare time. Vicky chose to do lots of different sports. She was a good swimmer, and the coach at the swimming club she went to thought she might be good enough to become a champion. But the club was a long way from her home so it was difficult for her to fit in the training around her schoolwork. When they were teenagers, Jamie, who loved cycling, bought himself a special track racing bike and started taking part in competitions. Vicky thought it looked very exciting and decided to try it for herself. She says that was the best decision she ever made. Soon she was cycling every day and doing really well. The track was near her school, which meant it was no problem for her to attend training sessions after school every day. Vicky went on to have a successful career in track cycling and won several competitions. Then, when she was 28, she retired from competitive cycling. Vicky told me: ‘For years I’d loved winning competitions but I began to get a bit tired of the whole thing – and when the excitement stops, there’s no point. Luckily, I went on to have a new career.’ Vicky got a job with a charity called CycleZone. ‘We work with young people who have never enjoyed sport,’ she says. ‘The first thing we do is teach them to ride a bike. We want them to learn to believe in themselves and their own abilities. CycleZone does a great job, and it gets young people together so they’re part of a wider group.’

Last year, I went on a trip to Canada. It was my brother Harry’s idea. He’s a journalist, like me, and he wanted to write articles about the trip. We travelled by boat along the west coast of Canada. There were storms in the area we were going to, but luckily the weather was calm. We joined the group and set off. We saw dolphins and birds. We also stopped at the rock pools on the beaches along the coast. They were full of amazing coloured fish. It was great to be able to stop caring about how quickly or slowly the day was passing. We never forgot lunch or dinner, though, which we all made together over camp fires. When I finally fell asleep on the boats each evening, it really felt like stress-free living. When the time came to leave, I was sad. But I knew if I stayed, I’d miss family and friends. I was also looking forward to telling everyone at home about our adventures."

It took me a while to agree, but a few weeks later, I found myself playing against a team from another school. My parents came to watch, but it made me more nervous. But it was OK in the end. I practised every day and did really well. I turned professional at the age of eighteen.

Seven years ago, I was studying tourism. I needed to find a part-time job because my course was expensive. I decided to become a weekend tour guide in my city, Chicago. I took visitors around the city and I enjoyed giving those tours. I felt like a new experience every time I gave a tour. After finishing my studies, I decided to go into tour guiding full-time. To get a licence, I had to learn a lot more than I'd already learned. All Chicago guides have to be able to answer hundreds of questions about the city. After several months, I gained my tour guide qualification and registered as an independent tour guide. Being a tour guide is not just about knowing facts or making sure you don't lose anyone. You also need to be able to be entertaining and tell interesting stories, and above all, you need to be able to react to changing situations. I need to make sure visitors are happy with my tours, otherwise they could post a negative review online. Like most tour guides, I realise that these reviews are really important, as good reviews attract more customers. That’s why making tours fun and stress-free is essential.

My name is Gina D’Costa and I own a flower shop in the UK. We sell flowers to people who buy them for friends, their homes, or other reasons. Sometimes we also provide flowers for hotels, offices, and photo sessions. Once I even decorated a castle with flowers for a wedding. It was a lot of work but I was proud of the job we’d done. My day starts early, usually around 4 a.m., when I go to the market to buy fresh flowers. It’s cold and dark at that time, but I don’t mind. The market has a lot of different flowers. I like to choose pink flowers, but I have to remember that what I like and what other people want aren’t necessarily the same thing. Sometimes I have to argue with the flower-sellers about prices, but it’s a necessary part of the job. Back at the shop, I look at customer orders and set up vases with the flowers I’ve bought. Then I create bunches of flowers and work out how much the orders will cost. Customers are often surprised by how expensive they are, but I sometimes have to ask them to think again about what they’d like. I like my job because I can put together the nicest possible flowers for the amount of money someone wants to spend."

My city has a modern cinema that shows all the latest films I want to see, and lots of films for kids at the weekends. It’s close to where I live, but a year ago, I realised something was missing – the experience of discussing a film in detail with a group of people after watching it with them. So, together with two friends, I started a film club. We decided to show the films in different locations in the city. For example, we hired an old factory to show a film that was set in Antarctica. It was freezing cold, and this created the perfect atmosphere for the film, which was brilliant! We’re happy to make enough to cover our costs – we’re not trying to make a profit. Each time we show a film, everything is a bit easier for us. We also know how many tickets we’ve sold because everything’s online. There’s still always plenty to do, but when people come up to say what a great experience they’ve had, it’s wonderful. We’ve started a blog, too, because we know that most people now go online for information about films, rather than read reviews in local papers. We’ve also tried putting up a few posters in cafés. Nothing’s as successful as word of mouth, though – people recommending us to their friends."

Taking photographs was always my favourite activity as a child. When I was 15, I felt that if I wanted to take my hobby to the next level, I had to do something special. So I decided to start a personal project: I would take one photograph every day for a whole year of my life. I was keen to create a photo diary and also to have the chance to show other people my photos. I was amazed to discover that there were others who liked the way I saw and photographed things. I was also enjoying photographing a wide range of subjects. As a result I sometimes had doubts about my project, and I almost gave up several times. In the end, however, I trusted my own feelings, and became more confident about my photographic style and choices. I now have my own photography studio and I’ve never regretted my career choice."

Last year, I joined the National Youth Challenge (NYC) because I knew they went camping and sailing. In the NYC, you can do different activities to challenge yourself and you’re always learning something. There are different levels, from beginner to advanced, run by adult volunteers called ‘leaders’. When you complete each level, you get a certificate.
I decided to take up the challenge of helping to organise activities at a local children’s club for two hours a week. I was quite shy then and I had a lot of trouble making friends. But I decided to take up the challenge and I was glad I did. I made a lot of new friends and I also learned a lot of new skills.

The hill was very steep, so my dad had to do a lot of persuading to get me on a board.

My parents said I could only have it if I paid for it myself. So I decided to work part-time and save as much as I could. I owe my parents a lot for making me do that. It taught me a really valuable lesson. I worked every Saturday in a café, but I didn’t really enjoy it. My parents suggested starting my own little business instead. I asked my mum if I could have a go at making necklaces. I’d never imagined I’d find it so easy. I sold my first items of jewellery to my friends and family. They told me they were delighted with them, but I just thought they were saying that to please me. So although I was grateful they’d bought them, I still needed convincing that they looked good enough to be popular with the public. There was only one way to find out, so I rented a market stall with my mum. There are always lots of tourists where I live, and they bought lots of my things to give to family and friends when they got back home. Soon we were receiving calls from all over the country from people looking to buy more. It’s been such a lot of fun so far."

When Janine Stuart was young, she wrote a novel called Being Amelia which became a bestseller. Being Amelia is based on Janine’s life. In one interview, Janine said, ‘Because of my family’s moving around a lot, I’ve become good at making new friends. I understand what it’s like to be the only new student in a class, and that helped me to write about how the main character, Amelia, gets on in a new school.
Janine started her novel one summer, when she was feeling bored at home. Her mother had always dreamt of becoming a published author herself, and her teachers had always encouraged her to write, so it seemed like a natural way for Janine to pass the time. The year before, she’d entered a short story competition on a young writers’ website and won first prize. That’s why, when Janine finished Being Amelia and sent it to a publishing company, the people who worked there were immediately keen to read it. They loved it, and a year later, Janine’s novel was on sale in bookshops."

I started playing football when I was 7. I would rush home from school to play with other boys and girls. I loved it, and I was good at it. But my family knew I often became keen on new hobbies and then dropped them, so they thought the same thing would happen with football. But it never did. I was already dreaming of playing football professionally when I was older. And the opportunity came sooner than I’d hoped. I played in local tournaments, and one of the referees noticed that I was a promising player, so he asked the manager of a professional women’s club to watch me play. After that, she asked me to join her club. I started regular training with a big club as a young 13-year-old. I improved enormously. And I’ve scored lots more winning goals!

One of the most interesting things about studying further and higher education in the UK is that students can get involved in research early on. Research is not just for famous scholars or scientists. It can also be seen as a way to build knowledge and skills. You can use research approaches and skills in your studies and in your job. As a student, you make a contribution to knowledge. You don't just copy what you read, you make it. Making knowledge is based on asking questions, rather than taking things for granted. You can ask questions like Why? How? When? What does this mean? How might that be done? What if this were different? How does it work in that context? What do we really make of whatever facts we are given, views we are meant to adopt, or beliefs we are told about? Why does it matter? These are the most common questions that underlie what we call research.

Cities have always been places where people gather to share ideas and discuss important topics. They can also be very challenging places to live. The modern city is a place of creativity, but it's also a place where people feel overwhelmed and stressed. Scientists have found that cities actually dull our thinking, sometimes dramatically so. One of the main reasons for this is the lack of nature in cities. Studies have shown that people who can see trees from their windows recover more quickly from illness. Natural settings also help us to focus better and concentrate. They provide a break from the constant distractions of city life.
In recent years, it has become clear that city life can have a negative impact on our mental and physical health. It can also make it difficult to concentrate and remember things. However, there are ways to mitigate the psychological damage of the metropolis. One way is to find ways to integrate nature into our daily lives. Vibrant urban parks, such as Central Park in New York, can provide a much-needed escape from urban life."

The mind is a complex thing. It is like a stick that is used by a blind person. The stick is a pathway that helps the blind person to see. It is also a boundary that separates the blind person from the outside world. The mind is like a stick because it is always changing and evolving. It is also a way of connecting with the material world.
The mind is more than just the brain. It is also the things that we make and use. For example, stone objects, body ornaments, engravings, clay tokens and writing systems play an active role in human evolution and the making of the human mind.
The mind is a powerful tool that helps us to learn, discover, and make sense of the world. It is also a way of connecting with others. The mind is a complex and fascinating thing. It is a mystery that scientists are still trying to understand."

Photography has changed the course of civilization and the way we know the world. It has been especially true in the United States, where photography became part of US culture at every level. Historians say that photography is arguably the country’s greatest single contribution to the visual arts. In no other art form has US work loomed so large.
Photography has been appealing because it is a mechanical process that matches a growing enthusiasm for technology. It also brings the wonders and sights of the world into the front room with an immediacy that is breathtaking. And finally, photography is in harmony aesthetically with a tendency towards realism.
If we want to understand a photograph historically, then we need to pay special attention to its purpose and function within a given cultural matrix. Why did the photographer make the image? How did people first see it? And to complicate matters further, the same image might be seen in several places and times and its meaning would accordingly be different for each one."

In 1890, William James, an American philosopher and physician, defined psychology as the 'science of mental life'. This definition is still a good starting point for understanding psychology today. We all have a mental life and therefore have some idea about what this means. However, even though the concept can be studied in rats and monkeys as well as humans, it remains a somewhat elusive one.
Psychology is about the mind or brain, but psychologists do not understand nearly enough about its workings to be able to comprehend the part that it plays in the experience and expression of our hopes, fears, and wishes, or in our behaviour during experiences as varied as giving birth or watching a football match.
The endeavour of psychology is much like that involved in solving a crossword puzzle. It involves evaluating and interpreting available clues. Complex interactions are the norm rather than the exception in psychology, and understanding them depends on the development of sophisticated techniques and theories.
Psychology has the same goals as any other science: to describe, understand, predict, and learn how to control or modify the process that it studies. Once these goals have been achieved, it can help us to understand the nature of our experience and come to conclusions that can be applied directly to people’s lives."

In a storehouse in a business park in Michigan, USA, there is a museum of failed products. The museum has a collection of products that were withdrawn from sale because nobody wanted to buy them. The proprietor of the museum, Carol Sherry, sees every product as embodying its own sad story. The museum is a viable, profit-making business. It was started by a man named Robert McMath who intended to accumulate a reference library of consumer products. But his collection ended up consisting mostly of unsuccessful products. The museum is a testament to the fact that most products fail. It is also a reminder that we should not be afraid to fail.

Everyone knows that sports teams have an advantage when they play at home. But does anyone know why? Most of us probably think we do; after all, it seems obvious. But professional sport is changing faster than at any time in its history and much of what we used to take for granted is now open to question.
There are two main reasons why home advantage exists. First, the home team has the advantage of playing in front of their own crowd. This can give them a boost of confidence and make them more likely to win. Second, the home team has the advantage of being able to control the playing conditions. This can also give them an edge in the game.
However, there are some changes that have recently happened that have made home advantage less effective. For example, travel has become much easier and the top grounds increasingly resemble one another in their soulless efficiency. As a result, home advantage has declined in all major sports, but not by as much as one might expect.
There are a few possible explanations for why home advantage should vary depending on the sport. One possible explanation is that home advantage is primarily a team phenomenon and in baseball there may be less team spirit since it is more about individual confrontations between batter and pitcher. Another possible explanation is that the players’ testosterone levels are higher before home matches, which may be connected to some primitive urge to defend home turf against interlopers."

The more I practice, the luckier I get, said Gary Player. This quote is famous and is used by many athletes and coaches. It is easy to see why this quote is popular. There are two main reasons why. First, the quote is not accurate. It is not literally true that the more you practice, the luckier you get. Second, the quote is enigmatic. It is not easy to understand what Player really meant. However, the quote does have a good message. It is saying that if you practice, you can improve your skills.

A recent report found that many children living in wealthy countries feel lonely and unhappy. The reason for this is that these children have been spending too much time indoors and not enough time outside. They have lost contact with the natural world and have become dependent on technology. This is causing a lot of problems for children.
A follow-up study found that most of the children would be happier if they could go outside more. Many adults also talk nostalgically about the freedom of their own youth. They say that it was much better to spend time outside than to be stuck indoors.
However, there are some concerns about the idea of children spending more time outside. One concern is that parents may be too afraid of danger to let their children go outside. Another concern is that children may not want to follow the same model of behavior that adults have imposed on them."

I am a researcher who has a lot of school. I am good at solving problems. But that has little to do with the schooling I’ve had. Most problems in life cannot be solved with a formula or memorized answers. They require the judgement, wisdom and creative ability that come from life experiences.
Play is the natural means by which adults and mammals have always educated themselves. It is also important for children’s development. All mammals, including humans, play when they are young. Children, who have the most to learn, play far more than any other young primates when they are allowed to do so.
Play is voluntary, which means that players are always free to quit. If you can’t quit, it’s not play. School has become more onerous: breaks have been reduced, homework piled up, and pressure for high grades increased. Outside school, adult-directed sports have replaced impromptu games.
If we care about our children and future generations, we must reverse the horrid trend that has been occurring over the past half century. We must give childhood back to children. Children must be allowed to follow their inborn drives to play and explore, so that they can grow into intellectually, socially, emotionally and physically strong adults fit for an unpredictable future."

In many countries, there are a lot of young people in their twenties who use social media to find work. There are two popular social media sites that are often used for job hunting: Twitter and LinkedIn. These sites offer the chance for direct contact with potential employers. If you use social media for job hunting, you need to be careful. There are a lot of things that can go wrong. For example, you might send a message to the wrong person or write a message that is too long or too informal. If you make a mistake, it could cost you a lot of time and effort.

Newspapers have been struggling in recent years. Their circulation has fallen and they are no longer the main source of news for most people in the US. There are a lot of people who predict that newspapers will go extinct in the next few years. However, there are also some people who believe that old media have a habit of surviving. Newspapers were once new media, and they have survived many other changes in the way people get news. Today, there are a lot of new ways to get news, but newspapers still have a lot to offer. They can provide us with up-to-date information, and they can help us to understand the world around us.

If humans were truly at home under the light of the moon and stars, we would go in darkness happily. Instead, we are creatures who are adapted to living in the sun’s light. We have engineered the night to receive us by filling it with light. This kind of control is no different from the feat of damming a river. Light pollution is largely the result of bad lighting design. It washes out the darkness of night, altering light levels and light rhythms to which many forms of life, including ourselves, have adapted.
Light pollution has a lot of negative effects on wildlife. It affects migration, reproduction, and feeding. It also causes birds to sing at unnatural hours. Denying darkness is futile. It is as essential to maintaining our biological welfare as light itself.
Living in a glare of our own making, we have cut ourselves off from our evolutionary and cultural heritage. We have forgotten the scale of our being, which is best measured against the dimensions of a deep night with the Milky Way arching overhead."

A company recently announced that it would no longer track its employees’ paid holiday time. The company has a lot of employees and provides a variety of services. The founder of the company said that the idea came to him from his daughter. He said that employees can take as much leave as they want, as long as they feel comfortable that their absence will not damage the business. However, there are some concerns about this policy. One concern is that it could lead to increased guilt and stress for employees. Another concern is that it could lead to decreased productivity. It is important to remember that employment law exists for a reason. Workers are entitled to a minimum amount of statutory paid annual leave because periods of rest and leisure are critical to their mental and physical health."

Journal-based peer review is a process that checks the quality of scientific research papers. It is often seen as a way to prevent flawed or nonsensical papers from being published. Reviewing a paper can delay its publication by up to a year. Some people think that this is a price worth paying to ensure the trustworthiness of the published literature. However, others feel that the current system is flawed and that preprints may be a better way to disseminate scientific research. Preprints are drafts of papers that are posted online without having been peer reviewed. They bring academics back to what research publication is all about: the rapid dissemination of new results. Preprints also enable, on a global scale, the informal scientific discussions once confined to correspondence between individuals. They could also become an effective outlet for negative results."

When I ask my students what a poem is, they usually give me answers like 'a painting in words.' Their answers rarely satisfy me, or them. One day I asked a group to choose an object and write one paragraph describing it empirically, as a scientist might, and another in the first person, from the point of view of the item itself. The exercise led to much amusement and useful discussion.
A poem is a thing made. Poets sometimes compare poems to wild animals or machines. But such comparisons fall apart upon closer analysis. The most productive thing about trying to define a poem through comparison lies not in the comparison itself but in the debate. A poem is a product of writing and rewriting just like an article, story, or novel. It never really becomes what they usually are – a thing created in order to become a commodity.

I bought a metal detector soon after I was married. It was a lot of money then, but I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first outing. I've also found other interesting things, like brooches and coins. They give me pleasure. But the most impressive find was a torc, which is a beautiful necklace of gold and silver. It's the most famous object from Iron Age Britain. I carried it to the car and showed it to my wife. We didn't try it on because it was too valuable. I hid it in our wardrobe and felt anxious. Finally, I carried it into the council office and gave it to the local council. The torc is currently in the British Museum in London."

Sleeping is one of my favorite travel experiences. I love to sleep when I travel, even though I feel a little guilty about it. When I go to new places, I often find that I sleep better than I do at home. This is because I am surrounded by new sights, sounds, smells, and ways of being. When I sleep on the road, I feel like I am immersed in the culture of the place I am visiting. I also remember my dreams more clearly when I sleep away from home. If you are a traveler, you should embrace the joy of sleep on the road. It is an experience that will change your rhythm and give you a deeper connection to the place you are visiting."

Pen is a skilled explorer. He has to be. This time, however, there is far more at stake. He will set out on a three-month, 1,000-kilometer trek to the North Pole, taking detailed measurements of the thickness and density of the ice. Nobody has ever done this before.
Pen is married to Mary, a horsewoman, who says he has a ‘spine of steel’ and who shares his love of the outdoors. They live in the country with their two children.
Pen is going to be 47 on Thursday. He has done far less training than he’s comfortable with. Why? Because organizational things always seem more urgent.

I had a break from my training. I was going to do something else. Being a successful athlete is a special thing. I had the chance to do more writing and TV work, and to speak to businesses and schools. I also entered marathons and triathlons. I was beginning to miss the feeling of rowing, but I still wasn’t ready to commit to the training regime seven days a week. I spoke to some of my rowing colleagues about whether they fancied the race; I didn’t receive any enthusiastic responses. I knew that if I entered the race, I would want to win. I got in contact with Ben Fogle. We spoke about the remaining costs of the race. We felt we stood a better chance than most, but it would still take work to secure it. Of all the ways to earn money as a retired professional sportsman, speaking at business conferences is one of the most profitable. I think if I’m honest, I had concerns over people’s reaction to me doing a race with a TV presenter. I was worried that it would look like I just wanted to be on TV, otherwise I would have chosen a better partner to help win the race. My concerns disappeared over the course of our preparations.

I found a small company run by Anna and Pasi, and they agreed to take me on as a husky dog handler. From December to February, there is plenty of business taking tourists out on sled rides. I could join the team for three months, but I knew the work would be long and difficult. I started packing straight away.
When I arrived at the farm, I was handed a pair of boots and turned out into the cold. The dogs were running back and forth, and I was able to join in on the fun. I learned the basics of dog-sledding, but everything else seemed to be very complicated.

On that day, Radcliffe ran very fast and won the race. The press was there to make sense of her extraordinary run. Her time was so good that it would have qualified her to compete in the men's marathon at the world championships in Paris. Journalists asked her about the benefits of a natural treatment called emu oil. Cathy Freeman, an Olympic gold medallist, had recommended this treatment to heal the wounds caused by a freak accident.
Radcliffe feels that her achievement never really sank in. She can see it must have been a really big deal at that time. She and her team said they weren’t going to set a limit on anything. That was their motto: no limits. During the race, her husband and coach, Gary Lough, was in a car with her support team, listening to the radio coverage.
Radcliffe began to calculate as she approached the finish line. She knew she could finish in under 2 hours 16 minutes if she crossed the line in less than three minutes. She ran very fast and finished the race in 2 hours 16 minutes and 25 seconds.
After the race, everyone wanted to know how an athlete who ran with such an awkward style had beaten the grace and skill of the East African runners. Radcliffe's physiotherapist, Gerard Hartmann, had stayed with her for weeks at a time, providing daily sessions to counter the pain she was experiencing. He says, ""I've worked with 63 Olympic medallists and there was nobody on the treatment table who could ever take that level of pain. She would hurt me rather than me hurt her. She would actually wear me down because I'd have to go so deep into her muscles, I would have to ice my thumbs afterwards I was in such agony.""

There had been a lot of talk about the food revolution happening in Britain, and I was confident that we had created a series of programmes that made a new contribution to that. I watched the first programme and was relieved that it was successful. The show was a big success and led to many other projects, including a book based on my experiences at the restaurant I own. In each project, there is a sense of being on a journey. I wrote several books in a series called 'Perfection', each one accompanying its own TV programme of the same name. In these books, the journey was often physical, with passports and suitcases and itineraries. The latest book in the series is called 'In Search of Total Perfection'. It is about meeting extraordinary artisans and exploring new foods. Despite the book's title, I knew that I wouldn't be claiming the recipes were perfect.

Dad said that spending too much time online is not good for you. He thinks you should get out into the real world. Generally, research shows that teenagers who use social media have a wide circle of real-life friends, a good sense of identity and belonging, and are developing the essential technical skills we need to be citizens of a digital age.
Social networking has become an integral part of modern childhood. Teenagers don’t just consume media like adults do, they inhabit it. It performs a similar function to hanging around at the youth club, as today’s parents used to do when they were younger. It can help you develop your sense of identity, deal with teenage issues and get on with your peers.

I decided to become a flight attendant because I love to travel. There was a lot of young people at the interview, and many were accepted. We all had different strengths and experiences. I practised what to say before the interview, and I got the job!
I would recommend this kind of work to anyone. There are so many things that make it worthwhile. The free flights I get aren’t top of the list. Most airline staff are incredibly hard-working, and there’s a saying – ‘no-one’s finished till everyone’s finished.’ It’s like a big family – even though we don’t see each other all the time, we’re still close."

At the summer camp, I like seeing the children succeed at things they never thought they could do. Many children know how to swim and play table-tennis, but rock climbing is new for most of them. Some children feel nervous, but after some encouragement, they agree to try and they all get to the top. This makes them feel great. We also get children who miss home at the beginning of the week. It's the older children who feel like that the most. We don't let them use their mobile phones all the time. We tell them they can phone home after lunch and after dinner. Most children are fine in a couple of days and at the end of their week's stay, they all come up to us and thank us because they have had a great time."

Rock the Planet, a musical show, opened in London last year. It was a big show with a lot of talented actors. The actors had to be really good musicians, too. The show was popular and everyone wanted to hear the songs. There was a young actor named Jamie who was in the show. He was very busy and had to learn a lot of new things. But he was also very happy and proud of his performance. The show is on in London for another year, and it is well worth seeing."
