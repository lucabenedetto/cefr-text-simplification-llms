Some time ago, there was a website that talked about the risks of public check-ins. It said that if you post something online, it can be seen by anyone. This made people think about the downsides of sharing their lives online. The internet has opened up a lot of new opportunities to share information and connect with people. But it also has some dangers. If you put something on the internet, it can be seen by anyone. This can lead to problems, such as people making fun of you or losing your job.
However, there is also a positive side to the internet. It can be a great way to connect with friends and family, or to learn new things. If you are careful about what you post, you can use the internet to improve your life."

A long time ago, some scientists started a campaign to warn people about a low-budget film called What the Bleep Do We Know? which showed that there is a lot about our universe that we don’t understand. The film made some pretty innocuous statements about new discoveries, but it was when it moved on to describe some of these discoveries that I did, at last, begin to see what the fuss was really about. One of the discoveries was the ability of water molecules to be affected by thought. This discovery was met with skepticism from many scientists, but it has been widely accepted by the public. The movie’s claims about the universe being far stranger than anyone could have believed are true. Scientists have found that the universe is made from an unknown form of matter and is being propelled by a mysterious force known only as ‘dark energy’. The movie also discussed some other astounding discoveries, such as the lag between conscious perception and reality and the birthplace of modern humans. Despite what some might have us believe, science shows no signs of reaching completion. The emergence of the concepts of chaos and quantum uncertainty have put unavoidable bounds on what we can know."

Writing novels is a challenge, while writing short stories is a joy. It is like planting a forest or a garden. The two processes complement each other, creating a complete landscape. Writing novels is like planting a forest, and writing short stories is like planting a garden. The two processes complement each other, creating a complete landscape. The green foliage of the trees casts a pleasant shade over the earth, and the wind rustles the leaves. The buds appear on flowers, and the colourful petals attract bees and butterflies. Since the beginning of my career as a fiction writer, I have fairly consistently alternated between writing novels and short stories. I find writing short stories a necessary change of pace and a way to experiment.

Science is a powerful force that has greatly impacted human society. It has improved our lives and presented challenges. It has also inspired artists and thinkers. Science has its beauty and its dangers. It has been characterized by conflict and change.
Throughout history, scientists have been making discoveries and developing new theories. Some theories have been proven to be incorrect, while others have stood the test of time. Science is not static. It is always evolving.
Science has also been used to control nature. We have the ability to manipulate the environment and use science to improve our lives. However, science has also been used to disrupt the balance of nature. We must be careful to use science responsibly.
Science has become an integral part of human society. It is a force that can be used for good or for evil. We must be aware of the potential benefits and risks of science. We must use science responsibly to ensure a better future for ourselves and our children."

From around 2015, major publishers started to report that sales of ebooks had plateaued or even fallen in some cases. This has raised concerns about the long-term potential of ebooks in the publishing industry. Some people believe that the ebooks hype may have driven unwise investment, with companies losing confidence in the power of the word on the page. Despite the evidence suggesting that digital and print can coexist comfortably in the market, the question of whether the ebook will ‘kill’ the print book continues to surface.
The idea of one medium ‘killing’ another has been a common narrative throughout history. Even before the advent of digital technologies, critics have predicted the demise of existing media. For example, when television was invented, many people believed that radio would die. But radio ended up surviving by finding new uses. The same is true for books. As technology changes, we often find ourselves longing for what we used to know, but no longer have. This is why entire industries develop around retro products and older technologies.
The spread of the printing press in 15th-century Europe, for example, made people seek out original manuscripts. The shift from silent to sound movie in the 1920s stimulated nostalgia for the older form. The same happened in the shift from analog to digital photography, and from vinyl records to CDs. Not surprisingly, e-readers stimulated a new appreciation for the material quality of ‘old’ books – and even for their often unpleasant smell."

Every day, I wake up early, brush my teeth, make coffee, and write about how some of the greatest minds of the past have approached their work. I write about the mundane details of their daily lives, such as their sleep, eating, working, and worrying. I hope to provide a new perspective on their personalities and careers, and to sketch entertaining, small-bore portraits of the artist as a creature of habit.
My book is about the circumstances of creative activity, not the product. It deals with manufacturing rather than meaning. But it’s also, inevitably, personal. I have struggled with the same issues as many of my subjects: how to do meaningful creative work while also earning a living, and how to manage your time effectively. I have tried to provide examples of how a variety of brilliant and successful people have confronted these challenges.
As much as possible, I have let my subjects speak for themselves, in quotes from letters, diaries, and interviews. I have also included some of my own thoughts and ideas about creative work. I hope that this book will inspire you to think about your own creative process and to find a rhythm that works for you."

Howard became a palaeontologist because of a rise in interest rates when he was six years old. He found out that he wanted to become a palaeontologist when he was at university. He studied delicate creatures revealed on the surface of grey rocks. He got a job as a palaeontologist at Tavistock College in London. He often found himself contrasting the orderly nature of his professional life with the anarchy of private concerns.
The world teems with people who can determine the quality of your existence, and on occasion some total stranger can reach in and manipulate the entire narrative, as Howard was to find when his briefcase, containing the notes for a lecture he was about to give, was stolen at an Underground station. Fuming, Howard returned to the college. He made an explanatory phone call and postponed the lecture. He reported the theft to the appropriate authorities and then went for a restorative coffee. He joined a colleague who was entertaining a visiting curator from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. And thus it was that Howard learnt of the recently acquired collection of fossils, as yet uncatalogued and unidentified, the study of which would provide him with his greatest challenge and ensure his professional future."

Charles Spence is a Professor of Experimental Psychology at Oxford University in the UK. He has studied how the senses interact to form our perception of flavour. Through his studies, he has influenced what we eat and drink. He has also studied how food is experienced with others. His book, The Perfect Meal, is packed with insights that are fascinating to anyone in possession of an appetite.
Spence has a lab in Oxford that is not very high-tech. It has soundproof booths and stacks of ancient-looking audio-visual equipment. Much of his work is funded by a major food multinational. He is currently helping famous brands through reductions in salt and sugar.
Spence has also collaborated with Heston Blumenthal, a renowned experimental chef. They have worked together to create new dishes that incorporate sensory science. One of their most famous dishes is the 'Sound of the Sea' dish."

Our brains are very busy these days. We have a lot of information to deal with, including facts, pseudo facts, and rumours. We also do more things than ever before. Thirty years ago, people used to rely on travel agents and salespeople to help them with their tasks. Now, we do most things ourselves. We’re doing the work of many people while still trying to keep up with our lives, our families, our careers, and our hobbies. Our smartphones have become an important part of our lives. They help us to do many things, but they also make it harder to focus.
Multitasking is a powerful and dangerous illusion. It makes us demonstrably less efficient. It also increases the production of stress hormones and the fight-or-flight hormone adrenaline. Multitasking creates a sort of craving, effectively rewarding the brain for losing focus and for constantly searching for external stimulation. It also makes it harder to make decisions.
To make matters worse, multitasking requires lots of decision-making. We rapidly spiral into a depleted state in which, after making lots of insignificant decisions, we can end up making truly bad decisions about something important."

In a zoo in Sweden, a chimpanzee named Santino spent his nights breaking up concrete into pieces to throw at visitors during the day. Was he being spiteful? In caves in the US, female bats help unrelated fruit bat mothers if they can’t find the right birthing position. Are they being caring? Fifty years ago, people thought that animals had behaviours that produced measurable outcomes, and science recorded those outcomes. But recently that has partially changed. Thanks to research into the behaviour of bats, chimps, and other animals, emotions of animals have gone from being a taboo area of investigation to being tentatively explored. The new research has started a debate about whether animals can be said to have consciousness and conscience. If animals do have consciousness, what does it mean for the production and consumption of beef? The observations may not be disputed, but the interpretation of them is. There are different views on what the new research means for the future of humanity and our relationship with animals. Some people believe that we should stop eating meat, while others believe that we should re-evaluate our view of animal cognition. Ultimately, the question of whether animals have consciousness and conscience is a philosophical one and may never be solved."

Critical thinking is a way of interacting with what we read or listen to in order to have a deeper understanding. It involves analyzing, evaluating, and judging information based on its relevance, accuracy, and credibility. Although technology can complement and enhance human thinking, it can also make it more difficult to think critically. One of the main concerns is the decline in reading and literary engagement. Many people, including children, spend less time reading books and more time watching videos and playing video games. This decline in reading has contributed to a decline in critical thinking skills. However, there are some positive aspects to technology that can help improve critical thinking skills. For example, video games can teach decision-making and analytical skills. They can also help people to explore ideas and concepts that might otherwise be inaccessible or off limits."

When Matthew Crawford is not writing or thinking about how we ought to live, he works as a motorcycle mechanic. He wrote two books about the benefits of manual trades and philosophy. He was inspired to write his latest book when he noticed that advertisements popped up on the credit card machine while he was shopping. Crawford says that these demands on our attention are becoming increasingly difficult to avoid.
There are a lot of distractions in our daily lives. We are constantly being interrupted and our attention is being pulled in many directions. This is making it difficult to think or remember conversations we’ve had. It also makes it difficult to interact with others.
Crawford's proposed solution has two parts. First, we need regulation of noise and distraction in public space. More importantly, though, Crawford advocates skilled practices as a way of engaging with the world in a more satisfying way.
This is not to suggest that everyone should rush out to chef school; more that it is important to find a way to use your judgment. There are plenty of benefits in addition to professional satisfaction. Constantly resisting distractions can be exhausting and makes you less able to focus on what matters. The practice of paying attention to one thing, by contrast, makes it easier to pay attention to others."

What do you do for a living? It's a common question that we use to define ourselves. As a philosopher, it's a bit harder to deal with. One reason is that describing yourself as a philosopher sounds rather pretentious. Another reason is that philosophy has become increasingly removed from lived experiences. However, philosophy can also help people look a little more closely at the practices and behaviours that define their lives.

Foodies, gourmands, chefs and others who love food might expect that reflecting on what and how we eat can contribute to culinary pleasure. However, philosophical discussions of food have often been about other topics, such as the acquisition of knowledge or the pursuit of pleasure. Food is inherently social and cultural. It derives from historical contexts and is shared with those in our communities. It also brings people together and plays a role in bridging cultural gaps.
Once food has been prepared, people will start talking and writing about it. There are undoubtedly many ethical issues that attach to food. We can ask what we should eat and why the answers are what they are. Cooking in restaurants and in the home differ. Home cooks have a special duty to their guests, while those who cook for a living have obligations to their employer and to the food itself.

Rob Daviau is a US designer who creates 'legacy' board games. He felt that traditional board games were no longer entertaining or challenging enough, so he started to wonder how board games might evolve. He adapted a classic board game called Risk and created a new version called Risk Legacy. Unlike previous board games, decisions made during gameplay had a permanent impact. Players might have to rip up cards, deface the board, or open packets containing new rules. The games play out over the course of a fixed number of sessions and long-held grudges become woven into the fabric of the game.
Legacy board games were never expected to go mainstream, but most players love the concept. They see it as one of the biggest advances in game design for several years. The legacy format draws on video games and the demand for episodic entertainment fuelled by popular TV series."

Once upon a time, there was an octopus named Inky who lived in a tank at the New Zealand National Aquarium. One night, Inky managed to escape from his tank and swim across the floor to a drain that led to the Pacific Ocean. It was a story that was shared online and was very popular.
One of the reasons why people find stories like Inky's so interesting is because they involve anthropomorphism, which is the idea that animals are like humans. In the case of octopuses, this pleasure is especially pronounced because the creatures’ great intelligence comes packaged in bodies so vastly dissimilar to our own.
There are many examples of animals exhibiting intelligent behaviors that were once thought to be uniquely human. For example, animals can consider the past and the future, demonstrate empathy, and self-awareness, and anticipate the motives of others.
However, there is a problem with anthropomorphism. It is often thought of as unscientific, which is not true. In fact, it is the opposite – an unwillingness to recognize the human-like traits of animals. This is called anthropodenial.
In recent years, there has been a growing movement towards recognizing the intelligence of animals. This is partly due to the work of Dr. Frans de Waal, who has written extensively about animal cognition. De Waal believes that animals are far smarter than we’ve been giving them credit for. He argues that the most effective tests of animal intelligence are designed with a species’ particular traits and skills in mind."

The field of robotics promises to be a major technological shift since industrialisation. Robots have been used in the automotive and manufacturing sectors for many years. Experts predict that there will be a tipping point in robotic usage across many sectors in the next few years. Many people believe that robots will take over most of the work currently done by humans. However, this is not necessarily true. Robots cannot service or program themselves. This means that new jobs will be created for technicians and programmers. The development of new technologies such as motion control, sensor technologies, and artificial intelligence will give rise to a new class of robots aimed at consumer markets. With millions of jobs at risk, it is important to understand and prepare for the robotic workforce of tomorrow.

Because it's there, the mountaineer George Mallory is said to have replied to a reporter's question about why he wanted to climb Mount Everest. Climbing has a general public desire to understand why anyone would participate in such a seemingly meaningless, life-threatening pursuit. There are many reasons why people climb, including the feeling of freedom it produces, the feeling of being confined, and the feeling of accomplishment. Climbing can also help cultivate important virtues such as courage, humility and respect for the environment.
There are different ways to climb. Some climbers prefer to climb independently, while others prefer to climb with a team or use technology to help them. Climbing can also be a very meditative experience. It can be a way to connect with oneself and the environment. It can also be a way to learn new skills and techniques."

One of the most interesting developments in further and higher education in the UK has been the move to encourage novice students to become involved with research as early as possible. Research is not an exclusive activity for established scholars or scientists. It can also be seen as a natural and fundamental way to build knowledge and skills.
Research approaches and skills are useful not only in your studies but also in employment. They are ways of thinking about the world and going about your own work. As a student, you make a contribution to knowledge. You do not just digest and repeat it, you make it. Making knowledge is based on asking questions, rather than taking things for granted.
Most students have always been researchers of sorts. You will have been carrying out some elements of research for projects and answered questions at school or in the workplace since your first few days there. You will also have been developing research and enquiry approaches and skills when exploring where to go on holiday, how to grow seeds successfully, how to fix things around the house, how to train your dog, how to find the right kind of music system, and how to buy the right kind of items for your needs online.
Critical thinking is particularly important in research. We need to be able not just to repeat what we’ve read and take everything in as if it was proven fact, but to engage with it, think about it, test it out, identify whether what we’re being told is presented in such a way as to trick us into agreement, or whether it is logical, reasoned and backed by evidence."

Cities have always been centers of intellectual life. They provide a place for people to gather and discuss ideas. However, city life can also be challenging. It can be exhausting and overwhelming. Scientists have found that cities actually dull our thinking, sometimes dramatically so. One of the main reasons for this is the lack of nature in cities. Studies have shown that people who are exposed to nature recover more quickly from illness. Natural settings also help to improve brain performance.
In recent years, it has become clear that city life has a number of negative effects on our mental and physical health. These effects include fatigue, stress, and anxiety. They also include problems with attention and memory. The good news is that there are a number of ways to mitigate these effects. One way is to spend time in nature. Another way is to design parks and other green spaces that are accessible to everyone.
So, given the myriad mental problems that are exacerbated by city life, the question remains: Why do cities continue to grow? And why, even in the electronic age, do they endure as wellsprings of intellectual life? The answer to this question is that cities offer a unique set of benefits that are not available in other settings. These benefits include the concentration of social interactions and the opportunity to engage in a wide range of activities."

The mind is more than just the brain. It is a complex system that includes our thoughts, feelings, and emotions. There is evidence that things and neurons participate in human cognitive life. From the viewpoint of archaeology, stone objects, body ornaments, engravings, clay tokens and writing systems play an active role in human evolution and the making of the human mind.
The mind and the brain became equated because most of what we know about the human mind has been uncovered through isolating people from the material culture they are usually surrounded by in order to study them. However, this often goes unnoticed that much of our thinking takes place outside our heads.
The author suggests that human intelligence ‘spreads out’ beyond the skin into culture and the material world. He calls that metaplasticity – we have plastic minds that develop and change as they interact with the material world.
The author's approach sees the human mind as an unfinished project, in a permanent state of on-going evolution. He believes that the human mind is constantly changing and adapting to new technologies."

Photography has significantly changed the course of civilization and the way we perceive the world. It has been especially impactful in the United States, where photography became an integral part of the culture at all levels. Historians believe that photography is arguably the country’s greatest single contribution to the visual arts. It has moved to the centre of US intellectual and aesthetic discourse.
There are several reasons why photography was so appealing to the Americans. Firstly, it was a mechanical process that matched the growing enthusiasm for technology. Secondly, the camera was the perfect tool for representing oneself and showcasing individual and national identities. Thirdly, photography has been a powerful tool for creating and sustaining impressions of self and family. Finally, the photograph’s inherent realism was aesthetically harmonious with the American tendency towards realism.
Photography has also been hailed as a ‘universal language’. However, photographic meaning is more complex than that. To understand a photograph historically, we need to pay attention to its purpose and function within a given cultural matrix. We also need to consider the placement and framing of the image. If we want to understand a photograph fully, we need to consider all of these factors."

In 1890, William James defined psychology as the 'science of mental life.' It is a complex subject that is difficult to understand, even for psychologists. However, there are some basic elements that make up human psychology. These elements include thoughts, feelings, the physical world, and a way of knowing about these things.
Psychology is about the mind or brain, but psychologists do not understand nearly enough about its workings to be able to comprehend the part that it plays in the experience and expression of our hopes, fears, and wishes, or in our behaviour during experiences as varied as giving birth or watching a football match.
The endeavour of psychology is much like that involved in solving a crossword puzzle. It involves evaluating and interpreting available clues. Complex interactions are the norm rather than the exception in psychology, and understanding them depends on the development of sophisticated techniques and theories.
Psychology has the same goals as any other science: to describe, understand, predict, and learn how to control or modify the process that it studies. Once these goals have been achieved, it can help us to understand the nature of our experience and come to conclusions that can be applied directly to people’s lives."

In a storehouse in an unremarkable business park in Michigan, USA, there is a museum of failed products called the Museum of Failed Products. The exhibits in the museum are products that were withdrawn from sale because nobody wanted to buy them. The museum's proprietor, Carol Sherry, sees every product as embodying its own sad story. The museum is a viable, profit-making business. It is a testament to the fact that most products fail. The museum was started by ex-marketing man Robert McMath, who intended to accumulate a reference library of consumer products. However, his collection ended up consisting mostly of unsuccessful products. The museum is a reflection of the culture of optimism that exists today. People often focus on the bright side of things, even when they know that there is a high chance of failure. This obsession with optimism is particularly prevalent in the burgeoning 'self-help' field. It is important to remember that failure is a natural part of life and that it can be used as an opportunity to learn and grow."

Everyone knows that sports teams have an advantage when they play at home. But does anyone know why? Most of us probably think we do; after all, it seems obvious. But professional sport is changing faster than at any time in its history and much of what we used to take for granted is now open to question.
There are two main reasons why home advantage exists. First, the home team has the benefit of playing in front of their own crowd, which can give them a boost of energy and confidence. Second, the home team has the advantage of being able to make adjustments to the game plan based on the crowd's reaction.
However, there are some changes that have recently occurred that have made home advantage less effective. For example, travel has become more convenient and the top grounds increasingly resemble one another in their soulless efficiency. As a result, the impact of playing at home has declined in all major sports.
Despite these changes, there is still some evidence to suggest that home advantage still exists. For example, researchers found that the players’ testosterone levels were higher before home matches than they were before away matches. This sense of territoriality may be connected to some primitive urge to defend home turf against interlopers."

The more I practice, the luckier I get, said Gary Player. This quote is famous and is valued by athletes and their coaches. However, the meaning of the quote is enigmatic. Player didn’t literally mean lucky, he was speaking ironically. His real message was: ‘The more I practice, the better I get.’ Up to a point. Where that point is, indeed, whether it exists at all, is at the heart of the nature-nurture debate. The debate has seemed as uneven as a basketball game between giants and dwarves: nurture has been victorious. The theory that expertise in any field can be attained with 10,000 hours’ practice is also supported by this theory. However, there are some exceptions. Epstein argues that science is far better at looking at an elite athlete and retrospectively suggesting why that individual is succeeding than at working out why some people have certain abilities, while others don’t. He also distinguishes between hardware (the product of nature) and software (nurture)."

A recent report found that a large number of children living in wealthy industrialized countries feel lonely and dissatisfied. The reason for this is that these children have been spending too much time indoors, watching TV or playing on computers, and have lost contact with the natural world. This has led to a decline in their overall well-being.
A follow-up study found that a large number of children would be happier if they could simply go outside more. Many adults talk nostalgically about the freedom of their own youth, when they spent long summer days playing outside. However, they rarely stop to reflect that they are the ones who have imposed that protective regime on their own children.
There are some good arguments in the book about the relationship between the fear of danger and child-focused consumerism. However, the author's tone is sometimes too extreme and she does not provide enough evidence to support her claims."

I'm a research bio-psychologist with a PhD. I've done lots of school and I'm a pretty good problem-solver. But that has little to do with the schooling I’ve had. Most problems in life cannot be solved with some complex formula or memorised answers. They require the judgement, wisdom and creative ability that come from life experiences.
Play is the natural means by which adults and mammals have always educated themselves. The most important skills children everywhere must learn in order to live happy, productive, moral lives are skills that cannot be taught in school. Such skills cannot be taught at all. They are learnt and practised by children in play.
School has become more onerous: breaks have been reduced, homework piled up, and pressure for high grades increased. Outside school, adult-directed sports have replaced impromptu games. These changes have been gradual, imperceptible, but over time they have been enormous.
If we care about our children and future generations, we must reverse the horrid trend that has been occurring over the past half century. We must give childhood back to children. Children must be allowed to follow their inborn drives to play and explore, so that they can grow into intellectually, socially, emotionally and physically strong adults fit for an unpredictable future."

Newspapers have been struggling in recent years due to declining circulation and the rise of online news. In the UK, the circulation of most national dailies has fallen by a third to half since 2000. Despite the challenges, old media have a habit of surviving. Newspapers themselves were once new media, and they have survived many other technological advancements.
The internet has revolutionized the way we consume news. We can now access information quickly and easily, and we can personalize the news to our own interests. Online news providers can post minute-by-minute updates, and we can correct or modify errors and misconceptions almost instantly.
However, the anxiety to be first with the news often leads to confusion and misinformation. It is important to remember that the internet is not always a reliable source of information. We need to be cautious and critical when consuming news online.
In conclusion, newspapers may face extinction, but they may also discover that they have a unique ability to guide us to wisdom and understanding in an unimprovable and fundamentally chaotic universe."

If humans were truly at home under the light of the moon and stars, we would go in darkness happily. Instead, we are diurnal creatures, with eyes adapted to living in the sun’s light. We have engineered the night to receive us by filling it with light. This kind of control is no different from the feat of damming a river. Light pollution is largely the result of bad lighting design. It washes out the darkness of night, altering light levels and light rhythms to which many forms of life, including ourselves, have adapted.
Light pollution has a number of negative effects on wildlife and humans. It affects migration, reproduction, feeding, and our internal clockwork. Denying darkness is futile. It is as essential to maintaining our biological welfare as light itself. The regular oscillation of waking and sleep in our lives is nothing less than a biological expression of the regular oscillation of light on Earth. So fundamental are these rhythms to our being that messing with them is akin to altering our center of gravity.
Living in a glare of our own making, we have cut ourselves off from our evolutionary and cultural heritage – the light of the stars and the rhythms of day and night. In a very real sense, light pollution causes us to lose sight of our true place in the universe, to forget the scale of our being, which is best measured against the dimensions of a deep night with the Milky Way arching overhead."

The founder of a large company recently announced that his company would no longer track employees’ paid holiday time. The move was inspired by an internet company that has implemented a similar policy. The founder stated that employees can take as much leave as they want, as long as they feel comfortable that their absence will not damage the business. However, there are concerns about the practicality of this policy. The company has a large number of employees and provides a wide range of services. It is difficult to assess whether an employee’s absence would harm the business. Additionally, there is the pressure from colleagues and office gossip concerning who was off when, and for how long. These factors could lead to decreased productivity and increased stress for employees. The policy could also result in a sort of paralysis, where workers do not feel able to take their entitled leave or continue to use their statutory rights as a guideline."

Journal-based peer review is a process that ensures the quality of scientific research papers. It is often seen as a way to prevent the publication of flawed or nonsensical papers. However, the process can also be time-consuming, sometimes delaying the publication of a paper by a year. Some scientists believe that the benefits of journal-based peer review outweigh the costs, while others are not so sure. Preprints, which are drafts of papers that are posted online without having been peer reviewed, are a growing trend that is changing the way scientists publish their work. Preprints bring academics back to the core of research publication, which is the rapid dissemination of new results. They also make it easier for scientists to critique and build upon each other's work. However, preprints also have some drawbacks, such as the risk of being rejected by journals or the potential for the spread of inaccurate information. Despite these challenges, many scientists believe that preprints have the potential to improve the scientific publishing process."

When I ask my students what a poem is, they often give me answers that are like ""a painting in words."" Their answers rarely satisfy me or them. One day, I asked a group to choose an object and write one paragraph describing it empirically, as a scientist might, and another in the first person, from the point of view of the item itself. The exercise led to much amusement and useful discussion.
A poem is a thing made. Poets sometimes compare poems to wild animals or machines. But such comparisons fall apart upon closer analysis. The most productive thing about trying to define a poem through comparison lies not in the comparison itself but in the debate. A poem is a product of writing and rewriting just like an article, story, or novel, yet it never really becomes what they usually are – a thing created in order to become a commodity.
A poem is a home for deep feelings, stunning images, tender reflections and/or biting wit. It can also be a source of inspiration and creativity. Poems can make us see commonplace things in a new light and can help us to experiment with our well-trodden patterns of thought."
