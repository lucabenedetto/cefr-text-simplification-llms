Some time ago, there was a website that talked about the risks of public check-ins. It said that if you post something online, it can be seen by anyone. This made people think about the downsides of sharing their lives online. The internet has opened up a lot of new opportunities to share information and connect with people. But it also has some dangers. If you put something on the internet, it can be seen by anyone. This can lead to problems, such as people making fun of you or losing your job.

However, there is also a positive side to the internet. It can be a great way to connect with friends and family, or to learn new things. If you are careful about what you post, you can use the internet to improve your life.<eos>"

A long time ago, some scientists started a campaign to warn people about a low-budget film called What the Bleep Do We Know? which showed that there is a lot about our universe that we don’t understand. The film made some pretty innocuous statements about new discoveries, but it was when it moved on to describe some of these discoveries that I did, at last, begin to see what the fuss was really about. One of the discoveries was the ability of water molecules to be affected by thought. This discovery was met with skepticism from many scientists, but it has been widely accepted by the public. The movie’s claims about the universe being far stranger than anyone could have believed are true. Scientists have found that the universe is made from an unknown form of matter and is being propelled by a mysterious force known only as ‘dark energy’. The movie also discussed some other astounding discoveries, such as the lag between conscious perception and reality and the birthplace of modern humans. Despite what some might have us believe, science shows no signs of reaching completion. The emergence of the concepts of chaos and quantum uncertainty have put unavoidable bounds on what we can know.<eos>"

Writing novels is a challenge, while writing short stories is a joy. It is like planting a forest or a garden. The two processes complement each other, creating a complete landscape. Writing novels is like planting a forest, and writing short stories is like planting a garden. The two processes complement each other, creating a complete landscape. The green foliage of the trees casts a pleasant shade over the earth, and the wind rustles the leaves. The buds appear on flowers, and the colourful petals attract bees and butterflies. Since the beginning of my career as a fiction writer, I have fairly consistently alternated between writing novels and short stories. I find writing short stories a necessary change of pace and a way to experiment.

Science is a powerful force that has greatly impacted human society. It has improved our lives and presented challenges. It has also inspired artists and thinkers. Science has its beauty and its dangers. It has been characterized by conflict and change.

Throughout history, scientists have been making discoveries and developing new theories. Some theories have been proven to be incorrect, while others have stood the test of time. Science is not static. It is always evolving.

Science has also been used to control nature. We have the ability to manipulate the environment and use science to improve our lives. However, science has also been used to disrupt the balance of nature. We must be careful to use science responsibly.

Science has become an integral part of human society. It is a force that can be used for good or for evil. We must be aware of the potential benefits and risks of science. We must use science responsibly to ensure a better future for ourselves and our children.<eos>"

From around 2015, major publishers started to report that sales of ebooks had plateaued or even fallen in some cases. This has raised concerns about the long-term potential of ebooks in the publishing industry. Some people believe that the ebooks hype may have driven unwise investment, with companies losing confidence in the power of the word on the page. Despite the evidence suggesting that digital and print can coexist comfortably in the market, the question of whether the ebook will ‘kill’ the print book continues to surface.

The idea of one medium ‘killing’ another has been a common narrative throughout history. Even before the advent of digital technologies, critics have predicted the demise of existing media. For example, when television was invented, many people believed that radio would die. But radio ended up surviving by finding new uses. The same is true for books. As technology changes, we often find ourselves longing for what we used to know, but no longer have. This is why entire industries develop around retro products and older technologies.

The spread of the printing press in 15th-century Europe, for example, made people seek out original manuscripts. The shift from silent to sound movie in the 1920s stimulated nostalgia for the older form. The same happened in the shift from analog to digital photography, and from vinyl records to CDs. Not surprisingly, e-readers stimulated a new appreciation for the material quality of ‘old’ books – and even for their often unpleasant smell.<eos>"

Every day, I wake up early, brush my teeth, make coffee, and write about how some of the greatest minds of the past have approached their work. I write about the mundane details of their daily lives, such as their sleep, eating, working, and worrying. I hope to provide a new perspective on their personalities and careers, and to sketch entertaining, small-bore portraits of the artist as a creature of habit.

My book is about the circumstances of creative activity, not the product. It deals with manufacturing rather than meaning. But it’s also, inevitably, personal. I have struggled with the same issues as many of my subjects: how to do meaningful creative work while also earning a living, and how to manage your time effectively. I have tried to provide examples of how a variety of brilliant and successful people have confronted these challenges.

As much as possible, I have let my subjects speak for themselves, in quotes from letters, diaries, and interviews. I have also included some of my own thoughts and ideas about creative work. I hope that this book will inspire you to think about your own creative process and to find a rhythm that works for you.<eos>"

Howard became a palaeontologist because of a rise in interest rates when he was six years old. He found out that he wanted to become a palaeontologist when he was at university. He studied delicate creatures revealed on the surface of grey rocks. He got a job as a palaeontologist at Tavistock College in London. He often found himself contrasting the orderly nature of his professional life with the anarchy of private concerns.

The world teems with people who can determine the quality of your existence, and on occasion some total stranger can reach in and manipulate the entire narrative, as Howard was to find when his briefcase, containing the notes for a lecture he was about to give, was stolen at an Underground station. Fuming, Howard returned to the college. He made an explanatory phone call and postponed the lecture. He reported the theft to the appropriate authorities and then went for a restorative coffee. He joined a colleague who was entertaining a visiting curator from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. And thus it was that Howard learnt of the recently acquired collection of fossils, as yet uncatalogued and unidentified, the study of which would provide him with his greatest challenge and ensure his professional future.<eos>"

Charles Spence is a Professor of Experimental Psychology at Oxford University in the UK. He has studied how the senses interact to form our perception of flavour. Through his studies, he has influenced what we eat and drink. He has also studied how food is experienced with others. His book, The Perfect Meal, is packed with insights that are fascinating to anyone in possession of an appetite.

Spence has a lab in Oxford that is not very high-tech. It has soundproof booths and stacks of ancient-looking audio-visual equipment. Much of his work is funded by a major food multinational. He is currently helping famous brands through reductions in salt and sugar.

Spence has also collaborated with Heston Blumenthal, a renowned experimental chef. They have worked together to create new dishes that incorporate sensory science. One of their most famous dishes is the 'Sound of the Sea' dish.<eos>"

Our brains are very busy these days. We have a lot of information to deal with, including facts, pseudo facts, and rumours. We also do more things than ever before. Thirty years ago, people used to rely on travel agents and salespeople to help them with their tasks. Now, we do most things ourselves. We’re doing the work of many people while still trying to keep up with our lives, our families, our careers, and our hobbies. Our smartphones have become an important part of our lives. They help us to do many things, but they also make it harder to focus.

Multitasking is a powerful and dangerous illusion. It makes us demonstrably less efficient. It also increases the production of stress hormones and the fight-or-flight hormone adrenaline. Multitasking creates a sort of craving, effectively rewarding the brain for losing focus and for constantly searching for external stimulation. It also makes it harder to make decisions.

To make matters worse, multitasking requires lots of decision-making. We rapidly spiral into a depleted state in which, after making lots of insignificant decisions, we can end up making truly bad decisions about something important.<eos>"

In a zoo in Sweden, a chimpanzee named Santino spent his nights breaking up concrete into pieces to throw at visitors during the day. Was he being spiteful? In caves in the US, female bats help unrelated fruit bat mothers if they can’t find the right birthing position. Are they being caring? Fifty years ago, people thought that animals had behaviours that produced measurable outcomes, and science recorded those outcomes. But recently that has partially changed. Thanks to research into the behaviour of bats, chimps, and other animals, emotions of animals have gone from being a taboo area of investigation to being tentatively explored. The new research has started a debate about whether animals can be said to have consciousness and conscience. If animals do have consciousness, what does it mean for the production and consumption of beef? The observations may not be disputed, but the interpretation of them is. There are different views on what the new research means for the future of humanity and our relationship with animals. Some people believe that we should stop eating meat, while others believe that we should re-evaluate our view of animal cognition. Ultimately, the question of whether animals have consciousness and conscience is a philosophical one and may never be solved.<eos>"

Critical thinking is a way of interacting with what we read or listen to in order to have a deeper understanding. It involves analyzing, evaluating, and judging information based on its relevance, accuracy, and credibility. Although technology can complement and enhance human thinking, it can also make it more difficult to think critically. One of the main concerns is the decline in reading and literary engagement. Many people, including children, spend less time reading books and more time watching videos and playing video games. This decline in reading has contributed to a decline in critical thinking skills. However, there are some positive aspects to technology that can help improve critical thinking skills. For example, video games can teach decision-making and analytical skills. They can also help people to explore ideas and concepts that might otherwise be inaccessible or off limits.<eos>"

When Matthew Crawford is not writing or thinking about how we ought to live, he works as a motorcycle mechanic. He wrote two books about the benefits of manual trades and philosophy. He was inspired to write his latest book when he noticed that advertisements popped up on the credit card machine while he was shopping. Crawford says that these demands on our attention are becoming increasingly difficult to avoid.

There are a lot of distractions in our daily lives. We are constantly being interrupted and our attention is being pulled in many directions. This is making it difficult to think or remember conversations we’ve had. It also makes it difficult to interact with others.

Crawford's proposed solution has two parts. First, we need regulation of noise and distraction in public space. More importantly, though, Crawford advocates skilled practices as a way of engaging with the world in a more satisfying way.

This is not to suggest that everyone should rush out to chef school; more that it is important to find a way to use your judgment. There are plenty of benefits in addition to professional satisfaction. Constantly resisting distractions can be exhausting and makes you less able to focus on what matters. The practice of paying attention to one thing, by contrast, makes it easier to pay attention to others.<eos>"

Foodies, gourmands, chefs and others who love food might expect that reflecting on what and how we eat can contribute to culinary pleasure. However, philosophical discussions of food have often been about other topics, such as the acquisition of knowledge or the pursuit of pleasure. Food is inherently social and cultural. It derives from historical contexts and is shared with those in our communities. It also brings people together and plays a role in bridging cultural gaps.

Once food has been prepared, people will start talking and writing about it. There are undoubtedly many ethical issues that attach to food. We can ask what we should eat and why the answers are what they are. Cooking in restaurants and in the home differ. Home cooks have a special duty to their guests, while those who cook for a living have obligations to their employer and to the food itself.

Rob Daviau is a US designer who creates 'legacy' board games. He felt that traditional board games were no longer entertaining or challenging enough, so he started to wonder how board games might evolve. He adapted a classic board game called Risk and created a new version called Risk Legacy. Unlike previous board games, decisions made during gameplay had a permanent impact. Players might have to rip up cards, deface the board, or open packets containing new rules. The games play out over the course of a fixed number of sessions and long-held grudges become woven into the fabric of the game.

Legacy board games were never expected to go mainstream, but most players love the concept. They see it as one of the biggest advances in game design for several years. The legacy format draws on video games and the demand for episodic entertainment fuelled by popular TV series.<eos>"

Once upon a time, there was an octopus named Inky who lived in a tank at the New Zealand National Aquarium. One night, Inky managed to escape from his tank and swim across the floor to a drain that led to the Pacific Ocean. It was a story that was shared online and was very popular.

One of the reasons why people find stories like Inky's so interesting is because they involve anthropomorphism, which is the idea that animals are like humans. In the case of octopuses, this pleasure is especially pronounced because the creatures’ great intelligence comes packaged in bodies so vastly dissimilar to our own.

There are many examples of animals exhibiting intelligent behaviors that were once thought to be uniquely human. For example, animals can consider the past and the future, demonstrate empathy, and self-awareness, and anticipate the motives of others.

However, there is a problem with anthropomorphism. It is often thought of as unscientific, which is not true. In fact, it is the opposite – an unwillingness to recognize the human-like traits of animals. This is called anthropodenial.

In recent years, there has been a growing movement towards recognizing the intelligence of animals. This is partly due to the work of Dr. Frans de Waal, who has written extensively about animal cognition. De Waal believes that animals are far smarter than we’ve been giving them credit for. He argues that the most effective tests of animal intelligence are designed with a species’ particular traits and skills in mind.<eos>"

Experts predict that there will be a tipping point in robotic usage across many sectors in the next few years.

Because it's there, the mountaineer George Mallory is said to have replied to a reporter's question about why he wanted to climb Mount Everest. Climbing has a general public desire to understand why anyone would participate in such a seemingly meaningless, life-threatening pursuit. There are many reasons why people climb, including the feeling of freedom it produces, the feeling of being confined, and the feeling of accomplishment. Climbing can also help cultivate important virtues such as courage, humility and respect for the environment.

There are different ways to climb. Some climbers prefer to climb independently, while others prefer to climb with a team or use technology to help them. Climbing can also be a very meditative experience. It can be a way to connect with oneself and the environment. It can also be a way to learn new skills and techniques.<eos>"

He was an intellectual and disciplined figure who explored and recorded European works for the piano. He wrote and played a great deal, but taught very little. Those who knew him best glimpsed a playful side to his character, but that was seldom on display in his concerts. It was a disciplined, never-ending cycle of study, travel and performance.

One day, a young boy named Kit Armstrong approached Brendel backstage at one of his concerts and asked for lessons. Brendel initially didn’t take the suggestion very seriously, but he eventually agreed to give Kit lessons. He noticed that Kit had a phenomenal memory and was a phenomenal sight reader.

My grandparents' garden was a special place for me. It was situated on the bank of a river and sloped gently down towards the water. You couldn’t reach the river but you could hear the sound of the water and the birds that sang in the trees above. I imagined that all gardens were like this – a place of escape, peace and solitude.

My father was a quiet and withdrawn person. He had a few phrases that he liked to use, one of them being 'It’s immaterial to me'. He was probably disappointed that he hadn’t made more of his life. He left school without qualifications and became apprenticed to a plumber. It was not something he was passionate about.

I always wanted to like the piano but it did its best to intimidate me. The only thing I did like about it were the two brass candlesticks that jutted out from the front. I wanted out of school as soon as possible but that seemed an unlikely prospect until one day my father announced, 'They’ve got a vacancy for an apprentice gardener in the Parks Department.

I like to feel that somewhere deep down inside him, although he hated gardening himself, he’d watched me doing it for long enough and noticed the keenness and the passion for all things that grew and flowered and fruited that hadn’t disappeared.<eos>"

When John Maloof bought a box of old photo negatives at an estate auction, he discovered the mystery of Vivian Maier. Maier was a street photographer with a keen eye for capturing compelling images. Maloof has amassed an archive of Maier’s life and work, which includes her cameras, film, prints, negatives, movies, and audiotapes.

Maier was born in 1926 and spent much of her childhood in France. She returned to New York in 1951 and came to Chicago in 1956 to work as a nanny. Maier was a private person who kept herself to herself and was a bit of a character. She always had a camera with her and dressed in oversized coats, broad-brimmed hats, and stout shoes.

Maier’s work is the purest form of art. None of it was done for any commercial reason. Her images lean toward women, children, the old, the poor, and the abstract. Maloof often wonders if he’ll ever work his way through all the negatives. The funny thing is he had no real interest in photography until he discovered Maier’s work.

He studied guitars and figured out how different shapes and types of wood affected the sound. He also learned how to build and repair instruments.

Jonny’s bass guitar turned out well, but he didn’t think of it as a career. He was also into painting and sculpture. He chose to study architecture at university but dropped out because he was too individualistic. He realized that guitar-building is actually a type of sculpture and decided to make guitars for a living.

Any discussion of English conversation often begins with the weather. It is a traditional practice to quote the famous comment of Dr. Johnson that, ""When two Englishmen meet, their first talk is of the weather."" Most commentators either stop or try to explain why the English have a fascination with the weather. They fail because they assume that our conversations about the weather are actually about the weather. However, this is not the case. Our conversations about the weather are not really about the weather at all. They are a form of ""grooming talk"" that helps us overcome our natural reserve and talk to each other. There are certain fixed contexts in which weather-speak is used. It can be used as a simple greeting, as an ice-breaker leading to conversation on other matters or as a ""default"" or ""filler"" topic when conversation on other matters dries up.<eos>"

No problem for the car, but with Alistair’s first couple of miles involving a 25 per cent incline, the older Brownlee brother had his work cut out from the start.

As the brothers raced, they faced various obstacles. There was a giant tractor that lumbered onto the road, and Alistair had to dismount and carry his bike up the hill.

The silence on Centre Court at the Wimbledon tennis championships is very calming. You can bounce the ball, serve, and hit it, and hear the echo of your own shot. The trimmed grass, the rich history, the ancient stadium, the players dressed in white, and the respectful crowds all combine to create a feeling of enclosure and comfort. The quiet of the Centre Court is good for my game. It helps me to focus on the point I’m playing and to shut everything else out.

The silence is broken by a sudden noise when a point is done: applause, cheers, and people shouting your name. You hear them, but as if from a distant place. You don’t register that there are thousands of people watching you. You are so focused that you have no sense at all that there are millions watching you as you play Roger Federer in the 2008 Wimbledon final.

I had always dreamed of playing at Wimbledon. I had played and lost against Federer in the final the year before, and the year before that. The defeat in 2006 had not been so hard.

During the first hour-long conversation, Shirley Ford speaks to me in various voices, including those of a cheeky 8-year-old boy, his tired mother, and a very fast-talking alien. Her voices are recognisable to viewers of children’s TV and cartoons. She talks about what it takes to do voiceovers. There are many actors who can do funny voices, but you also have to bring the script to life for an audience who can’t see you. Shirley has learned to create the right sounds from the back of her throat and to avoid always sounding like the same child. The competition for work is fierce, and a good showreel is essential. For anyone considering a career doing voiceovers, Shirley recommends attending ‘specialist workshops’ and having a passion for human sound.<eos>"

People often ask me how I became a cartoonist. Cartooning is a dream job that many people have. But most people eventually give up on their dreams and consider more realistic professions. The idea that you can support yourself financially by sketching the sort of doodles commonly found in high school notebooks is silly. Yet, some people do exactly that. To become a cartoonist, you don’t need a university degree or much money. You just need your brain, your hand and something that makes a mark. It’s a tough job, but if you feel that doing anything else would be impossible, it might be the right career for you.<eos>"

Twenty years ago, I was moving house and had a lot of stuff to get rid of. I decided to throw away an electric guitar that my dad had bought me for my 16th birthday. I felt sad about throwing it away, but I took it to the rubbish dump and was about to put it on a pile of rubbish. Suddenly, a young man came up to me and asked if he could have it. I said yes, and we went our separate ways. I felt sad for what I’d done for a long time. Then, a few months ago, I received an email that changed my life. Someone found my guitar and was offering to sell it back to me. I was so happy that I cried. I picked up the guitar and started playing. It felt like a long time since I had played it. I felt the need to stand up and play the guitar in a certain position. My fingers knew where to go. I couldn’t draw a diagram for any of the chords I wanted to play, but my hands just went into it. I felt the special pain of holding down the wires to play a chord. The electric guitar is not really a solo instrument. Now that I’m learning it again, I guess I’ll have to form a band.<eos>"

There has been a lot of talk about sleep lately. Sleep is very important for our mental, physical, and social well-being. It seems that people who have the hardest time sleeping are the ones who most appreciate how important sleep is. Dreams are important too. They help us find new patterns and create combinations that break through our usual habits of thinking.

When you wake up in the morning, the sleep you sacrifice is mainly REM or 'Rapid Eye Movement', the most dream-rich stage of sleep. Dreams are where we bring things together in fresh, often surprising ways. They draw on stores of knowledge from the past and present to find new associations.

When people are awakened out of REM and asked to say what comes to their minds in response to a certain word, their responses are more original than when awoken from other stages of sleep. This is because dreams help us find new patterns and create combinations that break through our usual habits of thinking.

So, dreams are important for everyone. They help us think creatively and flexibly as we negotiate relationships with colleagues, co-workers, family, and friends.<eos>"

It was twenty years ago that Susie Ray left London for a small coastal town in south-west England. She is a copyist artist who can reproduce the richness of an early-20th-century impressionist masterpiece as easily as the brilliance of a 16th-century Caravaggio portrait.

Susie has been in great demand since her 30 years as a copyist artist. She has painted the works of numerous great artists, including Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh. Her reproductions are so faithful that art experts mistake them for the originals.

However, Susie has always been open about what she does. When she reproduces an old masterpiece, she will make it look as authentic as possible. But she will put her own signature on the back of the canvas.

Susie has also been teaching younger painters. She stresses the importance of learning to draw and to represent things accurately. She also emphasises how much she’s studied to be able to do what she does.<eos>"

During Ellen MacArthur's racing days, she was passionate about the sea. It was her great obsession from childhood. With her boats, she had a unique connection. They worked as one. When she was on land, life felt trivial. After she came second in a solo round-the-world race, she took you on a tour of her boat. She talked about the careful planning that had gone into provisioning and housekeeping. The boat was her world and she looked after it because her life depended on it.

Now, she sees the world as a boat. It's a small, beautiful, and fragile thing whose supplies are running out. Her turning point came on a trip to South Georgia, where she helped with a rare bird survey on albatrosses. She realised that we have to design a way of not using things up. She also launched the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a charity that works through business and education to give young people the vision to rethink and redesign a sustainable future.<eos>"

Jordan Romero is 13 years old and wants to be the youngest person to climb Mount Everest. If he succeeds, he could become one of the most famous teenagers of his generation. Young people are spending more time on computers and games consoles, so Jordan hopes to inspire kids to climb their own mountains. He has already climbed five of the Seven Summits and might actually do it before his teenage years are over.

However, many people have doubts about whether a young climber would be emotionally strong enough or have enough experience to develop the good judgment and reactions a climber must have in order to take part in such a project safely. Jordan's parents, Paul and Karen, have heard such views before and believe that their own experience as climbers will help.

Jordan's motivation is also a question. Is this just an ambitious father taking his own love of adventure to a dangerous extreme? Or is there something more to it? Jordan says, 'I just focus on achieving my goal.'

This project isn’t about becoming famous for Jordan’s achievements. It’s about inspiring others to climb their own mountains. If Jordan wants to inspire others, he has to play the media game. This means blogging, sitting for photo shoots and giving interviews. He has got to offer something spectacular. Like climbing Everest.<eos>"

When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, it's probably not classical music they're listening to. Most teenagers don't know much about classical music. The main reason why teenagers don't like classical music is because it's not their music of choice. Classical music is structurally complex and requires time and concentration to appreciate. It also has a slow pace and rhythm that is difficult for teenagers to listen to. Pop music is much simpler and easier to listen to. It also has a faster pace and rhythm that is more appealing to teenagers. The way we listen to music has also changed. Nowadays, you can find any music you want at the click of a mouse. However, the sound track to our lives is rarely classical.<eos>"

I met Cody Simpson before and have always been impressed by his quiet confidence. The 15-year-old Australian has already released a number of successful songs. He started playing the guitar and writing songs when he was young. One day, he posted videos of himself singing and playing the guitar on the internet. These videos changed everything. He began getting lots of comments from fans asking for more videos. So, Cody decided to record more videos and post them online. The responses to his videos were overwhelming. He was a very talented swimmer, but he had to choose between swimming and music. He decided to take a chance and move to the US to pursue his dream of becoming a singer. His family was supportive, but they didn’t want to be directly involved in his career. Cody says it’s important to keep a small group of close friends and family around you to stay grounded. Of course, everyone has days of doubt. But Cody is always grateful for his family and friends who support him. He knows that success comes from a willingness to say ‘yes’ to your big break, even when it’s a little scary to do so.<eos>"

I saw a boy on the river bank trying to balance on an ice shelf. It was dangerous, but I didn't worry. I put on my wetsuit and jacket and went kayaking. I have a lucky chain that my grandfather gave me. It's a special chain. I also have the diary that he kept on his expedition in South America. I read bits of it before I fall asleep.

Mum caught Jess by the arm and asked her to come with her to the study. There was a painting on the table, which was unmistakably one of Grandpa’s. It was unlike anything he had done before and clearly nowhere near finished. Mum spoke again and said the painting had a name. There was something in her voice that betrayed her enthusiasm. Jess read the words Grandpa had scrawled on the painting. It was called 'River Boy.' The picture was strange and amorphous – and beautiful in an eerie way. There were no animals, no birds, no people; and it felt right that way. The riverbank was almost insignificant, such a subtle hint of green that the eye barely took it in. And there was a further mystery. Jess looked round at Mum. ‘There is no boy.’ ‘Exactly. Strange, isn’t it – I mean, for him to be so specific. Still, he hasn’t finished it yet, so maybe he’s going to put the boy in later.<eos>"

When I woke up this morning, I didn't mean to damage the carpet. It just seemed like a good idea at the time, as things so often do. I was trying to find a way of fitting my corner cabinet into a corner. Gran had given me the cabinet when she moved out of her house into a flat. It's really cute!

But the thing is, it is a corner cabinet. That is why it is shaped like a triangle. It has to stand in a corner. I've only got two corners in my bedroom. The only problem is, the lack of corners! My bed is in one, and my wardrobe in the other.

I'd tried fitting Gran’s cabinet into the angle between the roof and the floor, but it was just the tiniest little bit too tall. If I could only slice a couple of centimetres off the bottom of it... That was when it came to me. If I couldn’t slice anything off Gran’s cabinet, how about cutting a hole in the carpet? It just seemed like the obvious solution. What Dad calls lateral thinking. I reckoned he would be quite pleased with me. He is always telling us to ‘think outside the box’. And that was exactly what I was doing!<eos>"

The novel 'The Borrowers' is about a family of tiny people who live hidden in the walls and floors of a house. They secretly borrow things from the normal-sized people in order to survive. When the author was asked to direct a TV adaptation of the novel, she realised it was going to be hard to live up to people’s expectations. The most crucial thing was getting the scale right. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans, so if they were filming the Borrowers nervously walking across a room or bravely setting out on one of their borrowing missions, they had to be 10 times further away than on a normal shoot. The costumes worn by the lead actor and actress were made out of heavy canvas material so that they stuck out in the way that dolls’ clothes do. Unfortunately, the weather was really hot during filming. Most of the action that takes place away from the Borrowers’ home had to be shot with the actors separated from their surroundings. We filmed them in front of a blue screen on an otherwise empty set.

1. What is the main theme of the novel 'The Borrowers'?

Mom pulls to a stop at the corner of my new school, Palm Grove High school. She looks around nervously, searching for journalists. I tell her everything is going to be fine. She kisses her fingertip and touches my cheek right before I get out of the car. Then she’s off, leaving me alone with this whole new school, whole new situation to deal with.

I walk in the school’s main office and get my schedule. English Literature, first period. Cool, I can deal with that. But I’m late. English is in Room 214, second floor. I studied the map the night before, as I didn’t want to look like a complete buffoon searching for my classes.

When I get to the door, I hear the teacher already taking roll. I slip in undetected and slide into the last desk in the second row. The girl next to me smiles. She scans over my very normal and, might I add, very clever outfit – jeans and a T-shirt. Ha! Nobody will ever suspect me now!

The teacher pauses in the roll taking. ‘Desert... McGraw?’ she says hesitantly. ‘Here.’ The teacher then smiles and introduces herself as Ms. Smigla. She talks a lot and eventually hands us our course outlines. After we review them and she tells us all about books we’re required to read this year, she actually gives us time to socialize! All teachers should realize the importance of this.<eos>"

The average American teenage girl is expected to excel in school, have a part-time job, volunteer, and maintain a social life. Teenage boys and girls have a lot of responsibilities today, including homework, tests, extracurricular activities, jobs, chores, and family obligations. With the introduction of smart phones, tablets, and social media, students can now take their work on the go and do their homework wherever they happen to be. This has created what appears to be a cell phone addiction. Many teenagers start their days early and often end after midnight, leaving them with fewer than the recommended nine hours of sleep a night. This can lead to sleep deprivation and falling asleep in school. Despite the challenges, teenagers are still proving it wrong and forcing the world forward.<eos>"

The teenage members of the Earth to Sky Calculus Club live in Bishop, a mountain town in the US, surrounded by wilderness. They have launched over fifty balloons to the edge of space. It's a long-running science project that includes astronomy experiments and backcountry adventures. I joined them one weekend in late spring. They were releasing a high-altitude balloon, hoping to record shooting stars.

As it got dark, the teenagers secured a soft insulated lunch box to the bottom of the balloon. Inside was a camera, an instrument to measure altitude, and a thermometer. Two GPS trackers were mounted on the outside of the lunch box to help the group find it later. They used a gas tank to inflate the balloon and watched it ascend.

After the launch, most of the students went home, but a few stayed to watch the shooting stars. They lay on blankets on the mountainside and gazed at a sky so clear, it was hard to believe you're just four hours from Los Angeles.

The recovery team spent 11 hours finding the lunch box. It was in a canyon, high on a flat rock, in the middle of a cascading waterfall. Sure, it's a bit of a disappointment, but it's also a perfect opportunity to argue over the effects of atmospheric waves, and how they might work above mountain ridges.<eos>"

One day, she lent her younger brother a hand with a science project and came across an article about recent discoveries in the field. She felt that this was something she wanted to commit herself to.

Paleontology is not a common career choice for young people, but Chloe was determined to pursue her passion. She met her first professional palaeontologist, Matt Cornelius, who was famous despite being quite young. Despite her nervousness, she felt more at ease when he showed patience and willingness to listen.

Dinosaurs continue to fascinate us because they speak to the innate explorer in all of us. They remind us that there is still more out there to be discovered. And Palaeontology is a great form of time travel.<eos>"

When you're travelling by car with your family, even when you're young, you probably know that you're not 'there yet,' even as you're asking over and over 'Are we there yet?' Once you get there, it's not 'there' anymore, it's 'here'. If you really think there's a chance that you're 'there' yet, you should be asking 'Are we here yet?'.

The journey can be fun and enjoyable, with endless DVDs, music, and puzzles. You can also act as co-pilot and help your parents keep everything running smoothly. But sometimes, things can go wrong. For example, your brother or sister might put their foot on your side of the seat or hurl their whole body over into your space. If this happens, there could be a fight and the car might swwerve.

Over the years, your parents have developed strategies for dealing with these situations. For example, your dad might say, 'Yup. We're here. Get out of the car.' But if you're still on the highway, going 70 miles an hour, he might also say, 'Oh, well, then maybe we're not there yet.'

So once and for all, please note: if mum and dad are still near enough to answer your question, then the answer is: no. You're not there yet.<eos>"

John and Zuzi Morgan have opened a café in Oxford, UK, where people can enjoy coffee, cake, and board games. They hope that people will enjoy the experience so much that they will want to repeat it. The games that are played in their café are known as Eurogames. They are popular because they are relatively gentle and easy to learn.

The first Eurogame was created by a German designer named Klaus Teuber. It is called The Settlers of Catan. Players build settlements on an island and trade resources with each other. The game is very engaging and keeps all of the players involved.

Another popular Eurogame is called Pandemic. It was created by a North American designer named Matt Leacock. Pandemic is a cooperative game where players work together to solve global problems. The game is challenging and requires players to work together to be successful.

The growth of the video games industry has also contributed to the popularity of Eurogames. Video games have made it more acceptable for people to play games. As a result, more people are open to trying Eurogames.

In conclusion, tabletop gaming has become more than entertainment. It has become a way for people to share their love of games and interact with each other in a physical way. This trend is set to continue in the future.<eos>"

Jamie Scott is a successful music writer and producer. He has written and produced some of the biggest UK hits of recent years. His story is an example of why endurance and persistence are essential in the music business.

Scott was born into a family that loved music. His mother was an amazing singer, and he started playing the guitar at a young age. He was influenced by the local radio station that played middle-aged music. He started playing the piano and writing lyrics in economics lessons.

At 17, Scott left school to try to make it as a performer. He was part of a duo with a friend who was a skilled guitarist. After a few near misses with record labels, he was signed to a music publisher. However, the record label was only interested in him as a solo act, so he had to split with his friend.

Scott's success came behind the scenes rather than on stage. He asked the record label to let him go and switched to another label to release a new album. Fame and fortune did not follow. But he continued to write and produce music. He found his success by writing for others.

Scott is a humble and ambitious music writer. He believes that writing with an eye on the charts is not something to be ashamed of. He wants to write classic modern pop songs that will stand the test of time.<eos>"

Television presenter Helen Skelton has completed various dangerous challenges for charity, including a desert marathon run and a journey down the Amazon river in a tiny boat. For her latest challenge, Helen walked on a high wire, a long thin piece of metal, 66 meters above the ground. There was no safety net, only a belt around her waist attached to another wire above. To help her keep her balance and not to fall, she carried a long stick, weighing eight kilograms. Helen took lessons from an expert high-wire walker. Although she already had a few circus skills, she quickly discovered that high-wire walking was completely different. The training was a shock, said Helen. 'I didn’t realise how strong I’d need to be. Every day started at 8 am with a run up a steep hill; then came an hour of exercises, with another hour of them after my day practising on the wire.

I work at a university in the US where my team and I are studying water birds, particularly one called the American black duck. We have started using a new piece of equipment called a night-vision scope, which allows us to see the ducks in the dark. We are worried about black ducks mainly because their numbers have fallen hugely and we don’t know whether there’s enough food on the east coast for these animals. We have lots of information about their daytime activities, but nothing about what they do at night, because we simply haven’t had the equipment. But this new ‘scope’ will produce really clear pictures, even on moonless nights, so we’ll be able to find out more and make better decisions about looking after the area where they live based on what we learn. It is very hard work. There are four of us, each working six hours daily. We have studied ducks in different locations, and I have had to take a boat to some sites and make notes on every duck I see. The weather hasn’t helped – some nights are mild, but more often it’s wet. Oh, and it’s so quiet I’ve needed lots of coffee to stop me falling asleep! We’ve only missed one working day so far, because the snow was too deep even for our special snow vehicles. Still I like the challenge of it, especially compared to what the summer will bring – hours in a laboratory, where we’ll look at our results together. It’ll be hard to be stuck inside – but it’s essential to do this. And I wouldn’t change it for anything!<eos>"

These satchels are popular and sell in world-famous shops. Before choosing satchels, Julie made a list of different businesses, considering her options. Once she’d decided, she found not everyone agreed with her. Many people said there was no demand for them, but Julie was convinced.

When Vicky Harmiston was a child, her parents gave her and her brother Jamie the freedom to decide what they did in their spare time. Vicky chose to do lots of different sports. She was a good swimmer, and the coach at the swimming club she went to thought she might be good enough to become a champion. But the club was a long way from her home so it was difficult for her to fit in the training around her schoolwork. When they were teenagers, Jamie, who loved cycling, bought himself a special track racing bike and started taking part in competitions. Vicky thought it looked very exciting and decided to try it for herself. She says that was the best decision she ever made. Soon she was cycling every day and doing really well. The track was near her school, which meant it was no problem for her to attend training sessions after school every day. Vicky went on to have a successful career in track cycling and won several competitions. Then, when she was 28, she retired from competitive cycling. Vicky told me: ‘For years I’d loved winning competitions but I began to get a bit tired of the whole thing – and when the excitement stops, there’s no point. Luckily, I went on to have a new career.’ Vicky got a job with a charity called CycleZone. ‘We work with young people who have never enjoyed sport,’ she says. ‘The first thing we do is teach them to ride a bike.

Singer-songwriter Ana Ronson grew up in Ireland. Her parents weren’t musicians, but there was always music in the house. Her grandfather played the guitar and taught Ana and her brother to play. The first time Ana sang in front of an audience was at school. She was so nervous that her teacher had to lead her off the stage. The teacher suggested that joining the school theatre club might make her more confident. After attending the club for a while, she sang with 50 other students at an end-of-term concert. A year later, her brother asked her to write a song for them, and she wrote her first ever song, Falling Stars. Writing it took just three days and she enjoyed it so much that she enrolled on a songwriting course run by a professional songwriter. Despite being the youngest student, she already knew more about music than many of the others. But Ana says the teacher didn’t listen to anything she said, and she wrote Something to Say about how annoyed this made her feel. She posted this song online, and it became a huge success. One of her favourite songs is Decision, written about why her brother stopped singing for a while, and how unhappy it made him.<eos>"

Last year, I went on a trip to the west coast of Canada. It was my brother Harry’s idea. He’s a journalist, like me, and he wanted to write articles about the trip. I had dreamt of visiting the area ever since I saw it on TV as a child. So I asked Harry if I could go too – until he finally agreed. There were storms in the area we were going to, but luckily the weather was calm. We joined the group, packed our limited supplies into small boats and set off. We stopped for hours to explore the rock pools on the beaches along the coast. They were full of amazing coloured fish. And it was great to be able to stop caring about how quickly or slowly the day was passing. We never forgot lunch or dinner, though, which we all made together over camp fires. When I finally fell asleep on the boats each evening, it really felt like stress-free living. When the time came to leave, I was sad. But I knew if I stayed, I’d miss family and friends. I was also looking forward to telling everyone at home about our adventures.<eos>"

My dad was a professional basketball player in Germany, as his father had been before him. I went to watch many of his games when I was a kid. I loved telling my friends how good my dad was, but I used to take a book with me to read instead of watching. Starting secondary school, I was already tall and my sports teacher asked me if I’d be interested in training with the basketball team. I enjoyed the session, but I thought I’d need to develop my skills before I took part in a real match. It took me a while to agree, but a few weeks later, I found myself playing against a team from another school. My parents came to watch, but it made me more nervous. But it was OK in the end. I practised every day and did really well, even joining an adult team before I moved abroad to a special sports academy in the USA when I was fifteen. The coach there trains Olympic basketball players, and it was fantastic to work with him. However, I can’t say I enjoyed my first experience of living far from my parents. I got used to my new life in the end, though, and my English improved quickly too! I turned professional at the age of eighteen, three years after arriving in the USA. I’d been taller than most players in the professional league since I was fifteen, but had been much too light for my height, so had to get that right first.

Seven years ago, I was studying Tourism at college. I needed to find a part-time job because my course was expensive. After considering several options, I decided to become a weekend tour guide in my home city – Chicago. I enjoyed giving those tours and I learned a lot about the city. After finishing my studies, I decided to go into tour guiding full-time. To get a licence, I had to learn a lot more than I'd already learned. All Chicago guides have to be able to answer hundreds of questions about the city. After several months, I gained my tour guide qualification and registered as an independent tour guide. Tour guiding is a lot of work, but it is also a lot of fun. You need to be able to be entertaining and tell interesting stories, and above all, you need to be able to react to changing situations. I need to make sure visitors are happy with my tours, otherwise they could post a negative review online. Like most tour guides, I realise that these reviews are really important, as good reviews attract more customers. That’s why making tours fun and stress-free is essential.

My name is Ella and I'm 22. Last year I went to Thailand for two weeks with my sister Josie. We went to help as volunteers at an elephant sanctuary. To be honest, I wasn’t sure if we would have much in common with the other volunteers because they were all much older than us. We were also nervous because it was the first time we’d done anything like that before. In the end, though, there was no need to worry. We helped collect the elephants’ food and wash the elephants in the river. The part of the day I most looked forward to was the evening. By the light of the moon, we led the elephants on foot into the forest area where they spent the night. The meals were delicious – and didn’t include meat, which neither of us is keen on. After dinner, all the volunteers and staff spent the evenings talking and playing games. Now that we’re back in the UK, Josie doesn’t often talk about Thailand. But if anyone asks her if she enjoyed her time at the sanctuary, she says she loved it.<eos>"

I’m Gina D’Costa and I run a flower shop in the UK. We sell flowers to people for various reasons. Sometimes we provide flowers for hotels and offices, and we also take part in photo sessions for businesses. Once I decorated a castle with flowers for a wedding. It took a lot of work but I was proud of the job we’d done. My day starts early, usually around 4 a.m., when I go to the market to buy fresh flowers. The market is wonderful, with flowers from all over the world. It’s challenging to choose flowers, but I try to get the best ones I can. Back at the shop, I look at customer orders and set up vases with the flowers I’ve bought. Then I create bunches of flowers and work out how much the orders will cost. Customers are often surprised by how expensive flowers can be. I sometimes have to ask them to think again about what they’d like. I like thinking about how I can put together the nicest possible flowers for the amount of money someone wants to spend. That’s what you have to do when you’re selling things. I wouldn’t want any other job.<eos>"

My city has a modern cinema that shows all the latest films I want to see, and lots of films for kids at the weekends. It’s close to where I live, but a year ago, I realised something was missing – the experience of discussing a film in detail with a group of people after watching it with them. So, together with two friends, I started a film club. We decided early on that we didn’t want to hire a cinema to show the films in. Instead, we choose a different location in the city each month. We’ve been to some free places and some places where the owners make money by selling snacks during the film. We’re happy to make enough to cover our costs – we’re not trying to make a profit. Each time we show a film, everything is a bit easier for us. We also know how many tickets we’ve sold because everything’s online. There’s still always plenty to do, but when people of all ages come up at the end to say what a great experience they’ve had, it’s wonderful. We’ve started a blog, too, because we know that most people now go online for information about films, rather than read reviews in local papers. We’ve also tried putting up a few posters in cafés. Nothing’s as successful as word of mouth, though – people recommending us to their friends. And the audience love the special activities we put on with each film – last month it was a movie quiz, which everybody enjoyed.<eos>"

Taking photographs was always my favourite activity as a child. When I was 15, I felt that if I wanted to take my hobby to the next level, I had to do something special. So I decided to start a personal project: I would take one photograph every day for a whole year of my life. I was amazed to discover that there were others who liked the way I saw and photographed things. I was also enjoying photographing a wide range of subjects. Then someone suggested that if my photographs all had a common topic or idea to connect them, my project would be even better – and I agreed. So I began to concentrate more on taking photos of nature scenes, especially of birds and the sky. A lot of them were black and white photographs, which was very different to what many other young photographers were doing – they were all taking colour photos. As a result I sometimes had doubts about my project, and I almost gave up several times. In the end, however, I trusted my own feelings, and became more confident about my photographic style and choices. One day I showed my project to my art teacher at school. She told me about a national photography competition for people my age. So I entered some of my photos, just for fun. I’ll never forget the moment when the judges told me that I had won first prize; I was so happy, as my project meant so much to me. It was the first time I realised that maybe my photography really was good, and that I might actually be able to work as a professional photographer. I now have my own photography studio and I’ve never regretted my career choice.<eos>"

I joined the National Youth Challenge (NYC) last year because I knew they went camping and sailing and taught skills like public speaking. The NYC offers different activities to challenge yourself and you’re always learning something new. There are different levels, from beginner to advanced, run by adult volunteers called ‘leaders’. When you complete each level you get a certificate. I decided to take up the challenge and soon I was spending all my free time at the children’s club. I also made some great friends and learned a lot of new skills. Now I’m there for about four hours a week and I always really look forward to going.

I was born in Denver, USA, and started snowboarding when I was eight years old. My dad took me to a resort in the mountains, about two hours from Denver. The hill was very steep, so my dad had to do a lot of persuading to get me on a board. I was so young, I hadn’t even thought of asking him if I could start snowboarding, but he was already into it and wanted me to love it too. And in the end, I managed just fine. After this experience, I started to love the sport and improve my ability. I started competing aged ten. I enjoy not having a fixed plan, and sometimes this goes well, like when I became the first female ever to get a perfect 100 at a local competition. That achievement increased my trust in my own abilities. During the summer, I focus on training and my studies while there’s no snow. I also get to spend lots of time with my friends. It’s the best way of dealing with not being able to do what I love so much and what I’m really good at. I have to think carefully about my future. Snowboarding is such a huge part of my life now, but I also feel it’s important to have something else I can do, just in case I don’t succeed as a professional snowboarder or if I get injured.

When I was fifteen, I wanted everything my friends had. I didn't plan ahead, like I had no idea what I wanted to do when I left school. One day, my best friend got a new phone and I thought I should have one too. My parents said I could only have it if I paid for it myself, so I decided to work part-time and save as much as I could. I owe my parents a lot for making me do that – it taught me a really valuable lesson. I worked every Saturday in a café, but I didn’t really enjoy it. My parents suggested starting my own little business instead. I had seen my mum making necklaces for herself, so I asked if I could have a go at that. I’d never imagined I’d find it so easy, as it had seemed so complicated when I’d watched Mum doing it. I sold my first items of jewellery to my friends and family as soon as I’d finished making them. They told me they were delighted with them, but I just thought they were saying that to please me. So although I was grateful they’d bought them, I still needed convincing that they looked good enough to be popular with the public. There was only one way to find out, so I rented a market stall with my mum. There are always lots of tourists where I live, and they bought lots of my things to give to family and friends when they got back home. Soon we were receiving calls from all over the country from people looking to buy more. They thought we were a big company, employing loads of people to produce my designs, when in fact we were just two people on a market stall! That was when I knew it could work, and it was time to take the next step – creating a website. Since then, I’ve made thousands of pounds through my business, mostly online, although we still have our stall too. It’s been such a lot of fun so far.<eos>"

When Janine Stuart was young, she wrote a novel called Being Amelia which became a bestseller. Being Amelia is based on Janine’s life. In one interview, Janine said, ‘Because of my family’s moving around a lot, I’ve become good at making new friends. I understand what it’s like to be the only new student in a class, and that helped me to write about how the main character, Amelia, gets on in a new school.

Janine started her novel one summer, when she was feeling bored at home. Her mother had always dreamt of becoming a published author herself, and her teachers had always encouraged her to write, so it seemed like a natural way for Janine to pass the time. The year before, she’d entered a short story competition on a young writers’ website and won first prize. That’s why, when Janine finished Being Amelia and sent it to a publishing company, the people who worked there were immediately keen to read it. They loved it, and a year later, Janine’s novel was on sale in bookshops.

One review of Being Amelia mentions how, despite the book having pictures of happy teenagers on the cover, the people in the story actually face some difficult challenges. This is what really allows readers to believe in them. The reviewer says that although Janine is still very young, and Being Amelia isn’t a particularly long novel, she’s clearly shown that she’s a better writer than several other best-selling authors.<eos>"

I’m Tom, I’m fifteen years old, and three years ago my family and I moved into a castle on a small island. My dad was invited to be the castle’s manager. He works for an organisation that looks after historical buildings and keeps them open to the public. We were just focused on what life on the island would be like – we knew the castle probably wouldn’t be as comfortable as our cosy home just across the water, and there was no school. Once we’d moved, though, we quickly got used to island life. The castle isn’t particularly beautiful, but our apartment in it is comfortable. The island feels very sociable in summer as it attracts lots of visitors, and there are often parties on the beach. During the winter, we only see the other families who live on the island, and there aren’t as many teenagers among them as I had hoped. But the adults all support each other, though, and help with repairs on the island, which often involves lots of hard work. The biggest change for me was travelling by boat every day, back to my old school. I was looking forward to going on stormy days, when there are huge waves – but the ferries don’t run then! And I’ve discovered that if I miss the bus to the harbour after school, I also miss the last ferry home, which is worrying. So when schoolmates come home to stay with me, I’m always telling them to hurry up! But we often get the most fantastic views, for example when the sun goes down over the sea. Some days, though, it’s so foggy that you can’t see a thing, then within hours it’s brilliant sunshine again – it still seems amazing when that happens, even after living here all this time.<eos>"

I live in a beautiful house in Scotland, surrounded by countryside. I love nature and wild animals, and I started a new hobby called birdwatching six years ago. I went to the mountains in northern Scotland with my family, where we saw lots of birds in their natural environment. I spent hours watching them with my parents, who showed me how to tell the difference between species and how to find the best places to see them. It was amazing, and I joined a local young birdwatchers’ club. My goal is to see 200 different bird species, and I’ve almost achieved that. I’ve been to Egypt and South America, and I’m lucky to live in a place where there are lots of birds. I also think that birdwatching clubs should try to get more young people interested in this hobby. Everyone needs to connect with nature, whatever their age, and it doesn’t have to cost much money.<eos>"

I started playing football when I was 7. I loved it, and I was good at it. But my family thought that I would drop out like I had with other hobbies. But it never did. I was already dreaming of playing football professionally when I was older. And the opportunity came sooner than I’d hoped. I started playing in local tournaments, and one of the referees noticed that I was a promising player. He asked the manager of a professional women’s club to watch me play. After that, she asked me to join her club. I started regular training with a big club as a young 13-year-old. I improved enormously. But people still weren’t sure I’d ever be a star player, which made me feel a bit upset. But my coach encouraged me to just be myself, and believe in myself. I played in one of the club’s championship matches, much earlier than I’d expected. I won the game, and the team carried me round the pitch. Since then, I’ve scored lots more winning goals. And next month, my coach and I are running a football tournament in my area. The aim is to get teenagers interested in football, and to have a chance to chat to other players in my club.

One of the most interesting developments in further and higher education in the UK has been the move to encourage novice students to become involved with research as early as possible. Research is not an exclusive activity for established scholars or scientists. It can also be seen as a natural and fundamental way to build knowledge and skills.

Research approaches and skills are useful not only in your studies but also in employment. They are ways of thinking about the world and going about your own work. As a student, you make a contribution to knowledge. You do not just digest and repeat it, you make it. Making knowledge is based on asking questions, rather than taking things for granted.

Most students have always been researchers of sorts. You will have been carrying out some elements of research for projects and answered questions at school or in the workplace since your first few days there. You will also have been developing research and enquiry approaches and skills when exploring where to go on holiday, how to grow seeds successfully, how to fix things around the house, how to train your dog, how to find the right kind of music system, and how to buy the right kind of items for your needs online.

Critical thinking is particularly important in research. We need to be able not just to repeat what we’ve read and take everything in as if it was proven fact, but to engage with it, think about it, test it out, identify whether what we’re being told is presented in such a way as to trick us into agreement, or whether it is logical, reasoned and backed by evidence.<eos>"

Cities have always been centers of intellectual life. They provide a place for people to gather and discuss ideas. However, city life can also be challenging. It can be exhausting and overwhelming. Scientists have found that cities actually dull our thinking, sometimes dramatically so. One of the main reasons for this is the lack of nature in cities. Studies have shown that people who are exposed to nature recover more quickly from illness. Natural settings also help to improve brain performance.

In recent years, it has become clear that city life has a number of negative effects on our mental and physical health. These effects include fatigue, stress, and anxiety. They also include problems with attention and memory. The good news is that there are a number of ways to mitigate these effects. One way is to spend time in nature. Another way is to design parks and other green spaces that are accessible to everyone.

So, given the myriad mental problems that are exacerbated by city life, the question remains: Why do cities continue to grow? And why, even in the electronic age, do they endure as wellsprings of intellectual life? The answer to this question is that cities offer a unique set of benefits that are not available in other settings. These benefits include the concentration of social interactions and the opportunity to engage in a wide range of activities.<eos>"

The mind is more than just the brain. It is a complex system that includes our thoughts, feelings, and emotions. There is evidence that things and neurons participate in human cognitive life. From the viewpoint of archaeology, stone objects, body ornaments, engravings, clay tokens and writing systems play an active role in human evolution and the making of the human mind.

The mind and the brain became equated because most of what we know about the human mind has been uncovered through isolating people from the material culture they are usually surrounded by in order to study them. However, this often goes unnoticed that much of our thinking takes place outside our heads.

The author suggests that human intelligence ‘spreads out’ beyond the skin into culture and the material world. He calls that metaplasticity – we have plastic minds that develop and change as they interact with the material world.

The author's approach sees the human mind as an unfinished project, in a permanent state of on-going evolution. He believes that the human mind is constantly changing and adapting to new technologies.<eos>"

Photography has significantly changed the course of civilization and the way we perceive the world. It has been especially impactful in the United States, where photography became an integral part of the culture at all levels. Historians believe that photography is arguably the country’s greatest single contribution to the visual arts. It has moved to the centre of US intellectual and aesthetic discourse.

There are several reasons why photography was so appealing to the Americans. Firstly, it was a mechanical process that matched the growing enthusiasm for technology. Secondly, the camera was the perfect tool for representing oneself and showcasing individual and national identities. Thirdly, photography has been a powerful tool for creating and sustaining impressions of self and family. Finally, the photograph’s inherent realism was aesthetically harmonious with the American tendency towards realism.

Photography has also been hailed as a ‘universal language’. However, photographic meaning is more complex than that. To understand a photograph historically, we need to pay attention to its purpose and function within a given cultural matrix. We also need to consider the placement and framing of the image. If we want to understand a photograph fully, we need to consider all of these factors.<eos>"

In 1890, William James defined psychology as the 'science of mental life.' It is a complex subject that is difficult to understand, even for psychologists. However, there are some basic elements that make up human psychology. These elements include thoughts, feelings, the physical world, and a way of knowing about these things.

Psychology is about the mind or brain, but psychologists do not understand nearly enough about its workings to be able to comprehend the part that it plays in the experience and expression of our hopes, fears, and wishes, or in our behaviour during experiences as varied as giving birth or watching a football match.

The endeavour of psychology is much like that involved in solving a crossword puzzle. It involves evaluating and interpreting available clues. Complex interactions are the norm rather than the exception in psychology, and understanding them depends on the development of sophisticated techniques and theories.

Psychology has the same goals as any other science: to describe, understand, predict, and learn how to control or modify the process that it studies. Once these goals have been achieved, it can help us to understand the nature of our experience and come to conclusions that can be applied directly to people’s lives.<eos>"

In a storehouse in an unremarkable business park in Michigan, USA, there is a museum of failed products called the Museum of Failed Products. The exhibits in the museum are products that were withdrawn from sale because nobody wanted to buy them. The museum's proprietor, Carol Sherry, sees every product as embodying its own sad story. The museum is a viable, profit-making business. It is a testament to the fact that most products fail. The museum was started by ex-marketing man Robert McMath, who intended to accumulate a reference library of consumer products. However, his collection ended up consisting mostly of unsuccessful products. The museum is a reflection of the culture of optimism that exists today. People often focus on the bright side of things, even when they know that there is a high chance of failure. This obsession with optimism is particularly prevalent in the burgeoning 'self-help' field. It is important to remember that failure is a natural part of life and that it can be used as an opportunity to learn and grow.<eos>"

Everyone knows that sports teams have an advantage when they play at home. But does anyone know why? Most of us probably think we do; after all, it seems obvious. But professional sport is changing faster than at any time in its history and much of what we used to take for granted is now open to question.

There are two main reasons why home advantage exists. First, the home team has the benefit of playing in front of their own crowd, which can give them a boost of energy and confidence. Second, the home team has the advantage of being able to make adjustments to the game plan based on the crowd's reaction.

However, there are some changes that have recently occurred that have made home advantage less effective. For example, travel has become more convenient and the top grounds increasingly resemble one another in their soulless efficiency. As a result, the impact of playing at home has declined in all major sports.

Despite these changes, there is still some evidence to suggest that home advantage still exists. For example, researchers found that the players’ testosterone levels were higher before home matches than they were before away matches. This sense of territoriality may be connected to some primitive urge to defend home turf against interlopers.<eos>"

The more I practice, the luckier I get, said Gary Player. This quote is famous and is valued by athletes and their coaches. However, the meaning of the quote is enigmatic. Player didn’t literally mean lucky, he was speaking ironically. His real message was: ‘The more I practice, the better I get.’ Up to a point. Where that point is, indeed, whether it exists at all, is at the heart of the nature-nurture debate. The debate has seemed as uneven as a basketball game between giants and dwarves: nurture has been victorious. The theory that expertise in any field can be attained with 10,000 hours’ practice is also supported by this theory. However, there are some exceptions. Epstein argues that science is far better at looking at an elite athlete and retrospectively suggesting why that individual is succeeding than at working out why some people have certain abilities, while others don’t. He also distinguishes between hardware (the product of nature) and software (nurture).<eos>"

A recent report found that a large number of children living in wealthy industrialized countries feel lonely and dissatisfied. The reason for this is that these children have been spending too much time indoors, watching TV or playing on computers, and have lost contact with the natural world. This has led to a decline in their overall well-being.

A follow-up study found that a large number of children would be happier if they could simply go outside more. Many adults talk nostalgically about the freedom of their own youth, when they spent long summer days playing outside. However, they rarely stop to reflect that they are the ones who have imposed that protective regime on their own children.

There are some good arguments in the book about the relationship between the fear of danger and child-focused consumerism. However, the author's tone is sometimes too extreme and she does not provide enough evidence to support her claims.<eos>"

I'm a research bio-psychologist with a PhD. I've done lots of school and I'm a pretty good problem-solver. But that has little to do with the schooling I’ve had. Most problems in life cannot be solved with some complex formula or memorised answers. They require the judgement, wisdom and creative ability that come from life experiences.

Play is the natural means by which adults and mammals have always educated themselves. The most important skills children everywhere must learn in order to live happy, productive, moral lives are skills that cannot be taught in school. Such skills cannot be taught at all. They are learnt and practised by children in play.

School has become more onerous: breaks have been reduced, homework piled up, and pressure for high grades increased. Outside school, adult-directed sports have replaced impromptu games. These changes have been gradual, imperceptible, but over time they have been enormous.

If we care about our children and future generations, we must reverse the horrid trend that has been occurring over the past half century. We must give childhood back to children. Children must be allowed to follow their inborn drives to play and explore, so that they can grow into intellectually, socially, emotionally and physically strong adults fit for an unpredictable future.<eos>"

In many countries, a growing number of young people in their twenties are using social media to find work. There are two popular social networking sites that offer the chance for direct contact with potential employers: Twitter and LinkedIn. With greater access to social media, there is also a greater chance to make mistakes. For example, a young jobseeker in the US contacted a senior marketing executive via LinkedIn. The marketing executive was not willing to share her list of influential people with the young jobseeker. This incident has drawn attention to the fact that social media can be a dangerous tool for jobhunters who don’t know how to use it. To be successful on professional networking sites, you need to be clear, concise, and humble.<eos>"

Newspapers have been struggling in recent years due to declining circulation and the rise of online news. In the UK, the circulation of most national dailies has fallen by a third to half since 2000. Despite the challenges, old media have a habit of surviving. Newspapers themselves were once new media, and they have survived many other technological advancements.

The internet has revolutionized the way we consume news. We can now access information quickly and easily, and we can personalize the news to our own interests. Online news providers can post minute-by-minute updates, and we can correct or modify errors and misconceptions almost instantly.

However, the anxiety to be first with the news often leads to confusion and misinformation. It is important to remember that the internet is not always a reliable source of information. We need to be cautious and critical when consuming news online.

In conclusion, newspapers may face extinction, but they may also discover that they have a unique ability to guide us to wisdom and understanding in an unimprovable and fundamentally chaotic universe.<eos>"

Light pollution is largely the result of bad lighting design. It washes out the darkness of night, altering light levels and light rhythms to which many forms of life, including ourselves, have adapted.

Light pollution has a number of negative effects on wildlife and humans. It affects migration, reproduction, feeding, and our internal clockwork. Denying darkness is futile. It is as essential to maintaining our biological welfare as light itself. The regular oscillation of waking and sleep in our lives is nothing less than a biological expression of the regular oscillation of light on Earth. So fundamental are these rhythms to our being that messing with them is akin to altering our center of gravity.

Living in a glare of our own making, we have cut ourselves off from our evolutionary and cultural heritage – the light of the stars and the rhythms of day and night. In a very real sense, light pollution causes us to lose sight of our true place in the universe, to forget the scale of our being, which is best measured against the dimensions of a deep night with the Milky Way arching overhead.<eos>"

The founder of a large company recently announced that his company would no longer track employees’ paid holiday time. The move was inspired by an internet company that has implemented a similar policy. The founder stated that employees can take as much leave as they want, as long as they feel comfortable that their absence will not damage the business. However, there are concerns about the practicality of this policy. The company has a large number of employees and provides a wide range of services. It is difficult to assess whether an employee’s absence would harm the business. Additionally, there is the pressure from colleagues and office gossip concerning who was off when, and for how long. These factors could lead to decreased productivity and increased stress for employees. The policy could also result in a sort of paralysis, where workers do not feel able to take their entitled leave or continue to use their statutory rights as a guideline.<eos>"

Journal-based peer review is a process that ensures the quality of scientific research papers. It is often seen as a way to prevent the publication of flawed or nonsensical papers. However, the process can also be time-consuming, sometimes delaying the publication of a paper by a year. Some scientists believe that the benefits of journal-based peer review outweigh the costs, while others are not so sure. Preprints, which are drafts of papers that are posted online without having been peer reviewed, are a growing trend that is changing the way scientists publish their work. Preprints bring academics back to the core of research publication, which is the rapid dissemination of new results. They also make it easier for scientists to critique and build upon each other's work. However, preprints also have some drawbacks, such as the risk of being rejected by journals or the potential for the spread of inaccurate information. Despite these challenges, many scientists believe that preprints have the potential to improve the scientific publishing process.<eos>"

When I ask my students what a poem is, they often give me answers that are like ""a painting in words."" Their answers rarely satisfy me or them. One day, I asked a group to choose an object and write one paragraph describing it empirically, as a scientist might, and another in the first person, from the point of view of the item itself. The exercise led to much amusement and useful discussion.

A poem is a thing made. Poets sometimes compare poems to wild animals or machines. But such comparisons fall apart upon closer analysis. The most productive thing about trying to define a poem through comparison lies not in the comparison itself but in the debate. A poem is a product of writing and rewriting just like an article, story, or novel, yet it never really becomes what they usually are – a thing created in order to become a commodity.

A poem is a home for deep feelings, stunning images, tender reflections and/or biting wit. It can also be a source of inspiration and creativity. Poems can make us see commonplace things in a new light and can help us to experiment with our well-trodden patterns of thought.<eos>"

I bought a metal detector soon after I was married. It was a lot of money then, but it has given me a lot of pleasure. One day, I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first outing. Over the years, I've found many other interesting things. But the most important thing I found was a torc. It's a beautiful necklace of gold and silver. It's the most famous object from Iron Age Britain. I carried it to the car and showed it to my wife. We didn't try it on, because the risk of damaging it was too great. I hid it in our wardrobe and felt anxious. Finally, I carried it into the council office and gave it to the authorities. The torc has been far more than just a lucky windfall. It's something I've saved for the nation.<eos>"

Sleeping is one of my favorite travel pleasures. I sometimes feel a little guilty when I talk about it because I know that my friends have planned their trips very carefully. They pencil in every second of precious travel time with activities like museums and mountain treks. But I smile encouragingly and don't say much. What would they think if they knew that my own travel itineraries include yawningly empty slots for naps and lazy mornings. Better sleep is one of travel's happy side effects. When I visited Mexico's Yucatán coast in my early 20s, I was surprised by how many hours – more than 12 – I spent sleeping most days. There were lots of noisy birds in the neighboring lot, but it didn't matter. Surrounded by strange smells and sounds, I could plunge into a sleep that was more profound, dream-filled, and enjoyable than I imagined possible. Sleep is something else too: it's an experience that changes rhythm, sometimes dramatically, from place to place. People obsess about jet lag, but I suspect that the difficulties I experience recovering from long journeys have more to do with local and cultural adjustment than time zones. When I finally fall into the local sleep pattern, I feel I have truly arrived.<eos>"

I was flying east all night and woke up to see that it was already daylight. The landscape below was empty and I could see no sign of human life. The view was beautiful and rolled away in an otherworldly blend of mountains, streams and forests to an endless horizon. I shook my head and smiled at my neighbour who woke up and smiled at me. He was a salesman from Moscow who was flying to the outer limits of civilisation in order to sell safety clothing to the local mining industries.

I explained to him that I was flying to the far-eastern Siberian city of Magadan with only a one-way ticket because I was planning to return home to England by bicycle. He was unconvinced and pointed out that there was no road from Magadan. I explained that I had reason to believe that there was a road, though not many people used it these days. He still looked unconvinced.

I wrote to my friend Al and asked him if he wanted to cycle across the Karakorum Highway between Pakistan and China this summer. He agreed and we started planning the trip. It was six years later that I was going to join Al in Siberia. I was working as a geography teacher and I was still far from having full control of my classes, but I was happy with the job and I had great long holidays.

I envied Al in many ways. He was having an extraordinary adventure, finding that he could deal with each new challenge even if it seemed impossible. He was proving wrong the sceptics who had told him he could not do it. He was doing something that scared him nearly every day and it made him feel alive.<eos>"

In the Red Bull Air Race, twelve pilots race through a series of pylons between 15 and 25 meters high. They negotiate sharp turns, barrel rolls and loops at speeds of up to 370 km per hour. I was invited to find out what it feels like to take part. I had to sign two forms before the flight. The first confirmed that I was in good health, the second that I would empty all my pockets. I also learned that I would have to try to stay orientated throughout the flight. I was told to relax and enjoy the view. Half an hour before the flight, I had a safety briefing in which I was told not to touch anything. By the time we were taxiing down the runway, I was ready to fly. I ignored all instructions received and would not relax and enjoy the flight. This is the cruel paradox of high-speed acrobatic flying. In order to survive it without passing out, you have to keep calm and focused. You have to tense up at the right time and you have to relax at the right time. Panicking is a bad idea.

Doug Allan is a wildlife cameraman who films wild animals in cold places. He has filmed many major TV wildlife series. Allan says that his perfect temperature is -18C. He trained as a marine biologist and commercial diver. Diving was his first passion, where he learned about survival in cold places.

One day, Allan was working in Antarctica when he was approached by a TV crew to film a wildlife documentary. He took the crew to different places and realized that being a wildlife cameraman ticked all the boxes: travel, adventure, and underwater.

Allan says that wildlife filming is full of great successes, but also failures and embarrassments. He has experienced both. One time, he was in the Orkneys to film kittiwakes, but he could not identify which birds they were. Another time, he was filming sequences for a major TV series in Kong Karls Land, where he had to walk five or more hours a day and watch polar bear dens in the snow slopes for 23 days.

Allan would like to make his own film about climate change in the Arctic. He says he would be able to make an extraordinary documentary.<eos>"

In 2004, Pen Hadow became the first person to trek to the North Pole alone and without being resupplied on the way. He made it to the South Pole as well. Now he is back in the Arctic again, preparing for an expedition he says is even more ambitious.

Pen is a skilled explorer. He has to be. This time, however, there is far more at stake. He will set out on a three-month, 1,000-kilometer trek to the North Pole, taking detailed measurements of the thickness and density of the ice. Nobody has ever done this before, and he knows the results will be of vital importance to the scientific community.

Pen is married to Mary, a horsewoman, who says he has a ‘spine of steel’ and who shares his love of the outdoors. They live in the country with their two children.

Pen is going to be 47 on Thursday. He has done far less training than he’s comfortable with. Why? Because organizational things always seem more urgent.

Pen believes his mission reconnects exploration with the search for knowledge that drove previous generations into the unknown.<eos>"

I was beginning to miss the feeling of rowing, but I wasn’t ready to commit to the training regime. I spoke to some of my rowing colleagues about whether they fancied the race, but I didn’t get any enthusiastic responses. I knew that if I entered the race, I would want to win. I also had to take into account the loss of earnings that would result from being away from home. Participating in the race would mean I wouldn’t just be talking about past achievements. I’d actually be doing something again which I could bring in: rowing across the Atlantic. I learned a lot while planning this adventure, but one of the biggest lessons was to be thankful for the easy life of a full-time athlete.<eos>"

They agreed to take me on as a husky dog handler for the winter season. From December to February, there is plenty of business taking tourists out on sled rides. The dogs are almost hysterical with excitement, straining against the ropes in their desperation to be off.

When my first cookery programme, In Search of Perfection, first came out, I was unsure of how it would be received. There had been a lot of talk about the food 'revolution' happening in Britain, and I was certain that we had produced a series of programmes that made a genuinely innovative contribution to that. I watched the first programme and was relieved that it was well-received. The success of the show paved the way for other fascinating projects, including a book based on my experiences at the restaurant I own. In each project, there is a sense of being on a journey, whether it's into the past, into the mind, or into cookery techniques. I wrote several books in a series called 'Perfection', each one accompanying its own TV programme of the same name. In these books, the journey was often physical, with passports and suitcases and itineraries. The latest book in the series, In Search of Total Perfection, takes you on a journey around the globe to meet extraordinary artisans. Despite the book's title, I knew from the outset that I wouldn't be claiming the recipes were in any way 'definitive'. But I reckoned that, by using my technical skill and scientific knowledge, I could pin down some of the things that made these dishes work.<eos>"

It's not good to spend too much time online. You need to get out into the real world, said Dad. He's difficult to argue with, so I decided to find out what people who have studied the subject say – and it’s quite interesting. Generally, research shows that most teenagers who use social media have a wide circle of real-life friends, a good sense of identity and belonging, and are developing the essential technical skills we need to be citizens of a digital age.

Social networking has become an integral part of modern childhood. Teenagers don’t consume media – dipping in and out to buy airline tickets or check e-mails as adults do – they inhabit it. It performs a similar function to hanging around at the youth club, as today’s parents used to do when they were younger.

Adolescence is a time when you are asking, who am I? Social networking can help you develop that self-identity. You can post notices about your favourite music or sports, discover what you enjoy, and you are constantly reminded that other people have different ways of looking at things.

Teenagers who use social networking as a creative force will reap the benefits when they become adults and enter the world of work. Collaboration is a real 21st-century skill, and an important part of being employable in a digital age.<eos>"

When most people think of a family vacation, I guess a road trip through the western states in the US and Canada doesn’t immediately come to mind. However, my parents clearly weren’t looking to put their feet up as they organized our summer vacation this year. My dad seemed to have taken it upon himself to plan the ultimate family bonding trip.

We packed our car full of suitcases, coolers, and clothing. Though I was thrilled, I was sure going to miss my privacy for the next two weeks. We set off on ‘The Family Great American Road Trip’. As we drove west, out through the Oklahoma panhandle, I sensed a pattern forming. The days began to blend together, but each adventure was still distinct. We stopped at a town in Oklahoma under the darkest star-filled skies in the nation. We learned the rule of the road: cattle get the right-of-way. We moved on to Pagosa Springs, Colorado. The heavy smell of sulfur in that friendly tourist town gave us a taste of what we were going to experience later in our journey.

Our journey was filled with adventures. We climbed mountains, visited ancient ruins, and saw bears. We also learned a lot about the history of the region. After watching a rainstorm blow through from a cozy perch in our hotel in Canada, my family and I made our free-fall back south again.

My brother was busy, so I decided a group holiday might suit me. The man at the Greek port was curious when I asked for a single ferry ticket. I explained I wouldn't be alone for long; I’d be joining ten others to swim around the tiny islands. We did a short swim to split us into speed groups, then it was time for our first proper swim. I was nervous. I'd trained in my local pool, and done some river swimming, but never long distances in the open sea. Soon, the waves got bigger and I was at the back of the slow group - not at all where I’d hoped. I watched faster swimmers moving ahead like dolphins.

I love my job as a flight attendant. I’ve been to many places, including the US and Australia. I work with great people, have a lot of time off, and life is always exciting.

When I was a child, I often flew unaccompanied to boarding school. I felt lonely, so I would ask the flight attendants to let me help give out meals to passengers. And I guess that’s the thing I remembered later, when I needed an escape from my banking job and began looking for a new direction. There was a lot of young people at the interview, and many were accepted. They were often highly qualified like me, and were changing careers.

Before the interview, I practised what to say. I mentioned my strengths and previous work experience – and I got the job! I’d recommend this kind of work to anyone, as there are so many things that make it worthwhile.

When I’m not working, I don’t have to take work home. And if I do get difficult passengers, which is rare, I always know the flight will soon be over and I’ll probably never see them again.<eos>"

At the summer camp where I work, I really enjoy seeing the children succeed at things they never thought they could do. Most of the children know how to swim and play table-tennis, but rock climbing is a new experience for most of them. Some children feel very nervous, but after some encouragement they agree to try and they all get to the top in the end. This makes them feel great. We do get children who miss home at the beginning of the week. It's not the really young ones who feel like that the most – it's actually the ten- to thirteen-year-olds. We don't let them use their mobile phones all the time. We tell them they can phone home after lunch and when they ask again, usually after dinner, we say it's a bit late to phone now, do it tomorrow. Most children are fine in a couple of days and at the end of their week's stay, they all come up to us and thank us because they have had a great time.<eos>"

Rock the Planet, a musical show where actors also have to be good musicians, opened in London last year. The show was voted 'Best Musical' four times in the USA. It was challenging to do the show with an all-British cast of actors because the UK has limits on how many performances young actors can do weekly. Luckily, the director found plenty of talented UK-based actors. The theatre in London is bigger than the US venue, but it's been full every night.

I met 11-year-old Jamie, one of the show’s actors. He said that he gets paid to play and that he was very pleased with himself when he finally got a song right. He also told me about his school lessons and his classmates' reaction to the show.
