Some time ago, there was a website that talked about the risks of public check-ins. It said that if you post something online, it can be seen by a lot of people. This website confirmed that there can be downsides to sharing your life online. However, it also said that there are a lot of benefits to sharing your life online. For example, you can gain wealth and fame.

The website also talked about the early days of the internet. In the early days, people could use the internet to share their work and personal information. One of the first people to use the internet to share his personal information was a young man named Justin Hall. Hall started a blog and wrote about his life. His blog was popular and many people read it. However, Hall's blog was also controversial. Some people thought that he was being too personal.

The website also talked about the risks of sharing your personal information online. For example, if you share your address or phone number online, people may be able to use that information to harm you. If you share your personal information online, you should be aware of the risks.<eos>"

A long time ago, some scientists started a campaign to warn people about a movie called What the Bleep Do We Know? which showed that there is a lot about the universe that we don’t understand. The movie made some pretty amazing claims, but some scientists felt that it was not credible. They argued that the evidence was not strong enough to support the claims made in the movie. However, the movie did inspire some people to learn more about science and the universe. It also made people realize that the universe is much stranger than we could ever imagine.

Writing novels is a challenge, while writing short stories is a joy. It is like planting a forest or a garden. The two processes complement each other, creating a complete landscape. Writing novels is like planting a forest, and writing short stories is like planting a garden. The two processes complement each other, creating a complete landscape.

Since the beginning of my career as a fiction writer, I have fairly consistently alternated between writing novels and short stories. I write novels and short stories in different ways. It takes me about a week to get a short story into some kind of decent shape.

I find writing short stories a necessary change of pace and a way to experiment. They are like soft shadows I have set out in the world, faint footprints I have left behind. Short stories are like guideposts to my heart, and it makes me happy as a writer to be able to share these intimate feelings with my readers.<eos>"

Science is a powerful force that has greatly impacted human life. It has improved our lives and presented challenges. It has also inspired artists and thinkers. Science has its beauty and its dangers. It has been used to explain the universe and to cure diseases. However, science is not perfect. It is constantly changing and evolving. Scientists come in many colors, and their work is often characterized by conflict. The history of science is filled with examples of scientific change and progress. Science has also been used to control nature. We have the ability to manipulate the future, and science plays a big role in that. We need to be aware of the power and potential dangers of science. We also need to be prepared for the future that science will bring.<eos>"

From around 2015, sales of ebooks had started to decline. This led to doubts about the long-term potential of ebooks in the publishing industry. Some people feared that ebooks would kill print books. However, there is evidence to suggest that digital and print can coexist in the market. The idea of the disappearing book is powerful because it tells us much more about the mixture of exhilaration and fear we feel about innovation and change in general.

The emergence of new technologies often leads to fears about the demise of existing media. This is because we create emotional bonds with different media as they become a core part of our life. As a result, the emergence of a new technology can cause us to adjust our bond with something that has become an integral part of our day-to-day life.

The spread of the printing press and the shift from silent to sound movies have stimulated nostalgia for older forms of media. This is because we often long for what we used to know, but no longer have. As a result, entire industries develop around retro products and older technologies.<eos>"

Every day, I wake up early, brush my teeth, make coffee, and write about how some of the greatest minds of the past have approached their work. I write about the details of their daily lives, such as their sleep, eating, working, and worrying. I hope to provide a new perspective on their personalities and careers.

I also talk about my own struggles with creativity and productivity. I have concerns about how to do meaningful creative work while also earning a living. I have tried to provide examples of how a variety of brilliant and successful people have confronted similar challenges.

The book's title is Daily Rituals. My focus in writing it was really people’s routines. I believe that a solid routine can be a well-worn groove for one’s mental energies and help stave off the tyranny of moods.

As much as possible, I have let my subjects speak for themselves, in quotes from letters, diaries and interviews. I have also included some of my own thoughts and ideas about creativity and productivity.<eos>"

Howard became a palaeontologist because he was interested in dinosaurs. He studied delicate creatures revealed on the surface of grey rocks. He worked on his doctoral thesis and got a job as an Assistant Lecturer at Tavistock College in London. He often found himself contrasting the orderly nature of his professional life with the anarchy of private concerns.

One day, his briefcase was stolen. He was fuming and returned to the college. He made an explanatory phone call and postponed the lecture. He reported the theft to the appropriate authorities and then went for a restorative coffee. He joined a colleague who was entertaining a visiting curator from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. And thus it was that Howard learned of the recently acquired collection of fossils, as yet uncatalogued and unidentified.<eos>"

Charles Spence is a professor of experimental psychology at Oxford University in the UK. He has studied how the senses interact to form our perception of flavour. Through his studies, he has influenced what we eat and drink. He has also studied how food is experienced with others.

Spence has written a book called The Perfect Meal, which is packed with insights that are fascinating to anyone in possession of an appetite. It includes information about how much we eat when eating with others. It also includes information about how music and sound can affect taste.

Spence's lab is un-space-age. It has soundproof booths and stacks of ancient-looking audio-visual equipment. He can afford to work more creatively with cooks because he keeps his overheads low.

Spence is currently helping famous brands through reductions in salt and sugar. He points out that it is in their interests to help loyal customers stay alive for longer.<eos>"

Our brains are very busy these days. We have a lot of information to deal with, including facts, pseudo facts, and rumours. We also do more things than ever before. Thirty years ago, travel agents and salespeople helped us with our travel and shopping needs. Now we do most things ourselves. We’re doing the work of many people while still trying to keep up with our lives, our families, our careers, and our hobbies. Our smartphones have become an important part of our lives. They help us do many things, but they also make it harder to focus.

Multitasking is a powerful and dangerous illusion. It makes us demonstrably less efficient. It also increases the production of stress hormones and makes it harder to learn new information. Lots of multitasking also requires decision-making. It turns out that decision-making is also very hard on our brains. We rapidly spiral into a depleted state in which, after making lots of insignificant decisions, we can end up making truly bad decisions about something important.<eos>"

In a zoo in Sweden, a chimpanzee named Santino spent his nights breaking up concrete into pieces to throw at visitors during the day. Was he being spiteful? In caves in the US, female bats help unrelated fruit bat mothers if they can’t find the right birthing position. Are they being caring? Fifty years ago, people thought that animals had behaviours that produced measurable outcomes, and science recorded those outcomes. But recently that has partially changed. Thanks to research into the behaviour of bats, chimps, and other animals, emotions of animals have gone from being a taboo area of investigation to being tentatively explored. The new research has started a debate about whether animals can be said to have consciousness and conscience. If animals do have consciousness, what does it mean for the production and consumption of beef? The observations may not be disputed, but the interpretation of them is. There are different views on what the new research means for the future of humanity and our relationship with animals. Some people believe that we should stop eating meat, while others believe that we should re-evaluate our view of animal cognition. Ultimately, the question of whether animals have consciousness and conscience is a philosophical one, and there may not be a definitive answer.<eos>"

Critical thinking is a way of interacting with what we read or listen to in order to have a deeper understanding. It involves analyzing, evaluating, and judging information based on its relevance, accuracy, and credibility. Although technology can help us store and process information more easily, it can also make it more difficult to think critically. One of the main concerns is the amount of poor yet charismatic thinking that is available online. It can be overwhelming to reason with so much misinformation and biased information. Additionally, the constant barrage of visual media can make it difficult to focus on a single task and reflect on ideas. However, there are also some benefits to using technology for critical thinking. For example, games such as Sim City and Civilization can teach decision-making and analytical skills. It is important to understand the subtleties of how technology affects thinking and analysis in order to make the most of its benefits and minimize its negative effects.<eos>"

When Matthew Crawford is not writing or thinking about how we ought to live, he works as a motorcycle mechanic. He wrote two books about the benefits of manual trades and philosophy. He was inspired to write his latest book when he was shopping and noticed that advertisements popped up on the credit card machine. He says that these demands on our attention are becoming increasingly difficult to avoid.

Crawford is concerned about the impact of technology on our ability to think and communicate. He argues that technology has created the perfect vehicles for our self-obsession. He says that we are more conscious of other things we might be doing and that this has a social impact.

Crawford's proposed solution has two parts. First, we need regulation of noise and distraction in public space. More importantly, he advocates skilled practices as a way of engaging with the world in a more satisfying way.<eos>"

What do you do for a living? It's a common question that we often answer in a few words. However, if you're a philosopher, it's slightly harder to deal with. Philosophers are no different from the masses, but the misconception that they are is persistent. One reason for this misconception is that philosophers have established themselves as people who judge the activities of others and celebrate intellectual life. Another reason is that the discipline of philosophy has grown increasingly removed from lived experiences. To fix this trend, philosophers need to be more accessible to the public. More recently, I've begun to feel that the title 'ethicist' is insufficient to capture my area of inquiry, because ethics is commonly asserted as being connected to formal codes, values and laws.

Foodies, gourmands, chefs and others who love food might expect that reflecting on what and how we eat can contribute to culinary pleasure. However, philosophical discussions of food have often been about other topics, such as the acquisition of knowledge or the pursuit of pleasure. Food is inherently social and cultural. It is shared with those in our communities and provides us with dining companions and infrastructure. Ethical issues related to food include what we should eat and the extent to which cooking in restaurants and in the home differ. Cooking in the home is often more intimate and inclusive, while cooking for a living has different obligations. Food and dining can also play a role in bridging cultural gaps. We can come to appreciate others by learning to enjoy their food and forge personal bonds with people from other cultures by coming together to eat.<eos>"

Rob Daviau is a US designer who creates legacy board games. He felt that traditional board games were no longer entertaining or challenging enough, so he started to wonder how board games might evolve. He adapted a classic board game called Risk and created a new version called Risk Legacy. Unlike previous board games, decisions made during gameplay had a permanent impact. Players might have to rip up cards, deface the board, or open packets containing new rules. The games play out over the course of a fixed number of sessions and long-held grudges become woven into the fabric of the game.

Legacy board games were never expected to go mainstream, but most players love the concept. They see it as one of the biggest advances in game design for several years. The legacy format draws on video games and the demand for episodic entertainment fuelled by popular TV series.<eos>"

Once upon a time, there was an octopus named Inky who lived in New Zealand. One night, Inky managed to escape from his tank and swim into the Pacific Ocean. It was a story that was shared online and was very popular. One of the things that makes this story so fun is that it involves anthropomorphism, which means treating animals like humans. Octopuses are especially good at anthropomorphism because they are very intelligent creatures. They can open jars, recognize faces, and use coconut shells as armor.

Anthropomorphism is often thought of as unscientific, but Dr. Frans de Waal, who studies primates, argues that it is not. He says that anthropodenial, which is the opposite of anthropomorphism, has too often characterized our attitudes toward other species. Animals have been observed exhibiting many of the key behaviors that were thought to distinguish humans from animals.

De Waal believes that we are emerging from a dark period where animals were not treated well. He also points out that the most effective tests of animal intelligence are designed with a species’ particular traits and skills in mind.<eos>"

Once upon a time, there was a technology called robotics that has the potential to change the world. Robots have already been used in the automotive and manufacturing industries for many years. Experts say that the use of robots is going to increase rapidly in the next few years. This will have a big impact on many different industries.

For example, there is a robot called the Hadrian X that can lay 1,000 bricks in one hour. And there is a robot called Tally that roams supermarket aisles alongside human shoppers. These robots can do things that humans can do, but they can also do things that humans cannot do.

The use of robots is going to create new jobs, but it is also going to displace some jobs. Experts say that we need to prepare for the changes that robots will bring. We need to learn new skills and adapt to new technologies.

With the development of new technologies, such as motion control, sensor technologies, and artificial intelligence, there will be new types of robots that can interact with humans in even more sophisticated ways. These robots will have the potential to change the way we live and work.<eos>"

Maier was born in 1926 and spent much of her childhood in France. She returned to New York in 1951 and came to Chicago to work as a nanny. Maier was a private person but had strong opinions about movies and politics. She was also knowledgeable about theatre and movies.

Maier’s work is the purest form of art. None of it was done for any commercial reason. Her images lean toward women, children, the old, the poor, and the abstract.

Any discussion of English conversation often begins with the weather. It is a traditional part of English conversations. When two English people meet, their first talk is usually about the weather. Most commentators try to explain why the English are so obsessed with the weather. They fail because they start with the wrong assumption. They assume that English people talk about the weather because they have a keen interest in the subject. However, this is not true. Our conversations about the weather are not really about the weather at all. They are a form of 'grooming talk'. This is like what monkeys and apes do when they groom each other's fur. There are certain fixed contexts in which weather-speak is used.

The silence on Centre Court at the Wimbledon tennis championships is very quiet. You can bounce the ball and hit it, and you hear the echo of your own shot. The trimmed grass, the rich history, the ancient stadium, the players dressed in white, and the respectful crowds all combine to enclose and cushion you from the outside world. The quiet of the Centre Court is good for my game. It helps me to focus on the point I’m playing and to shut everything else out.

The silence of the Centre Court is broken by a sudden noise when a point’s done: applause, cheers, people shouting your name. You hear them, but as if from some place far off. You don’t register that there are fifteen thousand people hunched around the arena, tracking every move your opponent and you make. I am so focused I have no sense at all that there are millions watching me around the world as I play Roger Federer in the 2008 Wimbledon final – the biggest match of my life.

I had always dreamed of playing at Wimbledon. My uncle Toni, who has been my coach all my life, had drummed into me from an early age that this was the biggest tournament of them all. By the time I was 14, I was sharing with my friends the fantasy that I’d play there one day and win. Before 2008, though, I’d played and lost, both times against Federer – in the final there the year before, and the year before that. The defeat in 2006 had not been so hard. I went out onto the court that time just pleased and grateful that, having just turned twenty, I’d made it that far. Federer beat me pretty easily, more easily than if I’d gone out with more belief. But my defeat in 2007 left me utterly destroyed. I knew I could have done better, that it was not my ability or the quality of my game that had failed me, but my head. I wept after that loss. I cried incessantly for half an hour in the dressing room. Losing always hurts, but it hurts much more when you have a chance and throw it away.<eos>"

A young Englishwoman named Jane Goodall arrived in Africa in early 1957. She spent most of her life in Africa and became known for her work as a scientist, activist, and environmentalist. She was a pioneer in the study of chimpanzees and her work has had a significant impact on the way humans think about themselves.

Goodall's early childhood showed hints of her future accomplishments. One day, she crawled inside a henhouse to find out how hens lay eggs. This incident demonstrates her curiosity and determination.

Goodall's most significant contribution to the field of anthropology is her long-term study of wild apes in Gombe State, Nigeria. Her book, ""The Chimpanzees of Gombe,"" is considered to be the single most authoritative work on chimpanzees. Her research has revealed important information about chimpanzees, such as their diet, social behavior, and tool use.

Goodall's work has been widely praised for its contribution to the field of anthropology. She has been called ""one of the Western world's great scientific achievements."" Her achievements have also inspired many people to learn more about chimpanzees and the importance of conservation.<eos>"

I took the guitar to the rubbish dump and was about to put it on a pile of rubbish, when a young man came up to me and asked if I was going to throw it away. I said yes and he asked if he could have it. I gave it to him and felt sad that I had done something wrong.

A few months later, I received an email from a stranger who said he had found my guitar. I was surprised and happy to hear that my guitar had been found. I contacted the stranger and he offered to sell me the guitar back. I bought it back and felt like I had been given a second chance.

I started playing the electric guitar again and I felt like I was back in my teenage years. I remembered my parents presenting me with the guitar and I felt like I was playing it for them. I also remembered the feeling of playing the guitar when I was first learning. It was a lot of fun and I felt like I was a rock star.<eos>"

There has been a lot of talk about sleep lately. Sleep is very important for our mental, physical, and social well-being. It seems that people who have the hardest time sleeping are the ones who most appreciate how important sleep is. Dreams are important too. They help us find new patterns and create combinations that break through our usual habits of thinking.

When you wake up in the morning, the sleep you sacrifice is mainly REM or 'Rapid Eye Movement', the most dream-rich stage of sleep. Our most vivid, memorable and emotionally powerful dreams occur mainly in the stage of REM just before we wake up in the morning.

Dreams are where we bring things together in fresh, often surprising ways. They draw on stores of knowledge from the past and present to find new associations. When people are awakened out of REM and asked to say what comes to their minds in response to a certain word, their responses are more original than when awoken from other stages of sleep.<eos>"

It was twenty years ago that Susie Ray left London for a small coastal town in south-west England. She is a copyist artist who can reproduce the richness of an early-20th-century impressionist masterpiece as easily as the brilliance of a 16th-century Caravaggio portrait.

Susie has been in great demand since her 30 years as a copyist artist. She has painted the works of numerous great artists, including Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh. Her reproductions are so faithful that art experts mistake them for the originals.

However, Susie has always been open about what she does. When she reproduces an old masterpiece, she will make it look as authentic as possible. But she will put her own signature on the back of the canvas.

Susie has also been teaching younger painters. She stresses the importance of learning to draw and to represent things accurately. She also emphasises how much she’s studied to be able to do what she does.<eos>"

Jordan Romero is 13 years old and wants to be the youngest person to climb Mount Everest. If he succeeds, he could become one of the most famous teenagers of his generation. Young people are spending more time on computers and games consoles, so Jordan hopes to inspire kids to climb their own mountains. He has already climbed five of the Seven Summits and might actually do it before his teenage years are over.

There are some concerns about taking a young climber up Everest. Many people think that a young climber might not be emotionally strong enough or have enough experience. But Jordan's parents believe that their own experience as climbers will help them guide their son safely.

Jordan is motivated by his goal and is focused on achieving it. He knows that he has to play the media game if he wants to inspire others. This means blogging, sitting for photo shoots and giving interviews. He has to offer something spectacular. Like climbing Everest.<eos>"

When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, it's probably not classical music they're listening to. Most people our age can name a few pop groups, but few of us know who Brahms was. I have just started doing a music degree, but the people on my course know no more about classical music than anyone else our age. If you don’t know who wrote the music, you are unlikely to own any recordings of their work. The statistics are depressing for a lover of classical music. Apparently only a small percentage of concert tickets sold last year were for classical music events, and the average classical recording sells a small number of copies. I still find that hard to believe. So, what has caused this decline in interest for a type of music that has lasted for centuries? The simple truth is that classical music just doesn’t hold much attraction for most people, and that is particularly true of teenagers. There are a few reasons why teenagers don’t like classical music. First, the pace and rhythm of classical music are problematic for us. Second, pop music is structurally quite simple and therefore easy to listen to. Third, the subject matter of pop music is more appealing than a lengthy piece of classical music with no lyrics. Finally, the way we listen to music has changed. Nowadays, you can find any music you want at the click of a mouse, and yet the sound track to our lives is rarely classical.<eos>"

When I woke up this morning, I didn’t mean to damage the carpet. I was trying to find a way of fitting my corner cabinet into a corner. Gran had given me the cabinet when she moved out of her house into a flat. It’s really cute! I keep my collection of shells and fossils and interesting stones there.

The problem was, the cabinet was too tall to fit into the angle between the roof and the floor. If I could only slice a couple of centimetres off the bottom of it... That was when it came to me. If I couldn’t slice anything off Gran’s cabinet, how about cutting a hole in the carpet? It just seemed like the obvious solution. What Dad calls lateral thinking. I reckoned he would be quite pleased with me. He is always telling us to ‘think outside the box’. And that was exactly what I was doing!<eos>"

The novel 'The Borrowers' is about a family of tiny people who live hidden in the walls and floors of a house. They secretly borrow things from the normal-sized people in order to survive. When the author asked me to direct a TV adaptation of the novel, I knew it was going to be hard to live up to people’s expectations. The most crucial thing was getting the scale right. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans, so I had to make sure that the actors looked small. I also had to get the costumes right. The costumes were made out of heavy canvas material so that they stuck out in the way that dolls’ clothes do. Unfortunately, the weather was really hot during filming. Most of the action that takes place away from the Borrowers’ home had to be shot with the actors separated from their surroundings. We filmed them in front of a blue screen on an otherwise empty set. It was a challenge for them to react to things that weren’t physically there.

Mom pulls to a stop at the corner of my new school, Palm Grove High school. She looks around nervously, looking for journalists that aren’t there. I tell her everything is going to be fine. She kisses her fingertip and touches my cheek right before I get out of the car. Then she’s off, leaving me alone with this whole new school, whole new situation to deal with.

I walk in the school’s main office and get my schedule. English Literature, first period. Cool, I can deal with that. But I’m late. English is in Room 214, second floor. I studied the map the night before, as I didn’t want to look like a complete buffoon searching for my classes.

When I get to the door, I hear the teacher already taking roll. I slip in undetected and slide into the last desk in the second row. The girl next to me smiles. She scans over my very normal and, might I add, very clever outfit – jeans and a T-shirt. Ha! Nobody will ever suspect me now!

The teacher pauses in the roll taking. ‘Desert... McGraw?’ she says hesitantly. ‘Here.’ The teacher then smiles and introduces herself as Ms. Smigla. She talks a lot and eventually hands us our course outlines. After we review them and she tells us all about books we’re required to read this year, she actually gives us time to socialize!

In the United States, teenage girls are expected to be Student Council presidents and have part-time jobs, volunteer, and excel in all of these fields. Being an American teenager today is challenging. There are a lot of stresses that teenagers have, such as homework, tests, and extra-curricular activities. Many teenagers start their days early and end late, leaving them with little time for leisure activities.

Teenagers have a lot of responsibilities. They have to do their homework, take care of themselves, and help out at home. They also have to deal with the pressure of being constantly reachable. With the introduction of smart phones and social media, students can now take their work on the go and do their homework wherever they happen to be.

Despite the challenges, teenagers are still proving to be resilient and capable. Many teenagers are involved in volunteer work and are making a positive impact in their communities. There is evidence that teenagers are taking the world by storm and are forcing the world forward.<eos>"

The teenage members of the Earth to Sky Calculus Club live in Bishop, a mountain town in the US, surrounded by wilderness. They have launched over fifty balloons to the edge of space. It's a long-running science project that includes astronomy experiments and backcountry adventures. I joined them one weekend in late spring. They were releasing a high-altitude balloon, hoping to record shooting stars.

As it got dark, the teenagers secured a soft insulated lunch box to the bottom of the balloon. Inside was a camera, an instrument to measure altitude, and a thermometer. Two GPS trackers were mounted on the outside of the lunch box to help the group find it later. They used a gas tank to inflate the balloon and watched it ascend.

After the launch, most of the students went home, but a few stayed to watch the shooting stars. They lay on blankets on the mountainside and gazed at a sky so clear, it was hard to believe you're just four hours from Los Angeles.

The recovery team found the lunch box the next day. It was in a canyon, high on a flat rock, in the middle of a cascading waterfall. The camera hadn't recorded any shooting stars. Sure, it's a bit of a disappointment, but it's also a perfect opportunity to argue over the effects of atmospheric waves, and how they might work above mountain ridges.<eos>"

When you're travelling by car with your family, even when you're young, you know that you're not 'there yet,' even as you're asking over and over 'Are we there yet?' Once you get there, it's not 'there' anymore, it's 'here'. If you really think there's a chance that you're 'there' yet, you should be asking 'Are we here yet?'.

There are a lot of things to do on long car trips. You can watch DVDs, listen to music, or play puzzles. You can also act as co-pilot and help your parents keep the car running smoothly.

But sometimes, things don't go smoothly. Your sibling might put their foot on your side of the seat or hurl their whole body over into your space. If this happens, you might get angry and start fighting. But your parents will probably be there to help you calm down.

Over the years, your parents have developed strategies for dealing with kids on long car trips. One strategy is to answer the question 'Are we there yet?' with the answer 'No, you're not there yet.' Another strategy is to offer a reward for being quiet.

So once and for all, please note: if mum and dad are still near enough to answer your question, then the answer is: no. You're not there yet.<eos>"

John and Zuzi Morgan have opened a café in Oxford, UK, where people can enjoy coffee, cake, and board games. They hope that people will enjoy the experience so much that they will want to repeat it. Zuzi explains why they decided to turn their love of tabletop games into a full-time business: 'There’s so much technology. Everybody’s busy on their mobile phones and other gadgets. We wanted to bring people back together in a way that’s not just staring at screens. It’s a natural thing in people. We're supposed to be together and communicating with each other.'

The games that are played in John and Zuzi's café are called Eurogames. They are known for their relatively gentle themes, such as farming and landscape-building. The first game of this type was The Settlers of Catan, which was created by a German designer. Pandemic, a Eurogame in which players must collaborate to solve global problems, was created by a North American, Matt Leacock.

The growth of the video games industry has also contributed to the success of these modern, ingeniously designed board games. Video games and board games have learned a lot from each other. As is evident in John and Zuzi's busy and popular café, tabletop gaming has become more than entertainment. In our increasingly online society, games have become something to be shared, directly and physically, in the real world.<eos>"

For her latest challenge, Helen walked on a high wire, a long thin piece of metal, 66 meters above the ground. There was no safety net, only a belt around her waist attached to another wire above. To help her keep her balance and not to fall, she carried a long stick, weighing eight kilograms. Helen took lessons from an expert high-wire walker. Although she already had a few circus skills, she quickly discovered that high-wire walking was completely different. The training was a shock, said Helen. 'I didn’t realise how strong I’d need to be. Every day started at 8 am with a run up a steep hill; then came an hour of exercises, with another hour of them after my day practising on the wire.

I work at a university in the US where my team and I are learning more about water birds, particularly one called the American black duck. We have started using a new piece of equipment called a night-vision scope, which allows us to see the ducks in the dark. We are worried about black ducks mainly because their numbers have fallen hugely and we don’t know whether there’s enough food on the east coast for these animals. We have lots of information about their daytime activities, but nothing about what they do at night, because we simply haven’t had the equipment. But this new ‘scope’ will produce really clear pictures, even on moonless nights, so we’ll be able to find out more and make better decisions about looking after the area where they live based on what we learn. It is very hard work. There are four of us, each working six hours daily. We have studied ducks in different locations, and I have had to take a boat to some sites and make notes on every duck I see. The weather hasn’t helped – some nights are mild, but more often it’s wet. Oh, and it’s so quiet I’ve needed lots of coffee to stop me falling asleep! We’ve only missed one working day so far, because the snow was too deep even for our special snow vehicles. Still I like the challenge of it, especially compared to what the summer will bring – hours in a laboratory, where we’ll look at our results together. It’ll be hard to be stuck inside – but it’s essential to do this. And I wouldn’t change it for anything!<eos>"

Last year, I went on a trip to the west coast of Canada. It was my brother Harry’s idea. He’s a journalist, like me, and he wanted to write articles about the trip. I had dreamt of visiting the area ever since I saw it on TV as a child. So I asked Harry if I could go too – until he finally agreed. There were storms in the area we were going to, but luckily the weather was calm. We joined the group, packed our supplies into small boats and set off. We stopped for hours to explore the rock pools on the beaches along the coast. They were full of amazing coloured fish. And it was great to be able to stop caring about how quickly or slowly the day was passing. We never forgot lunch or dinner, though, which we all made together over camp fires. When I finally fell asleep on the boats each evening, it really felt like stress-free living. When the time came to leave, I was sad. But I knew if I stayed, I’d miss family and friends. I was also looking forward to telling everyone at home about our adventures.<eos>"

My dad was a professional basketball player in Germany, as his father had been before him. I went to watch many of his games when I was a kid. I loved telling my friends how good my dad was, but I used to take a book with me to read instead of watching. Starting secondary school, I was already tall and my sports teacher asked me if I’d be interested in training with the basketball team. I enjoyed the session, but I thought I’d need to develop my skills before I took part in a real match. It took me a while to agree, but a few weeks later, I found myself playing against a team from another school. It was OK in the end. I practised every day and did really well, even joining an adult team before I moved abroad to a special sports academy in the USA when I was fifteen. I got used to my new life in the end, though, and my English improved quickly too! I turned professional at the age of eighteen, and I’ve never regretted it.

Seven years ago, I was studying tourism and needed to find a part-time job. I decided to become a weekend tour guide in my home city, Chicago. I enjoyed giving tours and seeing the city from a new perspective. After finishing my studies, I decided to go into tour guiding full-time. To become a full-time tour guide, I had to learn a lot of things. I had to be able to answer hundreds of questions about the city, and I also had to be able to be entertaining and tell interesting stories. I need to make sure visitors are happy with my tours, otherwise they could post a negative review online. Like most tour guides, I realise that these reviews are really important, as good reviews attract more customers. That’s why making tours fun and stress-free is essential.

**Questions:**

1. What did the author study at college?
2. What did the author have to learn to become a full-time tour guide?
3. What is the most important thing for a tour guide to be able to do?

My name is Ella and I'm 22. Last year I went to Thailand for two weeks with my sister Josie. We went to help as volunteers at an elephant sanctuary. We collected the elephants' food and washed the elephants in the river. We also led the elephants on foot into the forest area. The part of the day I most looked forward to was the evening. By the light of the moon, we led the elephants on foot into the forest area where they spent the night. The meals were delicious. After dinner, all the volunteers and staff spent the evenings talking and playing games. Now that we’re back in the UK, Josie doesn’t often talk about Thailand. But if anyone asks her if she enjoyed her time at the sanctuary, she says she loved it.

I’m Gina D’Costa and I run a flower shop in the UK. We sell flowers to people who buy them for friends, their homes, or other occasions. Sometimes we take part in photo sessions for businesses. Once I decorated a castle with flowers for a wedding. It took a lot of work but I was really proud of the job we’d done.

My day starts at 4 a.m. when I go to the market to buy fresh flowers. It’s usually cold and dark at that time, but I don’t let it worry me. The market has a lot of different flowers. I like to choose pink flowers, but I have to remember that what I like and what other people want aren’t necessarily the same thing. Sometimes I have to argue with the flower-sellers about prices. It’s not always possible to find all the flowers that customers want. But I try to get the best price possible. Back at the shop, I look at customer orders and set up vases with the flowers I’ve bought. Then I create bunches of flowers and work out how much the orders will cost. Customers are often surprised by how expensive they are. I sometimes have to ask them to think again about what they’d like.

I like my job because I can put together the nicest possible flowers for the amount of money someone wants to spend. I wouldn’t want any other job.<eos>"

My city has a modern cinema that shows all the latest films I want to see, and lots of films for kids at the weekends. It’s close to where I live, but a year ago, I realised something was missing – the experience of discussing a film in detail with a group of people after watching it with them. So, together with two friends, I started a film club. We decided to keep our costs low, so we don’t hire a cinema. Instead, we choose a different location in the city each month. We’re happy to make enough to cover our costs – we’re not trying to make a profit. Each time we show a film, everything is a bit easier for us. We also know how many tickets we’ve sold because everything’s online. There’s still always plenty to do, but when people of all ages come up at the end to say what a great experience they’ve had, it’s wonderful. We’ve started a blog, too, because we know that most people now go online for information about films, rather than read reviews in local papers. We’ve also tried putting up a few posters in cafés. Nothing’s as successful as word of mouth, though – people recommending us to their friends.

Taking photographs was always my favourite activity as a child. When I was 15, I felt that if I wanted to take my hobby to the next level, I had to do something special. So I decided to start a personal project: I would take one photograph every day for a whole year of my life. I was amazed to discover that there were others who liked the way I saw and photographed things. I was also enjoying photographing a wide range of subjects. As a result I sometimes had doubts about my project, and I almost gave up several times. In the end, however, I trusted my own feelings, and became more confident about my photographic style and choices. One day I showed my project to my art teacher at school. She told me about a national photography competition for people my age. So I entered some of my photos, just for fun.

Last year, I joined the National Youth Challenge (NYC) because I knew they went camping and sailing and taught skills like public speaking. The NYC is a program where you can do different activities to challenge yourself and learn new things. There are different levels, from beginner to advanced, run by adult volunteers called ‘leaders’. When you complete each level, you get a certificate.

When I first joined, my leader suggested that my first challenge should be helping to organise activities at a local children’s club for two hours a week. I was a bit hesitant at first, but I decided to take up the challenge. Soon, I was spending all my free time at the children’s club. It meant a lot more to me than just getting the certificate. And when I finished the challenge, the NYC leader let me keep on volunteering at the club because I’d built up some great relationships with the children. Now I’m there for about four hours a week and I always really look forward to going.

Because of what I’ve learnt at the children’s club, I’ve decided that when I finish school in three years’ time I want to go to college to become a qualified youth worker – someone who works with children. I’ve improved my own communication skills while at the same time helping others. I’ve got several other NYC certificates now and yes, one of them is for camping.<eos>"

I was born in Denver, USA. I started snowboarding when I was eight years old. My dad took me to a resort in the mountains, about two hours from Denver. The hill was very steep, so my dad had to do a lot of persuading to get me on a board. I managed to snowboard well. After this experience, I started competing aged ten. I enjoy snowboarding and I also like to compete. I have won lots of competitions. I have to think carefully about my future.

When I was fifteen, I wanted everything my friends had. I didn't plan ahead, like I had no idea what I wanted to do when I left school. One day, my best friend got a new phone and I thought I should have one too. My parents said I could only have it if I paid for it myself, so I decided to work part-time and save as much as I could. I owe my parents a lot for making me do that – it taught me a really valuable lesson. I worked every Saturday in a café, but I didn’t really enjoy it. My parents suggested starting my own little business instead. I asked my mum if I could have a go at making necklaces, and I found it was easy to learn. I sold my first items of jewellery to my friends and family. They told me they were delighted with them, but I still needed convincing that they looked good enough to be popular with the public. There was only one way to find out, so I rented a market stall with my mum. Soon we were receiving calls from all over the country from people looking to buy more. It's been such a lot of fun so far.

When Janine Stuart was young, she wrote a novel called Being Amelia which became a bestseller. Being Amelia is based on Janine’s life. In one interview, Janine said, ‘Because of my family’s moving around a lot, I’ve become good at making new friends. I understand what it’s like to be the only new student in a class, and that helped me to write about how the main character, Amelia, gets on in a new school.

Janine started her novel one summer, when she was feeling bored at home. Her mother had always dreamt of becoming a published author herself, and her teachers had always encouraged her to write, so it seemed like a natural way for Janine to pass the time. The year before, she’d entered a short story competition on a young writers’ website and won first prize. That’s why, when Janine finished Being Amelia and sent it to a publishing company, the people who worked there were immediately keen to read it. They loved it, and a year later, Janine’s novel was on sale in bookshops.

One review of Being Amelia mentions how, despite the book having pictures of happy teenagers on the cover, the people in the story actually face some difficult challenges. This is what really allows readers to believe in them. The reviewer says that although Janine is still very young, and Being Amelia isn’t a particularly long novel, she’s clearly shown that she’s a better writer than several other best-selling authors.<eos>"

My name is Tom. I am fifteen years old. Three years ago, my family and I moved into a castle on a small island. My dad was invited to be the castle’s manager. He works for an organisation that looks after historical buildings. We were excited about the move at first, but it took a while to adjust to life on the island. The castle isn’t very beautiful, but our apartment is comfortable. The island feels very sociable in the summer, but there aren’t many teenagers among the other families. The adults all support each other and help with repairs on the island. The biggest change for me was travelling by boat every day. I was looking forward to going on stormy days, but the ferries don’t run then. And I’ve discovered that if I miss the bus to the harbour after school, I also miss the last ferry home. So when schoolmates come home to stay with me, I’m always telling them to hurry up! But we often get the most fantastic views, for example when the sun goes down over the sea. Some days, though, it’s so foggy that you can’t see a thing, then within hours it’s brilliant sunshine again – it still seems amazing when that happens, even after living here all this time. Of course, we do get awful storms, and I wonder sometimes if the castle’s strong enough to avoid getting damaged. But then I remind myself it’s been here for centuries – and it’s still standing.<eos>"

I live in a beautiful house in Scotland. I love nature and wild animals, and I started a new hobby called birdwatching six years ago. I went to the mountains in northern Scotland with my family, where we saw lots of birds. I spent hours watching them with my parents, who showed me how to tell the difference between species and how to find the best places to see them. It was amazing, and I joined a local young birdwatchers’ club. My goal is to see 200 different bird species, and I’ve almost achieved that. I’ve been to Egypt and South America, and I’ve learned that you have to be patient with this hobby. I posted a video online about this challenge, and many teenagers enjoyed it. I also think that birdwatching clubs should try to get more young people interested in this hobby. Everyone needs to connect with nature, whatever their age, and it doesn’t have to cost much money.<eos>"

I started playing football when I was 7. I loved it, and I was good at it. But my family thought that I would drop out like I had with other hobbies. But I didn’t. I was already dreaming of playing football professionally when I was older. And the opportunity came sooner than I’d hoped. I started playing in local tournaments, and one of the referees noticed that I was a promising player. He asked the manager of a professional women’s club to watch me play. After that, she asked me to join her club. I started regular training with a big club as a young 13-year-old. I improved enormously. But people still weren’t sure I’d ever be a star player, which made me feel a bit upset. But my coach encouraged me to just be myself, and believe in myself. I played in one of the club’s championship matches, much earlier than I’d expected. I won the game, and the team carried me round the pitch. Fantastic! Since then, I’ve scored lots more winning goals. And next month, my coach and I are running a football tournament in my area.

One of the most interesting developments in further and higher education in the UK has been a move to encourage novice students to become involved with research as early as possible. Research is not an exclusive activity for established scholars or scientists. It can also be seen as a natural and fundamental way to build knowledge and skills.

Research approaches and skills are useful not only in your studies but also in employment. They are ways of thinking about the world and going about your own work. As a student, you make a contribution to knowledge. You do not just digest and repeat it, you make it. Making knowledge is based on asking questions, rather than taking things for granted.

Most students have always been a researcher of sorts. You will have been carrying out some elements of research for projects and answered questions at school or in the workplace since your first few days there. You will also have been developing research and enquiry approaches and skills when exploring where to go on holiday, how to grow seeds successfully, how to fix things around the house, how to train your dog, how to find the right kind of music system, and how to buy the right kind of items for your needs online.

Critical thinking is particularly important in research. We need to be able not just to repeat what we’ve read and take everything in as if it was proven fact, but to engage with it, think about it, test it out, identify whether what we’re being told is presented in such a way as to trick us into agreement, or whether it is logical, reasoned and backed by evidence.<eos>"

Cities have always been centers of intellectual life. They have also been places where people have faced challenges. The modern city is a place of creativity, but it is also a deeply unnatural and overwhelming place. Scientists have begun to examine how the city affects the brain, and the results are alarming. They have found that cities actually dull our thinking, sometimes dramatically so. One of the main forces at work is the lack of nature. Studies have shown that people who can see trees from their windows recover more quickly from illness. Even these fleeting glimpses of nature improve brain performance. The city is so overstuffed with stimuli that we need to continually redirect our attention. Natural settings, in contrast, don't require the same amount of cognitive effort. To improve cognitive performance, people should take walks in natural places.<eos>"

The mind is a complex thing. It is often thought to be located inside people's heads. However, there is evidence to suggest that the mind is more than just the brain. Things and neurons also play a role in human cognitive life.

From the viewpoint of archaeology, it is clear that stone objects, body ornaments, engravings, clay tokens and writing systems play an active role in human evolution and the making of the human mind.

The mind and the brain became equated because most of what we know about the human mind has been uncovered through isolating people from the material culture they are usually surrounded by in order to study them.

However, this approach often goes unnoticed that much of our thinking takes place outside our heads.

The author's new theory, Material Engagement Theory (MET), explores the different ways in which things become cognitive extensions or are incorporated by the human body.

MET offers a new way of understanding how different forms of material culture, from the stone hand-axe to the latest smartphone, may have provided a powerful mechanism of defining, but also transforming, what we are and how we think.<eos>"

Photography has significantly changed the course of civilization and the way we perceive the world. It has been especially impactful in the United States, where photography became part of the culture at all levels. Historians believe that photography is arguably the country’s greatest single contribution to the visual arts. It has moved to the centre of US intellectual and aesthetic discourse.

There are several reasons why photography was so appealing to the Americans. Firstly, it was a mechanical process that matched the growing enthusiasm for technology. Secondly, the camera was the perfect tool for representing oneself and showcasing individual and national identities. Thirdly, photography was a way of creating and sustaining an impression of self and family. Finally, the photograph’s inherent realism was aesthetically pleasing.

Photography has also been used by artists in a variety of ways. For example, Andy Warhol used photographs in his paintings, silk screens, and multiples. Artists have incorporated photographs into their work to express themselves creatively and to represent their ideas.<eos>"

In 1890, William James defined psychology as the 'science of mental life.' It is a complex subject that studies the mind or brain. Although psychologists do study the brain, they do not understand nearly enough about its workings to be able to comprehend the part that it plays in the experience and expression of our hopes, fears, and wishes, or in our behaviour during experiences as varied as giving birth or watching a football match.

Psychology has the same goals as any other science: to describe, understand, predict, and learn how to control or modify the process that it studies. Psychological findings have been useful in fields as varied as developing more effective methods in teaching children to read, in designing control panels for machines that reduce the risk of accidents, and in alleviating the suffering of people who are emotionally distressed.

Although psychological questions have been discussed for centuries, they have only been investigated scientifically in the past 150 years. Early psychologists relied on introspection – the reflection of the individual’s own conscious experience – to find answers to psychological questions. Contemporary psychologists prefer to base their theories on careful observations of the phenomena in which they are interested, such as the behaviour of others rather than on reflections upon their own experience.<eos>"

In a storehouse in a business park in Michigan, USA, there is a museum of failed products. The museum has a collection of products that were withdrawn from sale because nobody wanted to buy them. The proprietor of the museum, Carol Sherry, sees each product as embodying its own sad story. The museum is a viable, profit-making business. It is a testament to the fact that most products fail. The museum was started by a man named Robert McMath who intended to accumulate a reference library of consumer products. However, his collection ended up consisting mostly of unsuccessful products. The museum is a reflection of the culture of optimism that exists today. People often focus on the positive aspects of things and ignore the negative ones. This obsession with optimism is particularly prevalent in the self-help field. It is important to remember that failure is a natural part of life and that it can be used to learn and grow.<eos>"

Everyone knows that sports teams have an advantage when they play at home. But does anyone know why? Most of us probably think we do; after all, it seems obvious. But professional sport is changing faster than at any time in its history and much of what we used to take for granted is now open to question.

There are two main reasons why home advantage exists. First, the home team has the advantage of playing in front of their own crowd. This can give them a boost of confidence and make them more likely to win. Second, the home team has the advantage of being able to control the playing conditions. This can also give them an edge in the game.

However, there are some changes that have recently occurred that have made home advantage less effective. For example, travel has become more convenient and the top grounds increasingly resemble one another. As a result, home advantage has declined in all major sports, but not by as much as one might expect.

One possible explanation for why home advantage varies depending on the sport is that it is primarily a team phenomenon. In team sports, winning ultimately hangs on all concerned being team players, which builds confidence in their ability to find each other on the court.<eos>"

Where that point is, is at the heart of the nature-nurture debate. The debate is about whether talent is born or acquired. There are different opinions on this topic. Some people believe that talent is born, while others believe that it is acquired through practice. However, there is no consensus on this issue. The most important thing is to practice.

A recent report found that many children living in wealthy countries feel lonely and unhappy. The reason for this is that these children have been spending too much time indoors, watching TV or playing on computers, and have lost contact with the natural world. This is a problem that has been discussed before, and many people talk nostalgically about their own childhood experiences. However, they rarely stop to reflect that they are the ones who have imposed that protective regime on their own children.

There are some good arguments in the book about the relationship between the fear of danger and child-focused consumerism. However, the author's tone is sometimes too extreme and she does not provide enough evidence to support her claims. For example, she argues that children need to have accidents in order to learn to avoid bigger accidents later. This is a dangerous and controversial idea. It is important to remember that children are not always capable of managing risk, and that we should not put them in situations where they are at risk of harm.<eos>"

I am a research bio-psychologist with a PhD. I have done a lot of school and I am a good problem-solver. But most problems in life cannot be solved with a formula or memorised answers. They require the judgement, wisdom and creative ability that come from life experiences.

Play is the natural means by which adults and mammals have always educated themselves. It is also important for children's development. All mammals, including humans, play when they are young. Children, who have the most to learn, play far more than any other young primates when they are allowed to do so.

Play is voluntary, which means that players are always free to quit. If you can't quit, it's not play. School has become more onerous and adult-directed sports have replaced impromptu games. Our children don’t need more school. They need more play.

In many countries, there are a lot of young people in their twenties who use social media to find work. There are two popular social networking sites that are often used for job hunting: Twitter and LinkedIn. These sites offer the chance for direct contact with potential employers. However, with greater access comes a greater chance to make mistakes. For example, a young jobseeker in the US contacted a senior marketing executive via LinkedIn. The marketing executive was not impressed by the young jobseeker's message and sent a rude rejection note. This incident has made people think more carefully about how they use social media in a professional capacity.

There are a few things you need to do if you want to be successful on LinkedIn. First, you need to explain clearly who you are and what you have to offer. Second, you need to keep the tone humble and avoid sending impersonal, blanket emails. Third, you need to be patient and persistent. If you follow these tips, you can increase your chances of making a positive impression on potential employers.<eos>"

Newspapers have been struggling in recent years. Their circulation has fallen significantly, and they are no longer the main source of news for most people in the US. There are many factors that have contributed to this decline, including the rise of the internet and the decline of traditional media. However, despite these challenges, newspapers continue to exist. They have a long history, and they have played an important role in society.

Newspapers were once the dominant medium for news, but they have been overtaken by the internet. The internet has made it easier for people to get news from all over the world, and it has also made it easier for people to personalise their news. Newspapers have not been able to keep up with these changes, and they are now facing extinction.<eos>"

If humans were truly at home under the light of the moon and stars, we would go in darkness happily. Instead, we are diurnal creatures, with eyes adapted to living in the sun’s light. We have engineered the night to receive us by filling it with light. This kind of control is no different from the feat of damming a river. Light pollution is largely the result of bad lighting design. It washes out the darkness of night, altering light levels and light rhythms to which many forms of life, including ourselves, have adapted.

Light pollution has a negative impact on various aspects of life. It affects migration, reproduction, feeding, and our biological well-being. Denying darkness is futile. It is as essential to maintaining our biological welfare as light itself. The regular oscillation of waking and sleep in our lives is nothing less than a biological expression of the regular oscillation of light on Earth. So fundamental are these rhythms to our being that messing with them is akin to altering our center of gravity.

Living in a glare of our own making, we have cut ourselves off from our evolutionary and cultural heritage – the light of the stars and the rhythms of day and night. In a very real sense, light pollution causes us to lose sight of our true place in the universe, to forget the scale of our being, which is best measured against the dimensions of a deep night with the Milky Way arching overhead.<eos>"

A company recently announced that it would no longer track its employees’ paid holiday time. The founder of the company was inspired by an internet company that has instigated a similar policy. The company has 50,000 employees and provides a variety of services. The founder stated that employees may take as much leave as they want, as long as they feel comfortable that their absence will not damage the business. However, there are concerns about the practicality of this policy. For example, it could lead to increased guilt and stress for employees, which could in turn lead to a decrease in productivity. Additionally, it could lead to pressure from colleagues and office gossip concerning who was off when, and for how long. The policy could also make it difficult for employees to maintain a healthy work-life balance. Overall, the author remains doubtful as to whether being able to take as much holiday as you want is the true intention or the probable outcome of this policy.<eos>"

Journal-based peer review is a process that ensures the quality of scientific research papers. It is often seen as a way to prevent the publication of flawed or nonsensical papers. However, the process can also be time-consuming, sometimes delaying the publication of a paper by a year. Preprints, which are drafts of papers that are posted online without having been peer reviewed, are a growing trend that is changing the way scientific papers are published. Preprints bring academics back to the core of research publication, which is the rapid dissemination of new results. They also make it easier for people to critique and discuss papers. Preprints have the potential to improve the scientific publishing process by increasing the visibility and impact of papers. They could also become an effective outlet for negative results.

**Questions:**

1. What is the main purpose of journal-based peer review?
2. What are some of the challenges associated with journal-based peer review?
3. What are the potential benefits of preprints?
4. How do preprints impact the scientific publishing process?

When I ask my students what a poem is, they usually give me answers like 'a painting in words.' Their answers rarely satisfy me, or them. One day I asked a group to choose an object and write one paragraph describing it empirically, as a scientist might, and another in the first person, from the point of view of the item itself. The exercise led to much amusement and useful discussion.

A poem is a thing made. Poets sometimes compare poems to wild animals or machines. But such comparisons fall apart upon closer analysis. The most productive thing about trying to define a poem through comparison lies not in the comparison itself but in the debate. A poem is a product of writing and rewriting just like an article, story, or novel, yet it never really becomes what they usually are – a thing created in order to become a commodity.

A poem is a home for deep feelings, stunning images, tender reflections and/or biting wit. It can also be a source of inspiration and entertainment. Poems can make us see commonplace things in a new light and can reroute our patterns of thought.<eos>"

I bought a metal detector soon after I was married. It cost a lot of money then, but it was worth it. I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first outing. Over the years, I've found many other interesting things. But the most important thing I found was a torc. It's a beautiful necklace of gold and silver. It's very old and rare. I hid it in my wardrobe and I was anxious. Finally, I carried it into the council office and it was authenticated and sold to my local council. The proceeds were split between me and the owner of the field.

Sleeping is one of my favorite travel pleasures. I sometimes feel a little guilty when I talk about it because I know that my friends have planned their trips very carefully. But I smile encouragingly and don't say much. When I travel, I like to sleep a lot. I often take naps under the hot Caribbean sun or relax in beautiful Italian sheets. When I visited Mexico's Yucatán coast, I was surprised by how much I slept. There were lots of noisy birds in the neighboring lot, but it didn't matter. I could plunge into a sleep that was more profound, dream-filled, and enjoyable than I imagined possible. Sleep is something else too: it's an experience that changes rhythm, sometimes dramatically, from place to place. People obsess about jet lag, but I suspect that the difficulties I experience recovering from long journeys have more to do with local and cultural adjustment than time zones. When I finally fall into the local sleep pattern, I feel I have truly arrived.<eos>"

I shook my head and smiled at my neighbour. He woke up and smiled at me. He was a salesman from Moscow who was flying to the outer limits of civilisation.

In the Red Bull Air Race, twelve pilots race through a series of pylons between 15 and 25 meters high. They negotiate sharp turns, barrel rolls and loops at speeds of up to 370 km per hour. I was invited to find out what it feels like to take part. I had to sign two forms before the flight. The first confirmed that I was in good health, the second that I would empty all my pockets. I also learned that I would have to try to stay orientated throughout the flight. I was told to relax and enjoy the view. Half an hour before the flight, I had a safety briefing in which I was told not to touch anything. By the time we were taxiing down the runway, I was ready to fly. I ignored all instructions received and would not relax and enjoy the flight. This is the cruel paradox of high-speed acrobatic flying. In order to survive it without passing out, you have to keep calm and focused. You have to tense up at the right time and you have to relax at the right time. Panicking is a bad idea. The flight was over in 10 minutes. It had been 'soft' compared to what the pilots endure when they race.

Doug Allan is a wildlife cameraman who films wild animals in cold places. He has filmed many major TV wildlife series. He says that his perfect temperature is -18C. Allan was trained as a marine biologist and commercial diver. Diving was his first passion, where he learned about survival in cold places.

One day, Allan was working in Antarctica when he was asked to film a wildlife documentary. He ended up taking the crew to different places and realized that being a wildlife cameraman ticked all the boxes: travel, adventure, underwater.

Allan says that wildlife filming is full of great successes, but also failures and embarrassments. He has seen a lot of amazing things, but he has also had some setbacks.

Now Allan would like to make his own film about climate change in the Arctic. He says he would be able to make an extraordinary documentary.<eos>"

In 2004, Pen Hadow became the first person to trek to the North Pole alone and without being resupplied on the way. He made it to the South Pole as well. Now he is back in the Arctic again, preparing for an expedition he says is even more ambitious.

Pen is a skilled explorer. He has to be. This time, however, there is far more at stake. He will set out on a three-month, 1,000-kilometer trek to the North Pole, taking detailed measurements of the thickness and density of the ice. Nobody has ever done this before. The results of his expedition will be of vital importance to the scientific community.

Pen is married to Mary, a horsewoman, who says he has a ‘spine of steel’ and who shares his love of the outdoors. They live in the country with their two children.

Pen is going to be 47 on Thursday. He has done far less training than he’s comfortable with. Why? Because organizational things always seem more urgent.

Pen believes his mission reconnects exploration with the search for knowledge that drove previous generations into the unknown.<eos>"

I had a break from my training. I was going to do something else. Being a successful Olympian is a great thing. I had the chance to do more writing and TV work, and to speak to businesses and schools. But there wasn’t anything on the horizon to get my competitive teeth into. I knew that I wished to stay in shape, so that I would be in a position to fight for an Olympic place if that dream reignited within me. So I entered marathons and triathlons. That should have been enough, but there was still the TV presenter Ben Fogle’s nagging invitation at the back of my mind. I spoke to some of my rowing colleagues about whether they fancied the race; I didn’t receive any enthusiastic responses. I knew that if I entered the race, even though it is billed primarily as an adventure, I would want to win. Would doing it with Ben give me the best chance of winning it? No. On the other hand, there was part of me that thought the chance to be an underdog with no pressure was appealing. I got in contact with Ben. We spoke about the remaining costs of the race. We felt we stood a better chance than most, but it would still take work to secure it. Of all the ways to earn money as a retired professional sportsman, speaking at business conferences is one of the most profitable. But I find it hard talking about something I’ve done without having another major goal. Participating in the race would mean I wouldn’t just be talking about past achievements. I’d actually be doing something again which I could bring in: rowing across the Atlantic. I learnt a lot while planning this adventure, but one of the biggest lessons was to be thankful for the easy life of a full-time athlete.<eos>"

When I first started a cookery programme called In Search of Perfection, I was not sure how it would be received. There had been a lot of talk about the food 'revolution' happening in Britain, and I was certain that we had produced a series of programmes that made a genuinely innovative contribution to that. I watched the first programme and was relieved that it was successful. The success of the show paved the way for other fascinating projects, including a book based on my experiences at the restaurant I own. In each project, there is a sense of being on a journey. I wrote several books in a series called 'Perfection', each one accompanying its own TV programme of the same name. In these books, the journey was often a very physical one, with passports and suitcases and itineraries. The latest book in the series is called In Search of Total Perfection. It is about meeting extraordinary artisans and exploring new foods. Despite the book's title, I knew from the outset that I wouldn’t be claiming the recipes were in any way 'definitive'. But I reckoned that, by using my technical skill and scientific knowledge, I could pin down some of the things that made these dishes work.<eos>"

There had been a party and her dad bought her a white-gold necklace with an L pendant. Her little brother Gus got all caught up in imagining himself at the same festival one day. Grace Chang, her teacher, took Lucy out for a special dinner to strategize a repertoire.

The festival was important to Lucy because it was a chance for her to be somebody. Even if it meant certain people were jealous or thought she was too young to get the kind of attention she did. Being a concert pianist didn't win her any special respect from the kids she’d been at school with.

It's not good to spend too much time online. You need to get out into the real world, said Dad. He's difficult to argue with, so I decided to find out what people who have studied the subject say – and it’s quite interesting. Generally, research shows that most teenagers who use social media have a wide circle of real-life friends, a good sense of identity and belonging, and are developing the essential technical skills we need to be citizens of a digital age.

Social networking has become an integral part of modern childhood. Teenagers don’t consume media – dipping in and out to buy airline tickets or check e-mails as adults do – they inhabit it. It performs a similar function to hanging around at the youth club, as today’s parents used to do when they were younger.

Adolescence is a time when you are asking, who am I? Social networking can help you develop that self-identity. You can post notices about your favourite music or sports, discover what you enjoy, and you are constantly reminded that other people have different ways of looking at things.

Teenagers who use social networking as a creative force will reap the benefits when they become adults and enter the world of work. Collaboration is a real 21st-century skill, and an important part of being employable in a digital age.<eos>"

Then a sharp drop and your stomach is suspended in the air. You hurtle quickly forwards, sharply left, then upside down. Your senses are a blur, you let out a roar of fear that comes from the pit of your gut.

Amusement parks are a huge industry that delivers thrills and escape from reality. To create the perfect ride, there are teams of highly inventive engineers and designers. It's a big challenge to create the perfect balance of pleasure and fear while ensuring that passengers are safe.

The teams behind rollercoasters must piece together a strong narrative, be it a space adventure or a high-paced chase in the jungle, that works with any innovations to create a seamless experience. However, in the end, gut instincts, years of experience and trial-and-error are what work.<eos>"

As a choreographer, Miranda is in a teaching role. She likes working with young students. They are receptive to exploring new ideas. They are hungry for success, but they don’t yet have a clear sense of their strengths and weaknesses.

When Miranda starts working with a new group, she concentrates on the dance steps and the music dictates what she does. If dancers aren’t responding well to a particular composer’s music, that can be frustrating, but she still has to find solutions.

Miranda doesn’t believe in attaching herself to one institution. She has to be prepared to adapt the way she works each time she goes somewhere new.

My brother was busy, so I decided a group holiday might suit me. The man at the Greek port was curious when I asked for a single ferry ticket. I explained I wouldn't be alone for long; I’d be joining ten others to swim around the tiny islands. We did a short swim to split us into speed groups, then it was time for our first proper swim. I was nervous. I’d trained in my local pool and done some river swimming, but never long distances in the open sea. Soon, the waves got bigger and I was at the back of the slow group.

I love my job as a flight attendant. I’ve been to many places, including the US and Australia. I work with great people, and I have a lot of time off. Life is always exciting, which makes it a great job for a young person like me.

When I was a child, I went to a boarding school away from my family. I always flew unaccompanied when term began and ended. I felt lonely, so I would ask the flight attendants to let me help give out meals to passengers. And I guess that’s the thing I remembered later, when I needed an escape from my job and began looking for a new direction. There was a lot of young people at the interview, and many were accepted. They were often highly qualified like me, and were changing careers. Before the interview, I practised what to say – more than simply that I loved to travel, as everyone else would say the same. Instead, I mentioned my strengths and previous work experience – and I got the job!

I’d recommend this kind of work to anyone, as there are so many things that make it worthwhile – but the free flights I get aren’t top of the list. Most airline staff are incredibly hard-working, and there’s a saying – ‘no-one’s finished till everyone’s finished.’ It’s like a big family – even though we don’t see each other all the time, we’re still close. When I’m not working, I don’t have to take work home. And if I do get difficult passengers, which is rare, I always know the flight will soon be over and I’ll probably never see them again!<eos>"

At the summer camp where I work, I really enjoy seeing the children succeed at things they never thought they could do. Most of the children know how to swim and play table-tennis, but rock climbing is a new experience for most of them. Some children feel very nervous, but after some encouragement they agree to try and they all get to the top in the end. This makes them feel great. We do get children who miss home at the beginning of the week. It's not the really young ones who feel like that the most – it's actually the ten- to thirteen-year-olds. We don't let them use their mobile phones all the time. We tell them they can phone home after lunch and when they ask again, usually after dinner, we say it's a bit late to phone now, do it tomorrow. Most children are fine in a couple of days and at the end of their week's stay, they all come up to us and thank us because they have had a great time.<eos>"
