Some time ago, there was a website that talked about the risks of public check-ins. It said that if you post something online, it can be seen by anyone. This made people think about the downsides of sharing information on the internet. The website also talked about the history of blogging. It said that the first bloggers were people who shared their lives online. One of the first bloggers was a young man named Justin Hall. He started blogging in 1996 and his blog was very popular. But one day, Hall's blog was taken down because someone sent the address of his blog to his boss. This made Hall feel bad, but he eventually started blogging again.

A long time ago, some scientists started a campaign to warn people about a movie called What the Bleep Do We Know? which showed that there is a lot about the universe that we don’t understand. The movie was very popular, but some scientists felt that it was not accurate. They said that the movie made some claims that were too far-fetched. However, the movie did inspire some people to learn more about science.

The movie talked about some new discoveries that were being made about the universe. One of the most important discoveries was that water molecules can be affected by thoughts. This discovery was very controversial, but many people believe that it is true. The movie also talked about other discoveries, such as the discovery of the expansion of the universe and the discovery of the existence of dark energy.

The movie was a popular success, but it was not without its critics. Some scientists said that the movie made some inaccurate claims and that it was not a very well-researched film. However, the movie did inspire some people to learn more about science and to appreciate the incredible beauty of the universe.<eos>"

I find writing novels a challenge, and writing short stories a joy. Writing novels is like planting a forest, and writing short stories is more like planting a garden. The two processes complement each other, creating a complete landscape that I treasure.

I write short stories because they are quick and easy to write. It generally takes me about a week to get a short story into some kind of decent shape. You can create a story out of the smallest things, and you don’t have to worry about failing.

I find writing short stories a necessary change of pace and a way to experiment. They are like soft shadows I have set out in the world, faint footprints I have left behind. Short stories are like guideposts to my heart, and it makes me happy as a writer to be able to share these intimate feelings with my readers.<eos>"

Science is a powerful force that has improved our lives and threatened our existence. It has also inspired us to dream big and to understand the universe. Science has its beauty and its perils, but it is also important for our future.

Science has been changing rapidly in recent years. New theories are being developed all the time, and old theories are being overthrown. Sometimes, these changes are small, but sometimes they are big. They can have a big impact on our lives.

Science has also been used to control nature. We are now able to do things that were once thought to be impossible, such as curing diseases and traveling to space. But science has also been used to destroy nature. We have polluted the air and water, and we have destroyed many animals.

Science is a complex and challenging field, but it is also an important one. We need to continue to learn about science and to use science to improve our world.<eos>"

From around 2015, sales of ebooks had started to decline. This made people question the future of ebooks in the publishing industry. Some people thought that the decline of ebooks would lead to the disappearance of print books. However, there is no evidence to support this. Ebooks and print books can coexist in the market. The idea of the disappearing book is a powerful narrative that tells us much more about our relationship with technology and change. It is a story that evokes both hope and fear. It is also a story that helps us to make sense of change.

Every day, I wake up early, brush my teeth, make coffee, and write about how some of the greatest minds of the past have approached their work. I write about the details of their daily lives, such as their sleep, eating, working, and worrying. I hope to provide a new perspective on their personalities and careers.

I also talk about my own struggles with creativity and earning a living. I have questions about how to do meaningful creative work while also earning a living, and whether it is better to devote yourself wholly to a project or to set aside a small portion of each day.

I have tried to provide examples of how a variety of brilliant and successful people have confronted similar challenges. I wanted to show how grand creative visions translate to small daily increments; how one’s working habits influence the work itself, and vice versa.

This book is about people’s routines and how they can help you be more creative and productive. It is also personal because I share my own struggles and experiences.<eos>"

Howard became a palaeontologist because he was interested in dinosaurs. He studied delicate creatures revealed on the surface of grey rocks. He worked on his doctoral thesis and got a job as an Assistant Lecturer at Tavistock College in London. He often found himself contrasting the orderly nature of his professional life with the anarchy of private concerns.

One day, Howard's briefcase was stolen. He was fuming and returned to the college. He made an explanatory phone call and postponed the lecture. He reported the theft to the appropriate authorities and then went for a restorative coffee. He joined a colleague who was entertaining a visiting curator from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. And thus it was that Howard learned of the recently acquired collection of fossils, as yet uncatalogued and unidentified.<eos>"

Charles Spence is a professor of experimental psychology at Oxford University in the UK. He has studied how the senses interact to form our perception of flavour. Through his studies, he has influenced what we eat and drink. He has also studied how food is experienced with others.

Spence has written a book called The Perfect Meal, which is packed with insights that are fascinating to anyone in possession of an appetite. It includes information about how much we eat when eating with others.

Spence's lab is un-space-age. It has soundproof booths and stacks of ancient-looking audio-visual equipment. He can afford to work more creatively with cooks because he keeps his overheads low.

Spence is currently helping famous brands through reductions in salt and sugar. He points out that it is in their interests to help loyal customers stay alive for longer.<eos>"

Our brains are very busy these days. We have a lot of information to deal with, including facts, rumors, and things that are not true. We also do more things than ever before. Thirty years ago, people used to make our airline reservations and help us find what we needed in shops. Now we do most things ourselves. We have smartphones that help us do all this. But there’s a problem with multitasking. It makes us less efficient. Multitasking can increase the production of stress hormones and make it harder to focus. It also makes it harder to make decisions. We can end up making truly bad decisions about something important. To make matters worse, multitasking requires a lot of decision-making. It turns out that making lots of small decisions takes up a lot of brain resources. We rapidly spiral into a depleted state in which we can end up making truly bad decisions about something important.<eos>"

In a zoo in Sweden, a chimpanzee named Santino spent his nights breaking up concrete into pieces to throw at visitors during the day. Was he being spiteful? In caves in the US, female bats help unrelated fruit bat mothers if they can’t find the right birthing position. Are they being caring? Fifty years ago, people thought that animals had behaviours that produced measurable outcomes, and science recorded those outcomes. But recently that has partially changed. Thanks to research into the behaviour of bats, chimps, and other animals, emotions of animals have gone from being a taboo area of investigation to being tentatively explored. The new research has started a debate about whether animals can be said to have consciousness and conscience. If animals do have consciousness, what does it mean for the production and consumption of beef? The observations may not be disputed, but the interpretation of them is. Some people believe that we should stop eating meat, while others believe that we should at least re-evaluate our view of animal cognition. The debate is ongoing and there is no clear answer.<eos>"

Critical thinking is a way of understanding what we read or listen to in order to have a deeper understanding. It involves interacting with the text and thinking about it in a way that goes beyond simply reading the words. There is a belief that argument is a way of finding the truth. Although there’s little debate that information technology complements and often enhances the human mind in the quest to store information and process an ever-growing tangle of bits and bytes, there’s increasing concern that the same technology is changing the way we approach complex problems and making it more difficult to really think.

Reading enhances thinking and engages the imagination in a way that visual media such as video games and television do not. It develops imagination, induction, reflection, and critical thinking, as well as vocabulary. However, visual media actually improve some types of information processing. Unfortunately, most visual media are real-time media that do not allow time for reflection, analysis, or imagination.

Many people – particularly those who are younger – wind up underachieving and not making the most of their capabilities. How society views technology has a great deal to do with how it forms perceptions about critical thinking. And nowhere is the conflict more apparent than at the intersection of video games and cognition.<eos>"

When Matthew Crawford is not writing or thinking about how we ought to live, he works as a motorcycle mechanic. He wrote two books about the benefits of manual trades and philosophy. One of his books is about how to cope with modernity. He was inspired to write it when he was shopping and noticed that advertisements popped up on the credit card machine. He says that this is becoming increasingly difficult to avoid.

Crawford is concerned about the impact of technology on our ability to think and communicate. He says that technology is creating a lot of distractions and making it difficult for us to focus on one thing at a time. He also says that we are becoming more self-obsessed and that this has a social impact.

Crawford's proposed solution has two parts. First, we need regulation of noise and distraction in public space. More importantly, though, Crawford advocates skilled practices as a way of engaging with the world in a more satisfying way.<eos>"

""What do you do for a living?"" is a common question. If you're a philosopher, it's a little harder to answer. It's because describing yourself as a philosopher sounds a bit pretentious. However, there are some good reasons why philosophers are important. One reason is that they help us to think critically about the world around us. Another reason is that they help us to understand ourselves better. If you want to live a more fulfilling life, you can start by examining your own experiences and thinking about them more deeply. You don't need to be a philosopher to do this, but it can be helpful. You can also learn from philosophers by reading their ideas and discussing them with others.

Foodies, gourmands, chefs and others who love food might expect that reflecting on what and how we eat can contribute to culinary pleasure. However, philosophical discussions of food have often been about other topics, such as the acquisition of knowledge or the pursuit of pleasure. Food is inherently social and cultural. It is shared with those in our communities and provides us with dining companions and infrastructure. Ethical issues related to food include what we should eat and the extent to which cooking in restaurants and in the home differ. Cooking in the home is often more intimate and inclusive, while cooking for a living has different obligations. Food and dining can also play a role in bridging cultural gaps. We can come to appreciate others by learning to enjoy their food and forge personal bonds with people from other cultures by coming together to eat.<eos>"

Rob Daviau is a designer of legacy board games. He felt that traditional board games were no longer entertaining or challenging enough. He started to wonder how board games might evolve. Could they have a storyline? Could decisions made in one session carry over into another? He adapted a classic board game called Risk and created a new version called Risk Legacy. Unlike previous board games, decisions made during gameplay had a permanent impact. Players might have to rip up cards, deface the board, or at key moments open packets containing new rules. The games play out over the course of a fixed number of sessions and long-held grudges become woven into the fabric of the game.

Legacy board games were never expected to go mainstream. Nevertheless, most players, like Russell Chapman, loved the concept. They see it as one of the biggest advances in game design for several years. The legacy format draws on video games and the demand for episodic entertainment fuelled by popular TV series.<eos>"

One night, an octopus named Inky escaped from his tank at the National Aquarium in New Zealand. It was a story that was shared online. Part of the fun of the story is that it involves animals behaving like humans. This is called anthropomorphism. Anthropomorphism is often thought of as unscientific, but it is not. Animals have been observed exhibiting many of the key behaviors that were thought to distinguish humans from animals.

The advent of behaviorism in the twentieth century shifted public views of animal intelligence. For most of the twentieth century, animals were seen as either stimulus-response machines or as robots endowed with useful instincts. Happily, we are emerging from this dark period and learning to think of animal cognition as being on the same spectrum, though not necessarily at the same point, as that of humans.

The most effective tests of animal intelligence are designed with a species’ particular traits and skills in mind. Squirrels may fail at human memory tasks, but they can remember where they’ve hidden tiny caches of nuts.<eos>"

When John Maloof bought a box of old photo negatives at an estate auction, he discovered the mystery of Vivian Maier. Maloof was looking for images to use in a book about the history of the Portage Park neighbourhood in Chicago. Instead, he found 30,000 images by Maier, a street photographer with a keen eye for capturing compelling images. Since then, Maloof has amassed an archive of Maier’s life and work. He has a lot of her cameras, film, prints and negatives. On a recent weekday morning, Maloof stood in the midst of it all and looked around. He knows he’s on the verge of something pretty cool.

Maier was born in 1926 and spent much of her childhood in France. She returned to New York in 1951 and came to Chicago in 1956 to work as a nanny. Maier was a private person but she had a strong passion for photography. She always had a camera with her and dressed in oversized coats, broad-brimmed hats and stout shoes.

Maier’s work is the purest form of art. None of it was done for any commercial reason. Her images lean toward women, children, the old, the poor, the abstract. Maloof often wonders if he’ll ever work his way through all the negatives. The funny thing is he had no real interest in photography until he discovered Maier’s work. Inspired by her architectural shots, Maloof actually went out on the street and began to take his own pictures.<eos>"

The silence on Centre Court at the Wimbledon tennis championships is very calming. You can bounce the ball and hit it, and you hear the echo of your own shot. The trimmed grass, the rich history, the ancient stadium, the players dressed in white, and the respectful crowds all combine to make you feel like you are in a peaceful place. The quiet of the Centre Court is good for your game. It helps you to focus and concentrate on the point you are playing.

The silence is broken by a sudden noise when a point is done. There is applause, cheers, and people shouting your name. You hear them, but as if from a long way away. You don’t register that there are thousands of people watching you. You are so focused that you have no sense at all that there are millions watching you as you play Roger Federer in the 2008 Wimbledon final.

You had always dreamed of playing at Wimbledon. You had played and lost, both times against Federer – in the final there the year before, and the year before that. The defeat in 2006 had not been so hard. You went out onto the court that time just pleased and grateful that, having just turned twenty, you’d made it that far. But your defeat in 2007 left you utterly destroyed. You knew you could have done better, that it was not your ability or the quality of your game that had failed you, but your head.

There has been a lot of talk about sleep lately. Sleep is very important for our mental, physical, and social well-being. It seems that people who have the hardest time sleeping are the ones who most appreciate how important sleep is. Dreams are important too. They help us find new patterns and create combinations that break through our usual habits of thinking.

When you wake up in the morning, the sleep you sacrifice is mainly REM or 'Rapid Eye Movement', the most dream-rich stage of sleep. Our most vivid, memorable and emotionally powerful dreams occur mainly in the stage of REM just before we wake up in the morning.

Dreams are where we bring things together in fresh, often surprising ways. They draw on stores of knowledge from the past and present to find new associations. When people are awakened out of REM and asked to say what comes to their minds in response to a certain word, their responses are more original than when awoken from other stages of sleep.<eos>"

It was twenty years ago that Susie Ray left London for a small coastal town in south-west England. She has a studio with a beautiful sea view. There are a lot of empty frames hanging on the walls, between photographs of her two daughters. Susie is a copyist artist who can reproduce the richness of an early-20th-century impressionist masterpiece as easily as the brilliance of a 16th-century Caravaggio portrait.

She has painted the works of numerous great artists, including Renoir, Monet and Van Gogh. Her reproductions are so faithful that art experts mistake them for the originals. Her clients include galleries and private collectors. Some collectors save on house insurance by storing the original in a bank safe and displaying Susie’s copy.

Susie has always been open about what she does. When she reproduces an old masterpiece, she will make it look as authentic as possible. However, she will put her own signature on the back of the canvas. She believes doing it badly would be letting the artist down.

When younger painters approach Susie for advice, she stresses the importance of learning to draw and to represent things accurately. She also emphasises how much she’s studied to be able to do what she does.<eos>"

During Ellen MacArthur's racing days, the sea was her greatest passion. She had a special connection with the boats that took her around the world. They worked as one. When she was on land, life felt trivial. After she came second in a big race, she took you down into her boat to show you how she prepared for the race. She talked about the careful planning that had gone into provisioning and housekeeping. The boat was her world and she looked after it because her life depended on it.

Now, she sees the world as a boat. She has been talking to people about the need to save the planet. She believes that we have to design a way of not using things up. She also started a charity to give young people the vision to rethink and redesign a sustainable future.<eos>"

Jordan Romero is 13 years old and wants to be the youngest person to climb Mount Everest. If he succeeds, he could become one of the most famous teenagers of his generation. Young people are spending more time on computers and games consoles, so Jordan hopes to inspire kids to climb their own mountains. He also wants to inspire kids to venture outdoors. Jordan’s team for the climb includes his father, Paul, and mother, Karen. They call themselves 'Team Romero.' If Jordan can climb Everest and Vinson Massif in Antarctica, he will become the youngest person to have climbed the Seven Summits. Few people achieve this under the age of thirty. Jordan has already climbed five of the Seven Summits and might actually do it before his teenage years are over.

There are some concerns about Jordan’s climb. Some people think that a young climber might not be emotionally strong enough or have enough experience to develop the good judgment and reactions a climber must have in order to take part in such a project safely. However, Jordan’s parents believe that their own experience as climbers will help them guide their son. They also believe that watching Jordan develop gives them confidence.

Jordan’s motivation is also a question. Some people might wonder if this is just an ambitious father taking his own love of adventure to a dangerous extreme. However, Paul insists that this project isn’t about him trying to become famous for his son’s achievements. He says, 'At first, he talked about it as something to do later in life, but when we discussed it, we thought: ‘Why not now?’ We talk to him regularly to make sure he hasn’t lost the motivation to do it.'<eos>"

When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, it's probably not classical music they're listening to. Most people can name a few pop groups, but few know who Brahms was. I started doing a music degree, but the people on my course know no more about classical music than anyone else my age. If you don’t know who wrote the music, you are unlikely to own any recordings of their work. Classical music is not very popular among teenagers. There are a few reasons why this is the case. First, the pace and rhythm of classical music are not very appealing to teenagers. Second, classical music is not structurally very simple. Third, the subject matter of classical music is not very relatable to teenagers. Finally, the way we listen to music has changed. Nowadays, you can find any music you want at the click of a mouse. The sound track to our lives is rarely classical.<eos>"

Mum caught Jess by the arm and asked her to come with her to the study. There was a painting on the table. It was one of Grandpa’s, but it was unlike anything he had done before. Mum spoke to Jess about the painting and asked her if she knew anything about it. Jess said she had never seen it before. The painting was strange and beautiful. There was a river in the picture. The riverbank was almost insignificant. There were no animals or people in the picture. Jess felt that the painting was right. There seemed no place for living things in this remote vision. Yet, she was captivated by the painting. Mum spoke again and said the painting had a name. The name was 'River Boy.' The words seemed to carry a strange resonance. Jess knew what Grandpa’s response would have been. He would have said that painting is hard enough work as it is without having to explain it to everyone. And he would have said that artists should not have to explain their pictures to every Tom, Dick, and Harry who came along.<eos>"

When I woke up this morning, I didn't mean to damage the carpet. I was trying to find a way of fitting my corner cabinet into a corner. Gran had given me the cabinet when she moved out of her house into a flat. It's really cute and I keep my collection of shells and fossils and interesting stones there.

The problem was, the cabinet was too tall to fit into the angle between the roof and the floor. If I could only slice a couple of centimetres off the bottom of it... That was when it came to me. If I couldn’t slice anything off Gran’s cabinet, how about cutting a hole in the carpet? It just seemed like the obvious solution.

My bedroom is small and cosy. It's like a nest. I love the way the roof slopes down, and the way the window is at floor level. The only problem is, the lack of corners. My bed is in one, and my wardrobe in the other.<eos>"

The novel 'The Borrowers' is about a family of tiny people who live hidden in the walls and floors of a house. They borrow things from the normal-sized people in order to survive. When the author asked me to direct a TV adaptation of the novel, I knew it was going to be hard to live up to people’s expectations. The most important thing was getting the scale right. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans, so I had to make sure that the actors looked small. I also had to get the costumes right. The costumes were made out of heavy canvas material so that they stuck out in the way that dolls’ clothes do. Unfortunately, the weather was really hot during filming. Most of the action that takes place away from the Borrowers’ home had to be shot with the actors separated from their surroundings. We filmed them in front of a blue screen on an otherwise empty set. It was a challenge for them to react to things that weren’t physically there.<eos>"

Mom pulls to a stop at the corner of my new school, Palm Grove High school. She looks around nervously, looking for journalists that aren’t there. I tell her everything is going to be fine. She kisses her fingertip and touches my cheek right before I get out of the car. Then she’s off, leaving me alone with this whole new school, whole new situation to deal with.

I walk in the school’s main office and get my schedule. English Literature, first period. Cool, I can deal with that. I have to be late, though. English is in Room 214, second floor. I studied the map the night before, as I didn’t want to look like a complete buffoon searching for my classes.

When I get to the door, I hear the teacher already taking roll. I slip in undetected and slide into the last desk in the second row. The girl next to me smiles. She scans over my very normal and, might I add, very clever outfit – jeans and a T-shirt. Ha! Nobody will ever suspect me now!

The teacher pauses in the roll taking. ‘Desert... McGraw?’ she says hesitantly. ‘Here.’ The teacher then smiles and introduces herself as Ms. Smigla. She talks a lot and eventually hands us our course outlines. After we review them and she tells us all about books we’re required to read this year, she actually gives us time to socialize! All teachers should realize the importance of this.<eos>"

Being an American teenager today is challenging. There are a lot of stresses that teenagers have, such as homework, tests, and extra-curricular activities, jobs, chores, and responsibilities at home. Despite these stresses, teenagers still have a lot of free time. They can use their cell phones to do their homework, listen to music, or connect with friends.

The teenage members of the Earth to Sky Calculus Club live in Bishop, a mountain town in the US, surrounded by wilderness. They have launched over fifty balloons to the edge of space. It's a long-running science project and a backcountry adventure. I join them one weekend in late spring. They are about to release a high-altitude balloon, hoping to record shooting stars.

A gas tank is used to inflate the balloon. It slowly grows to the size of a small car. Finally, it's time for lift-off. The balloon rises and expands until it's almost the size of a house. Then it pops in a dramatic explosion. A parachute helps the equipment inside the lunch box land safely back on Earth.

Getting the lunch box back isn’t straightforward. It often lands somewhere in the middle of nowhere. To find it, the recovery team has to drive south of the Sierra and then back up the western side of the mountain range. It takes a long time to find the lunch box. But it's also a perfect opportunity to argue over the effects of atmospheric waves, and how they might work above mountain ridges.<eos>"

Chloe Morgan is a palaeontologist. She started to be interested in Palaeontology when she was fifteen. She was inspired by her younger brother's interest in dinosaurs. She also found an article about recent discoveries in the field. She knew that this was something she wanted to commit herself to.

Chloe's job is varied. She spends lots of time digging up dinosaur bones, but also has to put in long hours in laboratories, analysing fossils, and writing for scientific publications. She also likes to reach out to young people and talk to them about science.

Walking with Dinosaurs was a recent TV documentary that Chloe was involved in. The documentary was successful because it attracted audiences of all ages. It also helped to change the way dinosaurs are portrayed on screen.

Why does Chloe feel dinosaurs continue to fascinate us? She suspects that they speak to the innate explorer in all of us. Our imaginations are drawn to the unfamiliar and the prospect of discovery. And at a time when our world seems to be shrinking, prehistoric creatures remind us that there is still more out there to be discovered.<eos>"

When you travel by car with your family, even when you're young, you know that you're not 'there yet.' Once you get there, it's not 'there' anymore, it's 'here.' If you really think there's a chance that you're 'there yet,' you should be asking 'Are we there yet? ' And parents often get tired of hearing that question over and over.

If you're travelling by car, you can have a lot of fun. You can watch DVDs, listen to music, or play puzzles. You can also act as co-pilot and help your parents adjust the radio station and temperature.

But sometimes, things can go wrong. For example, your brother or sister might put their foot on your side of the seat. If that happens, you might get angry and fight. And the driver and co-pilot might have to intervene.

Over the years, your parents have developed strategies for dealing with kids on the back seat. For example, they might say, ""Yup. We're here. Get out of the car."" But if you're still on the highway, going fast, they might say, ""Oh, well, then maybe we're not there yet.""

So once and for all, please note: if your parents are still near enough to answer your question, then the answer is: no. You're not there yet.<eos>"

John and Zuzi Morgan have opened a café in Oxford, UK, where people can enjoy coffee, cake, and board games. They hope that people will enjoy the experience so much they will want to repeat it. They decided to turn their love of tabletop games into a full-time business because there is so much technology and people are always on their mobile phones. They wanted to bring people back together in a way that’s not just staring at screens.

The games that are played in John and Zuzi's café are called Eurogames. They are known for their gentle themes, such as farming and landscape-building. The first Eurogame was created by a German designer, Klaus Teuber. Players establish settlements on an island and trade resources with the other players. The games that follow this type of game are called co-operative games. In these games, every player wins or loses as a team member. Pandemic, a Eurogame, was created by a North American, Matt Leacock. He was inspired by a Eurogame called Lord of the Rings.

The growth of the video games industry has also contributed to the success of these modern, ingeniously designed board games. Video games and board games have learned a lot from each other. More people are open to playing games than ever before. Tabletop gaming has become more than entertainment. It has become something to be shared, directly and physically, in the real world.<eos>"

Television presenter Helen Skelton has completed various dangerous challenges for charity, including a desert marathon run and a journey down the Amazon river in a tiny boat. For her latest challenge, Helen walked on a high wire, a long thin piece of metal, 66 meters above the ground. There was no safety net, only a belt around her waist attached to another wire above. To help her keep her balance and not to fall, she carried a long stick, weighing eight kilograms. Helen took lessons from an expert high-wire walker. Although she already had a few circus skills, she quickly discovered that high-wire walking was completely different. The training was a shock, said Helen. 'I didn’t realise how strong I’d need to be. Every day started at 8 am with a run up a steep hill; then came an hour of exercises, with another hour of them after my day practising on the wire.

I work at a university where my team and I are learning more about water birds, particularly one called the American black duck. We have started using a new piece of equipment called a night-vision scope, which allows us to see the ducks in the dark. We are worried about black ducks mainly because their numbers have fallen hugely and we don’t know whether there’s enough food on the east coast for these animals. We have lots of information about their daytime activities, but nothing about what they do at night, because we simply haven’t had the equipment. But this new ‘scope’ will produce really clear pictures, even on moonless nights, so we’ll be able to find out more and make better decisions about looking after the area where they live based on what we learn. It is very hard work. There are four of us, each working six hours daily. We have studied ducks in different locations, and I have had to take a boat to some sites and make notes on every duck I see. The weather hasn’t helped – some nights are mild, but more often it’s wet. Oh, and it’s so quiet I’ve needed lots of coffee to stop me falling asleep! We’ve only missed one working day so far, because the snow was too deep even for our special snow vehicles. Still I like the challenge of it, especially compared to what the summer will bring – hours in a laboratory, where we’ll look at our results together. It’ll be hard to be stuck inside – but it’s essential to do this. And I wouldn’t change it for anything!<eos>"

Sophia Grayson is from Circus Experience, a centre teaching young people circus skills. She says her course is popular because it includes many skills, such as juggling, throwing and catching things, trapeze, and business planning. On the year-long course, students gradually increase the amount of risk they take in each class and parents come along to certain classes to watch progress.

To be successful in the circus, performers need to avoid doing the same thing all the time and keep performances fresh and full of action. Training is very important for circus artists, like athletes, and the best performers are those who want success, have imagination and never stop improving skills.

The course also covers business planning. Many previous students set up businesses all over the world, and are happy to share their experiences. However, Sophia warns, it’s not a profession for making money.<eos>"

She was a good swimmer, and the coach at the swimming club she went to thought she might be good enough to become a champion.

My dad was a professional basketball player in Germany, as his father had been before him. I went to watch many of his games when I was a kid. I loved telling my friends how good my dad was, but I used to take a book with me to read instead of watching. Starting secondary school, I was already tall. My sports teacher asked if I’d be interested in training with the basketball team. I enjoyed the session, but I thought I’d need to develop my skills before I took part in a real match. It took me a while to agree, but a few weeks later, I found myself playing against a team from another school. My parents came to watch, but it made me more nervous. It was OK in the end.

Seven years ago, I was studying tourism and needed to find a part-time job. I decided to become a weekend tour guide in my home city, Chicago. I took visitors around the city and I enjoyed giving those tours. I learned a lot about Chicago and it felt like a new experience every time. After finishing my studies, I decided to go into tour guiding full-time. To get a licence, I had to learn a lot more than I'd learned so far. All Chicago guides have to be able to answer hundreds of questions about the city. After several months, I gained my tour guide qualification and registered as an independent tour guide. Being a tour guide is not just about knowing facts or making sure you don't lose anyone. You also need to be able to be entertaining and tell interesting stories, and above all, you need to be able to react to changing situations. I need to make sure visitors are happy with my tours, otherwise they could post a negative review online. Like most tour guides, I realise that these reviews are really important, as good reviews attract more customers. That’s why making tours fun and stress-free is essential.

My name is Ella and I am 22. Last year I went to Thailand with my sister Josie. We went to help as volunteers at an elephant sanctuary. There were a lot of other volunteers at the sanctuary, but we didn’t have much in common with them. We were also nervous because it was the first time we’d done anything like that before. In the end, though, there was no need to worry. We helped collect the elephants’ food and wash the elephants in the river. The part of the day I most looked forward to was the evening. We spent the evenings talking and playing games. Now that we’re back in the UK, Josie doesn’t often talk about Thailand. But if anyone asks her if she enjoyed her time at the sanctuary, she says she loved it.<eos>"

My name is Gina D’Costa and I own a flower shop in the UK. We sell flowers to people who buy them for friends, their homes, or other reasons. Sometimes we provide flowers for hotels and offices, and we also take part in photo sessions for businesses. Once I decorated a castle with flowers for a wedding. It was a lot of work but I was proud of the job we’d done.

My day starts early, at 4 a.m., when I go to the market to buy fresh flowers. It’s usually cold and dark at that time, but I don’t mind. The market is full of beautiful flowers. I like to choose flowers that are perfect for my customers. Sometimes it’s difficult to find the right flowers, but I try to get the best possible price.

Back at the shop, I look at customer orders and set up vases with the flowers I’ve bought. Then I create bunches of flowers and work out how much the orders will cost. Customers are often surprised by how expensive the flowers are, but I sometimes have to ask them to think again about what they’d like.

I like my job because I can put together the nicest possible flowers for the amount of money someone wants to spend. I wouldn’t want any other job.<eos>"

My city has a modern cinema that shows all the latest films I want to see, and lots of films for kids at the weekends. It’s close to where I live, but a year ago, I realised something was missing – the experience of discussing a film in detail with a group of people after watching it with them. So, together with two friends, I started a film club. We decided to keep our costs low, so we don’t hire a cinema. Instead, we choose a different location in the city each month. We’re happy to make enough to cover our costs – we’re not trying to make a profit. Each time we show a film, everything is a bit easier for us. We also know how many tickets we’ve sold because everything’s online. There’s still always plenty to do, but when people come up to say what a great experience they’ve had, it’s wonderful. We’ve started a blog, too, because we know that most people now go online for information about films, rather than read reviews in local papers. We’ve also tried putting up a few posters in cafés. Nothing’s as successful as word of mouth, though – people recommending us to their friends.<eos>"

Taking photographs was always my favourite activity as a child. When I was 15, I felt that if I wanted to take my hobby to the next level, I had to do something special. So I decided to start a personal project: I would take one photograph every day for a whole year of my life. I was keen to create a photo diary and also to have the chance to show other people my photos. I was amazed to discover that there were others who liked the way I saw and photographed things. I was also enjoying photographing a wide range of subjects. As a result, I sometimes had doubts about my project, and I almost gave up several times. In the end, however, I trusted my own feelings, and became more confident about my photographic style and choices. I now have my own photography studio and I’ve never regretted my career choice.<eos>"

Last year, I joined the National Youth Challenge (NYC) because I wanted to learn new skills. In the NYC, you can do different activities to challenge yourself and you’re always learning something. There are different levels, from beginner to advanced, run by adult volunteers called ‘leaders’. When you complete each level, you get a certificate. I decided to take up the challenge and I was able to keep on volunteering at the club because I’d built up some great relationships with the children. Now I’m there for about four hours a week and I always really look forward to going. I’ve improved my own communication skills while at the same time helping others. I’ve got several other NYC certificates now and yes, one of them is for camping.<eos>"

I was born in Denver, USA. I started snowboarding when I was eight years old. My dad took me to a resort in the mountains, about two hours from Denver. The hill was very steep, so my dad had to do a lot of persuading to get me on a board. I was so young, I hadn’t even thought of asking him if I could start snowboarding, but he was already into it and wanted me to love it too. And in the end, I managed just fine. After this experience, I started competing aged ten. I enjoy snowboarding and I also like to compete. I have to think carefully about my future. Snowboarding is such a huge part of my life now, but I also feel it’s important to have something else I can do, just in case I don’t succeed as a professional snowboarder or if I get injured.

When I was fifteen, I wanted everything my friends had. I didn't plan ahead. One day, my best friend got a new phone and I thought I should have one too. My parents said I could only have it if I paid for it myself, so I decided to work part-time and save as much as I could. I owe my parents a lot for making me do that – it taught me a really valuable lesson. I worked every Saturday in a café, but I didn’t really enjoy it. My parents suggested starting my own little business instead. I asked my mum if I could have a go at making necklaces. I’d never imagined I’d find it so easy, as it had seemed so complicated when I’d watched Mum doing it. I sold my first items of jewellery to my friends and family. They told me they were delighted with them, but I just thought they were saying that to please me. So although I was grateful they’d bought them, I still needed convincing that they looked good enough to be popular with the public. There was only one way to find out, so I rented a market stall with my mum. There are always lots of tourists where I live, and they bought lots of my things to give to family and friends when they got back home. Soon we were receiving calls from all over the country from people looking to buy more. We thought we were a big company, employing loads of people to produce my designs, when in fact we were just two people on a market stall. That was when I knew it could work, and it was time to take the next step – creating a website. Since then, I’ve made thousands of pounds through my business, mostly online. It’s been such a lot of fun so far.<eos>"

When Janine Stuart was young, she wrote a novel called Being Amelia which became a bestseller. Being Amelia is based on Janine’s life. In one interview, Janine said, ‘Because of my family’s moving around a lot, I’ve become good at making new friends. I understand what it’s like to be the only new student in a class, and that helped me to write about how the main character, Amelia, gets on in a new school.

Janine started her novel one summer, when she was feeling bored at home. Her mother had always dreamt of becoming a published author herself, and her teachers had always encouraged her to write, so it seemed like a natural way for Janine to pass the time. The year before, she’d entered a short story competition on a young writers’ website and won first prize. That’s why, when Janine finished Being Amelia and sent it to a publishing company, the people who worked there were immediately keen to read it. They loved it, and a year later, Janine’s novel was on sale in bookshops.<eos>"

My name is Tom. I am fifteen years old. Three years ago, my family and I moved to a castle on a small island. My dad was invited to be the castle’s manager. He works for an organisation that looks after historical buildings. We were worried about the move at first, but we soon got used to island life. The castle isn’t very beautiful, but our apartment is comfortable. The island feels very sociable in the summer and there are often parties on the beach. During the winter, there are not as many teenagers as I had hoped. But the adults all support each other and help with repairs on the island. The biggest change for me was travelling by boat every day. I have to catch the bus to the harbour after school to get the ferry. Sometimes I miss the bus and miss the last ferry home. So when schoolmates come home to stay with me, I’m always telling them to hurry up. But we often get the most fantastic views, for example when the sun goes down over the sea. Some days, though, it’s so foggy that you can’t see a thing, then within hours it’s brilliant sunshine again.<eos>"

I live in a house surrounded by beautiful countryside in Scotland. I love nature and wild animals, and I started a new hobby called birdwatching six years ago. I went to some mountains in northern Scotland with my family, where we saw lots of birds. I spent hours watching them with my parents, who showed me how to tell the difference between species and how to find the best places to see them. It was amazing, and I joined a local young birdwatchers’ club. My goal is to see 200 different bird species, and I’ve almost achieved that. I’ve been to Egypt and South America, where I hoped to see my 200th species. I didn’t mind that it didn’t happen, because I’ve learned that you have to be patient with this hobby. I posted a video online about this challenge, and many teenagers enjoyed it. I also think that birdwatching clubs should try to get more young people interested in this hobby. Everyone needs to connect with nature, whatever their age, and it doesn’t have to cost much money.<eos>"

I started playing football when I was 7. I would rush home from school to play with other boys and girls. I loved it, and I was good at it. But my family knew I often became keen on new hobbies and then dropped them, so they thought the same thing would happen with football. But it never did. I was already dreaming of playing football professionally when I was older. And the opportunity came sooner than I’d hoped. I played in local tournaments, and one of the referees noticed that I was a promising player, so he asked the manager of a professional women’s club to watch me play. After that, she asked me to join her club. I started regular training with a big club as a young 13-year-old. I improved enormously. But people still weren’t sure I’d ever be a star player, which made me feel a bit upset. But my coach encouraged me to just be myself, and believe in myself – he even let me play in one of the club’s championship matches, much earlier than I’d expected. I’ve never run so hard in my life – I didn’t want the other players to blame me for losing. Then by pure luck, I got the winning goal. And since then, I’ve scored lots more winning goals.<eos>"

One of the most interesting developments in further and higher education in the UK has been a move to encourage novice students to become involved with research as early as possible. Research is not an exclusive activity for established scholars or scientists. It can also be seen as a natural and fundamental way to build knowledge and skills.

Research approaches and skills will be useful not only in your studies but also in employment. They are ways of thinking about the world and ways of going about your own work. As a student, you make a contribution to knowledge. You do not just digest and repeat it, you make it. Making knowledge is based on asking questions, rather than taking things for granted.

Most students have always been a researcher of sorts. You will have been carrying out some elements of research for projects and answered questions at school or in the workplace since your first few days there. You will also have been developing research and enquiry approaches and skills when exploring where to go on holiday, how to grow seeds successfully, how to fix things around the house, how to train your dog, how to find the right kind of music system, and how to buy the right kind of items for your needs online.

Critical thinking is particularly important in research. We need to be able not just to repeat what we’ve read and take everything in as if it was proven fact, but to engage with it, think about it, test it out, identify whether what we’re being told is presented in such a way as to trick us into agreement, or whether it is logical, reasoned and backed by evidence.<eos>"

Cities have always been centers of intellectual life. They are places where people gather to discuss ideas and share their thoughts. However, city life is not always easy. It can be exhausting and overwhelming. Scientists have begun to study how the city affects the brain, and the results are alarming. They have found that cities actually dull our thinking, sometimes dramatically so. One of the main reasons for this is the lack of nature in cities. Studies have shown that people who can see trees from their windows recover more quickly from illness. Even small glimpses of nature improve brain performance. This research arrives just as humans pass an important milestone: the majority of people now live in cities. Instead of inhabiting wide-open spaces, we're crowded into concrete jungles, surrounded by millions of strangers. The unnatural surroundings of city life have important implications for our mental and physical health. They can powerfully alter how we think. To improve cognitive performance, we need to find ways to reduce stress and increase our connection to nature.<eos>"

The mind is a complex thing. It is not just the brain. There is evidence that things and neurons participate in human cognitive life. Stone objects, body ornaments, engravings, clay tokens and writing systems play an active role in human evolution and the making of the human mind.

The mind and the brain became equated because most of what we know about the human mind has been uncovered through isolating people from the material culture they are usually surrounded by in order to study them. But this often goes unnoticed that much of our thinking takes place outside our heads.

There is a new theory that explores the different ways in which things become cognitive extensions or are incorporated by the human body. It is called Material Engagement Theory (MET). MET aims to explore the different ways in which things become cognitive extensions or are incorporated by the human body.

The human mind is an unfinished project, in a permanent state of on-going evolution. It is important to keep in mind that whatever actual form the 'stick' might have taken in the history of our species, its primary function was that of a pathway instead of a boundary.<eos>"

Photography has greatly changed the way we know the world. It has been especially true in the United States, where photography quickly became part of US culture. Photography has been a major contribution to the visual arts in the US. It has moved to the centre of US intellectual and aesthetic discourse.

Why was photography so appealing? Firstly, it was a mechanical process that matched a growing enthusiasm for technology. Secondly, the camera was the instrument of choice for representing oneself and family. Thirdly, photography was a way of creating and sustaining an impression of self and family. Finally, the photograph’s inherent realism was in harmony aesthetically with a tendency towards realism.

If we want to understand a photograph historically, then we need to pay special attention to its purpose and function within a given cultural matrix. We also need to consider the placement and framing of the photograph.<eos>"

In 1890, William James, an American philosopher and physician, defined psychology as the 'science of mental life.' This definition is still a good starting point for understanding psychology today. We all have a mental life and therefore have some idea about what this means. However, even though the concept can be studied in rats and monkeys as well as humans, it remains a somewhat elusive one.

Psychology is about the mind or brain, but psychologists do not understand nearly enough about its workings to be able to comprehend the part that it plays in the experience and expression of our hopes, fears, and wishes, or in our behaviour during experiences as varied as giving birth or watching a football match.

The endeavour of psychology is much like that involved in solving a crossword puzzle. It involves evaluating and interpreting available clues. Complex interactions are the norm rather than the exception in psychology, and understanding them depends on the development of sophisticated techniques and theories.

Psychology has the same goals as any other science: to describe, understand, predict, and learn how to control or modify the process that it studies. Once these goals have been achieved, it can help us to understand the nature of our experience and come to conclusions that can be applied directly to people’s lives.<eos>"

The proprietor of the museum, Carol Sherry, sees every product as embodying its own sad story. The museum is a viable, profit-making business. It is a testament to the fact that most products fail. The museum was started by a man named Robert McMath who intended to accumulate a reference library of consumer products. But he ended up collecting mostly unsuccessful products. The museum is a reminder that we should not be afraid to fail. It is also a reminder that we should not be afraid to try new things.<eos>"

Everyone knows that sports teams have an advantage when they play at home. But does anyone know why? Most of us probably think we do; after all, it seems obvious. But professional sport is changing faster than at any time in its history and much of what we used to take for granted is now open to question.

There are two main reasons why home advantage exists. First, the home team has the advantage of playing in front of their own crowd. This can give them a boost of confidence and make them more likely to win. Second, the home team has the advantage of being able to control the playing conditions. This can also give them an edge in the game.

However, there are some changes that have recently occurred that have made home advantage less effective. For example, travel has become more convenient and the top grounds increasingly resemble one another. As a result, home advantage has declined in all major sports, but not by as much as one might expect.

One possible explanation for why home advantage varies depending on the sport is that it is primarily a team phenomenon. In team sports, winning ultimately hangs on all concerned being team players, which builds confidence in their ability to find each other on the court.<eos>"

The more I practice, the luckier I get, said Gary Player. This quote is famous and is valued by athletes and their coaches. It is easy to see why. The quote’s source is disputed and its meaning is enigmatic. However, the main message is clear: the more I practice, the better I get. Up to a point. Where that point is, is at the heart of the nature-nurture debate. Practice matters more than innate talent. It is the key to success in any field. However, there are some exceptions. Some people have a natural talent that makes it easier for them to learn new things. But, with practice, anyone can become an expert in anything.<eos>"

A recent report found that many children living in wealthy countries feel lonely and unhappy. The reason for this is that these children have been spending too much time indoors, watching TV or playing on computers, and have lost contact with the natural world. This is a problem because it can lead to unhappiness and dissatisfaction.

A follow-up study found that most of the children interviewed said they would be happier if they could go outside more. Many adults also talk nostalgically about the freedom of their own youth, when they spent long summer days playing outside. However, they rarely stop to reflect that they are the ones who have imposed that protective regime on their own children.

There are some good arguments in the book about the relationship between the fear of danger and child-focused consumerism. However, the author's arguments go too far and she does not provide enough evidence to support them.<eos>"

I'm a research bio-psychologist with a PhD. I've done lots of school. I'm a pretty good problem-solver, but that has little to do with the schooling I’ve had. Most problems in life cannot be solved with some complex formula or memorised answers. They require the judgement, wisdom and creative ability that come from life experiences.

Play is the natural means by which adults and mammals have always educated themselves. The most important skills children everywhere must learn in order to live happy, productive, moral lives are skills that cannot be taught in school. Such skills cannot be taught at all. They are learnt and practised by children in play.

School has become more onerous: breaks have been reduced, homework piled up, and pressure for high grades increased. Outside school, adult-directed sports have replaced impromptu games. These changes have been gradual, imperceptible, but over time they have been enormous.

If we care about our children and future generations, we must reverse the horrid trend that has been occurring over the past half century. We must give childhood back to children. Children must be allowed to follow their inborn drives to play and explore, so that they can grow into intellectually, socially, emotionally and physically strong adults fit for an unpredictable future.<eos>"

Newspapers have been struggling in recent years. Their circulation has fallen and they are no longer the main source of news for most people in the US. Some people predict that newspapers will soon be extinct. However, there are a few reasons why old media have a habit of surviving. For example, radio and cinema have survived despite the rise of other technologies. Even vinyl records have made a comeback. Newspapers themselves were once new media, and they have survived for centuries.

There are a few challenges that newspapers face today. One challenge is that people can get news more quickly and easily online. Another challenge is that people can personalize their news to their own interests. However, newspapers still have a lot to offer. They can provide us with up-to-date information, and they can help us to understand the world around us.<eos>"

If humans were truly at home under the light of the moon and stars, we would go in darkness happily. Instead, we are diurnal creatures, with eyes adapted to living in the sun’s light. We have engineered the night to receive us by filling it with light. This kind of control is no different from the feat of damming a river. Light pollution is largely the result of bad lighting design. It washes out the darkness of night, altering light levels and light rhythms to which many forms of life, including ourselves, have adapted.

Light pollution has a negative impact on various aspects of life. It affects migration, reproduction, feeding, and our biological well-being. Denying darkness is futile. It is as essential to maintaining our biological welfare as light itself. The regular oscillation of waking and sleep in our lives is nothing less than a biological expression of the regular oscillation of light on Earth. So fundamental are these rhythms to our being that messing with them is akin to altering our center of gravity.

Living in a glare of our own making, we have cut ourselves off from our evolutionary and cultural heritage – the light of the stars and the rhythms of day and night. In a very real sense, light pollution causes us to lose sight of our true place in the universe, to forget the scale of our being, which is best measured against the dimensions of a deep night with the Milky Way arching overhead.<eos>"

Journal-based peer review is a process that ensures the quality of scientific research papers. It is often seen as a way to prevent flawed or nonsensical papers from being published. However, reviewing a paper can delay its publication by up to a year. Is this a price worth paying to ensure the trustworthiness of the published literature? Well, yes and no. Preprints are drafts of papers that are posted online without having been peer reviewed. They bring academics back to what research publication is all about: the rapid dissemination of new results.

When I ask my students about poems, they often give me answers that are like ""a painting in words."" Their answers rarely satisfy me, or them. One day I asked a group to choose an object and write one paragraph describing it empirically, as a scientist might, and another in the first person, from the point of view of the item itself. The exercise led to much amusement and useful discussion.

A poem is a thing made. Poets sometimes compare poems to wild animals or machines. But such comparisons fall apart upon closer analysis. The most productive thing about trying to define a poem through comparison lies not in the comparison itself but in the debate. A poem is a product of writing and rewriting just like an article, story, or novel. It never really becomes what they usually are – a thing created in order to become a commodity.

A poem is a thing that can surprise, if only for a moment. It is a thing that can make us see commonplace things in a new light. It is a thing that can help us experiment with our well-trodden patterns of thought.<eos>"

Sleeping is one of my favorite travel experiences. I don't talk about it very much because I feel a little guilty. When friends share details of their well-planned trips, I smile and don't say much. What would they think if they knew that my own travel itineraries include naps and lazy mornings. Better sleep is one of travel's happy side effects. When I visited Mexico's Yucatán coast, I was surprised by how many hours I spent sleeping. There were lots of noisy birds in the neighboring lot, but it didn't matter. Surrounded by strange smells and sounds, I could plunge into a sleep that was more profound and dream-filled than I imagined possible. Sleep is something else too: it's an experience that changes rhythm, sometimes dramatically, from place to place. People obsess about jet lag, but I suspect that the difficulties I experience recovering from long journeys have more to do with local and cultural adjustment than time zones. When I finally fall into the local sleep pattern, I feel I have truly arrived.<eos>"

In the Red Bull Air Race, twelve pilots race through a series of pylons between 15 and 25 meters high. They negotiate sharp turns, barrel rolls and loops at speeds of up to 370 km per hour. I was invited to find out what it feels like to take part. I had to sign two forms before the flight. The first confirmed that I was in good health, the second that I would empty all my pockets. I also learned that I would have to try to stay orientated throughout the flight. I was told to relax and enjoy the view. Half an hour before the flight, I had a safety briefing in which I was told not to touch anything. By the time we were taxiing down the runway, I was ready to fly. I ignored all instructions received and would not relax and enjoy the flight. This is the cruel paradox of high-speed acrobatic flying. In order to survive it without passing out, you have to keep calm and focused. You have to tense up at the right time and you have to relax at the right time. Panicking is a bad idea.

Doug Allan is a wildlife cameraman who films wild animals in cold places. If you have ever seen footage of polar bears in a nature documentary, it's probably been filmed by him. Allan was born in a cold place and he has a passion for diving. He became a marine biologist and commercial diver. One day, he was working in Antarctica and a TV crew turned up to film a wildlife documentary. Allan took the crew to different places and after 48 hours, he realized that being a wildlife cameraman ticked all the boxes: travel, adventure, and underwater.

Allan has filmed many major TV wildlife series. He says that it is easier to film today than when he started 35 years ago. Today, you can shoot a lot and look at it immediately. Film was very expensive and you had to remember everything you shot. Today, you can have too much material.

Allan says that wildlife filming is full of great successes, but also failures and embarrassments. He has had some challenges, but he has also had some amazing experiences. He would like to make his own film about climate change in the Arctic. He says he would be able to make an extraordinary documentary.<eos>"

In 2004, Pen Hadow became the first person to trek to the North Pole alone and without being resupplied on the way. He made it to the South Pole as well. Now he is back in the Arctic again, preparing for an expedition he says is even more ambitious.

Pen is a skilled explorer. He has a lot of physical endurance and is able to withstand extreme cold and harsh conditions. He is also very organized and has a strong attention to detail.

Pen is married to Mary, a horsewoman, who says he has a ‘spine of steel’ and who shares his love of the outdoors. They live in the country with their two children.

Pen is going to the North Pole to collect data about the ice. Scientists will use this data to learn more about global warming. Pen believes his mission reconnects exploration with the search for knowledge that drove previous generations into the unknown.

I had a break from my training. I was going to do something else. Being a successful Olympian is a special thing. I had the chance to do more writing and TV work, and to speak to businesses and schools. I also entered marathons and triathlons. I was beginning to miss the feeling of rowing, but I still wasn’t ready to commit to the training regime seven days a week. I spoke to some of my rowing colleagues about whether they fancied the race; I didn’t receive any enthusiastic responses. I knew that if I entered the race, I would want to win. I got in contact with Ben Fogle. We spoke about the remaining costs of the race. We felt we stood a better chance than most, but it would still take work to secure it. Of all the ways to earn money as a retired professional sportsman, speaking at business conferences is one of the most profitable. I think if I’m honest, I had concerns over people’s reaction to me doing a race with a TV presenter. I was worried that it would look like I just wanted to be on TV, otherwise I would have chosen a better partner to help win the race. My concerns disappeared over the course of our preparations.

Last year, I moved to the Arctic Circle in Finland to work with huskies. I was young and restless, and I dreamed of seeing the cold and bleak landscapes of the Arctic. I found a small company run by Anna and Pasi, and they agreed to take me on as a husky dog handler. From December to February, there is plenty of business taking tourists out on sled rides. I could join the team for three months, but I knew the work would be long and tough. I started packing straight away.

The bus north was long and dark. I arrived at the farm after dark, and I was handed a pair of boots and turned out into the cold. I followed the sound of barking and joined the team of husky guides. I was able to learn the basics of dog-sledding, but everything else seemed to be very complicated. By the end of my first week, my head was spinning with instructions and my muscles ache from dragging heavy sleds. But I was triumphant. I emailed my friends and told them I could chop with an axe, hammer a nail, and use a circular saw in the snow.<eos>"

On that day, Radcliffe ran very fast and won the race. The press was there to make sense of her extraordinary run. Her time was so good that it would qualify her to compete in the men's marathon at the world championships in Paris. Journalists asked her about the benefits of a natural treatment called emu oil. Cathy Freeman, an Olympic gold medallist, had recommended this treatment to heal the wounds caused by a freak accident.

Radcliffe feels that her achievement never really sank in. She can see it must have been a really big deal at that time. She and her team said they weren’t going to set a limit on anything. That was their motto: no limits. During the race, her husband and coach, Gary Lough, was in a car with her support team, listening to the radio coverage.

Radcliffe began to calculate as she approached the finish line. She knew she could finish in under 2 hours 16 minutes if she crossed the line in less than three minutes. She ran quickly and finished the race in 2 minutes 25 seconds. At the finish, she felt proud of her accomplishment.

Many people were inspired by Radcliffe's run. Many women started running long distances because of her. She left a lasting legacy.<eos>"

When I first started a cookery programme called In Search of Perfection, I was not sure how people would react to it. There had been a lot of talk about the food revolution happening in Britain, and I was confident that we had created a series of programmes that made a unique contribution to that. I watched the first programme and was relieved that it was well-received. The success of the show led to other projects, including a book based on my experiences at the restaurant I own. In each project, there is a sense of adventure, whether it's into the past, into the mind, or into cookery techniques. I wrote several books in a series called 'Perfection', each one accompanying its own TV programme of the same name. In these books, the journey was often physical, with passports and suitcases and itineraries. The latest book in the series is called In Search of Total Perfection, and it takes you on a journey around the world to meet extraordinary artisans. Despite the book's title, I knew that I wouldn't be claiming the recipes were definitive. But I believed that, by using my technical skill and scientific knowledge, I could pin down some of the things that made these dishes work.<eos>"

Lucy was talking to two other pianists at the Prague Classical Music Festival. They were older than her and good enough English speakers. They talked about the pieces they were playing, where else they’d travelled recently, and where they were going next.

Lucy had not wanted to go to the festival, but she had made it. Her dad bought her a white-gold necklace with an L pendant to congratulate her. Her little brother Gus got all caught up in imagining himself at the same festival one day.

Her teacher took her out for a special dinner to strategize a repertoire. The thing was, Lucy hadn’t even applied. Her mom had filled out the form and sent in the CD.

In the elevator to their suite after they’d left the party, her grandfather turned to her. ‘You did well in there, Lucy. I’m proud of you. This is an important festival, and there’s a buzz about you. They all know who you are.’<eos>"

It's not good to spend too much time online. You need to get out into the real world, said Dad. He's difficult to argue with, so I decided to find out what people who have studied the subject say – and it’s quite interesting. Generally, research shows that most teenagers who use social media have a wide circle of real-life friends, a good sense of identity and belonging, and are developing the essential technical skills we need to be citizens of a digital age.

Social networking has become an integral part of modern childhood. Teenagers don’t consume media – dipping in and out to buy airline tickets or check e-mails as adults do – they inhabit it. It performs a similar function to hanging around at the youth club, as today’s parents used to do when they were younger.

Adolescence is a time when you are asking, who am I? Social networking can help you develop that self-identity. You can post notices about your favourite music or sports, discover what you enjoy, and you are constantly reminded that other people have different ways of looking at things.

Teenagers who use social networking as a creative force will reap the benefits when they become adults and enter the world of work. Collaboration is a real 21st-century skill, and an important part of being employable in a digital age.<eos>"

When people think of a family vacation, I guess most people don't imagine a cross-country adventure through the western states in the US and a Canadian province. However, my parents clearly weren’t looking to put their feet up as they organized our summer vacation this year. My dad seemed to have taken it upon himself to plan the ultimate family bonding trip. We packed a lot of stuff into the car, including suitcases, coolers, and clothing. We set off on 'The Family Great American Road Trip'. As we drove west, we stopped at a town in Oklahoma. We learned the rule of the road: cattle get the right-of-way. We continued our journey and stopped at Pagosa Springs, Colorado. We climbed mountains and learned that Jeep roads are best left to Jeep drivers. We also visited Yellowstone National Park and watched the setting sun cast its shadows over bear habitats close to the roads. Finally, we made our way back home.

Rose Frost was sixteen years old and was going to live with her grandmother, Daisy. Her family was separating for two years. Her father had an assignment overseas, and her mother would be joining him, but Rose and her sister Amy were staying in England. Amy was completing her final school courses and would be living under the guardianship of the college Head. It was her last year at school so it would have been unfair on Amy to move. To Amy’s delight, she had been given the best room at the college, with its own kitchen and study area. The free access to the Internet and phone had also not gone unnoticed. Rose was moving to her grandmother’s house. It was only vague holiday memories that Rose recalled of her grandmother, and she had never known her grandfather. Her parents had not been enthused by the idea of her living with her grandma, but Daisy had insisted that it was no trouble. Rose was sensible and very mature for her age. She knew about healthy eating, about keeping fit, and getting enough sleep. But this time Rose had insisted on one thing: she wanted her independence. Living with Daisy would be fulfilling all her needs. But Rose wanted to play music loud if she wanted, and to invite friends over or go out without having to ask permission every time.

Charlotte Grainger was inspired to write a novel by her primary school teacher. She started writing the novel when she was 13 years old. The novel is about to be published. It is a huge achievement. The narrative is assured and action packed. Nothing about the book suggests that it was written by a teenager.

Charlotte acknowledges the limitations of her youth. She says that she was trying to ask big questions, not answer them. She also says that she doesn’t think her understanding of the world is limited by her age.

Charlotte has a theory about teenagers and the way they are ‘betrayed’ by the fiction that is specifically aimed at them. She says that there are three types of teenager depicted in novels. There’s the outsider who becomes acceptable to society, the naïve teenager who knows nothing about the big wide world, and the awkward teenage character who isn’t socially skilled.

Charlotte has always been a keen reader of famous fantasy writers. She says that books by her favourite fantasy writers explore deep things about psychology and about life. She also says that she was inspired by a book called How Not to Write a Novel.<eos>"

Our instructor, Gareth, told us that speed is our friend, not our enemy. We looked down the ski slope and saw David, who had some experience, skiing off down the slope towards the jump. He hit the approach ramp fast and flew upwards, arms flailing in the air. Something was wrong and we held our breath. He hit the ground and flipped head-first into the snow. Gareth informed us that speed is an unpredictable beast. I had enjoyed messing about on previous skiing holidays, but I wasn’t one of those teenagers who spent their time doing freestyle tricks on ramps and half pipes.

Imagine you're on a rollercoaster in an amusement park. You come to a stop and inhale sharply before the carriage moves slowly upwards. A pause. Then there is a sharp drop and your stomach is suspended in the air. You hurtle quickly forwards, sharply left, then upside down. You let out a roar of fear that comes from the pit of your gut.

Amusement parks are a huge industry that delivers thrills and escape from reality. To create the perfect ride, there are teams of highly inventive engineers and designers. The skill of rollercoaster design is in compiling the pieces and ensuring that passengers are safe.

In order to create a thrilling ride, the teams must piece together a strong narrative, be it a space adventure or a high-paced chase in the jungle. However, in the end, gut instincts, years of experience and trial-and-error are what work.<eos>"

At 25, Miranda Ellington has achieved a lot as a choreographer. She creates works for many theatres and dance companies. She also dances from time to time. She is busy, but she enjoys her work.

As a choreographer, Miranda is in a teaching role. She likes working with young students. They are receptive to exploring new ideas. They are hungry for success, but they don’t yet have a clear sense of their strengths and weaknesses.

When Miranda starts working with a new group, she concentrates on the dance steps and the music dictates what she does. If the dancers aren’t responding well to a particular composer’s music, that can be frustrating, but she still has to find solutions.

Miranda doesn’t believe in attaching herself to one institution. She has to be prepared to adapt the way she works each time she goes somewhere new.

The conversation turns to the recent documentary on professional ballet dancers and choreographers. The documentary is accurate and shows the hard work and dedication involved in ballet.

Miranda has done a range of work, so I wonder how she sees herself: is she a modern dance choreographer or a ballet specialist? She says she doesn’t like to be labeled.<eos>"

A friend asked me why I travel when I can see everything on television. I agreed that you can see amazing things on TV, but why sit at home on your sofa when there’s so much out there to experience. I guess that conversation gave me the idea for my crazy four-day trip, and a film that aimed to get people to turn off their television sets. I had a mate getting rid of his old sofa, so I fixed it up and connected it to some old seatbelts. I put my luggage on the seats and slept on the sofa each night, including one night on the beach. Several friends joined me on the way, helping to pull the sofa along and encouraging me to keep going. I’ve been on several expeditions on foot in recent years, but this was something completely new. Not only was it the longest distance I have ever walked, but it was also on main roads, which meant I could stop at a roadside café and relax on the sofa with a cappuccino instead of having the wind blowing away my sandwiches while I sit on a rock.

When I read about swimming trips in the sea around some small Greek islands, I was excited. I'd never tried group trips before. My brother was busy, so I decided a group holiday might suit me. The man at the Greek port was curious when I asked for a single ticket. I explained I wouldn't be alone for long; I’d be joining ten others to swim around the tiny islands. We did a short swim to split us into speed groups, then it was time for our first proper swim. I was nervous. I’d trained in my local pool and done some river swimming, but never long distances in the open sea. Soon, the waves got bigger and I was at the back of the slow group. I watched faster swimmers moving ahead like dolphins. I wanted to complete this first distance, though, and was delighted when I finally managed it on my own.

I have a job that I love. I've been to many places, including the US and Australia. I work with great people, and I have a lot of time off. Life is always exciting, which makes it a great job for a young person like me.

When I was a child, I went to a boarding school away from my family. I always flew unaccompanied when term began and ended. I felt lonely, so I would ask the flight attendants to let me help give out meals to passengers. And I guess that’s the thing I remembered later, when I needed an escape from my job and began looking for a new direction. There was a lot of young people at the interview, and many were accepted. They were often highly qualified like me, and were changing careers. Before the interview, I practised what to say. I mentioned my strengths and previous work experience – and I got the job!

I would recommend this kind of work to anyone. There are so many things that make it worthwhile. The free flights I get aren’t top of the list. Most airline staff are incredibly hard-working, and there’s a saying – ‘no-one’s finished till everyone’s finished.’ It’s like a big family – even though we don’t see each other all the time, we’re still close. When I’m not working, I don’t have to take work home. And if I do get difficult passengers, which is rare, I always know the flight will soon be over and I’ll probably never see them again.<eos>"

At the summer camp where I work, I really enjoy seeing the children succeed at things they never thought they could do. Most of the children know how to swim and play table-tennis, but rock climbing is a new experience for most of them. Some children feel very nervous, but after some encouragement they agree to try and they all get to the top in the end. This makes them feel great. We do get children who miss home at the beginning of the week. It's not the really young ones who feel like that the most – it's actually the ten- to thirteen-year-olds. We don't let them use their mobile phones all the time. We tell them they can phone home after lunch and sometimes after dinner. Most children are fine in a couple of days and at the end of their week's stay, they all come up to us and thank us because they have had a great time.<eos>"

Rock the Planet, a musical show, opened in London last year. It was voted 'Best Musical' four times in the USA. The show was challenging to do with an all-British cast of actors because the UK puts more limits on how many performances young actors can do. Luckily, the director found plenty of talented UK-based actors. The theatre in London is bigger than the US venue, but it's been full every night.

I met 11-year-old Jamie, one of the show’s actors. He said that he gets paid to play and that he misses his old school mates. He also told me how busy the young actors are. They have normal school lessons each day at the theatre.

The show’s on in London for another year, and is well worth seeing.<eos>"
