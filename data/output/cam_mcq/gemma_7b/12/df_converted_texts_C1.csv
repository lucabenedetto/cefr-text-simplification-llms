Some time ago, there was a website that talked about the risks of public check-ins. It said that if you post something online, it can be seen by a lot of people. This made people think about the downsides of sharing their lives online. The website also talked about the history of blogging. It said that the first bloggers were people who were willing to share their lives with the world. One of the first bloggers was a young man named Justin Hall. He started blogging in 1996 and he was very popular. But one day, his blog was taken down because someone sent the address of his blog to his boss. This showed that the web can be a dangerous place. However, it also showed that people can overcome challenges and do great things. Another blogger, Heather Armstrong, had a similar experience. She was also targeted by her boss because of her blog. But she was able to overcome this challenge and continue blogging. Today, she is a successful blogger and she has a lot of followers.

A long time ago, some scientists started a campaign to warn people about a low-budget film called What the Bleep Do We Know? which showed that there is a lot about our universe that we don’t understand. The film made some pretty amazing claims, but some scientists felt that the evidence was not convincing. They argued that the movie’s claims were too vague and that more proof was needed. Despite this, the film was still a must-see for many people.

The film described some new discoveries about the universe, such as the ability of water molecules to be affected by thought. However, scientists were not impressed by the evidence presented in the film. They argued that the pictures of ice crystals were not convincing and that more research was needed.

The film also claimed that the universe is made from an unknown form of matter and is being propelled by a mysterious force known only as ‘dark energy’. Scientists have not confirmed this claim, but they believe that it is possible that the universe is made from a different type of matter than we are familiar with.<eos>"

I find writing novels a challenge, and writing short stories a joy. Writing novels is like planting a forest, and writing short stories is more like planting a garden. The two processes complement each other, creating a complete landscape that I treasure.

Since the beginning of my career as a fiction writer, I have fairly consistently alternated between writing novels and short stories. I write novels and short stories in different ways. It takes me about a week to get a short story into some kind of decent shape.

I find writing short stories a necessary change of pace and a way to experiment. They are like soft shadows I have set out in the world, faint footprints I have left behind. Short stories are like guideposts to my heart, and it makes me happy as a writer to be able to share these intimate feelings with my readers.<eos>"

Science is a powerful force that has greatly impacted human society. It has improved our lives and presented challenges. It has also inspired artists and thinkers. Science has its beauty and its dangers. It has been characterized by conflict and change.

Throughout history, scientists have been making discoveries and developing new theories. Some theories have been proven to be incorrect, while others have stood the test of time. Science is not static. It is always evolving.

Science has also been used to control nature. We have the ability to manipulate the environment and use science to improve our lives. However, science has also been used to disrupt the balance of nature. We must be careful to use science responsibly.

Science has become an integral part of human society. It is a powerful tool that we can use to improve our lives and the world. However, we must also be aware of the potential dangers of science.<eos>"

From around 2015, major publishers started to report that sales of ebooks had plateaued or even fallen in some cases. This has raised concerns about the long-term potential of ebooks in the publishing industry. Some people believe that the ebooks hype may have driven unwise investment, with companies losing confidence in the power of the word on the page. Despite the evidence suggesting that digital and print can coexist in the market, the question of whether the ebook will ‘kill’ the print book still continues to surface.

The idea of one medium ‘killing’ another has often followed the unveiling of new technologies. Even before the advent of digital technologies, critics have predicted the demise of existing media. For example, after the invention of television, many claimed that radio would die. But radio ended up surviving by finding new uses. The same is true for books. As technology moves on, we find ourselves longing for what we used to know, but no longer have. This is why entire industries develop around retro products and older technologies.<eos>"

Every day, I wake up early, brush my teeth, make coffee, and write about how some of the greatest minds of the past have approached creative work. I write about the mundane details of my subjects’ daily lives to provide a new perspective on their personalities and careers. I also talk about my own struggles with creativity and work-life balance.

My book is about the circumstances of creative activity, not the product. It deals with manufacturing rather than meaning. But it’s also, inevitably, personal. I have included examples of how a variety of brilliant and successful people have confronted similar challenges. I wanted to show how grand creative visions translate to small daily increments; how one’s working habits influence the work itself, and vice versa.

As much as possible, I have let my subjects speak for themselves, in quotes from letters, diaries and interviews. I have also included some of my own thoughts and ideas about creativity and work-life balance. I hope this book will inspire you to reflect on your own creative process and to find a rhythm that works for you.<eos>"

Charles Spence is a Professor of Experimental Psychology at Oxford University in the UK. He has studied how the senses interact to form our perception of flavour. Through his studies, he has influenced what we eat and drink. He has also studied how food is experienced with others. His book, The Perfect Meal, is packed with insights that are fascinating to anyone in possession of an appetite.

Spence has a lab in Oxford that is not very high-tech. It has soundproof booths and stacks of ancient-looking audio-visual equipment. Much of his work is funded by a major food multinational. He is currently helping famous brands through reductions in salt and sugar.

Spence has also collaborated with Heston Blumenthal, a renowned experimental chef. They have worked together to create new dishes that incorporate sensory science. One of their most famous dishes is the 'Sound of the Sea' dish.<eos>"

Our brains are very busy these days. We have a lot of information to deal with, including facts, pseudo facts, and rumours. We also do more things than ever before. Thirty years ago, people used to make our airline reservations and help us find what we needed in shops. Now we do most things ourselves. We’re doing the work of 10 different people while still trying to keep up with our lives, our families, our careers, our hobbies, and our favourite TV shows. Our smartphones have become an important part of our lives. They help us do all of these things. However, there’s a problem with multitasking. It turns out that multitasking is not very effective. It actually makes us less efficient. Multitasking can increase the production of stress hormones and make it harder to focus. It also makes it harder to learn new information. If you do your homework and watch TV at the same time, the information from your schoolwork will go to the wrong part of your brain. It’s also difficult to make decisions when you are multitasking. All of these problems are related to the amount of information we have to deal with these days.<eos>"

In a zoo in Sweden, a chimpanzee named Santino spent his nights breaking up concrete into pieces to throw at visitors during the day. Was he being spiteful? In caves in the US, female bats help unrelated fruit bat mothers if they can’t find the right birthing position. Are they being caring? Fifty years ago, people thought that animals had behaviours that produced measurable outcomes, and science recorded those outcomes. The idea that animals have consciousness, feelings and moral systems was not well-supported. But recently that has partially changed. Thanks to research into the behaviour of bats, chimps, not to mention rats, dolphins and chickens, emotions of animals have gone from being a taboo area of investigation to being tentatively explored. The new research has started a debate about whether animals can be said to have consciousness. If animals do have consciousness, what does it mean for the production and consumption of beef? The observations may not be disputed, but the interpretation of them is. There are different views on what the new research means for our relationship with animals. Some people believe that we should stop eating meat, while others believe that we should at the very least re-evaluate our view of animal cognition. The debate is ongoing and there is no clear answer.<eos>"

Critical thinking is a way of interacting with what we read or listen to in order to have a deeper understanding. It involves analyzing, evaluating, and judging information based on its relevance, accuracy, and credibility. Although technology can complement and enhance human thinking, it can also make it more difficult to think critically. One of the main concerns is the decline in reading and literary engagement. Many experts believe that a greater focus on visual media comes at a price, including a decline in critical thinking skills. However, there are also some positive aspects to technology, such as its ability to improve information processing and provide access to a vast amount of information. Ultimately, the impact of technology on critical thinking depends on how we use it. It is important to be aware of the potential benefits and drawbacks of technology so that we can make informed decisions about how to use it in a way that enhances our critical thinking abilities.<eos>"

When Matthew Crawford is not writing or thinking about how we ought to live, he works as a motorcycle mechanic. He wrote two books about the benefits of manual trades and philosophy. He was inspired to write his latest book when he noticed that advertisements popped up on the credit card machine while he was shopping. Crawford says that these demands on our attention are becoming increasingly difficult to avoid.

There are a lot of things that are distracting us from our ability to think clearly. We are constantly being interrupted by notifications and advertisements. This is making it difficult to focus on one thing at a time. Crawford argues that we need to find a way to use our judgment and attention more effectively. He suggests that we should engage with the world in a more satisfying way, such as by cooking, playing hockey, or racing motorbikes.

Crawford's proposed solution has two parts. First, we need regulation of noise and distraction in public space. More importantly, though, Crawford advocates skilled practices as a way of engaging with the world in a more satisfying way.<eos>"

What do you do for a living? It's a common question that we often answer in a few words. However, if you're a philosopher, it's slightly harder to deal with. One reason is that describing yourself as a philosopher sounds rather pretentious. Another reason is that philosophy has become increasingly removed from lived experiences.

Philosophy can help people look a little more closely at the practices and behaviours that define their lives. Sometimes this might reveal something we already know; at other times we might discover that our beliefs are hard to justify. Either way, merely by examining these ideas, we’ll be doing something for the benefit of everyone.<eos>"

Foodies, gourmands, chefs and others who love food might expect that reflecting on what and how we eat can contribute to culinary pleasure. However, philosophical discussions of food have often been about other topics, such as the acquisition of knowledge or the pursuit of pleasure. Food is inherently social and cultural. It derives from historical contexts and is shared with those in our communities. It also brings people together and plays a role in bridging cultural gaps.

Once food has been prepared, people will start talking and writing about it. There are undoubtedly many ethical issues that attach to food. We can ask what we should eat and why the answers are what they are. Cooking in restaurants and in the home differ. Home cooks have a special duty to their guests, while those who cook for a living have obligations to their employer and to the food itself.

Rob Daviau is a US designer who creates 'legacy' board games. He felt that traditional board games were no longer entertaining or challenging enough, so he started to wonder how board games might evolve. He adapted a classic board game called Risk and created a new version called Risk Legacy. Unlike previous board games, decisions made during gameplay had a permanent impact. Players might have to rip up cards, deface the board, or open packets containing new rules. The games play out over the course of a fixed number of sessions and long-held grudges become woven into the fabric of the game.

Legacy board games were never expected to go mainstream, but most players love the concept. They see it as one of the biggest advances in game design for several years. The legacy format draws on video games and the demand for episodic entertainment fuelled by popular TV series.<eos>"

Once upon a time, there was an octopus named Inky who lived in a tank at the New Zealand National Aquarium. One night, Inky managed to escape from his tank and swim across the floor to a drain that led to the Pacific Ocean. It was a story that was shared online and was popular among children.

One of the reasons why people find stories about animals being like humans so enjoyable is called anthropomorphism. Anthropomorphism is when we think of animals in the same way that we think of ourselves. In the case of octopuses, this pleasure is especially pronounced because of their intelligence and their physical differences from humans.

There are many examples of animals exhibiting human-like behaviors. For example, octopuses can open jars, recognize faces, use coconut shells as portable armor, and exhibit sophisticated play behavior. Animals are far smarter than we have been giving them credit for.

However, there are some challenges associated with anthropomorphism. One challenge is that it can lead to anthropodenial, which is the opposite of anthropomorphism. Anthropodenial is when we fail to recognize the human-like traits of animals. This has often characterized our attitudes toward other species.

Another challenge is that anthropomorphism can lead to inaccurate assumptions about animals. For example, we might assume that because octopuses are intelligent, they are also capable of learning language like humans. This is not necessarily true.

Despite these challenges, anthropomorphism can be a valuable tool for learning about animals. It can help us to appreciate their intelligence and their ability to adapt to their environment. It can also help us to develop empathy for animals.<eos>"

Once upon a time, there was a technology called robotics that has the potential to change the world. Robots have already been used in the automotive and manufacturing industries for many years. Experts predict that in the next few years, robots will be used in many other industries.

One of the main concerns about robotics is that it will lead to job loss. However, some experts believe that robots will create new jobs. They say that the new jobs will require higher skills than the jobs that are being replaced.

Another concern about robotics is that it will lead to a decline in interpersonal skills. Some experts believe that society is not prepared for the upheaval that the downgrading of the human touch will bring.

Despite the challenges, robotics has the potential to improve our lives in many ways. It can help us to be more efficient, productive, and safe. It can also help us to live longer and healthier lives.

In order to prepare for the robotic workforce of tomorrow, we need to invest in education and training programs. We also need to develop new regulatory frameworks to ensure our safety and privacy.<eos>"

There are many reasons why people climb, including the feeling of freedom it produces, the sense of accomplishment, and the opportunity to develop important virtues such as courage, humility and respect for the environment. Climbing also has a practical value, such as helping to develop the traits and virtues that allow one to flourish and live well in our non-climbing world.<eos>"

My Granddad’s garden was a special place. It was situated on the bank of a river and sloped gently down towards the water. You couldn’t reach the river but you could hear the sound of the water and the birds that sang in the trees above. I imagined that all gardens were like this – a place of escape, peace and solitude.

Granddad’s plot was nothing out of the ordinary. He had nothing as grand as a greenhouse, unlike some of his neighbours. But he did have a lot of other things that made his garden special. There was a river, a pond, and a lot of flowers.

My father was a quiet and withdrawn person. He didn’t have a lot of ambition. He worked as a plumber. But he was good at his job. He was able to fix anything that was broken.

I always wanted to like the piano but it did its best to intimidate me. The only thing I did like about it were the two brass candlesticks that jutted out from the front.

I was allowed to go to the river a lot. I would walk along the river bank and look for fish. I would also take my fishing net and set off into the water.

One day my father announced that there was a vacancy for an apprentice gardener in the Parks Department. I thought I might be interested. I stuck at it and I eventually became a gardener.<eos>"

When John Maloof bought a box of old photo negatives at an estate auction, he discovered the mystery of Vivian Maier. Maloof was looking for images to use in a book about the history of the Portage Park neighbourhood in Chicago. Instead, he found 30,000 images by Maier, a street photographer with a keen eye for capturing compelling images. Since then, Maloof has amassed an archive of Maier’s life and work. He has a large collection of her cameras, film, prints, negatives, movies and audiotapes.

Maier was born in 1926 and spent much of her childhood in France. She returned to New York in 1951 and came to Chicago in 1956 to work as a nanny. Maier was a private person who kept herself to herself and was a bit of a character. She always had a camera with her and dressed in oversized coats, broad-brimmed hats and stout shoes.

Maier’s work is the purest form of art. None of it was done for any commercial reason. Her images lean toward women, children, the old, the poor, the abstract. Maloof often wonders if he’ll ever work his way through all the negatives. The funny thing is he had no real interest in photography until he discovered Maier’s work. Inspired by her architectural shots, Maloof actually went out on the street and began to take his own pictures.<eos>"

Jonny’s bass guitar turned out well, but he didn’t think of it as a career. He was also into painting and sculpture. He chose to study architecture at university but dropped out because he was too individualistic. He then realized that guitar-building is actually a type of sculpture and decided to make guitars for a living.

Any discussion of English conversation often begins with the weather. It is a traditional practice to quote the famous comment of Dr. Johnson that, ""When two Englishmen meet, their first talk is of the weather."" Most commentators either stop or try to explain why the English have a fascination with the weather. They fail because they start with the mistaken premise that our conversations about the weather are actually about the weather. In other words, they assume that English people talk about the weather because they have a keen interest in the subject. Most commentators try to figure out what it is about the English weather that is so fascinating. However, the truth is that our conversations about the weather are not really about the weather at all. They are a form of 'grooming talk' used to help English people overcome their natural reserve and actually talk to each other.<eos>"

The silence on Centre Court at the Wimbledon tennis championships is very calming. You can bounce the ball, serve, and hit it, and hear the echo of your own shot. The trimmed grass, the rich history, the ancient stadium, the players dressed in white, and the respectful crowds all combine to make you feel like you are in a world of your own. The quiet of the Centre Court is good for your game. It helps you to focus on the point you are playing and to shut everything else out.

The silence is broken by a sudden noise when a point is done: applause, cheers, and people shouting your name. You hear them, but as if from a long way away. You don’t register that there are thousands of people watching you. You are so focused you have no sense at all that there are millions watching you as you play Roger Federer in the 2008 Wimbledon final.

The dream of playing at Wimbledon had always been a dream of yours. You had always dreamed of playing there one day and winning. You had played and lost, both times against Federer, in the final there the year before, and the year before that. The defeat in 2006 had not been so hard. You went out onto the court that time just pleased and grateful that, having just turned twenty, you’d made it that far. But your defeat in 2007 left you utterly destroyed.

To be successful, you have to bring the script to life and have a passion for human sound. You also need to invest in a strong showreel and be persistent. Shirley has learned to create the right sounds from the back of her throat and to avoid always sounding like the same child. She collects new voices as she watches children’s TV. The competition for work is fierce, but a good showreel is essential. For anyone considering a career doing voiceovers, Shirley recommends attending workshops and having a passion for human sound.<eos>"

People often ask me how I became a cartoonist. Cartooning is a dream job that many people have. But most people eventually give up on their dreams and consider more realistic professions. The idea that you can support yourself financially by sketching the sort of doodles commonly found in high school notebooks is silly. Yet, some people do exactly that. To become a cartoonist, you don’t need a university degree or much money. You just need your brain, your hand and something that makes a mark. It’s a tough job, but if you feel that doing anything else would be impossible, it might be the right career for you.<eos>"

Twenty years ago, I was moving house and having a clear-out. I decided to throw away an electric guitar that my dad had bought me for my 16th birthday. I felt a constant, aching sorrow for what I’d done. Then a few months ago, I received an email that changed my life. Keith Rushton, a dealer and restorer of guitars, found my name and address on the back of the guitar and contacted me. He offered to sell me the guitar back for a fair price. I couldn’t have drawn a diagram for any of the chords I wanted to play, but my hands just went into it. The electric guitar is not really a solo instrument. Now that I’m learning it again, I guess I’ll have to form a band.<eos>"

There has been a lot of talk about sleep lately. Sleep is very important for our mental, physical, and social well-being. It seems that people who have the hardest time sleeping are the ones who most appreciate how important sleep is. Dreams are important too. They help us find new patterns and create combinations that break through our usual habits of thinking.

When you wake up in the morning, the sleep you sacrifice is mainly REM or 'Rapid Eye Movement', the most dream-rich stage of sleep. Dreams are where we bring things together in fresh, often surprising ways. They draw on stores of knowledge from the past and present to find new associations.

When people are awakened out of REM and asked to say what comes to their minds in response to a certain word, their responses are more original than when awoken from other stages of sleep. This is what creativity is. We live in a complex world. All of us need our brains to be functioning fully. We need to think creatively and flexibly as we negotiate relationships with colleagues, co-workers, family, friends. This is why we need to dream.<eos>"

It was twenty years ago that Susie Ray left London for a small coastal town in south-west England. She is a copyist artist who can reproduce the richness of an early-20th-century impressionist masterpiece as easily as the brilliance of a 16th-century Caravaggio portrait.

Susie has been in great demand since her 30 years as a copyist artist. She has painted the works of numerous great artists, including Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh. Her reproductions are so faithful that art experts mistake them for the originals.

While the originals would fetch millions of pounds in auctions, her reproductions fetch anything between a few hundred pounds and £12,000. Susie has always been open about what she does. When she reproduces an old masterpiece, she will make it look as authentic as possible. However, she will put her own signature on the back of the canvas.<eos>"

Jordan Romero is 13 and wants to be the youngest person ever to climb Mount Everest. If he succeeds, he could become one of the most famous teenagers of his generation. Young people are spending more time on computers and games consoles, so Jordan hopes to inspire kids to climb their own mountains. He has already climbed five of the Seven Summits and might actually do it before his teenage years are over.

There are concerns about taking a young climber up Everest. Many people think that a young climber might not be emotionally strong enough or have enough experience. However, Jordan's parents believe that their own experience as climbers will help them guide their son safely.

Jordan's motivation is also a question. Some people might wonder if this is just an ambitious father taking his own love of adventure to a dangerous extreme. But Jordan says, ""I just focus on achieving my goal.""

This story is about Jordan's dream to climb Mount Everest. It also talks about the challenges and risks involved in such a project.<eos>"

When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, it's probably not classical music they're listening to. Most people our age can list the names of dozens of pop groups, but few of us know who Brahms was. I have just started doing a music degree, but the people on my course know no more about classical music than anyone else our age. If you don’t know who wrote the music, you are unlikely to own any recordings of their work. The statistics are depressing for a lover of classical music. Apparently only a small percentage of concert tickets sold last year were for classical music events, and the average classical recording sells a mere few hundred copies. I still find that hard to believe. So, what has caused this decline in interest for a type of music that has lasted for centuries? The simple truth is that classical music just doesn’t hold much attraction for most people, and that is particularly true of teenagers. There are a few reasons why teenagers don’t like classical music. First, the pace and rhythm of classical music are problematic for us. Second, the subject matter of pop music is more appealing than a lengthy piece of classical music with no lyrics. Third, the way we listen to music has changed. Nowadays, you can find any music you want at the click of a mouse, and yet the sound track to our lives is rarely classical.<eos>"

Mum caught Jess by the arm and asked her to come with her to the study. There was a painting on the table, which was one of Grandpa’s. It was unlike anything he had done before and clearly nowhere near finished. Mum spoke again and said the painting had a name. There was something in her voice that betrayed her enthusiasm. Jess read the words Grandpa had scrawled on the painting. It was called 'River Boy.' The picture was strange and amorphous – and beautiful in an eerie way. There were no animals, no birds, no people; and it felt right that way. The riverbank was almost insignificant, such a subtle hint of green that the eye barely took it in. And there was a further mystery. Jess looked round at Mum. ‘There is no boy.’ ‘Exactly. Strange, isn’t it – I mean, for him to be so specific. Still, he hasn’t finished it yet, so maybe he’s going to put the boy in later.<eos>"

When I woke up this morning, I didn't mean to cut a hole in my bedroom carpet. It could have happened, but it didn't. I was trying to fit my corner cabinet into a corner. Gran had given me the cabinet when she moved out of her house into a flat. It's really cute and I keep my collection of shells and fossils there.

The problem was, the cabinet was too tall for the corner. If I could only slice a couple of centimetres off the bottom of it... That was when it came to me. I had an idea. If I couldn't slice anything off Gran's cabinet, how about cutting a hole in the carpet? It just seemed like the obvious solution. What Dad calls lateral thinking. I reckoned he would be quite pleased with me. He is always telling us to 'think outside the box'. And that was exactly what I was doing.<eos>"

The novel 'The Borrowers' is about a family of tiny people who live hidden in the walls and floors of a house. They secretly borrow things from the normal-sized people in order to survive. When I was asked to direct a TV adaptation of the novel, I knew it was going to be hard to live up to people’s expectations. The author had told me she wanted the series to be from the Borrowers' perspective, not a human one, which made filming much more complex. The most crucial thing was getting the scale right. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans, so I had to be 10 times further away from the actors than on a normal shoot. We also had to film from a low angle, close to the ground, in order to get the Borrowers' perspective. One big challenge was finding a way to get the shadows right. We developed a unique technique for this. The costumes were also a big challenge. I had them made out of heavy canvas material so that they stuck out in the way that dolls’ clothes do. Unfortunately, the weather was really hot during filming. Most of the action that takes place away from the Borrowers’ home had to be shot with the actors separated from their surroundings. We filmed them in front of a blue screen on an otherwise empty set. It was a challenge for them to react to things that weren’t physically there.<eos>"

The average American teenage girl is expected to excel in school, have a part-time job, volunteer, and maintain a social life. Teenage boys and girls have a lot of responsibilities today, including homework, tests, extracurricular activities, jobs, chores, and family obligations. With the introduction of smart phones, tablets, and social media, students can now take their work on the go and do their homework wherever they happen to be. However, this convenience comes with a cost. Teens today have to be available 24/7, which often leads to sleep deprivation. Many teenagers start their days around 6 a.m. or 7 a.m. and often end after midnight. This schedule is crammed with school, after-school activities, family obligations, and homework. And then, he or she must get up and do it all again the next day, with fewer than the recommended nine hours of sleep a night.<eos>"

The teenage members of the Earth to Sky Calculus Club live in Bishop, a mountain town in the US, surrounded by wilderness. They have launched over fifty balloons to the edge of space. It's a long-running science project that includes astronomy experiments and backcountry adventures. I joined them one weekend in late spring. They were releasing a high-altitude balloon, hoping to record shooting stars.

As it got dark, the teenagers secured a soft insulated lunch box to the bottom of the balloon. Inside was a camera, an instrument to measure altitude, and a thermometer. Two GPS trackers were mounted on the outside of the lunch box to help the group find it later. They used a gas tank to inflate the balloon and watched it ascend.

After the launch, most of the students went home, but a few stayed to watch the shooting stars. They lay on blankets on the mountainside and gazed at a sky so clear, it was hard to believe you're just four hours from Los Angeles.

The recovery team spent 11 hours finding the lunch box. It was in a canyon, high on a flat rock, in the middle of a cascading waterfall. The camera hadn't recorded any shooting stars. Sure, it's a bit of a disappointment, but it's also a perfect opportunity to argue over the effects of atmospheric waves, and how they might work above mountain ridges.<eos>"

When you're travelling by car with your family, even when you're young, the chances are you know that you're not 'there yet.' Once you get there, it's not 'there' anymore, it's 'here.' If you really think there's a chance that you're 'there yet,' you should be asking 'Are we there yet? ' And I'm pretty sure there's no one who wishes they were 'there yet' more than the mums and dads fielding that question over and over every single long car trip.

The car ride can be fun and enjoyable. You can watch DVDs, listen to music, or read a book. You can also act as co-pilot and help your parents adjust the radio station and temperature. If there's a problem, your parents will be there to help you.

But sometimes, things can go wrong. Your sibling might put their foot on your side of the seat or hurl their body over into your space. If this happens, you might get angry and upset. But your parents will be there to help you calm down and make sure that everything is okay.

Over the years, your parents have developed strategies for dealing with you on the back seat. They know that you're going to ask 'Are we there yet?' a lot, so they've come up with a response that usually keeps everyone quiet. If you see your parents tumble out of the car and go as far away as they can from the kids, then you know that you're finally 'there.'<eos>"

John and Zuzi Morgan have opened a café in Oxford, UK, where people can enjoy coffee, cake, and board games. They hope that people will enjoy the experience so much they will want to repeat it. The games that are played in their café are known as Eurogames. They are popular because they are relatively gentle and easy to learn.

The first Eurogame was created by a German designer named Klaus Teuber. It is called The Settlers of Catan. Players build settlements on an island and trade resources with each other. The game is very engaging and keeps all players involved.

Another popular Eurogame is called Pandemic. It was created by a North American designer named Matt Leacock. Pandemic is a cooperative game where players work together to solve global problems. The game is challenging but also fun and rewarding.

The growth of the video games industry has also helped to the popularity of Eurogames. Video games have made it more acceptable to play games in public. As a result, more people are open to trying Eurogames.

In conclusion, tabletop gaming has become more than entertainment. It has become a way for people to share their love of games and connect with each other. This trend is set to continue in the future.<eos>"

Television presenter Helen Skelton has completed various dangerous challenges for charity, including a desert marathon run and a journey down the Amazon river in a tiny boat. For her latest challenge, Helen walked on a high wire, a long thin piece of metal, 66 meters above the ground. There was no safety net, only a belt around her waist attached to another wire above. To help her keep her balance and not to fall, she carried a long stick, weighing eight kilograms. Helen took lessons from an expert high-wire walker. Although she already had a few circus skills, she quickly discovered that high-wire walking was completely different. The training was a shock, said Helen. 'I didn’t realise how strong I’d need to be. Every day started at 8 am with a run up a steep hill; then came an hour of exercises, with another hour of them after my day practising on the wire. I also had to learn how to fall onto the wire so that if I slipped I could carry on. Every time I fell on the wire it hurt badly. But it was essential to keep a positive attitude: if I was nervous and started shaking, so would the wire!' The day of the actual challenge was windy and Helen controlled herself by taking deep breaths as she moved step by step along the wire. The 150-meter walk took 15 minutes. 'That was the scariest thing I’ve done,’ she admitted afterwards. 'I’m glad it’s over!'

I work at a university in the US where my team and I are studying water birds, particularly one called the American black duck. We have started using a new piece of equipment called a night-vision scope, which allows us to see the ducks in the dark. We are worried about black ducks mainly because their numbers have fallen hugely and we don’t know whether there’s enough food on the east coast for these animals. We have lots of information about their daytime activities, but nothing about what they do at night, because we simply haven’t had the equipment. But this new ‘scope’ will produce really clear pictures, even on moonless nights, so we’ll be able to find out more and make better decisions about looking after the area where they live based on what we learn. It is very hard work. There are four of us, each working six hours daily. We have studied ducks in different locations, and I have had to take a boat to some sites and make notes on every duck I see. The weather hasn’t helped – some nights are mild, but more often it’s wet. Oh, and it’s so quiet I’ve needed lots of coffee to stop me falling asleep! We’ve only missed one working day so far, because the snow was too deep even for our special snow vehicles.

Last year, I went on a trip to the west coast of Canada. It was my brother Harry’s idea. He’s a journalist, like me, and he wanted to write articles about the trip. I had dreamt of visiting the area ever since I saw it on TV as a child. So I asked Harry if I could go too – until he finally agreed. There were storms in the area we were going to, but luckily the weather was calm. We joined the group, packed our limited supplies into small boats and set off. We stopped for hours to explore the rock pools on the beaches along the coast. They were full of amazing coloured fish. And it was great to be able to stop caring about how quickly or slowly the day was passing. We never forgot lunch or dinner, though, which we all made together over camp fires. When I finally fell asleep on the boats each evening, it really felt like stress-free living. When the time came to leave, I was sad. But I knew if I stayed, I’d miss family and friends.

My dad was a professional basketball player in Germany, as his father had been before him. I went to watch many of his games when I was a kid. I loved telling my friends how good my dad was, but I used to take a book with me to read instead of watching. Starting secondary school, I was already tall and my sports teacher asked me if I’d be interested in training with the basketball team. I enjoyed the session, but I thought I’d need to develop my skills before I took part in a real match. It took me a while to agree, but a few weeks later, I found myself playing against a team from another school. My parents came to watch, but it made me more nervous. But it was OK in the end. I practised every day and did really well, even joining an adult team before I moved abroad to a special sports academy in the USA when I was fifteen. The coach there trains Olympic basketball players, and it was fantastic to work with him. However, I can’t say I enjoyed my first experience of living far from my parents. I got used to my new life in the end, though, and my English improved quickly too! I turned professional at the age of eighteen, three years after arriving in the USA. I’d been taller than most players in the professional league since I was fifteen, but had been much too light for my height, so had to get that right first.

Seven years ago, I was studying Tourism at college. I needed to find a part-time job because my course was expensive. I decided to become a weekend tour guide in my home city – Chicago. I took visitors around the city and I enjoyed giving those tours. I felt like a new experience every time I gave a tour. After finishing my studies, I decided to go into tour guiding full-time. To get a licence, I had to learn a lot more than I'd learned so far. All Chicago guides have to be able to answer hundreds of questions about the city. After several challenging months, I gained my tour guide qualification and registered as an independent tour guide. Tour guiding is a lot of work, but it is also a lot of fun. You need to be able to be entertaining and tell interesting stories, and above all, you need to be able to react to changing situations. I need to make sure visitors are happy with my tours, otherwise they could post a negative review online. Like most tour guides, I realise that these reviews are really important, as good reviews attract more customers. That’s why making tours fun and stress-free is essential.

My name is Ella and I'm 22. Last year I went to Thailand for two weeks with my sister Josie. We went to help as volunteers at an elephant sanctuary. We collected the elephants' food and washed the elephants in the river. The part of the day I most looked forward to was the evening. We led the elephants on foot into the forest area where they spent the night. The meals were delicious and included plenty of fruit and vegetables. After dinner, all the volunteers and staff spent the evenings talking and playing games. Now that we're back in the UK, Josie doesn’t often talk about Thailand. But if anyone asks her if she enjoyed her time at the sanctuary, she says she loved it.<eos>"

I’m Gina D’Costa and I run a flower shop in the UK. We sell flowers to people who buy them for friends, their homes, hotels, and offices. Sometimes we take part in photo sessions for businesses. Once I decorated a castle with flowers for a wedding. It took a lot of work but I was really proud of the job we’d done.

My day starts at 4 a.m. when I go to the market to buy fresh flowers. It’s usually cold and dark at that time, but I don’t let it worry me. The market has a lot of different flowers. I like to choose pink flowers, but I have to remember that what I like and what other people want aren’t necessarily the same thing. Sometimes I have to argue with the flower-sellers about prices. It’s not always possible to find all the flowers that customers want. But I try to get the best price possible. Back at the shop, I look at customer orders and set up vases with the flowers I’ve bought. Then I create bunches of flowers and work out how much orders will cost. Customers are often surprised by how expensive they are. Sometimes I have to ask them to think again about what they’d like. I like thinking about how I can put together the nicest possible flowers for the amount of money someone wants to spend. That’s what you have to do when you’re selling things. I wouldn’t want any other job.<eos>"

My city has a modern cinema that shows all the latest films I want to see, and lots of films for kids at the weekends. It’s close to where I live, but a year ago, I realised something was missing – the experience of discussing a film in detail with a group of people after watching it with them. So, together with two friends, I started a film club. We decided early on that we didn’t want to hire a cinema to show the films in. Instead, we choose a different location in the city each month. We’ve been to some free places and some places where the owners make money by selling snacks during the film. We’re happy to make enough to cover our costs – we’re not trying to make a profit. Each time we show a film, everything is a bit easier for us. We also know how many tickets we’ve sold because everything’s online. There’s still always plenty to do, but when people of all ages come up at the end to say what a great experience they’ve had, it’s wonderful. We’ve started a blog, too, because we know that most people now go online for information about films, rather than read reviews in local papers. We’ve also tried putting up a few posters in cafés. Nothing’s as successful as word of mouth, though – people recommending us to their friends. And the audience love the special activities we put on with each film – last month it was a movie quiz, which everybody enjoyed.<eos>"

Taking photographs was always my favourite activity as a child. When I was 15, I felt that if I wanted to take my hobby to the next level, I had to do something special. So I decided to start a personal project: I would take one photograph every day for a whole year of my life. I was amazed to discover that there were others who liked the way I saw and photographed things. I was also enjoying photographing a wide range of subjects. Then someone suggested that if my photographs all had a common topic or idea to connect them, my project would be even better – and I agreed. So I began to concentrate more on taking photos of nature scenes, especially of birds and the sky. A lot of them were black and white photographs, which was very different to what many other young photographers were doing – they were all taking colour photos. As a result I sometimes had doubts about my project, and I almost gave up several times. In the end, however, I trusted my own feelings, and became more confident about my photographic style and choices. One day I showed my project to my art teacher at school. She told me about a national photography competition for people my age. So I entered some of my photos, just for fun. I’ll never forget the moment when the judges told me that I had won first prize; I was so happy, as my project meant so much to me. It was the first time I realised that maybe my photography really was good, and that I might actually be able to work as a professional photographer. I now have my own photography studio and I’ve never regretted my career choice.<eos>"

I joined the National Youth Challenge (NYC) last year because I knew they went camping and sailing and taught skills like public speaking. The NYC offers different activities to challenge yourself and you’re always learning something. There are different levels, from beginner to advanced, run by adult volunteers called ‘leaders’. When you complete each level you get a certificate. I decided to take up the challenge and soon I was spending all my free time at the children’s club. I also made some great relationships with the children. Now I’m there for about four hours a week and I always really look forward to going. I’ve improved my own communication skills while at the same time helping others. I’ve got several other NYC certificates now and yes, one of them is for camping.<eos>"

I was born in Denver, USA, and started snowboarding when I was eight years old. My dad took me to a resort in the mountains, about two hours from Denver. The hill was very steep, so my dad had to do a lot of persuading to get me on a board. I was so young, I hadn’t even thought of asking him if I could start snowboarding, but he was already into it and wanted me to love it too. I managed just fine. After this experience, I started competing aged ten. I enjoy taking part in competitions and winning too. I have also improved my ability to compete in snowboarding. During the summer, I focus on training and my studies. I also get to spend lots of time with my friends. It’s the best way of dealing with not being able to do what I love so much and what I’m really good at. I have to think carefully about my future.

When I was fifteen, I wanted everything my friends had. I didn’t plan ahead, like I had no idea what I wanted to do when I left school. One day, my best friend got a new phone and I thought I should have one too. My parents said I could only have it if I paid for it myself, so I decided to work part-time and save as much as I could. I owe my parents a lot for making me do that – it taught me a really valuable lesson. I worked every Saturday in a café, but I didn’t really enjoy it. My parents suggested starting my own little business instead. I asked my mum if I could have a go at making necklaces, and she showed me it was possible to create something attractive at home using basic tools and materials. I sold my first items of jewellery to my friends and family. They told me they were delighted with them, but I still needed convincing that they looked good enough to be popular with the public. There was only one way to find out, so I rented a market stall with my mum. Soon we were receiving calls from all over the country from people looking to buy more. It’s been such a lot of fun so far.<eos>"

When Janine Stuart was young, she wrote a novel called Being Amelia which became a bestseller. Being Amelia is based on Janine’s life. In one interview, Janine said, ‘Because of my family’s moving around a lot, I’ve become good at making new friends. I understand what it’s like to be the only new student in a class, and that helped me to write about how the main character, Amelia, gets on in a new school.

Janine started her novel one summer, when she was feeling bored at home. Her mother had always dreamt of becoming a published author herself, and her teachers had always encouraged her to write, so it seemed like a natural way for Janine to pass the time. The year before, she’d entered a short story competition on a young writers’ website and won first prize. That’s why, when Janine finished Being Amelia and sent it to a publishing company, the people who worked there were immediately keen to read it. They loved it, and a year later, Janine’s novel was on sale in bookshops.

One review of Being Amelia mentions how, despite the book having pictures of happy teenagers on the cover, the people in the story actually face some difficult challenges. This is what really allows readers to believe in them. The reviewer says that although Janine is still very young, and Being Amelia isn’t a particularly long novel, she’s clearly shown that she’s a better writer than several other best-selling authors.<eos>"

My name is Tom. I am fifteen years old. Three years ago, my family and I moved into a castle on a small island. My dad was invited to be the castle’s manager. He works for an organisation that looks after historical buildings and keeps them open to the public. We were excited about the move at first, but it took a while before we agreed Dad should take the job. Once we moved, we quickly got used to island life. The castle isn’t particularly beautiful, but our apartment is comfortable. The island feels very sociable in the summer, and there are often parties on the beach. During the winter, we only see the other families who live on the island. The adults all support each other, and help with repairs on the island. The biggest change for me was travelling by boat every day, back to my old school. I was looking forward to going on stormy days, when there are huge waves, but the ferries don’t run then. And I’ve discovered that if I miss the bus to the harbour after school, I also miss the last ferry home, which is worrying. So when schoolmates come home to stay with me, I’m always telling them to hurry up! But we often get the most fantastic views, for example when the sun goes down over the sea. Some days, though, it’s so foggy that you can’t see a thing, then within hours it’s brilliant sunshine again – it still seems amazing when that happens, even after living here all this time. Of course, we do get awful storms, and I wonder sometimes if the castle’s strong enough to avoid getting damaged. But then I remind myself it’s been here for centuries – and it’s still standing!<eos>"

I live in a beautiful house in Scotland. I love nature and wild animals, and I started a new hobby called birdwatching six years ago. I went to the mountains in northern Scotland with my family, where we saw lots of birds.

It was amazing, and I joined a local young birdwatchers’ club. My goal is to see 200 different bird species, and I’ve almost achieved that. I’ve been to Egypt and South America, and I’m lucky to live in the countryside. I understand why many teenagers in cities might not think of becoming birdwatchers, but there are actually plenty of birds to see, especially in places which have lots of green areas.

I started playing football when I was 7. I would rush home from school to play with other boys and girls. I loved it, and I was good at it. But my family knew I often became keen on new hobbies and then dropped them, so they thought the same thing would happen with football. But it never did. I was already dreaming of playing football professionally when I was older. And the opportunity came sooner than I’d hoped. I played in local tournaments, and one of the referees noticed that I was a promising player, so he asked the manager of a professional women’s club to watch me play. After that, she asked me to join her club. I started regular training with a big club as a young 13-year-old. I improved enormously. But people still weren’t sure I’d ever be a star player, which made me feel a bit upset. But my coach encouraged me to just be myself, and believe in myself – he even let me play in one of the club’s championship matches, much earlier than I’d expected. I’ve never run so hard in my life – I didn’t want the other players to blame me for losing. Then by pure luck, I got the winning goal. And since then, I’ve scored lots more winning goals.

One of the most interesting developments in further and higher education in the UK has been the encouragement of novice students to become involved with research as early as possible. Research is not an exclusive activity for established scholars or scientists. It can also be seen as a natural and fundamental way to build knowledge and skills.

Research approaches and skills are useful not only in your studies but also in employment. They are ways of thinking about the world and going about your own work. As a student, you make a contribution to knowledge. You do not just digest and repeat it, you make it. Making knowledge is based on asking questions, rather than taking things for granted.

Most students have always been researchers of sorts. You will have been carrying out some elements of research for projects and answered questions at school or in the workplace since your first few days there. You will also have been developing research and enquiry approaches and skills when exploring where to go on holiday, how to grow seeds successfully, how to fix things around the house, how to train your dog, how to find the right kind of music system, and how to buy the right kind of items for your needs online.

Critical thinking is particularly important in research. We need to be able not just to repeat what we’ve read and take everything in as if it was proven fact, but to engage with it, think about it, test it out, identify whether what we’re being told is presented in such a way as to trick us into agreement, or whether it is logical, reasoned and backed by evidence.<eos>"

Cities have always been centers of intellectual life. They provide a place for people to gather and discuss ideas. However, city life can also be challenging. It can be exhausting and overwhelming. Scientists have found that cities actually dull our thinking, sometimes dramatically so. One of the main reasons for this is the lack of nature in cities. Studies have shown that people who are exposed to nature recover more quickly from illness. Natural settings also help to improve brain performance.

In recent years, it has become clear that city life has a number of negative effects on our mental and physical health. These effects include fatigue, stress, and anxiety. They also include problems with attention and memory. However, there is some good news. Scientists have found that spending time in nature can help to reduce these effects.

So, if you are feeling overwhelmed by city life, there are a few things you can do to improve your mood and cognitive function. Take a walk in the park, spend time in nature, or simply relax and enjoy the fresh air.<eos>"

The mind is a complex and enigmatic phenomenon. It is often thought to reside within the confines of the brain. However, there is evidence to suggest that the mind extends beyond the skull. Stone objects, body ornaments, engravings, clay tokens, and writing systems have played an active role in human evolution and the making of the human mind. They are cognitive extensions that become part of the human body.

The mind-brain connection is undeniable. However, much of our thinking takes place outside our heads. This is evident in the way we interact with material culture. For example, when we make numbers and symbols out of clay, or use a stone to strike another stone, we are engaging with material culture in a way that enhances our cognitive abilities.

My approach to understanding the mind, called Material Engagement Theory (MET), explores the different ways in which things become cognitive extensions or are incorporated by the human body. It also investigates how those ways might have changed since earliest prehistory. MET offers a new way of understanding how different forms of material culture may have provided a powerful mechanism of defining, but also transforming, what we are and how we think.<eos>"

Photography has significantly changed the course of civilization and the way we perceive the world. It has been especially impactful in the United States, where photography quickly became part of American culture. Historians believe that photography is arguably the country’s greatest single contribution to the visual arts. It has moved to the centre of US intellectual and aesthetic discourse.

There are several reasons why photography was so appealing to the Americans. Firstly, it was a mechanical process that matched the growing enthusiasm for technology. Secondly, the camera was the perfect tool for representing oneself and creating a public image in a country where individuality was valued. Thirdly, photography was a way of creating and sustaining an impression of self and family. Finally, the photograph’s inherent realism was aesthetically pleasing.

Photography has also been used by artists in a variety of ways. For example, Andy Warhol used photographs in his paintings, silk screens, and multiples. Artists have incorporated photographs into their work to express themselves creatively and to represent their ideas.<eos>"

In 1890, William James defined psychology as the 'science of mental life.' This definition is still a good starting point for understanding psychology today. We all have a mental life, so we have some idea about what this means. However, even though the concept can be studied in rats and monkeys as well as humans, it remains a somewhat elusive one.

Psychology is about the mind or brain, but psychologists do not understand nearly enough about its workings to be able to comprehend the part that it plays in the experience and expression of our hopes, fears, and wishes, or in our behaviour during experiences as varied as giving birth or watching a football match.

The endeavour of psychology is much like that involved in solving a crossword puzzle. It involves evaluating and interpreting available clues. Complex interactions are the norm rather than the exception in psychology, and understanding them depends on the development of sophisticated techniques and theories.

Psychology has the same goals as any other science: to describe, understand, predict, and learn how to control or modify the process that it studies. Once these goals have been achieved, it can help us to understand the nature of our experience and come to conclusions that can be applied directly to people’s lives.<eos>"

The exhibits are products that were withdrawn from sale because nobody wanted to buy them. The museum's proprietor, Carol Sherry, sees every product as embodying its own sad story. The museum is a viable, profit-making business. It was started by ex-marketing man Robert McMath, who intended to accumulate a reference library of consumer products. However, his collection ended up consisting mostly of unsuccessful products. The museum is a testament to the fact that most products fail.

Everyone knows that sports teams have an advantage when they play at home. But does anyone know why? Most of us probably think we do; after all, it seems obvious. But professional sport is changing faster than at any time in its history and much of what we used to take for granted is now open to question.

There are two main reasons why home advantage exists. First, the home team has the benefit of playing in front of their own crowd, which can give them a boost of energy and confidence. Second, the home team has the advantage of being able to make adjustments to the game plan based on the crowd's reaction.

However, there are some changes that have recently occurred that have made home advantage less effective. For example, travel has become more convenient and the top grounds increasingly resemble one another in their soulless efficiency. As a result, the impact of playing at home has declined in all major sports.

Despite these changes, there is still some evidence to suggest that home advantage still exists. For example, researchers found that the players’ testosterone levels were higher before home matches than they were before away matches. This sense of territoriality may be connected to some primitive urge to defend home turf against interlopers.<eos>"

The more I practice, the luckier I get, said Gary Player some half-century ago. This quote is famous and is valued by athletes and their coaches. However, the meaning of the quote is not clear. Player didn’t literally mean lucky, he was actually speaking ironically. His real message was: ‘The more I practice, the better I get.’ Up to a point. Where that point is, indeed, whether it exists at all, is at the heart of the nature-nurture debate. The debate has been uneven, with nurture winning out. The theory that expertise in any field can be attained with 10,000 hours’ practice is popular. But it is not always true. There are other factors that can influence success, such as genes, environment, and opportunity. Epstein argues that science is better at looking at an elite athlete and retrospectively suggesting why that individual is succeeding than at figuring out why some people have certain abilities. He also distinguishes between hardware (the product of nature) and software (nurture).<eos>"

A recent report found that a large number of children living in wealthy countries feel lonely and dissatisfied. The reason for this is that these children have been spending too much time indoors, watching TV or playing on computers, and have lost contact with the natural world. This has led to a decline in their overall well-being. A follow-up study found that a large number of children would be happier if they could simply go outside more. Many adults talk nostalgically about the freedom of their own youth, but they rarely stop to reflect that they are the ones who have imposed that protective regime on their own children. There are some good arguments in the book about the relationship between the fear of danger and child-focused consumerism. However, the author's tone is sometimes too extreme and she does not provide enough evidence to support her claims.<eos>"

I'm a research bio-psychologist with a PhD. I've done lots of school. I'm a pretty good problem-solver, but that has little to do with the schooling I’ve had. Most problems in life cannot be solved with some complex formula or memorised answers. They require the judgement, wisdom and creative ability that come from life experiences.

Play is the natural means by which adults and mammals have always educated themselves. The most important skills children everywhere must learn in order to live happy, productive, moral lives are skills that cannot be taught in school. Such skills cannot be taught at all. They are learnt and practised by children in play.

School has become more onerous: breaks have been reduced, homework piled up, and pressure for high grades increased. Outside school, adult-directed sports have replaced impromptu games. These changes have been gradual, imperceptible, but over time they have been enormous.

If we care about our children and future generations, we must reverse the horrid trend that has been occurring over the past half century. We must give childhood back to children. Children must be allowed to follow their inborn drives to play and explore, so that they can grow into intellectually, socially, emotionally and physically strong adults fit for an unpredictable future.<eos>"

In many countries, there are a lot of young people in their twenties who are using social media to find work. There are two popular social networking sites that are often used for job hunting: Twitter and LinkedIn. These sites offer the chance for direct contact with potential employers. However, with greater access comes a greater chance to make mistakes. For example, a young jobseeker in the US contacted a senior marketing executive via LinkedIn. The marketing executive was not impressed by the young jobseeker's message and sent a rude rejection note. This incident has raised awareness about the dangers of using social media for job hunting. If it makes young people think more carefully about how they use social media in a professional capacity, she may have actually ended up doing them a favour.

There are a few things you should keep in mind when using social media for job hunting. Firstly, explain clearly who you are and what you have to offer. Secondly, keep the tone humble and avoid sending impersonal, blanket emails. Thirdly, be mindful of the potential dangers of using social media for job hunting and avoid making the same mistakes as the young jobseeker in the US.<eos>"

They have a long history, and they have played an important role in society.

If humans were truly at home under the light of the moon and stars, we would go in darkness happily. Instead, we are diurnal creatures, with eyes adapted to living in the sun’s light. We’ve lit up the night as if it were an unoccupied country, when nothing could be further from the truth. Light is a powerful biological force, and on many species it acts as a magnet attracting them to it. Denying darkness is futile. It is as essential to maintaining our biological welfare as light itself.

The regular oscillation of waking and sleep in our lives is nothing less than a biological expression of the regular oscillation of light on Earth. So fundamental are these rhythms to our being that messing with them is akin to altering our center of gravity. Living in a glare of our own making, we have cut ourselves off from our evolutionary and cultural heritage – the light of the stars and the rhythms of day and night.<eos>"

The founder of a large company recently announced that his company would no longer track employees’ paid holiday time. The move was inspired by an internet company that has implemented a similar policy. The founder stated that employees can take as much leave as they want, as long as they feel comfortable that their absence will not damage the business. However, there are concerns about the practicality of this policy. The company has a large number of employees and provides a wide range of services. It is difficult to assess whether an employee’s absence would harm the business. Additionally, there is pressure from colleagues and office gossip concerning who was off when, and for how long. The policy could also lead to a decrease in productivity due to increased guilt and self-discipline. Overall, the author remains doubtful as to whether being able to take as much holiday as you want is the true intention or the probable outcome of this policy.<eos>"

Journal-based peer review is a process that ensures the quality of scientific research papers. It is often seen as a way to prevent the publication of flawed or nonsensical papers. However, the process can also be time-consuming, sometimes delaying the publication of a paper by up to a year. Preprints, which are drafts of papers that are posted online without having been peer reviewed, are a growing trend that is changing the way scientists publish their work. Preprints bring academics back to the core of research publication, which is the rapid dissemination of new results. They also make it easier for scientists to critique and build upon each other's work. However, there are some challenges associated with preprints, such as the lack of peer review and the potential for the publication of flawed or nonsensical papers. Despite these challenges, preprints have the potential to improve the scientific publishing process and make it more accessible to a wider audience.<eos>"

When I ask my students what a poem is, they usually give me answers like 'a painting in words.' Their answers rarely satisfy me, or them. One day I asked a group to choose an object and write one paragraph describing it empirically, as a scientist might, and another in the first person, from the point of view of the item itself. The exercise led to much amusement and useful discussion.

A poem is a thing made. Poets sometimes compare poems to wild animals or machines. But such comparisons fall apart upon closer analysis. The most productive thing about trying to define a poem through comparison lies not in the comparison itself but in the debate. A poem is a product of writing and rewriting just like an article, story, or novel, yet it never really becomes what they usually are – a thing created in order to become a commodity.

A poem is a powerful thing. It can hit home like nothing else can, even though, in terms of ink on paper, it does nothing more than the prose around it. Because of its special status – set apart in a magazine or book – a poem still has the ability to surprise, if only for a moment.<eos>"

I bought a metal detector soon after I was married. It was a lot of money then, but I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first outing. Over the years, I've found many interesting things, including a fragment of a metal wheel and a fat, intricately patterned loop. The loop is a famous object from Iron Age Britain called the Great Torc. It's a beautiful necklace of gold and silver. I carried it to the car and showed it to my wife. We didn't try it on because the risk of damaging it was too great. I hid it in our wardrobe and felt anxious. Finally, I carried it into the council office and gave it to the local council. The proceeds were split between the owner of the field and myself. The torc has been far more than just a lucky windfall. It's something I've saved for the nation.<eos>"

Sleeping is one of my favorite travel pleasures. I don't talk about it very much because I feel a little guilty. When friends share details of their carefully planned trips, I smile encouragingly and don't say much. What would they think if they knew that my own travel itineraries include naps and lazy mornings. Better sleep is one of travel's happy side effects. When I visited Mexico's Yucatán coast in my early 20s, I was surprised by how many hours I spent sleeping. There were lots of noisy birds in the neighboring lot, but it didn't matter. Surrounded by strange smells and sounds, I could plunge into a sleep that was more profound, dream-filled, and enjoyable than I imagined possible. Sleep is something else too: it's an experience that changes rhythm, sometimes dramatically, from place to place. People obsess about jet lag, but I suspect that the difficulties I experience recovering from long journeys have more to do with local and cultural adjustment than time zones. When I finally fall into the local sleep pattern, I feel I have truly arrived.<eos>"

Lawrence Okoye is a young athlete who moved from London to Atlanta in the United States. He has a long journey from his Olympic final in the discus to the brink of another transformation. Despite never having played American football before, Lawrence appears likely to be picked for one of the major USA teams. He is still working out the exact responsibilities of his unfamiliar position.

Lawrence had originally travelled to Atlanta for warm-weather discus training. He had been intent on preparing himself for the world championships. He was offered a place at Oxford University to study law but decided to postpone taking it up to train seriously for the discus. Within 20 months of starting, Lawrence was ranked the world’s fourth-best discus-thrower.

There is caution, too. Lawrence himself is without even the most basic experience. How can such a raw recruit make it into an NFL team? 'From what coaches have told me, I’ve got all the attributes you need. It’s just about how hard I work,' he replies.

After his Olympic disappointment, there was speculation that Lawrence had allowed a momentous occasion to diminish him. However, Lawrence refuses to comment. A minimum salary for an NFL player is over $400,000 a year and so the economic incentives are plain. So, Lawrence has swapped rugby for athletics and now American football.<eos>"

I was flying east all night and woke up to see that it was already daylight. I looked out of the window and saw the empty landscape below. It was mid-September and it had not yet started showing in Siberia. I could see no sign of human life and the view was beautiful. I shook my head and smiled. My neighbour woke up and smiled at me. He said hello and asked me how I was. He was a salesman from Moscow and he was flying to the outer limits of civilisation. His English was not very good, but I managed to explain to him that I was flying to the far-eastern Siberian city of Magadan. He was concerned about me being alone. I explained that I would be riding with a friend called Al. He still looked unconvinced. I tried to convince him that I had a lot of warm clothes and that I was going to be fine. Most of my clothes and equipment had been brought at slashed prices. I was not sure if they would be up to the job, but I was hoping for the best. I wrote to my friend Al and asked him if he would like to join me on a bike ride across the Karakorum Highway. He agreed to come. We were going to meet in Siberia. I was working as a geography teacher at the time and I was still far from having full control of my classes, but I was happy with my job. It was frequently challenging, rarely boring, often fulfilling and, of course, there were great long holidays in which to chase adventures. I had been working as a geography teacher for a while and I had used my holidays to go to meet Al. He had decided to do something far more relaxing than teaching: to cycle around the world. I envied him in many ways. He was having an extraordinary adventure, finding that he could deal with each new challenge even if it seemed impossible. He was proving wrong the sceptics who had told him he could not do it. He was doing something that scared him nearly every day and it made him feel alive.<eos>"

In the Red Bull Air Race, twelve pilots race through a series of pylons between 15 and 25 meters high. They negotiate sharp turns, barrel rolls and loops at speeds of up to 370 km per hour. I was invited to find out what it feels like to take part. I had to sign two forms before the flight. The first confirmed that I was in good health, the second that I would empty all my pockets. I also learned that I would have to try to stay orientated throughout the flight. I was told to relax and enjoy the view. Half an hour before the flight, I had a safety briefing in which I was told not to touch anything. By the time we were taxiing down the runway, I was ready to fly. I ignored all instructions received and would not relax and enjoy the flight. This is the cruel paradox of high-speed acrobatic flying. In order to survive it without passing out, you have to keep calm and focused. You have to tense up at the right time and you have to relax at the right time. Panicking is a bad idea. The flight was over in 10 minutes. It had been 'soft' compared to what the pilots endure when they race.

Doug Allan is a wildlife cameraman who films wild animals in cold places. If you have ever been amazed by footage of polar bears in a nature documentary, it's probably been filmed by him. Allan trained as a marine biologist and commercial diver. Diving was his first passion, where he learned about survival in cold places. His big break came when a TV crew turned up in Antarctica, where Allan was working, to film a wildlife documentary.

Allan has a lot of experience filming in cold places. He says that the camera and communications technology was very basic when he started 35 years ago. Today, it is much easier to film. You can shoot a lot and look at it immediately. You used to have to think what shots you needed next, and what you had missed. You shot less. Film was very expensive. Today you can have too much material.

Allan says that wildlife filming is full of great successes, but also failures and embarrassments. He recently got permission to film sequences for a major TV series in Kong Karls Land, a group of islands in the Arctic Ocean. After walking five or more hours a day and watching polar bear dens in the snow slopes for 23 days, he had seen just one mother bear and her cub.

Now Allan would like to make his own film about climate change in the Arctic, talking to the people who live there and experience the impact of it first hand. He says he would be able to make an extraordinary documentary.<eos>"

Pen is a skilled explorer. He has a lot of physical endurance and is able to withstand extreme cold and harsh conditions. He is also a very determined person. He has a lot of experience in polar exploration and knows the risks involved.

Pen is going to be 47 on Thursday. He is concerned about his fitness level and the organizational aspects of the expedition. He believes his mission reconnects exploration with the search for knowledge that drove previous generations into the unknown.

Pen is excited about his upcoming expedition. He believes that his work is important and that it can benefit many people. He also believes that his skills are now more relevant than ever before.<eos>"

I had a break from competition. I was going to do some writing and TV work, and speak to businesses and schools. I also entered marathons and triathlons. There was a race I was thinking about doing, but I wasn’t ready to commit to the training regime. I spoke to some of my rowing colleagues about the race, but I didn’t get any enthusiastic responses. I knew that if I entered the race, I would want to win. I also had to take into account the loss of earnings that would result from being away from home. Participating in the race would mean I wouldn’t just be talking about past achievements. I’d actually be doing something again which I could bring in: rowing across the Atlantic. I learned a lot while planning this adventure, but one of the biggest lessons was to be thankful for the easy life of a full-time athlete.<eos>"

Last year, I went to the Arctic Circle in Finland to work with huskies. I was restless and dreamed of Arctic landscapes. I found a small company run by Anna and Pasi. They agreed to take me on as a husky dog handler for the winter season. From December to February, there is plenty of business taking tourists out on sled rides. The dogs are almost hysterical with excitement, straining against the ropes in their desperation to be off. I was initiated into the ranks of the husky guides, but everything else seemed to be very complicated. Simple tasks such as feeding and watering the dogs become very difficult in sub-zero conditions. But I am triumphant. I can chop with an axe, hammer a nail, and use a circular saw. 'In the snow.'

On that day, Radcliffe sprinted past the finish line. Her time would qualify her to compete in the men's marathon at the world championships in Paris. Journalists quizzed her on the benefits of emu oil, a product that Olympic gold medallist, Cathy Freeman, had recommended. Radcliffe insists that the achievement never really sank in. She felt that it was what she was going to do that day and so it just sort of flowed over her. During the race, her husband and coach, Gary Lough, was in a car with her support team, listening to the radio coverage. With 800m left to run, Radcliffe began to calculate. She finished the race in under 2 hours 16 minutes. Many women were inspired to take up long-distance running after Radcliffe's achievement.

When I first started my cookery programme, In Search of Perfection, I was unsure of how it would be received. There had been a lot of talk about the food 'revolution' happening in Britain, and I was certain that we had produced a series of programmes that made a genuinely innovative contribution to that. I watched the first programme and was relieved that it was successful. The subsequent success of the show paved the way for other fascinating projects, including a book based on my experiences at the restaurant I own. In each project, there is a sense of being on a journey, whether it's into the past, into the mind, or into cookery techniques. I wrote several books in a series called 'Perfection', each one accompanying its own TV programme of the same name. In these books, the journey was often physical, with passports and suitcases and itineraries. The latest book in the series, In Search of Total Perfection, takes you on a journey around the globe to meet extraordinary artisans. Despite the book's title, I knew from the outset that I wouldn't be claiming the recipes were in any way 'definitive'. But I reckoned that, by using my technical skill and scientific knowledge, I could pin down some of the things that made these dishes work.<eos>"

He stood for a long time peering at the engine with his hands in his pockets and a knowing look on his face. He said, ""Actually, I haven’t a clue what I’m doing."" Bea was worried, ""We can’t stay here forever."" The field stretched as far as I could see. There was nothing much in it, just grass and flowers. We sat on the side of the road and watched John grow smaller and smaller as he went off in search of someone who knew something about cars. Mum stretched out on the grass. She made us tea. We stayed at the café all day while John squinted dismally into the engine. At first Bea hadn’t wanted to move, so John had picked her up and put her in the truck himself. Now she sat in the front with the man who was driving. I kept wondering how we’d get home again now that our van had to be dragged everywhere.

Lucy had not wanted to come to the festival, but she had made it. Her dad bought her a white-gold necklace with an L pendant to congratulate her. Her little brother Gus got all caught up in imagining himself at the same festival one day.

Her teacher took her out for a special dinner to strategize a repertoire. The thing was, Lucy hadn’t even applied. Her mom had filled out the form and sent in the CD.

It's not good to spend too much time online. You need to get out into the real world, said Dad. He's difficult to argue with, so I decided to find out what people who have studied the subject say – and it’s quite interesting. Generally, research shows that most teenagers who use social media have a wide circle of real-life friends, a good sense of identity and belonging, and are developing the essential technical skills we need to be citizens of a digital age.

Social networking has become an integral part of modern childhood. Teenagers don’t consume media – dipping in and out to buy airline tickets or check e-mails as adults do – they inhabit it. It performs a similar function to hanging around at the youth club, as today’s parents used to do when they were younger.

Adolescence is a time when you are asking, who am I? Social networking can help you develop that self-identity. You can post notices about your favourite music or sports, discover what you enjoy, and you are constantly reminded that other people have different ways of looking at things.

Teenagers who use social networking as a creative force will reap the benefits when they become adults and enter the world of work. Collaboration is a real 21st-century skill, and an important part of being employable in a digital age.<eos>"

However, my parents clearly weren’t looking to put their feet up as they organized our summer vacation this year. My dad seemed to have taken it upon himself to plan the ultimate family bonding trip. We packed a lot of stuff into the car, including suitcases, coolers, and clothing. We set off on our journey, which was called 'The Family Great American Road Trip'. As we drove west, we had a lot of adventures. We stopped at a town in Oklahoma under the darkest star-filled skies. We learned the rule of the road: cattle get the right-of-way. We also visited Pagosa Springs, Colorado, and learned that what are marked as Jeep roads are best left to Jeep drivers. We drove on to Yellowstone National Park and watched the setting sun cast its shadows over bear habitats close to the roads. We had a close encounter with a bear and made some unforgettable memories. After watching a rainstorm blow through, we made our free-fall back south again. I knew that for me, the things I’d remember would be the unplanned, the spontaneous.<eos>"

She knew about healthy eating, about keeping fit, and getting enough sleep. But this time Rose had insisted on one thing: she wanted her independence.

Charlotte Grainger was inspired to write a novel by her primary school teacher. When she was 13, she started writing the novel that is now being published. The novel is about a teenager who is going through similar experiences to Charlotte.

Charlotte acknowledges the limitations of her youth. She says that she was trying to ask big questions, not answer them. She also says that she doesn’t think her understanding of the world is limited by her age.

Charlotte has a theory about teenagers and the way they are ‘betrayed’ by the fiction that is specifically aimed at them. She says that there are three types of teenager depicted in novels. There’s the outsider who becomes acceptable to society, the naïve teenager who knows nothing about the big wide world, and the awkward teenage character who isn’t socially skilled.

Charlotte has always been a keen reader of famous fantasy writers. She says that books by her favourite fantasy writers explore deep things about psychology and about life. She also says that she was discouraged by reading books by her favourite fantasy writers. However, she does praise the influence of a book called How Not to Write a Novel.<eos>"

Imagine you're on a rollercoaster in an amusement park. You come to a grinding halt and inhale sharply before the carriage creeps slowly upwards. A pause. Then a sharp drop and your stomach is suspended in the air. You hurtle quickly forwards, sharply left, then upside down. Your senses are a blur, you let out a roar of fear that comes from the pit of your gut.

Amusement parks are a huge industry that delivers thrills and escape from reality. To create the perfect ride, there are huge teams of engineers and designers. It's a big challenge to create the perfect balance of pleasure and fear while ensuring that passengers are not in any danger.

The teams behind rollercoasters must piece together a strong narrative, be it a space adventure or a high-paced chase in the jungle, that works with any innovations to create a seamless experience. However, as in many creative industries, gut instincts, years of experience and trial-and-error are what work.

Sure, virtual reality can add a veneer, but it doesn't change the physical coaster experience. I think that will remain king for many years to come.<eos>"

A friend asked me why I travel when I can see everything on television. I agreed that you can see amazing things on TV, but why sit at home on your sofa when there’s so much out there to experience. I guess that conversation gave me the idea for my crazy four-day trip, and a film that aimed to get people to turn off their television sets. I had a mate getting rid of his old sofa, which became the star of the film. I fixed some wheels and cables to it and connected them to old seatbelts over my shoulders. I put my luggage on the seats and slept on the sofa each night, including one night on the beach. Several friends joined me on the way, helping to pull the sofa along and encouraging me to keep going. I’ve been on several expeditions on foot in recent years but this was something completely new. Not only was it the longest distance I have ever walked, it was also on main roads, which meant I could stop at a roadside café and relax on the sofa with a cappuccino instead of having the wind blowing away my sandwiches while I sit on a rock.

When I read about guided swimming trips in the sea around some small Greek islands, I was excited. I'd never tried organised group trips before. My brother was busy, so I decided a group holiday might suit me. The man at the Greek port was curious when I asked for a single ferry ticket. I explained I wouldn't be alone for long; I’d be joining ten others to swim around the tiny islands. We did a short swim to split us into speed groups, then it was time for our first proper swim. I was nervous. I’d trained in my local pool, and done some river swimming, but never long distances in the open sea. Soon, the waves got bigger and I was at the back of the slow group.

I enjoy being a flight attendant. I have been to many places, including the US and Australia. I work with great people, and I have a lot of time off. Life is always exciting, which makes it a great job for a young person like me.

When I was a child, I often flew unaccompanied to boarding school. I felt lonely, so I would ask the flight attendants to let me help give out meals to passengers. I guess that’s the thing I remembered later, when I needed an escape from my banking job and began looking for a new direction. There was a lot of young people at the interview, and many were accepted. They were often highly qualified like me, and were changing careers. Before the interview, I practised what to say – more than simply that I loved to travel, as everyone else would say the same. Instead, I mentioned my strengths and previous work experience – and I got the job!

I would recommend this kind of work to anyone, as there are so many things that make it worthwhile – but the free flights I get aren’t top of the list. Most airline staff are incredibly hard-working, and there’s a saying – ‘no-one’s finished till everyone’s finished.’ It’s like a big family – even though we don’t see each other all the time, we’re still close. When I’m not working, I don’t have to take work home. And if I do get difficult passengers, which is rare, I always know the flight will soon be over and I’ll probably never see them again!<eos>"

At the summer camp where I work, I really enjoy seeing the children succeed at things they never thought they could do. Most of the children know how to swim and play table-tennis, but rock climbing is a new experience for most of them. Some children feel very nervous, but after some encouragement they agree to try and they all get to the top in the end. This makes them feel great. We do get children who miss home at the beginning of the week. It's not the really young ones who feel like that the most – it's actually the ten- to thirteen-year-olds. We don't let them use their mobile phones all the time. We tell them they can phone home after lunch and when they ask again, usually after dinner, we say it's a bit late to phone now, do it tomorrow. Most children are fine in a couple of days and at the end of their week's stay, they all come up to us and thank us because they have had a great time.<eos>"

Rock the Planet, a musical show, opened in London last year. It was voted 'Best Musical' four times in the USA. The show was challenging to do with an all-British cast of actors because the UK has limits on how many performances young actors can do.
