Some time ago, there was a website that talked about the risks of public check-ins, which are online announcements of your whereabouts. The website said that when you post something online, you are also telling everyone in the world where you are. This made people realize that there can be some downsides to sharing so much information online.
The internet has opened up a lot of new opportunities to share your life with the world. You can write a blog, post photos, and share your thoughts with anyone who wants to see them. However, you should be aware that the internet can also be a dangerous place. If you post something online, it can be seen by anyone. This means that you should be careful about what you say online.
In the early days of the internet, there was a young man named Justin Hall who started a blog. He wrote about his life and shared his photos and art with the world. However, things went wrong when people started finding out his home address and posting it online. This made Hall feel unsafe and he had to stop blogging.
Heather Armstrong is another example of how the internet can be a dangerous place. She had a blog and wrote about her job and her life. However, one day an anonymous person sent the address of her blog to all of her bosses. This led to her being fired from her job.
These two stories show that the internet can be a great place to share your life, but you should also be aware of the risks. If you post something online, it can be seen by anyone. So, you should be careful about what you say online."

A long time ago, some scientists started a campaign to warn people about a movie called What the Bleep Do We Know. The movie showed that there is a lot about the universe that we don't understand. Even the most experienced scientists admit that they don't have all the answers. Some people felt that the movie was dangerous and issued warnings about it. The movie was very popular, but I didn't understand why people were so excited about it at first. However, when the movie described some new discoveries, I started to see what all the fuss was about. One of the discoveries was that water molecules can be affected by thoughts. I had heard rumours about this before, but the movie gave me some evidence to support it. The evidence was not very convincing, but it was still interesting. The movie also talked about other discoveries, such as the nature of the universe and the existence of life on Earth. These discoveries were amazing and showed me that the universe is far stranger than I could ever imagine."

Writing novels is like planting a forest, while writing short stories is more like planting a garden. The two processes complement each other, creating a complete landscape that I treasure. Writing novels takes a long time and a lot of commitment, while writing short stories is more manageable and allows me to experiment and express myself freely.
I have been writing novels and short stories since I began my career as a fiction writer. I usually write a novel after finishing a group of short stories, and vice versa. It takes me about a week to complete a short story, which is much faster than writing a novel.
Short stories are like guideposts to my heart, and I feel happy as a writer to be able to share my intimate feelings with my readers."

Science is a powerful force that has both improved and threatened human existence. It has made our lives easier and has also challenged our very existence. Science has its beauty and its dangers, and it has been used for both good and evil.
Science has been used to explain the natural world, from the tiniest particles to the vastness of the universe. It has also been used to develop new technologies and treatments for diseases. However, science has also been used to create weapons and destroy lives.
The history of science is filled with conflict and change. Scientists have constantly been modifying and overthrowing theories. Sometimes, these changes have been minor, but other times they have been major. The struggle between old and new theories has often been bitter and contentious.
Despite its challenges, science continues to progress. It is a field that is constantly evolving and changing. Scientists are always learning new things and developing new theories. Science is a powerful tool that can be used to improve the world, but it is also a dangerous force that can be used to destroy it."

From around 2015, major publishers started to report that sales of ebooks had plateaued or even fallen in some cases. This has raised concerns about the long-term potential of ebooks in the publishing industry. Some people believe that the ebooks hype may have driven unwise investment, with companies losing confidence in the power of the word on the page. Despite the evidence, the question of whether ebooks will 'kill' the print book still continues to surface.
The idea of one medium 'killing' another has often followed the unveiling of new technologies. Even before the advent of digital technologies, critics have predicted the demise of existing media. For example, when television was invented, many people thought that radio would die. But radio ended up surviving by finding new uses.
The emergence of new technology often causes us to adjust our bond with something that has become an integral part of our day-to-day life. As a result, as technology moves on, we find ourselves longing for what we used to know, but no longer have. This is why entire industries develop around retro products and older technologies."

Every day, I wake up early to write about how some of the greatest minds of the past have approached their work. I write about their daily routines and how they made the time each day to do their best work. I also write about my own struggles with creativity and productivity.
I have a lot of concerns about creativity and productivity. How do you do meaningful creative work while also earning a living? Is it better to devote yourself wholly to a project or to set aside a small portion of each day? And when there doesn’t seem to be enough time for all you hope to accomplish, must you give things up or can you learn to condense activities, to do more in less time, to ‘work smarter, not harder’?
I have tried to provide examples of how a variety of brilliant and successful people have confronted many of the same challenges. I wanted to show how grand creative visions translate to small daily increments; how one’s working habits influence the work itself, and vice versa.
This book is about people’s routines. It’s about the circumstances of creative activity, not the product; it deals with manufacturing rather than meaning. But it’s also, inevitably, personal. I have documented all of my sources in the Notes section, which I hope will also serve as a guide to further reading."

Howard became a palaeontologist because he was inspired by a rise in interest rates when he was young. He knew for a long time that he wanted to become a palaeontologist, and he worked hard to achieve his goal. He studied delicate creatures revealed on the surface of grey rocks and wrote his doctoral thesis. He was disappointed when he didn't get the job he wanted, but he knew that his potential was good. He applied for a job at Tavistock College in London and was eventually offered the position. He was surprised by the favouritism he encountered, but he was grateful for the job and the opportunity to do the work he loved."

Charles Spence is a Professor of Experimental Psychology at Oxford University in the UK. He has studied how the senses interact to form our perception of flavour. Through his studies, he has influenced what we eat and drink. He has also studied how the environment affects taste.
Spence has written a book called The Perfect Meal, which is packed with insights about food and drink. It is a fascinating book for anyone who loves to eat and drink.
Spence's lab is not very high-tech. It has soundproof booths and stacks of ancient-looking audio-visual equipment. He can afford to work more creatively with cooks because he keeps his overheads low.
Spence has been helping famous brands reduce salt and sugar in their products. He says that it is in their interests to help loyal customers stay alive for longer.
Spence has also studied the effects of sound on flavour. He has found that higher-pitched music enhances sweetness, and lower-pitched and brassy sounds make food taste bitter."

Our brains are very busy these days. We have a lot of information to deal with, including facts, rumors, and things that are not true. We also do more things ourselves now than we used to. For example, we make our own reservations and find things in shops. We do a lot of different things at once, but it's not multitasking. It's more like spinning plates. When we think we're multitasking, we're actually switching from one task to another very quickly. This can be stressful and make it harder to focus on the task at hand. Multitasking also makes it harder to learn new information and make decisions. It's a real problem, especially with email. We feel obligated to answer emails, but it's impossible to do that and get anything else done."

In a Swedish zoo, a chimpanzee named Santino would sometimes break up concrete into pieces and throw them at visitors. Was he being spiteful? In caves in the US, female bats help unrelated fruit bat mothers if they can’t find the right birthing position. Are they being caring? Fifty years ago, people thought that animals didn’t have consciousness, feelings or moral systems. But recently that has partially changed. Thanks to research into the behaviour of bats, chimps, and other animals, emotions of animals have gone from being a taboo area of investigation to being tentatively explored. It is a change that has in recent years filtered through the scientific strata to a selection of popular science books. And it has started a debate that may never be solved by science: can animals be said to have consciousness?
The debate about animal consciousness raises a second question: conscience – a person’s moral sense of right and wrong that guides their behaviour. In a recent experiment involving cows, it became apparent that those that successfully opened the gate themselves showed more pleasure than those that had to have the gate opened for them. If, as this research seems to imply, cows enjoy problem-solving, what does it mean for the production and consumption of beef? The observations may not be disputed, but the interpretation of them is. Some people believe that the only logically consistent response to the new research is to stop eating meat. Others believe that we should at the very least re-evaluate our view of animal cognition. Still others believe that we should just stop anthropomorphising animals. The debate is ongoing and there is no clear answer."

Critical thinking is a way of understanding what we read or listen to in a deeper way. It involves interacting with the text and thinking about it in a way that goes beyond simply remembering facts.
There is some concern that technology is changing the way we approach complex problems and making it more difficult to really think. For example, the amount of information available online can be overwhelming and can make it difficult to focus on a single task. Additionally, the use of visual media, such as video games and television, can distract people from reading and writing.
However, there is also evidence that technology can have a positive impact on critical thinking. For example, video games can teach decision-making and analytical skills. They can also help people to explore ideas and concepts that might otherwise be inaccessible or off limits.
It is important to understand the subtleties of how technology affects thinking and analysis. By understanding how technology can be used to enhance critical thinking, we can help to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to think critically."

When Matthew Crawford is not writing or thinking about how we should live, he works as a motorcycle mechanic. He wrote two books about the benefits of manual trades and how to cope with modernity.
Crawford says that our attention is being pulled in many directions. We are constantly being interrupted and it is becoming more and more difficult to think or remember conversations we’ve had. This is because everyone is trying to protect themselves from the irritation of constantly being interrupted.
Crawford also talks about the impact that technology has had on our ability to connect with others. He says that we are more conscious of other things we might be doing and that this has a social impact. We’d rather send a text message to a friend, free from the risk of having a conversation.
Crawford's proposed solution has two parts. First, we need regulation of noise and distraction in public space. More importantly, though, Crawford advocates skilled practices as a way of engaging with the world in a more satisfying way."

""What do you do for a living?"" is a common question that we often answer in a few words. However, if you're a philosopher, it's a bit harder to deal with. It's because describing yourself as a philosopher sounds rather pretentious. Saying you study or teach the subject is fine, but to say you are a philosopher is, in the eyes of many, to claim access to some mystical truth or enlightenment above one’s fellows.
There are a few reasons why this misconception exists. One reason is that philosophers have established themselves as people who judge the activities of others and celebrate intellectual life. Another reason is that the academic discipline of philosophy has grown increasingly removed from lived experiences.
Philosophy can help people look a little more closely at the practices and behaviours that define their lives. Sometimes this might reveal something we already know; at other times we might discover that our beliefs are hard to justify. Either way, merely by examining these ideas, we’ll be doing something for the benefit of everyone."

Foodies, gourmands, chefs and others who love food might expect that reflecting on what and how we eat can contribute to culinary pleasure. However, philosophical discussions of food have often been about other topics, such as the acquisition of knowledge or the pursuit of pleasure. Food is inherently social and cultural. It derives from historical contexts and is shared with those in our communities. It also brings people together and provides infrastructure for growing and distributing food.
Once food has been prepared, people will start talking and writing about it. They enjoy the privilege of being able to taste and describe food tastes. But why do these people enjoy such a privileged status? One philosopher has reminded us that tasting what we eat is not some sort of special expertise. Another aspect of food is aesthetics. We talk about paintings or symphonies being beautiful, but not the taste of food. And there are undoubtedly many ethical issues that attach to food.
A separate matter is the extent to which cooking in restaurants and in the home differ. Home cooks have a special duty to their guests, while those who cook for a living have obligations to their employer and to the food itself. Food and dining can play a role in bridging cultural gaps. We can come to appreciate others by learning to enjoy their food and forge personal bonds with people from other cultures by coming together to eat."

Rob Daviau is a US designer who creates 'legacy' board games. These games are different from traditional board games because they have a permanent impact on the game. For example, in one game called Risk Legacy, players might have to rip up cards, deface the board, or open packets containing new rules. The games play out over a fixed number of sessions and long-held grudges become woven into the fabric of the game.
Legacy board games were not expected to become popular, but most players love the concept. They see it as one of the biggest advances in game design for several years. The legacy format draws on video games and the demand for episodic entertainment fuelled by popular TV series.
Daviau feels a sense of ownership, but he is also keen to see where others take the idea. He suspects gamers will soon be asking: 'Enough of that, what's new?'"

Once upon a time, there was an octopus named Inky who lived in a tank at the New Zealand National Aquarium. One night, Inky managed to escape from his tank and swim across the floor to a narrow drain that led to the Pacific Ocean. It was a story that was shared online and was popular among children.
One of the reasons why people find stories like Inky's so interesting is because they involve anthropomorphism, which means treating animals like humans. In the case of octopuses, this pleasure is especially pronounced because of their intelligence and their physical differences from humans.
Scientists have found that animals have many of the same abilities as humans, such as the ability to consider the past and the future, to demonstrate empathy and self-awareness, and to anticipate the motives of others. However, there are some things that humans can do that animals cannot, such as fully-developed language.
It is important to remember that animals are not humans. They have their own unique ways of thinking and behaving. However, we can learn from animals and appreciate their intelligence."

Once upon a time, there was a technology called robotics that has the potential to change the world. Robots have already been used in the automotive and manufacturing industries for many years. Experts say that in the next few years, robots will be used in many other industries.
One of the main challenges with robotics is that it can lead to job loss. However, it can also create new jobs. For example, robots can build houses much faster than humans. They can also be used to clean supermarkets and stock shelves.
Another challenge with robotics is that it can lead to social unrest. Some people are afraid that robots will take away their jobs and their ability to interact with others. However, experts say that this is not necessarily true. They say that robots can create new jobs and make it easier for people to interact with each other.
In order to prepare for the robotic workforce of tomorrow, we need to invest in education and training programs. We also need to develop new regulatory frameworks to ensure our safety and privacy."

The mountaineer George Mallory was asked why he wanted to climb Mount Everest. He said, ""Because it’s there."" The general public has a desire to understand why people climb. It is possible that the climber’s answer may inspire some to act on their dreams. Climbing can be a very confining and restricting activity, but it can also give a feeling of freedom. There are some important virtues that climbing can cultivate, such as courage, humility and respect for the environment. Climbing can also help develop the traits and virtues that allow one to flourish and live well in our non-climbing world."

One of the most interesting things happening in further and higher education in the UK and around the world is the move to encourage novice students to get involved in research as early as possible. Research is not just for famous scholars or scientists. It can also be seen as a natural way to build knowledge and skills.
There are different ways to do research. You can do it in a big way, like the highly trained few who do groundbreaking research, or you can do it in a smaller way, like asking questions about your own interests. No matter how you do it, research is about asking questions, thinking critically about the information you have, and making your own conclusions.
In college and higher education, having an enquiring mind, identifying problems and questions, critically exploring and evaluating information and ideas that you read about or hear about, and constructing your own responses and your own knowledge to add to the debates are all learning activities which are expected of you.
Critical thinking is particularly important in research. We need to be able to not just repeat what we’ve read and take everything in as if it was proven fact, but to engage with it, think about it, test it out, identify whether what we’re being told is presented in such a way as to trick us into agreement, or whether it is logical, reasoned and backed by evidence."

Cities have been centers of intellectual life since the 18th century. They provide a place for people to gather and discuss ideas. However, city life is not always easy. It can be exhausting and overwhelming. Scientists have found that cities actually dull our thinking, sometimes dramatically so. One of the main reasons for this is the lack of nature in cities. Studies have shown that people who can see trees from their windows recover more quickly from illness. Even small glimpses of nature improve brain performance.
In recent years, it has become clear that living in cities has a number of negative effects on our mental and physical health. These effects include fatigue, stress, and depression. However, there is also evidence that living in cities can have some positive effects on our creativity and innovation.
The key to mitigating the psychological damage of the metropolis while maintaining its unique benefits is to find ways to integrate nature into city life. This can be done through a variety of methods, such as creating more parks and green spaces, and making it easier for people to access nature."

The mind is a complex thing that takes place inside people's heads. We have neuroimaging techniques to prove it. But the study of the mind should not stop at the skin or the skull. There is evidence that things and neurons participate in human cognitive life. From the viewpoint of archaeology, stone objects, body ornaments, engravings, clay tokens and writing systems play an active role in human evolution and the making of the human mind.
The mind and the brain are often equated. Most of what we know about the human mind has been uncovered through isolating people from the material culture they are usually surrounded by in order to study them. But it often goes unnoticed that much of our thinking takes place outside our heads.
My approach sees the human mind as an unfinished project, in a permanent state of on-going evolution. It is important to keep in mind that whatever actual form the 'stick' might have taken in the history of our species, its primary function was that of a pathway instead of a boundary. Through the 'stick', the human species feels, discovers, and makes sense of the environment, but also enacts the way forward."

Photography has significantly changed the course of civilization and the way we perceive the world. It has been especially impactful in the United States, where photography quickly became part of American culture at all levels. Historians believe that photography is arguably the country’s greatest single contribution to the visual arts. No other art form has US work loomed so large.
Photography has been appealing because it is a mechanical process that matches the growing enthusiasm for technology in the US. It also brought the wonders and sights of the world into the front room with an immediacy that was breathtaking. Additionally, photography has been important for creating and sustaining impressions of self and family, and for representing everyday realities.
Photographs are records of events, people, and things. They embody a certain objectivity, but also carry with them an inescapable element of subjectivity. If we want to understand a photograph historically, we need to pay attention to its purpose and function within a given cultural matrix."

In 1890, William James, an American philosopher and physician, defined psychology as the ""science of mental life."" This definition is still a good starting point for understanding psychology today. We all have a mental life, so we have some idea about what this means. However, even though the concept can be studied in rats and monkeys as well as humans, it remains a somewhat elusive one.
Psychology is about the mind or brain, but psychologists do not understand nearly enough about its workings to be able to comprehend the part that it plays in the experience and expression of our hopes, fears, and wishes, or in our behaviour during experiences as varied as giving birth or watching a football match.
The endeavour of psychology is much like that involved in solving a crossword puzzle. It involves evaluating and interpreting available clues. Complex interactions are the norm rather than the exception in psychology, and understanding them depends on the development of sophisticated techniques and theories.
Psychology has the same goals as any other science: to describe, understand, predict, and learn how to control or modify the process that it studies. Once these goals have been achieved, it can help us to understand the nature of our experience and come to conclusions that can be applied directly to people’s lives."

The proprietor of the museum, Carol Sherry, sees each product as embodying its own sad story. The museum is a viable, profit-making business. It is a testament to the fact that most products fail. The museum was started by ex-marketing man Robert McMath, who intended to accumulate a reference library of consumer products. McMath had a collection of new products that were unsuccessful.

Everyone knows that sports teams have an advantage when they play at home. But does anyone know why? Most of us probably think we do; after all, it seems obvious. But professional sport is changing faster than at any time in its history and much of what we used to take for granted is now open to question.
There are two main reasons why home advantage exists. First, the home team has the advantage of playing in front of their own crowd. The crowd can generate a lot of noise and energy, which can help the home team to perform better. Second, the home team has the advantage of being familiar with their own environment. They know the layout of the field, the weather conditions, and the crowd. This can give the home team an edge in terms of strategy and execution.
However, there are some factors that can reduce home advantage. One factor is travel. If the away team has to travel a long distance to the home team's city, they may be tired and not able to perform as well. Another factor is the weather. If the weather is extreme, such as very hot or very cold, it can also affect the performance of the home team.
Despite these factors, home advantage still exists. There are a number of studies that have shown that home teams win more games than away teams. This is because of the psychological effects that playing at home have on the home team. When the home team is playing at home, they feel more confident and are more likely to win the game."

The more I practice, the luckier I get, said Gary Player. This quote is famous and is valued by athletes and coaches worldwide.

There is a debate about whether talent is born or acquired. However, the majority of experts believe that practice is more important than talent. This is known as the 10,000-hours rule. According to this rule, anyone can become an expert in anything with 10,000 hours of practice. However, this is not always the case. There are many examples where people have not achieved their goals despite practicing for many hours.

A recent report found that a large number of children living in wealthy industrialized countries feel unhappy, lonely, and dissatisfied. The reason for this unhappiness is that these children have been spending too much time indoors, watching TV or playing on computers, and have lost contact with the natural world.
In her book, Kith, Jay Griffiths argues that this is the heart of the problem. She believes that children need to be allowed to roam and explore the wild woods of their home territory, and to take risks.
A follow-up study to the report interviewed a sample of children and found that a large number said that they would be happier if they could simply go outside more. Many of today’s over-40s talk nostalgically about the freedom of their own youth, and they often forget that they are the ones who have imposed that protective regime on their own children.
Griffiths' book has some good arguments about the importance of children's freedom and autonomy. However, she does not provide enough information about how to achieve this freedom and autonomy."

I am a research bio-psychologist with a PhD. I have done a lot of school and I am a good problem-solver. However, my schooling has not helped me solve all of life's problems. Most problems in life cannot be solved with a complex formula or memorized answers. They require the judgement, wisdom and creative ability that come from life experiences.
For children, those experiences are embedded in play. Play is the natural means by which adults and mammals have always educated themselves. The most important skills children everywhere must learn in order to live happy, productive, moral lives are skills that cannot be taught in school. Such skills include the abilities to think creatively, to get along with other people and co-operate effectively, and to control their own impulses and emotions.
Play is also important for social development. Children everywhere are born with a strong drive to play with other children. Such play is the means by which they acquire social skills and practise fairness and morality, which they will need in order to participate fully later in life.
If we care about our children and future generations, we must reverse the horrid trend that has been occurring over the past half century. We must give childhood back to children. Children must be allowed to follow their inborn drives to play and explore, so that they can grow into intellectually, socially, emotionally and physically strong adults fit for an unpredictable future."

In many countries, there are a lot of young people in their twenties who use social media to find work. There are two popular social networking sites that are often used for job hunting: Twitter and LinkedIn. These sites offer the chance for direct contact with potential employers. However, with greater access comes a greater chance to make mistakes.
For example, a young jobseeker in the US contacted a senior marketing executive via LinkedIn. The marketing executive had a lot of influential people in her contact list. The young jobseeker felt that he could use this list to help him land a job. However, the marketing executive was not happy with this idea. She sent a rude and sarcastic rejection note that has since gone viral.
If this incident makes young people think more carefully about how they use social media in a professional capacity, it may have actually ended up doing them a favour. It has drawn attention to an unfortunate truth. Social media is a potentially dangerous tool for jobhunters who don’t know how to use it. And a worrying number are getting it wrong.
To be successful on professional networking sites, you need to be clear and concise in your message, and keep the tone humble. You should also avoid sending impersonal, blanket emails. If you do these things, you have a better chance of getting a positive response from potential employers."

Newspapers have been struggling in recent years due to declining circulation and the rise of online news. In the UK, the circulation of most national dailies has fallen by a third to half since 2000. Despite the challenges, old media have a habit of surviving. Newspapers were once new media, and they became the dominant medium for news in the mid-19th century thanks to the steam press, the railway, and the telegraph.
Today, we have a wealth of ways to get news online. We can read articles, watch videos, and listen to podcasts. We can also personalize the news to our own interests and priorities. This is a world away from the straitjacket of newspaper publication. Yet few if any providers seem alive to the new medium’s capacity for spreading understanding and enlightenment. Instead, the anxiety is always to be first with the news, to maximise reader comments, to create heat, sound and fury and thus add to the sense of confusion."

If humans were truly at home under the light of the moon and stars, we would go in darkness happily. Instead, we are diurnal creatures, with eyes adapted to living in the sun’s light. We have engineered the night to receive us by filling it with light. This kind of control is no different from the feat of damming a river. Its benefits come with consequences – called light pollution.
Light pollution is largely the result of bad lighting design. It washes out the darkness of night, altering light levels and light rhythms to which many forms of life, including ourselves, have adapted. Wherever man-made light spills into the natural world, some aspects of life are affected.
Light is a powerful biological force, and on many species it acts as a magnet attracting them to it. It was once thought that light pollution only affected astronomers, but it also affects other creatures, such as birds and frogs. Denying darkness is futile. It is as essential to maintaining our biological welfare as light itself.
In the end, humans are no less trapped by light pollution than the frogs in a pond near a brightly lit highway. Living in a glare of our own making, we have cut ourselves off from our evolutionary and cultural heritage – the light of the stars and the rhythms of day and night."

The founder of a large company recently announced that his company would no longer track employees’ paid holiday time. The company was inspired by an internet company that has implemented a similar policy. The founder's daughter wrote him an email suggesting the idea. The company has 50,000 employees and provides a variety of services. The policy allows employees to take as much leave as they want as long as they feel comfortable that their absence will not damage the business. However, there are some concerns about the practicality of this policy. For example, it could lead to increased guilt and stress for employees, which could in turn lead to a decrease in productivity. Additionally, it could lead to pressure from colleagues and office gossip. The policy could also make it difficult for employees to maintain a healthy work-life balance.

Journal-based peer review is a process that ensures the quality of scientific research papers. It is often touted as a way to prevent flawed or nonsensical papers from being published. However, there are some concerns about the effectiveness of journal-based peer review. Preprints are a new way to share research papers that have not been peer-reviewed. They bring academics back to what research publication is all about: the rapid dissemination of new results. Preprints also enable informal scientific discussions and provide a platform for negative results. They could also become an effective outlet for negative results, which are often overlooked by journals."

When I teach literature, students often answer that a poem is like a painting in words. Their answers usually don't satisfy me or them. One day, I asked students to choose an object and write one paragraph describing it empirically and another in the first person, from the point of view of the item itself. The exercise led to much amusement and discussion.
A poem is a thing made, like a painting or a machine. Poets sometimes compare poems to wild animals or machines, but such comparisons don't always hold up. The most productive thing about trying to define a poem is the debate. Whether you view a poem as a machine or a wild animal, this process can change your conception of what a machine or wild animal is.
A poem is a product of writing and rewriting just like an article, story, or novel. It never really becomes what they usually are – a thing created in order to become a commodity."
