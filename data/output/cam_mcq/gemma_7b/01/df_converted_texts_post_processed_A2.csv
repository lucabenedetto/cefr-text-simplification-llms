Some time ago, there was a website that talked about the dangers of public check-ins. It said that if you put your location online, people you don't know can see it. This made people realize that there are some downsides to sharing everything on the internet.
The internet has a lot of opportunities for people to share their lives. You can write a blog, post photos, and share your thoughts with the world. But you should be careful about what you share online. If you put your personal information on the internet, people might be able to find it and use it against you.
There are some people who have learned from the mistakes of others. Heather Armstrong is one of them. She had a blog where she wrote about her life. One day, someone sent the address of her blog to her boss. As a result, she lost her job. But Armstrong didn't give up. She started a new blog and wrote about her family. Today, she is a successful blogger and her writing supports her family."

A long time ago, some scientists started a campaign to warn people about a movie called What the Bleep Do We Know. The movie showed that there is a lot about the universe that we don't understand. Some scientists felt that the movie was dangerous and issued warnings about it. The movie was very popular, but I couldn't see what all the fuss was about at first. However, when the movie moved on to describe some of the new discoveries, I started to see what the fuss was really about. One of the discoveries was that water molecules can be affected by thoughts. I had heard rumours about this before, but the movie gave me some evidence to support it. The evidence was not very convincing, but it was still enough to make me believe that the discovery was real. The movie also talked about other discoveries, such as the discovery of the universe being made from an unknown form of matter and the discovery that our conscious perception of events lags behind reality. These discoveries are amazing, but they also make me feel like we are further away from understanding the universe than ever before."

Writing novels is like planting a forest, and writing short stories is more like planting a garden. The two processes complement each other, creating a complete landscape. Writing novels takes a long time and a lot of commitment, while writing short stories is quicker and easier to complete. You can create a story out of the smallest things, and you don’t have to worry about failing. Short stories are like guideposts to your heart, and it makes you happy as a writer to be able to share these intimate feelings with your readers."

Science is a powerful force that has improved our lives and threatened our existence. It has also inspired us to dream big and to understand the universe. Science has its beauty and its perils, but it is also important and fallible.
Scientists come in many different colors, and they often disagree with each other. But they always keep working to learn new things and to improve their theories. Sometimes, scientists make big changes to their theories that can have a big impact on the world.
Science has also been used to control nature. We have moved from being simply observers of nature to being, in a modest but growing way, its controllers. Concomitantly, we have occasionally disturbed the balance of nature in ways that we did not always understand.
Science has become part of the human race’s way of conceiving of and manipulating its future. The manipulation of the future is not a question to be left to philosophers. The answers can affect the national budget, the health of your next child – even the long-term prospects for life on this planet."

From around 2015, major publishers started to notice that sales of ebooks had stopped growing, or even fallen in some cases. This made people question whether ebooks would continue to be popular. One publishing executive admitted that the ebooks hype may have been too much, and that his company had lost confidence in the power of the printed word. Despite the evidence, the idea that ebooks will 'kill' print books continues to be discussed. It is important to remember that digital and print books can coexist in the market. The potential disappearance of the book does not mean that it will cease to inspire us or provoke intense debate.
The idea of one medium 'killing' another has been used to describe many new technologies. Even before the invention of digital technologies, people predicted that existing media would die. But new technologies have often found new uses and survived. The same is true for books. As technology changes, we find ourselves longing for what we used to know, but no longer have. This is why entire industries develop around retro products and older technologies."

Every day, I wake up early to write about how some of the greatest minds of the past have approached their work. I write about their daily routines and how they made the time to do their best work. I also write about my own struggles with creativity and productivity.
I have a lot of concerns about creativity and productivity. How do you do meaningful creative work while also earning a living? Is it better to devote yourself wholly to a project or to set aside a small portion of each day? And when there doesn’t seem to be enough time for all you hope to accomplish, must you give things up or can you learn to condense activities, to do more in less time, to ‘work smarter, not harder’?
I have tried to provide examples of how a variety of brilliant and successful people have confronted many of the same challenges. I wanted to show how grand creative visions translate to small daily increments; how one’s working habits influence the work itself, and vice versa.
This book is about people’s routines. It’s about the circumstances of creative activity, not the product; it deals with manufacturing rather than meaning. But it’s also, inevitably, personal. I have documented all of my sources in the Notes section, which I hope will also serve as a guide to further reading."

Howard became a palaeontologist because he was interested in dinosaurs. He wanted to become a palaeontologist since he was young. He studied delicate creatures revealed on the surface of grey rocks. He worked on his doctoral thesis and got a job as an Assistant Lecturer at Tavistock College in London. He was surprised at the evident favouritism from a man he did not know. But he was grateful that he had the job and could support himself by doing the sort of work he wanted to do."

Charles Spence is a Professor of Experimental Psychology at Oxford University in the UK. He has studied how the senses interact to form our perception of flavour. Through his studies, he has influenced what we eat and drink. He has also studied how the environment affects taste.
Spence has written a book called The Perfect Meal, which is packed with insights about food and drink. It is a fascinating book for anyone who loves to eat and drink.
Spence's lab is not very high-tech. It has soundproof booths and stacks of ancient-looking audio-visual equipment. He can afford to work more creatively with cooks because he keeps his overheads low.
Spence has been helping famous brands reduce salt and sugar in their products. He says that it is in their interests to help loyal customers stay alive for longer.
Spence has also studied the effects of sound on flavour. He has found that higher-pitched music enhances sweetness, and lower-pitched and brassy sounds make food taste bitter."

Our brains are very busy these days. We have a lot of information to deal with, including facts, rumors, and things that are not true. We also do more things ourselves now than we used to. For example, we make our own reservations and find things in shops. We do a lot of different things at once, but it's not always easy to keep up with everything. Our smartphones help us do all of this, but they also make it harder to focus.
When we think we're multitasking, we're actually switching from one task to another very quickly. This is not very efficient. Multitasking can also make us feel stressed and anxious. It can also make it harder to learn new information. If you do your homework and watch TV at the same time, the information from your schoolwork will not go to the right part of your brain.
Multitasking also requires a lot of decision-making. This can be very tiring for our brains. If we make a lot of small decisions, we can end up making a big decision that is not very well thought out. This is because our brains are not wired to multitask well. We are more like amateur plate spinners, frantically switching from one task to another, ignoring the one that’s not right in front of us but worried it’ll come crashing down any minute."

In a zoo in Sweden, a chimpanzee named Santino would break up concrete into pieces at night and throw them at visitors during the day. Was he being spiteful? In caves in the US, female bats help unrelated fruit bat mothers if they can’t find the right birthing position. Are they being caring? Fifty years ago, people thought that animals didn’t have consciousness, feelings or moral systems. But recently that has changed. Thanks to research into the behaviour of bats, chimps, and other animals, emotions of animals have gone from being a taboo area of investigation to being tentatively explored. It is a change that has in recent years filtered through the scientific strata to a selection of popular science books. And it has started a debate that may never be solved: can animals be said to have consciousness?
The debate about animal consciousness raises a second question: conscience – a person’s moral sense of right and wrong that guides their behaviour. In a recent experiment, it became apparent that cows that successfully opened the gate themselves showed more pleasure than those that had to have the gate opened for them. If, as this research seems to imply, cows enjoy problem-solving, what does it mean for the production and consumption of beef? The observations may not be disputed, but the interpretation of them is. Some people believe that the only logically consistent response to the new research is to stop eating meat. Others believe that we should at the very least re-evaluate our view of animal cognition. Still others believe that we should just stop anthropomorphising animals. The debate may never be solved because it is a philosophical one."

Critical thinking is a way of understanding things more deeply. It involves interacting with what we read or listen to in a way that helps us to think more deeply.
There is a belief that argument is a way of finding the truth. Although technology can help us store and process information, it can also make it more difficult to think critically.
One problem is that technology can make it easier to get information quickly, but it can also make it harder to reflect on that information. This is because many visual media are real-time media that do not allow time for reflection, analysis, or imagination.
Another problem is that technology can make it easier to become distracted. This is because there are many distractions on the internet and on our phones.
Despite these challenges, there are some ways to use technology to improve your critical thinking skills. For example, you can read books, articles, and blogs on a variety of topics. You can also use technology to find information and to connect with others who are interested in the same topics."

When Matthew Crawford is not writing or thinking about how we should live, he works as a motorcycle mechanic. He wrote two books about the benefits of manual trades and how to cope with modernity.
Crawford says that our attention is being pulled away by many things, such as advertisements and video games. It is becoming more and more difficult to think or remember conversations we’ve had. And because everyone is trying to protect themselves from being interrupted, we close ourselves off and no longer want to do simple things like chat to strangers.
Crawford's proposed solution has two parts. First, we need regulation of noise and distraction in public space. More importantly, though, Crawford advocates skilled practices as a way of engaging with the world in a more satisfying way.
For example, if you like to cook, you can practice your skills by making a meal for your family and friends. If you like to play hockey, you can practice your skills by playing with your friends. If you like to ride motorcycles, you can practice your skills by riding with your friends."

""What do you do for a living?"" is a common question that people often ask. If you are a philosopher, it can be a little harder to answer this question. This is because describing yourself as a philosopher sounds a bit pretentious. However, there are some good reasons why philosophers are important.
One reason is that philosophers have established themselves as people who judge the activities of others and celebrate intellectual life. They have also argued that a life lived in contemplation, i.e. a philosophical life, is the most virtuous of all.
Another reason is that philosophy can help people look a little more closely at the practices and behaviours that define their lives. It can help people to understand themselves better and to make better decisions.
If you are interested in learning more about philosophy, there are many resources available to you. You can read books, articles, and blogs about philosophy. You can also find online courses and lectures."

Foodies, gourmands, chefs and others who love food might expect that thinking critically about what and how we eat can contribute to culinary pleasure. However, historically, philosophical discussions about food have been mostly about other topics, such as the acquisition of knowledge. Sometimes, philosophical conversations about food appear to be about other things, but when you look closer, you find that they are actually about something else. It is interesting to note the case of the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus, who believed that the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain should be the goal of life. Epicurus' name is often used to describe people who love to eat and drink. Restaurants, food shops and online recipe sites often use the name Epicurus to promote their products. These businesses expect that if their products are seen to be approved by eminent philosophers, they will be more successful. Food is also social and cultural. It is shared with family, friends and the community. It brings people together and helps them to build relationships. Food is also a topic of ethical debate. We can ask questions about what we should eat and why. There are also ethical issues related to cooking in restaurants and at home. Finally, food can be used to bridge cultural gaps. It can help us to appreciate others and forge personal bonds with people from other cultures."

Rob Daviau is a designer from the US who creates legacy board games. These games are different from traditional board games because they have a permanent impact on the game. For example, in one game, you might have to rip up cards or deface the board. The games play out over a fixed number of sessions and long-held grudges become woven into the fabric of the game.
Daviau was asked to collaborate on a legacy version of Pandemic, a popular co-operative board game. His next project was a board game called SeaFall. Legacy board game designers must consider all possible player choices to ensure the narrative doesn’t fall apart. To do this, designers recruit testers so they can observe how board games will unfold.
Legacy board games were never expected to go mainstream, but most players love the concept. The appeal of an unfolding adventure trumped any concerns about longevity. The legacy format draws on video games and the demand for episodic entertainment fuelled by popular TV series."

Once upon a time, there was an octopus named Inky who lived in a tank at the New Zealand National Aquarium. One night, Inky managed to escape from his tank and swim across the floor to a drain that led to the Pacific Ocean. It was a story that was shared online and was very popular.
One of the reasons why people find stories like Inky's so interesting is because they involve anthropomorphism, which means treating animals like humans. In the case of octopuses, this pleasure is especially pronounced because of their intelligence and their bodies that are very different from our own.
Animals have been observed exhibiting many of the same behaviors that humans can do, such as considering the past and the future, demonstrating empathy, and being self-aware. However, there are some things that humans can do that animals cannot, such as fully-developed language.
It is important to remember that animals are not exactly like humans. They have their own unique ways of thinking and behaving. For example, squirrels are not very good at remembering human memory tasks, but they are very good at remembering where they have hidden their nuts. And octopuses are not very good at producing color patterns, but they are very good at squeezing through narrow drains."

Once upon a time, there was a technology called robotics that has the potential to change the world. Robots have already been used in factories and cars for many years, but now they are starting to be used in many other places too.
One of the biggest problems with robotics is that it can lead to job loss. Many people believe that robots will take over their jobs, but this is not necessarily true. While it is true that robots can do some things that humans can do, they cannot do everything. This means that there will still be plenty of jobs for humans in the future.
Another problem with robotics is that it can lead to safety risks. For example, robots can be dangerous to work around, and they can also cause accidents. It is important to develop new regulations to ensure that robots are safe and that they do not harm people.
Despite the challenges, robotics has the potential to improve our lives in many ways. For example, robots can help us to do things that are currently difficult or impossible. They can also help us to live longer and healthier lives.
In order to prepare for the robotic workforce of tomorrow, we need to invest in education and training programs. We also need to develop new regulatory frameworks to ensure that robots are safe and that they do not harm people."

The mountaineer George Mallory said that he climbed Mount Everest because it was there. Many people wonder why people climb mountains. It is possible that the climber’s answer may inspire some to act on their dreams. Climbing can give people a feeling of freedom, but it can also be very confining. There is an apparent paradox in many forms of climbing. However, climbing can also help cultivate important virtues such as courage, humility and respect for the environment.
When asked why he climbed, US rock climber Joe Fitschen said that a better question would be 'Why do people climb?' Climbing is in our genes and it is inherent in our basic makeup to take on challenges and test limits. Climbing can also help develop important virtues such as courage, humility and respect for the environment."

My grandparents' garden was a beautiful place. It was on the bank of a river and sloped gently down towards the water. You couldn't reach the river but you could hear the sound of the water and the birds that sang in the trees above. I imagined that all gardens were like this – a place of escape, peace and solitude.
My father was a quiet and withdrawn person. He had a lot of phrases that he liked to use, one of them being 'It's immaterial to me'. He was probably disappointed that he hadn't made more of his life. He left school without qualifications and became apprenticed to a plumber. It wasn't something he was passionate about.
I always wanted to like the piano but it did its best to intimidate me. The only thing I did like about it were the two brass candlesticks that jutted out from the front. I'd walk along the river bank looking for a suitable spot where I could take off the painful sandals and leave them with my picnic while I ventured out, tentatively, peering through the water for any fish that I could scoop up with the net and take home.
One day my father announced that there was a vacancy for an apprentice gardener in the Parks Department. I thought you might be interested. I like to feel that somewhere deep down inside him, although he hated gardening himself, he'd watched me doing it for long enough and noticed the keenness and the passion for all things that grew and flowered and fruited that hadn't disappeared."

When John Maloof bought a box of old photo negatives at an estate auction, he discovered the mystery of Vivian Maier. Maloof was looking for images to use in a book about the history of the Portage Park neighbourhood in Chicago. Instead, he found 30,000 images by Maier, a street photographer with a keen eye for capturing compelling images. Since then, Maloof has amassed an archive of Maier’s life and work. He has a lot of her cameras, film, prints, negatives, movies and audiotapes.
Maier was born in 1926 and spent much of her childhood in France. She returned to New York in 1951 and came to Chicago in 1956 to work as a nanny. Maier always had a camera with her and dressed in oversized coats, broad-brimmed hats and stout shoes. She was a private person but had strong opinions about movies and politics.
Maier’s work is the purest form of art. It was not done for any commercial reason. Her images lean toward women, children, the old, the poor, and the abstract. Maloof often wonders if he’ll ever work his way through all the negatives. He had no real interest in photography until he discovered Maier’s work. Inspired by her architectural shots, Maloof actually went out on the street and began to take his own pictures."

When a novel is described as ambitious, it usually means that it is not very successful. However, this is not the case with Eleanor Catton’s book, The Luminaries. The book is set in New Zealand during the 1860s and is a murder mystery. The plot is complex and there are many characters. Catton said she set out to write a murder mystery, not a historical novel, but found the past offered more opportunities for complications and misunderstandings for her characters to deal with. The book is long, but Catton said she wanted to give each of the 20 main characters ‘a decent show’. The book is also exciting and fun to read.

The silence at Centre Court during the Wimbledon tennis championships is very quiet. You can bounce the ball, serve, and hit it, and you hear the echo of your own shot. The grass is soft and the stadium is ancient. The players wear white and the crowds are respectful. The quiet of the Centre Court is good for your game. It helps you to focus on the point you are playing and to shut everything else out.
When a point is done, there is a lot of noise. People cheer and applaud. You hear them, but it feels like they are coming from a long way away. You are so focused on the game that you don't notice the number of people watching you.

In the early 1950s, a young Englishwoman named Jane Goodall arrived in Africa. She spent most of her life in Africa and became known for her work as a scientist, activist, and environmentalist.
Goodall's research on chimpanzees has been very influential. She discovered that chimpanzees eat meat, use tools, and have emotions like humans. Her book, ""The Chimpanzees of Gombe,"" is a leading authority on chimpanzee research.
Goodall's work has also changed the way humans think about themselves. She has helped us to understand that we are more closely related to chimpanzees than we thought. She has also helped us to understand that we share many similarities with chimpanzees, such as our ability to learn and solve problems.
Even as a child, there were signs that Goodall would become a scientist. When she was five years old, she spent five hours hiding in a henhouse to learn how hens lay eggs. This event is a clear indicator of Goodall's curiosity and determination."

During my first conversation, Shirley Ford spoke to me in the voice of a young boy, his tired mother, and a fast-talking alien. Her voices are similar to those heard on children’s TV and cartoons, and to people who have seen computerised employee programmes about health and safety.
Shirley talked about what it takes to do voiceovers. You have to bring the script to life for an audience who can’t see you. You also have to be able to create the right sounds from the back of your throat.
After school, Shirley enrolled on a drama course and had some occasional work singing jingles for TV adverts. One day, she was asked to try out for the part of a rabbit in the soundtrack for a cartoon. Amazingly, she ended up getting a major part.
Shirley has learned to create the right sounds from the back of her throat and to avoid always sounding like the same child, she collects new voices as she watches children’s TV. The competition for work is fierce, and a good showreel is essential.
For anyone considering a career doing voiceovers, Shirley recommends attending ‘specialist workshops’ and having a passion for human sound."

Twenty years ago, I was moving house and had a lot of things to get rid of. I decided to throw away an electric guitar that my dad had bought me for my 16th birthday. I felt sad about throwing it away, but I took it to the rubbish dump and was about to put it on a pile of rubbish. Suddenly, a young man came up to me and asked if I was going to throw it away. I said yes and he asked if he could have it. I gave it to him and felt sad that I had thrown it away.
A few months later, I got an email from someone I didn't know. It was from a dealer and restorer of guitars called Keith Rushton. He said he had my guitar and offered to sell it back to me. I was so happy to get my guitar back and I started playing it again.
I had forgotten all about my dad's habit of putting name-and-address stickers on everything I had, including my guitar. My dad had been very keen for me to learn the classical guitar, but I couldn't make much progress. So I switched to the electric guitar and started playing undemanding stuff.
Now that I'm learning it again, I guess I'll have to form a band. Maybe I can play with my son or there are other people of my age who have had a similar experience to mine. Maybe we could call ourselves 'The Regainers'!'"

There has been a lot of talk about sleep lately. Sleep is very important for our mental, physical, and social well-being. It seems that people who have the hardest time sleeping appreciate how important sleep is the most.
When we wake up from sleep, we often forget our dreams. The dreams that we remember are usually the ones that occur during the REM stage of sleep. REM is the stage of sleep where we dream the most vividly.
Dreams are important for creativity. When people are awakened out of REM, they are able to think more creatively and flexibly. This is because dreams help us to find new patterns and create combinations that break through our usual habits of thinking.
So, everyone needs to dream. Whether you are a writer, artist, teacher, or politician, dreams can help you to think creatively and flexibly."

It was twenty years ago that Susie Ray left London for a small coastal town in south-west England. She has a studio with a beautiful sea view and hangs photographs of her two daughters on the walls. Susie is a copyist artist who can reproduce the richness of an early-20th-century impressionist masterpiece as easily as the brilliance of a 16th-century Caravaggio portrait.
The problem is that Susie is very popular. She has painted the works of numerous great artists, including Renoir, Monet and Van Gogh. Her reproductions are so faithful that art experts mistake them for the originals.
Susie has always been open about what she does. When she reproduces an old masterpiece, she will make it look as authentic as possible. However, she will put her own signature on the back of the canvas.
When younger painters approach Susie for advice, she stresses the importance of learning to draw and to represent things accurately. She also emphasises how much she’s studied to be able to do what she does."

Jordan Romero is 13 years old and wants to be the youngest person to climb Mount Everest. If he succeeds, he could become one of the most famous teenagers of his generation. Young people are spending more time on computers and games consoles, so Jordan hopes to inspire kids to climb their own mountains or venture outdoors. His team includes his father, Paul, and mother, Karen. They call themselves 'Team Romero.' If Jordan can climb Everest and Vinson Massif in Antarctica, he will become the youngest person to have climbed the Seven Summits. Few people achieve this under the age of thirty. Jordan has already climbed five of the Seven Summits and might actually do it before his teenage years are over.
There are some concerns about Jordan's climb. Some people think that a young climber might not be emotionally strong enough or have enough experience. But Jordan's parents believe that their own experience as climbers will help them guide their son. They also think that watching Jordan develop gives them confidence.
Jordan's motivation is also a question. Some people might wonder if this is just an ambitious father taking his own love of adventure to a dangerous extreme. But Paul insists that this project isn't about him trying to become famous for his son's achievements. He says, 'If Jordan comes home tomorrow and says he’s done with mountain climbing and wants to play basketball instead, we’ll shut this whole project down and go to the gym.'"

When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, it's probably not classical music they're listening to. Most people our age can name a lot of pop groups, but ask any of my friends if they know who Brahms was and they probably won't have a clue. I'm doing a music degree, but the people on my course know no more about classical music than anyone else my age. If you don't know who wrote the music, you are unlikely to own any recordings of their work. The statistics are not very encouraging for a lover of classical music. Apparently only a small number of concert tickets sold last year were for classical music events, and the average classical recording sells very few copies. I still find that hard to believe. So, what has caused this decline in interest for classical music? Well, there are a few reasons. First of all, classical music is not very popular among teenagers. It's not the music that we like to listen to when we relax. In addition, the way we listen to music has changed. Nowadays, you can find any music you want at the click of a mouse, and the sound track to our lives is rarely classical."

I met Cody Simpson a long time ago. He is a young Australian singer who has released many successful songs. He started singing when he was very young. One day, he posted some videos of himself singing on the internet. These videos became popular and people started asking for more. Cody was happy to oblige. He started recording more videos and people loved them.
But Cody was also a very talented swimmer. He was training hard and had a lot of success. However, record labels came calling and offered him a deal to move to the US and become a singer. Cody had to make a difficult decision. He had to choose between his dream of becoming a swimmer and his dream of becoming a singer.
In the end, Cody decided to take the chance and move to the US. He has been very successful as a singer. He has traveled to many countries and played in front of thousands of fans.

I woke up early and looked at the river. The ice was shining in the sunlight. I helped my family to protect the buildings from flooding. I worked hard all last week. My grandfather didn’t notice. I saw a boy on the river bank. He was trying to balance on an ice shelf. I was going kayaking. I put on my wetsuit and jacket. I checked my lucky chain. It was a silver chain that my grandfather brought back from South America. I went to the kitchen and ate breakfast. My mom smiled at me. She said I was up early for a Saturday.

Mum caught Jess by the arm and asked her to come with her to the study. There was a painting on the table. It was one of Grandpa's, but it was different from his other paintings. It was not finished and it was strange. There was a river in the painting. It was not a real river, it was a fantasy river. The picture was beautiful, but it was also mysterious. There were no animals or people in the painting. It felt like there was no place for living things. But Jess was captivated by the painting. She thought about the coming of autumn after a long, rich summer. Mum spoke again. She said the painting had a name. It was called 'River Boy'. The name was important to Jess. She didn't know why, but it was. And there was another mystery. The painting was not finished. Maybe Grandpa was going to put the boy in later."

When I woke up this morning, I didn't mean to damage my bedroom carpet. It just seemed like a good idea at the time. I was trying to find a way of fitting my corner cabinet into a corner. Gran had given me the cabinet when she moved out of her house into a flat. It's really cute. I keep my collection of shells and fossils and interesting stones there.
The problem was, the cabinet was too tall. If I could only slice a couple of centimetres off the bottom of it... That was when it came to me. If I couldn't slice anything off Gran’s cabinet, how about cutting a hole in the carpet? It just seemed like the obvious solution. What Dad calls lateral thinking. I reckoned he would be quite pleased with me."

The novel 'The Borrowers' is about a family of tiny people who live hidden in the walls and floors of a house. They borrow things from the normal-sized people in order to survive. When I was asked to direct a TV adaptation of the novel, I knew it was going to be hard to live up to people’s expectations. The author had told me she wanted the series to be from the Borrowers' perspective, not a human one, which made filming much more complex.
The most crucial thing was getting the scale right. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans, so I had to be much further away from the camera than on a normal shoot. When filming the human surroundings the Borrowers found themselves in, the crew had to crawl along the ground and film from no higher than 15 centimetres, in order to get the Borrowers' perspective.
One big challenge was finding a way to get the shadows right when the images of the supposedly tiny Borrowers were combined with a background image of ordinary-sized surroundings. We developed a unique technique for this. The costumes were also a big challenge. They had to be made out of heavy canvas material so that they stuck out in the way that dolls’ clothes do. Unfortunately, the weather was really hot during filming. I don’t think either of them thanked me for my attention to detail with those costumes!"

Mom pulled up at the corner of my new school, Palm Grove High School. She looked around nervously, but there were no journalists there. I was excited to see how long it would take before the craziness began. It always does. The fake smiles, the wannabe friends, the people who want free tickets to one of my dad’s concerts. I told her, ""Everything’s going to be fine."" She kissed her fingertip and touched my cheek right before I got out of the car. Then she was off, leaving me alone with this whole new school and situation to deal with. But this is what I asked her for. To get away from my old life on the road and tour tutors. So while the rest of the band is renting here during the recording, we’re staying for good. I wanted to meet real kids for a change. How about a kid with a mom who types from nine to five in an office? Or a dad who cuts grass? That’d be so cool. So normal. I walked into the school’s main office and asked for my schedule. The secretary seemed confused. But I got my schedule and it was cool. English Literature, first period. I was late, though. English is in Room 214, second floor. I studied the map the night before, as I didn’t want to look like a complete buffoon searching for my classes. When I got to the door, I heard the teacher already taking roll. I slipped in undetected and slid into the last desk in the second row. The girl next to me smiled. She was friendly. 'Nice shoes,' she whispered. I knew I should have worn sneakers. 'Thanks,' I said. The teacher paused in the roll taking. 'Desert... McGraw?' she said hesitantly. 'Here.' The teacher then smiled and introduced herself as Ms. Smigla. She talked a lot and eventually handed us our course outlines. After we reviewed them and she told us all about books we’re required to read this year, she actually gave us time to socialize! All teachers should realize the importance of this."

In the United States, teenage girls are expected to be Student Council presidents and have part-time jobs, volunteer, and excel in all of these fields. It's what being an American teenager is like today. Teenage boys and girls have a lot of responsibilities, including homework, tests, extra-curricular activities, jobs, chores, and family obligations. They also have to deal with the stress of trying to maintain a social life.
There are some negative stereotypes about teenagers, such as being lazy, disrespectful, and rebellious. However, not everyone agrees with these stereotypes. Some people believe that teenagers are actually hard-working and ambitious. They also point out that teenagers have a lot of homework and other responsibilities, so it's not surprising that they need to use their cell phones a lot.
Teenagers today have a lot of challenges, but they also have a lot of opportunities. They can take their work on the go with them and do their homework wherever they are. They can also use their cell phones to connect with friends and family.
In the future, it's likely that the stereotype of teenagers will change. However, one thing is for sure, teenagers will continue to prove that they are capable of great things."

One weekend, I joined the club to release a high-altitude balloon. We inflated the balloon and watched it rise into the sky. We also watched shooting stars. After the launch, some of the students stayed to watch the stars. They lay on blankets on the mountainside and gazed at the sky.
It took us a long time to find the lunch box. It was in a canyon, high on a flat rock, in the middle of a cascading waterfall. The camera hadn't recorded any shooting stars. But it was still a great adventure."

Chloe Morgan loves science, especially Palaeontology. She started to be interested in the subject when she was fifteen. It happened by chance when her younger brother was going through the dinosaur phase. Chloe was reluctant to help at first, but she ended up lending him a hand with a science project. She also found an article about recent discoveries in Palaeontology that blew her mind. She knew that this was something she wanted to commit herself to.
Paleontology is not a common career choice for young people, but Chloe was determined to make it her dream. She met her first professional palaeontologist, Matt Cornelius, who was famous already. He was approachable and easy-going, and he showed her a lot of patience.
Dinosaurs continue to fascinate us because they speak to the innate explorer in all of us. They are mysterious and unknown, and they offer the promise of discovery. Palaeontology is a great form of time travel."

When you travel by car with your family, even when you're young, you probably know that you're not 'there yet,' even when you ask over and over 'Are we there yet?' It's not 'there' anymore once you get there. It's 'here'. If you really think there's a chance that you're 'there' yet, you should be asking 'Are we here yet?'. And I'm sure there's no one who wishes they were 'there yet' more than the mums and dads fielding that question over and over every single long car trip.
When you travel by car, you can have a lot of fun. You can watch DVDs, listen to music, and play puzzles. You can also act as co-pilot and help your parents keep the car running smoothly. But sometimes, things can go wrong. For example, your brother or sister might put their foot on your side of the seat or hurl their whole body over into your space. If this happens, you might get angry and start fighting. But don't worry, your parents will probably be there to help you calm down.
Over the years, your dad has developed some strategies for dealing with kids on the back seat. One of his strategies is to say, 'Yup. We're here. Get out of the car.' This usually keeps everyone quiet for a while. You know that you're finally 'there' when you see the grown-ups tumble out of the car and go as far away as they can from the kids."

John and Zuzi Morgan have a café in Oxford, UK, where people can enjoy coffee, cake, and play board games. They decided to turn their love of tabletop games into a full-time business because there is so much technology and people are busy on their mobile phones and gadgets. The games that are played in their café are called Eurogames. They are known for their gentle themes and easy rules.
One of the most successful Eurogames is Pandemic. It was created by Matt Leacock, a North American designer. He was inspired by a Eurogame called Lord of the Rings. Pandemic is a cooperative game where players work together to solve global problems.
The growth of the video games industry has also helped to the success of Eurogames. Video games have become more popular than ever before, and this has led to more people being open to playing board games. As a result, tabletop gaming has become more popular than ever before."

I work at a university in the US. My team and I are learning more about water birds, especially one called the American black duck. We have started using a new piece of equipment called a night-vision scope, which allows us to see the ducks in the dark. We are worried about black ducks because their numbers have fallen hugely. We don’t know whether there’s enough food on the east coast for these animals. We have lots of information about their daytime activities, but nothing about what they do at night, because we simply haven’t had the equipment. But this new ‘scope’ will produce really clear pictures, even on moonless nights, so we’ll be able to find out more and make better decisions about looking after the area where they live based on what we learn. It is hard work. There are four of us, each working six hours daily. We have studied ducks in different locations, and I have had to take a boat to some sites and make notes on every duck I see. The weather hasn’t helped – some nights are mild, but more often it’s wet. Oh, and it’s so quiet I’ve needed lots of coffee to stop me falling asleep! We’ve only missed one working day so far, because the snow was too deep even for our special snow vehicles. Still I like the challenge of it, especially compared to what the summer will bring – hours in a laboratory, where we’ll look at our results together. It’ll be hard to be stuck inside – but it’s essential to do this. And I wouldn’t change it for anything!"

Have you ever wondered what it's like to perform in a circus? Sophia Grayson is from Circus Experience, a centre that teaches young people circus skills. She says her course is popular because it includes many skills, such as juggling, throwing and catching things, trapeze, which involves flying through the air, and other fun activities. On the year-long course, students gradually increase the amount of risk they take in each class and parents come along to certain classes to watch progress.
To be successful in the circus, you must keep practising and be fit. You also need to have imagination and never stop improving your skills. Being fit is really important for circus artists, like athletes, who train daily to keep strong. Training is very important, but the best performers are those who want success, have imagination and never stop improving skills.
The course also covers business planning. Many previous students set up businesses all over the world, and are happy to share their experiences. However, Sophia warns, it's not a profession for making money. ""The work typically means not having a regular salary. It's also competitive - but great fun!"""

It took me a while to agree, but a few weeks later, I found myself playing against a team from another school. My parents came to watch, but it made me more nervous. But it was OK in the end. I practised every day and did really well. I joined an adult team before I moved abroad to a special sports academy in the USA when I was fifteen. The coach there trains Olympic basketball players, and it was fantastic to work with him. However, I can’t say I enjoyed my first experience of living far from my parents. At home, I’d never been able to spend much time with my friends due to all the training, so that wasn’t such a change for me. I got used to my new life in the end, though, and my English improved quickly too! I turned professional at the age of eighteen, three years after arriving in the USA. I was taller than most players in the professional league, but I was much too light for my height, so had to get that right first. I joined a team and have never regretted it."

I like to choose flowers that are perfect for the customer’s order. Sometimes it’s not easy to find the right flowers, but I try to get the best possible price.
Back at the shop, I look at customer orders and set up vases with the flowers I’ve bought. Then I create bunches of flowers and work out how much the order will cost. Customers are often surprised by how expensive their orders are. Sometimes I have to ask them to think again about what they’d like.

My city has a modern cinema that shows all the latest films I want to see, and there are also lots of films for kids at the weekends. It’s close to where I live, but a year ago, I realized something was missing – the experience of discussing a film in detail with a group of people after watching it with them. So, together with two friends, I started a film club. We decided that we didn’t want to hire a cinema to show the films. Instead, we choose a different location in the city each month. For example, we rented an old factory to show a film that was set in Antarctica. It was very cold, and this created the perfect atmosphere for the film, which was brilliant! Some places we use are even free, as the owners make money by selling snacks during the film. We’re happy to make enough to cover our costs – we’re not trying to make a profit. Each time we show a film, everything is a bit easier for us. We also know how many tickets we’ve sold because everything’s online. There’s still always plenty to do, but when people of all ages come up at the end to say what a great experience they’ve had, it’s wonderful. We’ve started a blog, too, because we know that most people now go online for information about films, rather than read reviews in local papers. We’ve also tried putting up a few posters in cafés. Nothing’s as successful as word of mouth, though – people recommending us to their friends."

Taking photographs was always my favorite activity when I was a child. When I was 15, I knew that if I wanted to take my hobby to the next level, I had to do something special. So I decided to start a personal project: I would take one photograph every day for a whole year of my life. Many other young photographers had done the same thing before me, but it seemed like a really great idea to me. After a few weeks, I put my photos on a website for young photographers. I was surprised to find that there were others who liked the way I saw and photographed things. I was also enjoying photographing a wide range of subjects. Someone suggested that if my photographs all had a common topic or idea to connect them, my project would be even better. So I began to concentrate more on taking photos of nature scenes, especially of birds and the sky. A lot of them were black and white photographs, which was different to what many other young photographers were doing. Sometimes I had doubts about my project, and I almost gave up several times. But I trusted my own feelings and became more confident about my photographic style and choices. One day I showed my project to my art teacher at school. She told me about a national photography competition for people my age. So I entered some of my photos, just for fun. I’ll never forget the moment when the judges told me that I had won first prize. It was the first time I realised that maybe my photography really was good, and that I might actually be able to work as a professional photographer. Now I have my own photography studio and I’ve never regretted my career choice."

Last year, I joined the National Youth Challenge (NYC) because I wanted to learn new skills and have new experiences. In the NYC, you can do many different activities to challenge yourself and learn new things. There are different levels, from beginner to advanced, run by adult volunteers called 'leaders'. When you complete each level, you get a certificate.
When I first joined, my leader suggested that my first challenge should be helping to organise activities at a local children’s club for two hours a week. I was a bit nervous at first, but I decided to take up the challenge. Soon, I was spending all my free time at the children’s club. I made a lot of new friends and I also learned new skills, such as public speaking and communication.
Now I’m at the children’s club for about four hours a week. I always really look forward to going. I’ve also decided that when I finish school, I want to go to college to become a youth worker. I never thought about my future job before, but the idea of youth work has entered my mind. This has been my favourite part of the NYC so far and I’ve improved my own communication skills while at the same time helping others."

I was born in Denver, USA. When I was eight years old, my Dad took me to a resort in the mountains, about two hours from Denver. The hill was very steep, so my dad had to do a lot of persuading to get me on a board. I was so young, I hadn’t even thought of asking him if I could start snowboarding, but he was already into it and wanted me to love it too. I managed to do well. After this experience, I started to love snowboarding and improve my ability. I started competing aged ten. I enjoy taking part in competitions and winning too. I also get to spend lots of time with my friends. It’s the best way of dealing with not being able to do what I love so much. I have to think carefully about my future. Snowboarding is such a huge part of my life now, but I also feel it’s important to have something else I can do, just in case I don’t succeed as a professional snowboarder or if I get injured."

When I was fifteen, I wanted everything my friends had. I didn't plan ahead, like what I wanted to do when I left school. One day, my best friend got a new phone and I thought I should have one too. My parents said I could only have it if I paid for it myself, so I decided to work part-time and save as much as I could. It was a valuable lesson. I worked every Saturday in a café, but I didn't really enjoy it. My parents suggested starting my own little business instead. I asked my mum if I could have a go at making necklaces. It was easy to learn. I sold my first items of jewellery to my friends and family. They were delighted with them, but I still needed convincing that they looked good enough to be popular with the public. There was only one way to find out, so I rented a market stall with my mum. Lots of people bought my things. Soon we were receiving calls from all over the country from people looking to buy more. It was a big success. Since then, I've made thousands of pounds through my business, mostly online. It's been such a lot of fun so far."

When Janine Stuart was young, she wrote a novel called Being Amelia which became popular. The book is based on Janine’s life. In one interview, Janine said that because of her family’s moving around a lot, she became good at making new friends. She also understood what it was like to be the only new student in a class. The book has funny parts about Amelia’s home life, particularly her relationship with her older brother. Janine started her novel one summer when she was feeling bored at home. She had a dream of becoming a published author, and she wrote a lot. When Janine finished her novel, people were excited to read it. They loved it, and a year later, Janine’s novel was on sale in bookshops. The book has a lot of happy teenagers on the cover, but the people in the story actually face some difficult challenges. This is what makes the book interesting. Janine is still getting used to being famous. She says that she would like to give advice to other young writers, but they have to find what works for them."

My name is Tom. I am fifteen years old. Three years ago, my family and I moved to a castle on a small island. My dad was invited to be the manager of the castle. He works for an organisation that looks after historical buildings. It was a long time before the rest of us agreed Dad should take the job. But once we moved, we quickly got used to island life. The castle isn’t very beautiful, but our apartment is comfortable. The island feels very sociable in the summer, and there are often parties on the beach. In the winter, there are not as many people living on the island. But the adults all support each other and help with repairs on the island. The biggest change for me was travelling by boat every day. I was looking forward to going on stormy days, but the ferries don’t run then. And I’ve discovered that if I miss the bus to the harbour after school, I also miss the last ferry home. So I always tell my schoolmates to hurry up when they come home to stay with me."

I live in a beautiful house in Scotland, surrounded by nature. I love animals and birds, and I started a new hobby called birdwatching six years ago. I went to the mountains in northern Scotland with my family, where we saw lots of birds. I spent hours watching them with my parents, who taught me how to tell the difference between species and how to find the best places to see them. It was amazing, and I joined a local club for young birdwatchers. My goal is to see 200 different bird species, and I’m close to achieving that. I’ve been to many places to see birds, including Egypt and South America. I also posted a video online about my challenge, and many people enjoyed it. I might even do another one next year. I’m lucky to live in the countryside, and I think everyone should connect with nature, regardless of their age or financial resources."

I started playing football when I was 7. I would rush home from school to play with other boys and girls. I loved it, and I was good at it. But my family thought that I would drop out like I had with other hobbies. But it never happened. I was already dreaming of playing football professionally when I was older. And the opportunity came sooner than I’d hoped. I played in local tournaments, and one of the referees noticed that I was a promising player. He asked the manager of a professional women’s club to watch me play. After that, she asked me to join her club. I started regular training with a big club as a young 13-year-old. I improved enormously. But people still weren’t sure I’d ever be a star player, which made me feel a bit upset. But my coach encouraged me to just be myself, and believe in myself. He even let me play in one of the club’s championship matches, much earlier than I’d expected. I ran so hard in that match, I didn’t want the other players to blame me for losing. And I got the winning goal. Since then, I’ve scored lots more winning goals. And next month, my coach and I are running a football tournament in my area. The aim is to get teenagers interested in football, and to have a chance to chat to other players in my club."

One of the most interesting things happening in higher education in the UK and around the world is that students are being encouraged to do research earlier in their studies. This means that research is not just for famous scholars or scientists. It can also be done by everyone.
There are different ways to do research. You can do it by reading books, articles, and websites. You can also do it by talking to people and asking questions. If you are a student, you can make a contribution to knowledge by making your own research. You can do this by asking questions, finding answers, and sharing your findings with others.
Critical thinking is an important part of research. It means that you need to be able to think about what you read and hear, test it out, and judge whether it is logical and reasonable. You also need to be able to identify whether the information you are being given is presented in such a way as to trick you into agreement, or whether it is logical, reasoned and backed by evidence."

Cities have been centers of intellectual life since the 18th century. They have also been places where people have faced challenges. For example, the same cafes in London that stimulated discussion also spread cholera. The modern city is a place of creativity, but it is also a place where people feel overwhelmed. Scientists have begun to study how the city affects the brain, and the results are concerning. They have found that cities actually dull our thinking, sometimes dramatically so. One of the main reasons for this is the lack of nature in cities. Studies have shown that people who can see trees from their windows recover more quickly from illness. Even small glimpses of nature improve brain performance.
In addition to the lack of nature, cities also have a lot of other challenges. For example, they are full of distractions and require us to constantly redirect our attention. This can be tiring and can lead to problems with concentration and memory. However, there are ways to mitigate the psychological damage of the metropolis. For example, people can spend time in parks or other natural settings. This can help to relax the mind and improve brain function."

The mind is a complex thing that takes place inside people's heads. We have neuroimaging techniques to prove it. But the study of the mind should not stop at the skin or the skull. There is evidence that things and neurons participate in human cognitive life. Stone objects, body ornaments, engravings, clay tokens and writing systems play an active role in human evolution and the making of the human mind.
The mind and the brain are often equated. Most of what we know about the human mind has been uncovered through isolating people from the material culture they are usually surrounded by in order to study them. But it often goes unnoticed that much of our thinking takes place outside our heads.
My approach sees the human mind as an unfinished project, in a permanent state of on-going evolution. It is important to keep in mind that whatever actual form the 'stick' might have taken in the history of our species, its primary function was that of a pathway instead of a boundary. Through the 'stick', the human species feels, discovers, and makes sense of the environment, but also enacts the way forward."

Photography has had a significant impact on the United States. It became part of US culture at every level, from the practical and scientific, to the industrial, to the aesthetic. Photography has also been a major source of amusement and entertainment. Historians say that photography is arguably the country’s greatest single contribution to the visual arts.
Photography has been widely used in the US since the mid-19th century. It was a popular way to capture memories and share them with others. Photography also became a way to document events and record history.
The camera is a powerful tool that can be used to represent the self and family. It is also a way to create and sustain an impression of self and family. Photographs are records of events, of people, and of things. They embody a certain objectivity and subjectivity."

In 1890, William James, an American philosopher and physician, defined psychology as the 'science of mental life.' This definition is still a good starting point for understanding psychology today. We all have a mental life, so we have some idea about what this means. However, even though the concept can be studied in rats and monkeys as well as humans, it remains a somewhat elusive one.
Psychology is about the mind or brain, but psychologists do not understand nearly enough about its workings to be able to comprehend the part that it plays in the experience and expression of our hopes, fears, and wishes, or in our behaviour during experiences as varied as giving birth or watching a football match.
The endeavour of psychology is much like that involved in solving a crossword puzzle. It involves evaluating and interpreting available clues. Complex interactions are the norm rather than the exception in psychology, and understanding them depends on the development of sophisticated techniques and theories.
Psychology has the same goals as any other science: to describe, understand, predict, and learn how to control or modify the process that it studies. Once these goals have been achieved, it can help us to understand the nature of our experience and come to conclusions that can be applied directly to people’s lives."

In a storehouse in a business park in Michigan, USA, there is a museum of failed products. The museum has a collection of products that were not successful. The proprietor of the museum, Carol Sherry, sees each product as embodying its own sad story. The museum is a viable, profit-making business. It is a testament to the fact that most products fail.
The museum was started by a man named Robert McMath. McMath intended to accumulate a reference library of consumer products. He started purchasing a sample of every new item he could find. Over time, McMath's collection came to consist overwhelmingly of unsuccessful products.
The culture of optimism in today's society may be responsible for the goods lining the museum's shelves. People often have a positive outlook on life, even when things are not going well. This obsession with optimism can be seen in the self-help field.
Psychologists have studied the effects of positive thinking on motivation and achievement. Their results show that spending time thinking about how well things could go actually depletes most people's motivation to achieve their goals."

Everyone knows that sports teams have an advantage when they play at home. But does anyone know why? Most of us probably think we do; after all, it seems obvious. But professional sport is changing faster than at any time in its history and much of what we used to take for granted is now open to question.
There are two main reasons why home advantage exists. First, the home team has the advantage of playing in front of their own crowd. The crowd can generate a lot of noise and energy, which can help the home team to perform better. Second, the home team has the advantage of being familiar with their own environment. They know the stadium, the locker rooms, and the practice facilities. This can give the home team an edge in terms of performance and concentration.
However, there are some changes that have recently occurred that have made home advantage less effective. For example, travel has become much easier, so players are no longer as tired when they travel to away games. Additionally, modern-day stadiums are more similar to each other, so there is less difference in the playing conditions between home and away games.
Despite these changes, home advantage still exists. There are a number of factors that can contribute to home advantage, including the team's spirit, the players' testosterone levels, and the crowd's energy."

The more I practice, the luckier I get, said Gary Player. This quote is famous and is valued by athletes and coaches. However, there are some arguments about who said it first and what it really means. Player didn’t literally mean lucky, he was speaking ironically. He meant that the more you practice, the better you get. Up to a point. Where that point is, is at the heart of the nature-nurture debate. The debate is about whether talent is born or acquired. But it is not a balanced debate. It is more like a basketball game between giants and dwarves. Nurture has been victorious. The theory that expertise in any field can be attained with 10,000 hours’ practice is true. But it is not always the case. There are other factors that can influence success, such as genes, environment, and opportunity."

A recent report found that many children living in wealthy countries feel lonely and unhappy. The reason for this is because they have been spending too much time indoors and not enough time outside. In her book, Kith, Jay Griffiths argues that this is the main problem. She says that children need to be able to roam freely and explore the natural world. A follow-up study found that many children would be happier if they could go outside more. Many adults also talk nostalgically about the freedom of their own youth. They say that they spent long summer days playing outside and that they would be happier if their children could do the same. However, there are some risks associated with spending too much time outside, such as the risk of injury. Griffiths believes that children need to be allowed to take risks in order to learn how to manage them."

I am a researcher who has a lot of school and I am good at solving problems. But I don't think that my schooling has much to do with my ability to solve problems. Most problems in life can't be solved with a formula or memorized answers. They require the judgement, wisdom and creative ability that come from life experiences.
For children, those experiences are embedded in play. Play is the natural means by which adults and mammals have always educated themselves. It is also important for children to learn social skills, fairness and morality.
There has been a lot of change in the way children play. In the past, children used to have more time to play unsupervised in their neighbourhoods. Now, adults are more likely to intervene and adults-directed sports have replaced impromptu games. These changes have been caused by a number of factors, including parents' fears, the rise of experts warning us about dangers, and the decline of cohesive neighbourhoods.
If we care about our children and future generations, we must reverse the horrid trend that has been occurring over the past half century. We must give childhood back to children. Children must be allowed to follow their inborn drives to play and explore, so that they can grow into intellectually, socially, emotionally and physically strong adults fit for an unpredictable future."

In many countries, there are a lot of young people in their twenties who use social media to find work. There are two popular social networking sites that are often used for job hunting: Twitter and LinkedIn. These sites give people the chance to connect directly with potential employers. However, with greater access to social media comes a greater chance to make mistakes.
For example, there was a young jobseeker in the US who contacted a senior marketing executive via LinkedIn. The marketing executive was not impressed by the young jobseeker's message and sent a rude rejection note. This note has since gone viral. It is a warning to young people about how to use social media for job hunting.
If you are a young person who is looking for a job, there are a few things you should keep in mind. First, you need to be clear and concise in your message. Second, you need to keep the tone humble. Third, you need to be patient and persistent. If you follow these tips, you will be more likely to get a positive response from potential employers."

Newspapers have been struggling in recent years. Their circulation has fallen and they are no longer the main source of news for most people in the US.

If humans were truly at home under the light of the moon and stars, we would go in darkness happily. Instead, we are creatures who are adapted to living in the sun’s light. We have engineered the night to receive us by filling it with light. This kind of control has some negative effects called light pollution.
Light pollution is mostly caused by bad lighting design. It washes out the darkness of night and alters light levels and light rhythms. It affects many aspects of life, including migration, reproduction, and feeding.

The founder said that employees can take as much leave as they want, as long as they feel comfortable that their work can be completed on time. However, there are some problems with this policy. First, it is difficult to be sure whether or not your work will be completed on time. Second, it can lead to pressure from colleagues and office gossip.

Journal-based peer review is a process that ensures the quality of scientific research papers. It is often praised for preventing the publication of flawed or nonsensical papers. However, there are some concerns about the effectiveness of peer review. For example, it can delay the publication of a paper by up to a year. Preprints are a new way to share research papers that have not been peer-reviewed. They bring academics back to the original purpose of research publication: the rapid dissemination of new results. Preprints also make it easier for people to critique and discuss papers. They could also become an effective outlet for negative results."

When I teach literature, students often answer that a poem is like a painting in words. Their answers usually don't satisfy me or them. One day, I asked students to choose an object and write one paragraph describing it empirically and another in the first person, from the point of view of the item itself.
One student wrote about an oxygen mask. The mask is a device that helps people breathe. It's only used in emergencies and even then only for a limited time. Most people will never have to use it. The exercise led to much amusement and discussion.
Poetry can be difficult to understand at school. I used to see every poem as a puzzle that got in the way of true understanding and feeling. After school, poetry is something that grabs me less and less. Sometimes you see one, and it announces itself by what it is not: continuous prose. It practically dares you to read it, which you do, and too often feel disappointed by its blandness, or because it baffles initial comprehension.
But poems can also be a source of deep feelings, stunning images, and tender reflections. They can also be used to express biting wit. If you want to find out more about poems, you can read articles or watch videos online. You can also read poems in books or magazines."

Sleeping is one of my favorite travel experiences, but I don't talk about it very much because I feel a little guilty. When friends share details of their well-planned trips, I smile and don't say much. What would they think if they knew that my own travel itineraries include naps and lazy mornings. Better sleep is one of travel's happy side effects. When I visited Mexico's Yucatán coast, I was surprised by how many hours I spent sleeping. There were lots of noisy birds, but it didn't matter. Surrounded by strange smells and sounds, I could plunge into a sleep that was more profound and dream-filled than I imagined possible. Sleep is something else too: it's an experience that changes rhythm, sometimes dramatically, from place to place. People obsess about jet lag, but I suspect that the difficulties I experience recovering from long journeys have more to do with local and cultural adjustment than time zones. When I finally fall into the local sleep pattern, I feel I have truly arrived."

Doug Allan is a wildlife cameraman who films wild animals in cold places. If you have ever been amazed by footage of polar bears in a nature documentary, it's probably been filmed by him. Allan was born in a cold place and he loves to spend time in cold places. He trained as a marine biologist and commercial diver. Diving was his first passion, where he learned about survival in cold places.
One day, Allan was working in Antarctica when he was asked to film a wildlife documentary. He ended up taking the crew to different places and after 48 hours, he realized that being a wildlife cameraman ticked all the boxes: travel, adventure, and underwater.
Allan has worked on many major TV wildlife series. He says that his value is field experience in cold conditions. He has a feel for it and he has spent a lot of time on sea ice.
Wildlife filming is full of great successes, but also failures and embarrassments. Once, Allan was in the Orkneys to film kittiwakes. Unfortunately, he could not identify which birds they were.
Now Allan would like to make his own film about climate change in the Arctic. He says he would be able to make an extraordinary documentary."

He also made it to the South Pole the same year. Now he is back in the Arctic preparing for an expedition he says is even more ambitious.
Pen is a strong and determined person. He has a lot of physical endurance and he is also very organized. He is going to set out on a three-month, 1,000 kilometer trek to the North Pole.

Last year, I went to the Arctic Circle in Finland to work with huskies. I was 26 and I was feeling restless. I found a small company run by Anna and Pasi, and they agreed to take me on as a husky dog handler. From December to February, there is plenty of business taking tourists out on sled rides. The dogs are almost hysterical with excitement, straining against the ropes in their desperation to be off. I was able to join the team for three months. The work is very physical and the hours are long. But I am triumphant. I can chop with an axe, hammer a nail, and use a circular saw. 'In the snow.'"

On that day, Radcliffe ran very fast and won the race. The press was there to see her run. They said that her time would qualify her to compete in the men's marathon at the world championships in Paris. Journalists asked her about a natural treatment called emu oil. Cathy Freeman had recommended it to heal her wounds. Radcliffe says that she feels like she achieved her goal that day. She was very proud of her accomplishment. During the race, her husband and coach, Gary Lough, was in a car with her support team. They were listening to the radio coverage. With 800m left to run, Radcliffe began to calculate. She knew that if she crossed the line in less than three minutes, she could finish in under 2 hours 16 minutes. She ran very fast and finished the race in 2 hours 16 minutes and 25 seconds. Many people were surprised by her time. After the race, everyone wanted to know how she had done it. But Radcliffe was not proud of her time. She was proud of her accomplishment. She knew that she had achieved her goal that day."

When I first started my cooking programme, I was not sure how people would react to it. There had been a lot of talk about the food revolution in Britain, and I was certain that we had created a series of programmes that made a genuinely innovative contribution to that. I watched the first programme and was relieved that it was well-received. The success of the show led to many other interesting projects, including a book based on my experiences at the restaurant I own. In each project, there is a sense of adventure, whether it's into the past, into the mind, or into cookery techniques. I wrote several books in a series called 'Perfection', each one accompanying its own TV programme of the same name. In these books, the journey was often physical, with passports and suitcases and itineraries. The latest book in the series is called 'In Search of Total Perfection'. It takes you on a journey around the world to meet extraordinary artisans. These people have spent years pursuing their own ideals of perfection. Perfection is subjective. Even the simple task of choosing which dishes to include in the series turned out to be a challenge. But I knew I had to include something for everyone. After a lot of discussion, we finally came up with a list of dishes that everyone could enjoy. This reinforced my opinion that each of us has our own idea of what constitutes perfection."

We were driving to Marrakech, but the van broke down and crashed into a field. John got out and opened the hood to look at the engine. He stood there for a long time, looking at the engine with his hands in his pockets. I was worried about him, so I repeated, ""No, we can't stay here forever."" The field was big and there was nothing in it except grass and flowers. We sat on the side of the road and waited for Mum and John to stop laughing. We watched John go away and Mum stretched out on the grass. She asked me to tell her a story. I told her about the birds I heard in London. The tea was very sweet and we stayed at the café all day. When it began to grow dark, Mum made an open-air bed for us in the hotel garden. We slept well that night. The next day, we followed John into the hotel. It was expensive, but Mum reassured him that they would have tea. We stayed at the café all day and watched John squint dismally into the engine. At night, we drove the van to the hotel. We watched our van being towed into Marrakech. I was worried about how we would get home again. I thought it might be easier if we could take a boat straight to London. Then I must have fallen asleep."

Lucy was talking to two other pianists at the Prague Classical Music Festival. They were older than her and good enough English speakers. They talked about the pieces they were playing, where else they’d travelled recently, and where they were going next.
Lucy had not wanted to go to the festival, but she had made it. Her dad bought her a white-gold necklace with an L pendant to congratulate her. Her little brother Gus was excited about the festival. Grace Chang, her teacher, took Lucy out for a special dinner to strategize a repertoire.
In the elevator to their suite after the party, her grandfather turned to her. ‘You did well in there, Lucy. I’m proud of you. This is an important festival, and there’s a buzz about you. They all know who you are.’"

Your dad might be right. Spending too much time online can be bad for you. But it can also have some benefits. Generally, research shows that teenagers who use social media have a lot of friends, a good sense of identity and belonging, and are developing the skills they need to be successful in the digital age.
There are a few things that you can do with social media that can help you develop your skills and identity. You can post notices about your favorite music or sports, discover what you enjoy, and connect with others who have similar interests. You can also use social media to collaborate with others to create content and share it with the world.
If you're not outgoing or have a specialized interest, social media can be a great way to connect with others. You can join groups of like-minded people, share your interests, and learn new skills. You can also use social media to build your brand awareness and increase your employability."

When most people think of a family vacation, I guess a road trip through the western states in the US and Canada doesn’t come to mind. However, my parents planned a special vacation this year. They wanted to have a family bonding trip. They said, ""Not enough people do this anymore."" I was excited, but I was also worried about my privacy. We packed a lot of things into the car, including suitcases, coolers, and clothes. We set off on our journey.
We traveled west and stopped at a town in Oklahoma. The sky was very dark and there was a lot of dust. We learned that cattle get the right-of-way. We continued our journey and stopped at a mountain town in Colorado. It was very smelly and there were a lot of tourists. We also learned that Jeep roads are best left to Jeep drivers. We drove on and saw many interesting things, including wind farms and bears.
Our trip was over and I was sad to be home. But I was also happy that I had a lot of new memories. I took a lot of pictures to document our journey. I knew that I would never forget this trip."

Rose Frost was sixteen years old and was going to live with her grandmother, Daisy. Her family was separating for two years. Her father had an assignment overseas, and her mother would be joining him, but Rose and her sister Amy were staying in England. Amy was finishing her final school courses and was going to live in a college with her own kitchen and study area. It was her last year at school, so it would have been unfair on Amy to move.
Rose was excited about living with her grandmother. There would be lots of dinner invitations, coffee requests, and shopping trips. Her grandmother was not the typical frail old lady figure. She was a social go-getter and had an uncanny knack of bringing people together.
Rose was sensible and very mature for her age. She knew about healthy eating, about keeping fit, and getting enough sleep. But this time Rose had insisted on one thing: she wanted her independence. She wanted to play music loud if she wanted, and to invite friends over or go out without having to ask permission every time.
Rose was going to start a new school and meet new friends. It was her fourth senior school in five years, so she felt like a veteran at it now. For Rose, it was a new moment in time, a new glass shard in the mosaic that was her life."

My name is Charlotte Grainger. My primary school teacher first thought that I might write a novel. I thought that writing a book would be a big achievement and I didn't know what other teenagers were doing. When I turned 13, I decided to attempt writing a novel. The novel I started then is about to be published. It's a big achievement. The story is well-written and action-packed. Nothing about it, except the age of the heroine, suggests that it was written by a teenager.
I was surprised to see a teenager sitting in the office of my publishers. But I knew that I was going to interview a 15-year-old girl about her book. The book is a huge achievement. It's well-written and action-packed. I was impressed by Charlotte's intelligence and her determination. She is a spirited and alert young girl.
Charlotte acknowledges the limitations of her youth. She says that she was trying to ask big questions, not answer them. She also says that she doesn't think her understanding of the world is limited by her age. She was just interested in exploring the theme of taking responsibility.
Charlotte has a theory about teenagers and the way they are 'betrayed' by the fiction that is specifically aimed at them. She says that there are three types of teenager depicted in novels. There's the outsider who becomes acceptable to society, the naïve teenager who knows nothing about the big wide world, and the awkward teenage character who isn’t socially skilled. She says that it's not fair that writers sometimes write stories that make teenagers feel inadequate."

Our instructor, Gareth, told us that speed is our friend, not our enemy. We looked down the ski slope and felt nervous. One guy, David, had some experience and pushed forward, skiing off down the slope towards the jump. He hit the ramp fast and flew upwards, arms flailing in the air. Something was wrong and we held our breath. He hit the ground and flipped head-first into the snow. Gareth informed us that speed is an unpredictable beast. I didn’t feel I was cut out for this freestyle stuff. I had enjoyed messing about on previous skiing holidays, but I knew I wasn’t one of those teenagers who spent their time doing freestyle tricks on ramps and half pipes. I was afraid of being ridiculed. My parents decided to have a winter holiday at a training centre for freestyle skiing in the US. There was a huge indoor facility near the slopes, with trampolines and ski jumps covered in artificial snow. Students practised their moves indoors and then headed outside to try them for real. I struggled to convince my body to ignore what my brain was saying and race straight towards the jump. But finally, I managed to land properly. I felt like I was walking on air."

Imagine you're riding a rollercoaster in an amusement park. You come to a stop and take a deep breath. Then, the rollercoaster starts to move quickly and turns sharply. Your stomach feels like it's in the air. You feel scared and excited at the same time.
Amusement parks are a big industry. They have rides that can take you upside down and make you feel like you're flying. To create these rides, there are teams of engineers and designers. They work hard to make sure that the rides are safe and exciting.
The teams behind rollercoaster design must piece together a strong narrative, be it a space adventure or a high-paced chase in the jungle, that works with any innovations to create a seamless experience. However, in the end, gut instincts, years of experience and trial-and-error are what work."

At 25, Miranda Ellington has accomplished a lot as a choreographer. She creates works for many theatres and dance companies. She also still dances from time to time. It's surprising to her that she can fit both activities into her busy schedule.
As a choreographer, Miranda is like a teacher. She enjoys working with young students. She finds it easier to work with students than professionals because they are open to trying new ideas and are hungry for success.
When Miranda starts working with a new group, she focuses on the dance steps and the music dictates what she does. If the dancers aren't responding well to a particular composer's music, that can be frustrating, but she still has to find solutions.
Miranda doesn't like to be attached to one institution. She feels it's valuable to keep establishing contacts with new people. She has to be prepared to adapt the way she works each time she goes somewhere new.
The conversation turns to the recent documentary on professional ballet dancers and choreographers. Miranda says that the documentary does a good job of giving viewers an accurate portrayal of life inside a dance company. She also says that the amount of work and dedication involved in ballet is underestimated by the public."

A friend asked me why I travel when I can see everything on television. I agreed that you can see amazing things on TV, but why sit at home when there’s so much to experience out there. I guess that conversation gave me the idea for my crazy trip. I made a film that aimed to get people to turn off their television sets. My friend was getting rid of his old sofa, which became the star of the film. I fixed the sofa with some wheels and cables and connected it to old seatbelts. I put my luggage on the seats and slept on the sofa each night. Several friends joined me on the trip, helping to pull the sofa along and encouraging me to keep going. It was the longest distance I have ever walked and it was on main roads, which meant I could stop at a roadside café and relax on the sofa with a cappuccino. I got used to telling people, ""No, I’m not doing it for charity, I’m not training for a marathon"". When someone at work asks me about my weekend, I’d rather explain how I dragged a sofa 100 miles across southern England than discuss the latest show on TV. You’ll be able to see the film on my website."

When I read about swimming trips in the sea around some small Greek islands, I was excited. I'd never tried group trips before. My brother was busy, so I decided to join a group holiday. The man at the port was surprised when I asked for a single ticket, but he showed me on board with a smile. Our group had exchanged emails before we set off, but there was little time to chat before our first swim. We did a short swim to split us into speed groups, then it was time for our first proper swim. I was nervous because I'd never swum such a long distance in the sea before. But I managed to complete the distance on my own. The following days followed a routine: jumping in; swimming to a comfortable speed; stopping to admire the scenery. As the swims grew greater in distance, I was able to swim faster and enjoy the scenery more. There seemed little need for the support boat. I can hardly wait to come again next year."

I like being a flight attendant. It's not easy, but it's a great job for young people. I've been to many places, like the US and Australia, and I work with amazing people. I also have a lot of time off. Life is always exciting, which makes it a great job.
When I was a child, I often flew unaccompanied to boarding school. I felt lonely, so I would ask the flight attendants to let me help give out meals to passengers. Sometimes they would let me. I remembered that later, when I was working in the bank and I was feeling unhappy. I decided to change my career and I applied to be a flight attendant. There was a lot of competition, but I was accepted. I was very qualified like the other attendants, and I was changing careers.
When I'm not working, I don't have to take work home. And if I do get difficult passengers, which is rare, I know the flight will soon be over and I'll probably never see them again."

At the summer camp where I work, I like seeing the children succeed at things they never thought they could do. Most of the children know how to swim and play table-tennis, but rock climbing is new for most of them. Some children feel nervous, but after some encouragement they try and they all get to the top. This makes them feel great. We also get children who miss home at the beginning of the week. It's the older children who feel like that the most. We don't let them use their mobile phones all the time. We tell them they can phone home after lunch and after dinner. Most children are fine in a couple of days and at the end of their week's stay, they all come up to us and thank us because they have had a great time."

Rock the Planet, a musical show where actors also have to be good musicians, opened in London last year. The show was voted 'Best Musical' four times in the USA. It was challenging to do the show with an all-British cast of actors because the UK has limits on how many performances young actors can do. Luckily, the director found plenty of talented UK-based actors. The theatre in London is bigger than the US venue, but it's been full every night.
I met 11-year-old Jamie, one of the show’s actors. He said that he gets paid to play and that he was very pleased with himself when he finally got a song right. He also told me about his school lessons and his classmates' reaction to the show.
The show is on in London for another year, and is well worth seeing."
