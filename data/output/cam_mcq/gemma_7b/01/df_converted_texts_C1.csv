Some time ago, there was a website that talked about the risks of public check-ins, which are online announcements of your whereabouts. The website said that when you post something online, it can be seen by a lot of people, even people you don't know. This made people realize that there can be some downsides to sharing so much information online.

The internet has opened up a lot of new opportunities to share your life with the world. You can write a blog, post photos, and share your thoughts with anyone who wants to see them. However, it's important to remember that what you say online can have real-world consequences.

In the early days of the internet, there was a young man named Justin Hall who started a blog. He wrote about his life and shared his photos and art. But one day, his blog was taken down because someone sent the address of his blog to his boss. This showed that even though you can say anything you want online, it doesn't mean that you should.

Another example of the risks of sharing online is the story of Heather Armstrong, a young woman who wrote a blog about her job. One day, an anonymous colleague sent the address of her blog to all the vice presidents at her company. As a result, she lost her job.

So, if you're thinking about sharing something online, it's important to think about the consequences. What you say online can have a real impact on your life.<eos>"

A long time ago, some scientists started a campaign to warn people about a movie called What the Bleep Do We Know. The movie showed that there is a lot about the universe that we don't understand. Even the most experienced scientists admit that they don't have all the answers. Some people felt that the movie was very dangerous and issued warnings about it. The movie was a must-see for everyone, but I couldn't see what all the fuss was about at first. However, when the movie moved on to describe some of the new discoveries, I started to see what the fuss was really about. One of the discoveries was that water molecules can be affected by thoughts. I had heard rumours about this before, but the movie gave me some evidence to support it. The evidence was not very convincing, but it was enough to make me believe that the discovery was real. The movie's claims were not very bizarre, but they were still amazing. They showed me that the universe is far stranger than I could have ever imagined.<eos>"

Writing novels is like planting a forest, while writing short stories is more like planting a garden. The two processes complement each other, creating a complete landscape. Writing novels takes a long time and a lot of commitment, while writing short stories is quicker and easier to complete. You can create a story out of the smallest things and experiment with different ideas. Short stories are like guideposts to your heart, and it makes you happy as a writer to be able to share these intimate feelings with your readers.<eos>"

Science is a powerful force that has both improved and threatened human existence. It has made our lives easier and has also challenged our very existence. Science has its beauty and its dangers, and it has been used for both good and evil.

Science has been used to explain the natural world, from the tiniest particles to the vastness of the universe. It has also been used to develop new technologies and treatments for diseases. However, science has also been used to create weapons and destroy lives.

The history of science is filled with conflict and change. Scientists have constantly been modifying and overthrowing theories. Sometimes, these changes have been minor, but other times they have been major. The struggle between old and new theories has often been bitter and contentious.

Despite its challenges, science continues to progress. It is a field that is constantly evolving and changing. Scientists are always learning new things and developing new theories. Science is a powerful tool that can be used to improve the world, but it is also a dangerous force that can be used to destroy it.<eos>"

From around 2015, major publishers started to report that sales of ebooks had plateaued or even fallen in some cases. This has raised concerns about the future of ebooks in the publishing industry. Some people believe that the rise of ebooks will lead to the demise of print books. However, there is no evidence to support this claim. Digital and print books can coexist comfortably in the market.

The idea of the disappearing book is a powerful one. It evokes feelings of both excitement and fear. It is also a reminder that technology can change things quickly. In the past, many new technologies have been predicted to kill off existing media. But none of these technologies have actually succeeded in doing so.

The spread of the printing press, the shift from silent to sound movies, and the shift from analog to digital photography are all examples of how new technologies have changed the way we consume media. These changes have also led to a new appreciation for older technologies. For example, e-readers have stimulated a new appreciation for the material quality of 'old' books.

The idea of the disappearing book is a powerful narrative that can help us to make sense of change. It is a story that evokes feelings of both excitement and fear. It is also a story that reminds us that technology can change things quickly.<eos>"

Every day, I wake up early, brush my teeth, make coffee, and write about how some of the greatest minds of the past have approached their work. I want to provide a new perspective on their personalities and careers, and to share my own experiences as a writer.

I have a lot of concerns about creative work and earning a living. How do you do meaningful creative work while also earning a living? Is it better to devote yourself wholly to a project or to set aside a small portion of each day? And when there doesn’t seem to be enough time for all you hope to accomplish, must you give things up or can you learn to condense activities, to do more in less time, to ‘work smarter, not harder’, as my dad is always telling me?

I have tried to provide examples of how a variety of brilliant and successful people have confronted similar challenges. I wanted to show how grand creative visions translate to small daily increments; how one’s working habits influence the work itself, and vice versa.

This book is about people’s routines. It’s about the circumstances of creative activity, not the product; it deals with manufacturing rather than meaning. But it’s also, inevitably, personal. I have included my own experiences and challenges as a writer.

I hope you enjoy reading this book. I have tried to make it as clear and easy to understand as possible.<eos>"

Howard became a palaeontologist because he was interested in dinosaurs. He wanted to become a palaeontologist since he was young. He studied delicate creatures revealed on the surface of grey rocks. He finished his doctoral thesis and got a job as an assistant lecturer at Tavistock College in London. He was surprised to find that he got the job, but he was grateful. He often found himself contrasting the orderly nature of his professional life with the anarchy of private concerns. One day, his briefcase was stolen. He was fuming, but he made an explanatory phone call and postponed the lecture. He reported the theft to the appropriate authorities and then went for a restorative coffee. He joined a colleague who was entertaining a visiting curator from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. And thus it was that Howard learned of the recently acquired collection of fossils, as yet uncatalogued and unidentified.<eos>"

Charles Spence is a Professor of Experimental Psychology at Oxford University in the UK. He has studied how the senses interact to form our perception of flavour. Through his studies, he has influenced what we eat and drink. He has also studied how the environment affects taste.

Spence has written a book called The Perfect Meal, which is packed with insights about food and drink. It is a fascinating book for anyone who loves to eat and drink.

Spence's lab is not very high-tech. It has soundproof booths and stacks of ancient-looking audio-visual equipment. He can afford to work more creatively with cooks because he keeps his overheads low.

Spence has been helping famous brands reduce salt and sugar in their products. He says that it is in their interests to help loyal customers stay alive for longer.

Spence has also studied the effects of sound on flavour. He has found that higher-pitched music enhances sweetness, and lower-pitched and brassy sounds make food taste bitter.<eos>"

Our brains are very busy these days. We have a lot of information to deal with, including facts, rumors, and things that are not true. We also do more things ourselves now than we used to. For example, we make our own reservations and find things in shops. We do a lot of different things at once, but it's not multitasking. It's more like spinning plates. When we think we're multitasking, we're actually switching from one task to another very quickly. This can be stressful and make it hard to focus on the task at hand. Multitasking also makes it harder to learn new information and make decisions. It can also cause us to feel overwhelmed and depleted. To make matters worse, lots of multitasking requires decision-making. It turns out that making lots of small decisions takes up a lot of brain resources. We rapidly spiral into a depleted state in which we can end up making truly bad decisions about something important.<eos>"

In a Swedish zoo, there is a chimpanzee named Santino who spends his nights breaking up concrete into pieces. Some people might say that he is being spiteful. In caves in the US, female bats help unrelated fruit bat mothers if they can’t find the right birthing position. Some people might say that they are being caring. Fifty years ago, people thought that animals didn’t have consciousness, feelings or moral systems. But recently that has changed. Thanks to research into the behaviour of bats, chimps, not to mention rats, dolphins and chickens, we now know that animals have emotions. It is a change that has in recent years filtered through the scientific strata to a selection of popular science books. And it has started a debate that may never be solved by science: can animals be said to have consciousness?

The debate about animal consciousness raises a second question: conscience – a person’s moral sense of right and wrong that guides their behaviour. In a recent experiment involving cows that had to open a locked gate in order to get food, it became apparent that those that successfully opened the gate themselves showed more pleasure than those that had to have the gate opened for them. If, as this research seems to imply, cows enjoy problem-solving, what does it mean for the production and consumption of beef? The observations may not be disputed, but the interpretation of them is. Some people believe that the only logically consistent response to the new research is to stop eating meat. Others believe that we should at the very least re-evaluate our view of animal cognition. Still others believe that we should just stop anthropomorphising animals. The three may never be reconciled because the crux of the issue is not so much a scientific disagreement, or even a moral one, but a philosophical one.<eos>"

Critical thinking is a way of understanding things more deeply. It involves interacting with what we read or listen to in a way that helps us to think more deeply. There is a belief that argument is a way of finding the truth. Although technology can help us store and process information, it can also make it more difficult to think critically.

There are a number of things that can contribute to the decline of critical thinking. One is the decline in reading. Reading enhances thinking and engages the imagination in a way that visual media such as video games and television do not. Another is the increase in real-time media. Real-time media do not allow time for reflection, analysis, or imagination.

However, there are also some benefits to technology that can help us to think critically. For example, video games can teach decision-making and analytical skills. Virtual worlds can also give participants freedom to explore ideas and concepts that might otherwise be inaccessible or off limits.

It is important to understand the subtleties of how technology affects thinking and analysis. By understanding these subtleties, we can make sure that we are using technology in a way that helps us to think critically.<eos>"

When Matthew Crawford is not writing or thinking about how we should live, he works as a motorcycle mechanic. He wrote two books about the benefits of manual trades and how to cope with modernity.

Crawford says that our attention is being pulled away by many things, including advertisements, video games, and our phones. He also says that we are more conscious of other things we might be doing.

Crawford's proposed solution has two parts. First, we need regulation of noise and distraction in public space. More importantly, though, Crawford advocates skilled practices as a way of engaging with the world in a more satisfying way.

For example, if you like to cook, you can practice your skills by making a meal for your family and friends. If you like to play hockey, you can practice your skills by playing in a game. If you like to ride motorcycles, you can practice your skills by riding around town.<eos>"

""What do you do for a living?"" is a common question that we often answer in a few words. But if you're a philosopher, it's a little harder to deal with. It's because describing yourself as a philosopher sounds rather pretentious. It's like saying you have access to some mystical truth or enlightenment above your fellows. This is clearly not true. Philosophers are no different from the masses.

However, there is one thing that makes the job of a philosopher a little different. It's the fact that philosophers have established themselves as people who judge the activities of others and celebrate intellectual life. This means that if you're a philosopher, people might expect you to be able to explain your ideas to them in a clear and concise way.

But you don't have to be a philosopher to benefit from philosophy. You can simply look more closely at the everyday experiences that define your life to ensure they deserve their central role. This is called the examined life. It doesn't require the wide reading of philosophical classics or a life dedicated to intellectual reflection. It simply means looking more closely at the everyday experiences that define your life to ensure they deserve their central role.<eos>"

Foodies, gourmands, chefs and others who love food might expect that thinking critically about what and how we eat can contribute to culinary pleasure. However, historically, philosophical discussions about food have been mostly about other topics. When philosophers have talked about eating, it has often been as a metaphor for something else, such as the acquisition of knowledge. Alternatively, some philosophical conversations that appear to be about food actually explore deeper, but loosely connected, points.

The food that we eat is inherently social and cultural. It derives from historical contexts and is shared with those in our communities. Communities provide us with dining companions, as well as the infrastructure through which food is grown and distributed.

There are also ethical issues that attach to food. We can ask what we should eat and why the answers are what they are. And philosophers will always ask why the answers are what they are; engaging in such academic debate is fully justified in relation to food.<eos>"

Rob Daviau is a US designer who creates 'legacy' board games. These games are different from traditional board games because they have a permanent impact on the game. For example, in one game called Risk Legacy, players might have to rip up cards, deface the board, or open packets containing new rules. The games play out over a fixed number of sessions and long-held grudges become woven into the fabric of the game.

Legacy board games were not expected to become popular, but most players love the concept. They see it as one of the biggest advances in game design for several years. The legacy format draws on video games and the demand for episodic entertainment fuelled by popular TV series.

Daviau feels a sense of ownership, but he is also keen to see where others take the idea. He suspects gamers will soon be asking: 'Enough of that, what's new?'<eos>"

Once upon a time, there was an octopus named Inky who lived in a tank at the New Zealand National Aquarium. One night, Inky managed to escape from his tank and swim across the floor to a drain that led to the Pacific Ocean. It was a story that was shared online and was popular among children.

One of the reasons why people find stories like Inky's so interesting is because they involve anthropomorphism, which means treating animals like humans. In the case of octopuses, this pleasure is especially pronounced because of their intelligence and their bodies that are very different from our own.

Scientists have found that animals have many of the same abilities as humans, such as the ability to consider the past and the future, to demonstrate empathy and self-awareness, and to anticipate the motives of others. However, there are some things that humans can do that animals cannot, such as fully-developed language.

It is important to remember that animals are not exactly like humans. They have different strengths and weaknesses. For example, humans can remember a lot of information, but octopuses can remember where they have hidden their food.

Overall, the story of Inky the octopus is a reminder that animals are smarter than we think they are. They have many of the same abilities as humans, and they are capable of learning and adapting to new situations.<eos>"

Once upon a time, there was a technology called robotics that has the potential to change the world. Robots have already been used in the automotive and manufacturing industries for many years. Now, experts are saying that robots will soon be used in many other industries.

One of the main challenges with the widespread use of robots is that it will lead to job loss. However, experts also say that it will create new jobs. For example, there will be more demand for technicians and programmers.

Another challenge is that society is not prepared for the changes that robots will bring. For example, robots will make it easier for people to interact with each other. This could lead to changes in the way we work and socialize.

Despite the challenges, experts believe that robotics has the potential to improve our lives. For example, robots can help us to be more efficient and productive. They can also help us to live longer and healthier lives.

In order to prepare for the robotic workforce of tomorrow, we need to invest in education and training programs. We also need to develop new regulatory frameworks to ensure our safety and privacy.<eos>"

The mountaineer George Mallory said that he climbed Mount Everest because it was there. Many people wonder why people climb mountains. It is possible that the climber’s answer may inspire some to act on their dreams. Climbing can be a very freeing and confining activity. It can also be a very dangerous activity. There are some risks involved in climbing, but climbers who are committed to their goal can overcome these risks. Climbing can also help develop important virtues such as courage, humility and respect for the environment.

When asked why he climbed, US rock climber Joe Fitschen said that a better question would be 'Why do people climb?' He argued that climbing is in our genes and that it is inherent in our basic makeup to take on challenges and test limits. Climbing can also help develop important virtues such as courage, humility and respect for the environment.<eos>"

My grandparents' garden was a beautiful place. It was located on the bank of a river and sloped gently down towards the water. You couldn't reach the river but you could hear the sound of the water and the birds that sang in the trees above. I imagined that all gardens were like this – a place of escape, peace and solitude.

My father was a quiet and withdrawn person. He had a few phrases that he liked to use, one of them being 'It's immaterial to me'. He was probably disappointed that he hadn't made more of his life. He left school without qualifications and became apprenticed to a plumber. Plumbing was not something he was passionate about. It was just what he did.

I always wanted to like the piano but it did its best to intimidate me. The only thing I did like about it were the two brass candlesticks that jutted out from the front. I'd walk along the river bank looking for a suitable spot where I could take off the painful sandals and leave them with my picnic while I ventured out, tentatively, peering through the water for any fish that I could scoop up with the net and take home.

One day my father announced that there was a vacancy for an apprentice gardener in the Parks Department. I thought you might be interested. I like to feel that somewhere deep down inside him, although he hated gardening himself, he'd watched me doing it for long enough and noticed the keenness and the passion for all things that grew and flowered and fruited that hadn't disappeared.<eos>"

When John Maloof bought a box of old photo negatives at an estate auction, he discovered the mystery of Vivian Maier. Maloof was looking for images to use in a book about the history of the Portage Park neighbourhood in Chicago. Instead, he found 30,000 images by Maier, a street photographer with a keen eye for capturing compelling images. Since then, Maloof has amassed an archive of Maier’s life and work. He has a lot of her cameras, film, prints, negatives, movies and audiotapes.

Maier was born in 1926 and spent much of her childhood in France. She returned to New York in 1951 and came to Chicago in 1956 to work as a nanny. Maier was a private person but she had a strong passion for photography. She always had a camera with her and dressed in oversized coats, broad-brimmed hats and stout shoes.

Maier’s work is the purest form of art. None of it was done for any commercial reason. Her images lean toward women, children, the old, the poor, and the abstract. Maloof often wonders if he’ll ever work his way through all the negatives. The funny thing is he had no real interest in photography until he discovered Maier’s work.

Our conversations about the weather are not really about the weather at all. They are a form of ""grooming talk.""

There are certain fixed contexts in which weather-speak is used. It can be used as a simple greeting, as an ice-breaker leading to conversation on other matters, or as a ""default"" or ""filler"" topic when conversation on other matters dries up.<eos>"

After school, Shirley enrolled on a drama course and had some occasional work singing jingles for TV adverts. One day, she was suggested to try out for the part of a rabbit in the soundtrack for a cartoon. Amazingly, she ended up getting a major part.

The competition for work is fierce, and a good showreel is essential. To be successful in this profession, you need to be dogged and persistent. If you are passionate about human sound and voices, and you are willing to put in the work, voiceover work might be the right career for you.<eos>"

People often ask me how I became a cartoonist. It's a dream job that many people have, like being a race car driver. But most people eventually give up on their childish daydreams and consider more realistic professions. To become a cartoonist, you don't need a university degree or much money. You just need your brain, your hand and something that makes a mark. If you feel that doing anything else would be impossible, then cartooning might be the right job for you. But it's not easy. It's a tough job that requires a lot of hard work and dedication. To protect your work, you can draw a little 'c' for 'copyright' and put a circle around the letter.<eos>"

Twenty years ago, I was moving house and had a lot of things to get rid of. I decided to throw away an electric guitar that my dad had bought me for my 16th birthday. I felt sad about throwing it away, but I took it to the rubbish dump and was about to put it on a pile of rubbish. Suddenly, a young man came up to me and asked if I was going to throw it away. I said yes and he asked if he could have it. I gave it to him and felt sad that I had thrown it away.

A few months later, I got an email from someone I didn't know. It was from a dealer and restorer of guitars called Keith Rushton. He said he had my guitar and offered to sell it back to me. I was so happy to get my guitar back and I started playing it again.

I had forgotten all about my dad's habit of putting name-and-address stickers on everything I had, including my guitar. My dad had been very keen for me to learn the classical guitar, but I couldn't make much progress. So I switched to the electric guitar and started playing undemanding stuff.

Now that I'm learning it again, I guess I'll have to form a band. My son's learning the saxophone; maybe I can play with him. Or maybe there are other people of my age who have had a similar experience to mine. Maybe we could call ourselves 'The Regainers'!'<eos>"

There has been a lot of talk about sleep lately. Sleep is very important for our mental, physical, and social well-being. It seems that people who have the hardest time sleeping appreciate how important sleep is the most.

Dreams are important too. They help us find new patterns and create combinations that break through our usual habits of thinking. When we dream, we bring things together in fresh, often surprising ways.

When we wake up from a dream, our brains are still active. We can use our dreams to fuel our thoughts and creativity. Sometimes, even a troubling dream can provide us with new ideas and inspiration.

So, we all need to dream. It is important for our brains to be functioning fully and for us to think creatively and flexibly.<eos>"

It was twenty years ago that Susie Ray left London for a small coastal town in south-west England. She has a studio with a beautiful sea view and hangs photographs of her two daughters on the walls. Susie is a copyist artist who can reproduce the richness of an early-20th-century impressionist masterpiece as easily as the brilliance of a 16th-century Caravaggio portrait.

The problem is that Susie is very popular. She has painted the works of numerous great artists, including Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh. Her reproductions are so faithful that art experts mistake them for the originals.

Susie has always been open about what she does. When she reproduces an old masterpiece, she will make it look as authentic as possible. However, she will put her own signature on the back of the canvas.

When younger painters approach Susie for advice, she stresses the importance of learning to draw and to represent things accurately. She also emphasises how much she’s studied to be able to do what she does.<eos>"

Jordan Romero is 13 years old and wants to be the youngest person to climb Mount Everest. If he succeeds, he could become one of the most famous teenagers of his generation. Young people are spending more time on computers and games consoles, so Jordan hopes to inspire kids to climb their own mountains or venture outdoors. His team includes his father, Paul, and mother, Karen. They call themselves 'Team Romero.' If Jordan can climb Everest and Vinson Massif in Antarctica, he will become the youngest person to have climbed the Seven Summits. Few people achieve this under the age of thirty. Jordan has already climbed five of the Seven Summits and might actually do it before his teenage years are over.

There are some concerns about Jordan's climb. Many people think that it is not a good idea to take a young person up such a dangerous mountain. They worry about whether a teenager would be emotionally strong enough or have enough experience. However, Jordan's parents believe that their own experience as climbers will help them to guide their son safely. They also think that watching Jordan develop gives them confidence.

Jordan's motivation is also a question. Some people might wonder if this is just an ambitious father taking his own love of adventure to a dangerous extreme. However, Paul insists that this project is not about him trying to become famous for his son's achievements. He says that they talk to Jordan regularly to make sure he hasn't lost his motivation.<eos>"

When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, it's probably not classical music they're listening to. Most people our age can name a lot of pop groups, but few of us know who Brahms was. I started doing a music degree, but the people on my course know no more about classical music than anyone else. If you don’t know who wrote the music, you are unlikely to own any recordings of their work. Classical music is not very popular among teenagers. There are a few reasons why this is the case. First, the pace and rhythm of classical music are not very appealing to us. Second, classical music is not structurally very simple. Third, the subject matter of classical music is not very relatable to teenagers. Finally, the way we listen to music has changed. Nowadays, we can find any music we want at the click of a mouse. The sound track to our lives is rarely classical.<eos>"

There were no animals or people in the picture. It felt right that way. Mum spoke again and said the painting had a name. The name was 'River Boy.' The words seemed to carry a strange resonance.

When I woke up this morning, I didn't mean to damage my bedroom carpet. It just seemed like a good idea at the time. I was trying to find a way of fitting my corner cabinet into a corner. Gran had given me the cabinet when she moved out of her house into a flat. It's really cute.

But the thing is, it is a corner cabinet. That is why it is shaped like a triangle. It has to stand in a corner. I've only got two corners in my bedroom. I'd tried fitting Gran’s cabinet into the angle between the roof and the floor, but it was just the tiniest little bit too tall. If I could only slice a couple of centimetres off the bottom of it...

That was when it came to me. If I couldn’t slice anything off Gran’s cabinet, how about cutting a hole in the carpet? It just seemed like the obvious solution. What Dad calls lateral thinking. I reckoned he would be quite pleased with me. He is always telling us to ‘think outside the box’. And that was exactly what I was doing!<eos>"

The novel 'The Borrowers' is about a family of tiny people who live hidden in the walls and floors of a house. They secretly borrow things from the normal-sized people in order to survive. When I was asked to direct a TV adaptation of the novel, I knew it was going to be hard to live up to people’s expectations. The author had told me she wanted the series to be from the Borrowers' perspective, not a human one, which made filming much more complex.

The most crucial thing was getting the scale right. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans, so I had to be much further away from the camera than on a normal shoot. When filming the human surroundings the Borrowers found themselves in, the crew had to crawl along the ground and film from no higher than 15 centimetres, in order to get the Borrowers' perspective.

One big challenge was finding a way to get the shadows right when the images of the supposedly tiny Borrowers were combined with a background image of ordinary-sized surroundings. We developed a unique technique for this. The costumes were also a big challenge. I had them made out of heavy canvas material so that they stuck out in the way that dolls’ clothes do. Unfortunately, the weather was really hot during filming. I don’t think either of them thanked me for my attention to detail with those costumes!<eos>"

In the United States, teenage girls are expected to be Student Council presidents and have part-time jobs, volunteer, and excel in all of these fields. Being an American teenager today is challenging. Teenagers have a lot of homework, tests, and extra-curricular activities, jobs, chores, and responsibilities at home. They also have to maintain a social life.

Despite these stresses, teenagers still face negative stereotypes. Some people think that teenagers are lazy, disrespectful, rebellious, loud, reckless, and self-absorbed. However, this is not always true. Many teenagers are hard-working and dedicated students. They are also involved in their communities and are always willing to help others.

In addition to their studies and personal activities, teenagers also have to deal with the challenges of sleep deprivation. Many teenagers start their days early and end them late, leaving them with fewer than the recommended nine hours of sleep a night. This can lead to problems in school and other areas of life.

Despite the challenges, teenagers are still making their mark on the world. They are taking the initiative to make their communities better and are proving that they are capable of great things.<eos>"

It took us a long time to find the lunch box. It was in a canyon, high on a flat rock, in the middle of a cascading waterfall. The camera hadn't recorded any shooting stars. But it was still a perfect opportunity to argue over the effects of atmospheric waves and share stories of adventure.<eos>"

When you travel by car with your family, even when you're young, you probably know that you're not 'there yet,' even when you ask over and over 'Are we there yet?' It's not 'there' anymore once you get there. It's 'here'. If you really think there's a chance that you're 'there' yet, you should be asking 'Are we here yet?'. And I'm sure there's no one who wishes they were 'there yet' more than the mums and dads fielding that question over and over every single long car trip.

When you're travelling by car, you can have a lot of fun. You can watch DVDs, listen to music, or play puzzles. You can also act as co-pilot and help your parents to keep everything running smoothly. But sometimes, things can go wrong. For example, your brother or sister might put their foot on your side of the seat or hurl their whole body over into your space. If this happens, it can lead to a fight. But don't worry, your parents will be there to help you. They'll yell at your sibling and separate you from them. And once the fight is over, you can continue to enjoy your trip.<eos>"

We have started using a new piece of equipment called a night-vision scope, which allows us to see the ducks in the dark. We are concerned about black ducks because their numbers have fallen greatly and we don’t know if there is enough food on the east coast for these animals. We have lots of information about their daytime activities, but nothing about what they do at night, because we simply haven’t had the equipment. But this new ‘scope’ will produce really clear pictures, even on moonless nights, so we’ll be able to find out more and make better decisions about looking after the area where they live based on what we learn. It is hard work. There are four of us, each working six hours daily. We have studied ducks in different locations, and I have had to take a boat to some sites and make notes on every duck I see.

I got used to my new life in the end, though, and my English improved quickly too! I turned professional at the age of eighteen, three years after arriving in the USA. I was taller than most players in the professional league, but I was much too light for my height, so had to get that right first. I joined a team and have never regretted it.<eos>"

Seven years ago, I was studying tourism in college, but I needed to find a part-time job because my course was expensive. I decided to become a weekend tour guide in my home city, Chicago. It was a lot of fun giving tours to visitors. I got to see the city that I’d been living in my whole life through the eyes of tourists. After finishing my studies, I decided to go into tour guiding full-time. To become a full-time tour guide, I had to learn a lot of things. I had to know a lot about the city, including its history and architecture. I also had to be able to answer hundreds of questions about Chicago. After completing my training, I became a licensed tour guide. Tour guiding is not just about knowing facts. You also need to be able to be entertaining and tell interesting stories. You need to be able to react to changing situations and make sure that visitors are happy. If they are not, they could post a negative review online. Like most tour guides, I know that these reviews are really important, so I make sure that my tours are fun and stress-free.<eos>"

My name is Ella and I'm 22. Last year I went to Thailand for two weeks with my sister Josie. We went to help as volunteers at an elephant sanctuary. It was our first time doing something like that. We collected the elephants' food and washed them in the river. We also led the elephants on foot into the forest area. The evenings were fun. We talked and played games. Now that we're back in the UK, Josie doesn't often talk about Thailand. But if anyone asks her if she enjoyed her time at the sanctuary, she says she loved it.<eos>"

My name is Gina D’Costa and I own a flower shop in the UK. We sell flowers to people who buy them for friends, their homes, or businesses. Sometimes we provide flowers for photoshoots and weddings. One time I decorated a castle with flowers for a wedding. It was a lot of work, but I was proud of the job we had done.

My day starts early, at 4 a.m., when I go to the market to buy fresh flowers. It's usually cold and dark at that time, but I don't mind. The market is full of beautiful flowers. I choose the flowers that people want and set up vases with them. Then I create bunches of flowers and work out how much the orders will cost.

Customers are often surprised by how expensive flowers are. Sometimes I have to ask them to think again about what they'd like. But I like thinking about how I can put together the nicest possible flowers for the amount of money someone wants to spend. That's what you have to do when you're selling things. I wouldn't want any other job.<eos>"

My city has a modern cinema that shows all the latest films I want to see, and there are also lots of films for kids at the weekends. It’s close to where I live, but a year ago, I realized something was missing – the experience of discussing a film in detail with a group of people after watching it with them. So, together with two friends, I started a film club. We decided that we didn’t want to hire a cinema to show the films. Instead, we choose a different location in the city each month. For example, we rented an old factory to show a film that was set in Antarctica. It was very cold, and this created the perfect atmosphere for the film, which was brilliant. Some places we use are even free, as the owners make money by selling snacks during the film. We’re happy to make enough to cover our costs – we’re not trying to make a profit. Each time we show a film, everything is a bit easier for us. We also know how many tickets we’ve sold because everything’s online. There’s still always plenty to do, but when people of all ages come up at the end to say what a great experience they’ve had, it’s wonderful. We’ve started a blog, too, because we know that most people now go online for information about films, rather than read reviews in local papers. We’ve also tried putting up a few posters in cafés. Nothing’s as successful as word of mouth, though – people recommending us to their friends.<eos>"

Taking photographs was always my favorite activity when I was a child. When I was 15, I knew that if I wanted to take my hobby to the next level, I had to do something special. So I decided to start a personal project: I would take one photograph every day for a whole year of my life. Many young photographers had done the same thing before me, but it seemed like a really great idea to me. After a few weeks, I put my photos on a website for young photographers. I was surprised to find that there were others who liked the way I saw and photographed things. I was also enjoying photographing a wide range of subjects. Someone suggested that if my photographs all had a common topic or idea to connect them, my project would be even better. So I began to concentrate more on taking photos of nature scenes, especially of birds and the sky. A lot of them were black and white photographs, which was different to what many other young photographers were doing. Sometimes I had doubts about my project, and I almost gave up several times. But I trusted my own feelings, and became more confident about my photographic style and choices. One day I showed my project to my art teacher at school. She told me about a national photography competition for people my age. So I entered some of my photos, just for fun. I’ll never forget the moment when the judges told me that I had won first prize. It was the first time I realised that maybe my photography really was good, and that I might actually be able to work as a professional photographer. Now I have my own photography studio and I’ve never regretted my career choice.<eos>"

Last year, I joined the National Youth Challenge (NYC) because I wanted to learn new skills and have new experiences. In the NYC, you can do many different activities to challenge yourself and learn new things. There are different levels, from beginner to advanced, run by adult volunteers called 'leaders'. When you complete each level, you get a certificate.

When I first joined, my leader suggested that my first challenge should be helping to organise activities at a local children’s club for two hours a week. I was a bit hesitant at first, but I decided to take up the challenge. Soon, I was spending all my free time at the children’s club. It was a lot more to me than just getting the certificate. I also made some great friends and learned new skills.

Now I’m there for about four hours a week and I always really look forward to going. Because of what I’ve learned at the children’s club, I’ve decided that when I finish school in three years’ time I want to go to college to become a qualified youth worker. I never thought about my future job before starting at the club. This has been my favourite part of the NYC so far and I’ve improved my own communication skills while at the same time helping others.<eos>"

I was born in Denver, USA, and started snowboarding when I was eight years old. My dad took me to a resort in the mountains, about two hours from Denver. The hill was very steep, so my dad had to do a lot of persuading to get me on a board. I was young, so I hadn’t even thought about asking him if I could start snowboarding, but he was already into it and wanted me to love it too. I managed to do well. After this experience, I started competing aged ten. I enjoy taking part in competitions and winning too. I also get to spend lots of time with my friends. It’s the best way of dealing with not being able to do what I love so much and what I’m really good at. I have to think carefully about my future. Snowboarding is such a huge part of my life now, but I also feel it’s important to have something else I can do, just in case I don’t succeed as a professional snowboarder or if I get injured.<eos>"

When I was fifteen, I wanted everything my friends had. I didn't plan ahead, like what I wanted to do when I left school. One day, my best friend got a new phone and I thought I should have one too. My parents said I could only have it if I paid for it myself, so I decided to work part-time and save as much as I could. I owe my parents a lot for making me do that – it taught me a really valuable lesson. I worked every Saturday in a café, but I didn’t really enjoy it. My parents suggested starting my own little business instead. I had seen my mum making necklaces for herself, so I asked if I could have a go at that. I’d never imagined I’d find it so easy, as it had seemed so complicated when I’d watched Mum doing it. I sold my first items of jewellery to my friends and family as soon as I’d finished making them. They told me they were delighted with them, but I just thought they were saying that to please me. So although I was grateful they’d bought them, I still needed convincing that they looked good enough to be popular with the public. There was only one way to find out, so I rented a market stall with my mum. There are always lots of tourists where I live, and they bought lots of my things to give to family and friends when they got back home. Soon we were receiving calls from all over the country from people looking to buy more. They thought we were a big company, employing loads of people to produce my designs, when in fact we were just two people on a market stall! That was when I knew it could work, and it was time to take the next step – creating a website. Since then, I’ve made thousands of pounds through my business, mostly online, although we still have our stall too. It’s been such a lot of fun so far.<eos>"

When Janine Stuart was young, she wrote a novel called Being Amelia which became a bestseller. The book is partly based on Janine’s life. In one interview, Janine said that because of her family’s moves, she had become good at making new friends. She also understood what it was like to be the only new student in a class.

Janine started her novel one summer, when she was feeling bored at home. Her mother had always dreamed of becoming a published author herself, and her teachers had always encouraged her to write. So, it seemed like a natural way for Janine to pass the time.

The book is about a character named Amelia who also goes through similar experiences to Janine. Some of the funniest parts of the book focus on Amelia’s home life, particularly her relationship with her older brother.

One reviewer said that although Janine is still very young, and Being Amelia isn’t a particularly long novel, she’s clearly shown that she’s a better writer than several other best-selling authors.<eos>"

During the winter, there are only a few families who live on the island. But the adults all support each other and help with repairs on the island.

I live in a beautiful house in Scotland, surrounded by countryside. I love nature and wild animals, and I started a new hobby called birdwatching six years ago. I went to the mountains in northern Scotland with my family, where we saw lots of birds. I spent hours watching them with my parents, who showed me how to tell the difference between species and how to find the best places to see them. It was amazing, and I joined a local young birdwatchers’ club. My goal is to see 200 different bird species, and I’ve almost achieved that. I’ve been to many places to see birds, including Egypt and South America. I also think that birdwatching clubs should try to get more young people interested in this hobby. Everyone needs to connect with nature, whatever their age, and it doesn’t have to cost much money.<eos>"

I started playing football when I was 7. I would rush home from school to play with other boys and girls. I loved it, and I was good at it. But my family thought that I would drop out like I had with other hobbies. But it never did. I was already dreaming of playing football professionally when I was older. And the opportunity came sooner than I’d hoped. I played in local tournaments, and one of the referees noticed that I was a promising player. He asked the manager of a professional women’s club to watch me play. After that, she asked me to join her club. I started regular training with a big club as a young 13-year-old. I improved enormously. But people still weren’t sure I’d ever be a star player, which made me feel a bit upset. But my coach encouraged me to just be myself, and believe in myself. He even let me play in one of the club’s championship matches, much earlier than I’d expected. I’ve never run so hard in my life – I didn’t want the other players to blame me for losing. Then by pure luck, I got the winning goal. And next month, I’m running a football tournament in my area.

One of the most interesting things happening in higher education in the UK and around the world is the move to encourage students to get involved in research early on. This means that research is not just for famous scholars or scientists, but it can also be done by everyone.

There are different ways to do research. You can do it in a big way, like the scientists who are making new discoveries, or you can do it in a smaller way, like asking questions about your homework or your family. No matter how you do it, research is a way of thinking about the world and learning new things.

In college and higher education, you are expected to be a researcher. You should be able to ask questions, find information, and make your own conclusions. You should also be able to critically evaluate the research of others. This means that you should not just take everything you read or hear as fact. You should think about it, test it out, and see if it makes sense.<eos>"

Cities have been centers of intellectual life since the 18th century. They provide a place for people to gather and discuss ideas. However, city life is not always easy. It can be exhausting and overwhelming. Scientists have found that cities actually dull our thinking, sometimes dramatically so. One of the main reasons for this is the lack of nature in cities. Studies have shown that people who can see trees from their windows recover more quickly from illness. Even small glimpses of nature improve brain performance.

In recent years, it has become clear that living in cities has a number of negative effects on our mental and physical health. These effects include fatigue, stress, and depression. However, there is also evidence that living in cities can have some positive effects on our health, such as increased creativity and innovation.

The key to mitigating the psychological damage of the metropolis while maintaining its unique benefits is to find ways to integrate nature into city life. This can be done through a variety of methods, such as creating more parks and green spaces, and making it easier for people to access nature.<eos>"

The mind is a complex thing that takes place inside people's heads. We have neuroimaging techniques to prove it. But the study of the mind should not stop at the skin or the skull. There is evidence that things and neurons participate in human cognitive life. From the viewpoint of archaeology, stone objects, body ornaments, engravings, clay tokens and writing systems play an active role in human evolution and the making of the human mind.

The mind and the brain are often equated. Most of what we know about the human mind has been uncovered through isolating people from the material culture they are usually surrounded by in order to study them. But it often goes unnoticed that much of our thinking takes place outside our heads.

My approach sees the human mind as an unfinished project, in a permanent state of on-going evolution. It is important to keep in mind that whatever actual form the 'stick' might have taken in the history of our species, its primary function was that of a pathway instead of a boundary. Through the 'stick', the human species feels, discovers, and makes sense of the environment, but also enacts the way forward.<eos>"

Photography has significantly changed the course of civilization and the way we perceive the world. It has been especially impactful in the United States, where photography quickly became part of American culture at all levels. Historians believe that photography is arguably the country’s greatest single contribution to the visual arts. No other art form has US work loomed so large.

Photography has been appealing because it is a mechanical process that matches the growing enthusiasm for technology in the US. It also brought the wonders and sights of the world into the front room with an immediacy that was breathtaking. Additionally, photography has been important for creating and sustaining impressions of self and family, and for representing everyday realities.

Photographs are records of events, people, and things. They embody a certain objectivity, but also carry with them an inescapable element of subjectivity. If we want to understand a photograph historically, we need to pay attention to its purpose and function within a given cultural matrix.<eos>"

In 1890, William James, an American philosopher and physician, defined psychology as the 'science of mental life.' This definition is still a good starting point for understanding psychology today. We all have a mental life, so we have some idea about what this means. However, even though the concept can be studied in rats and monkeys as well as humans, it remains a somewhat elusive one.

Psychology is about the mind or brain, but psychologists do not understand nearly enough about its workings to be able to comprehend the part that it plays in the experience and expression of our hopes, fears, and wishes, or in our behaviour during experiences as varied as giving birth or watching a football match.

The endeavour of psychology is much like that involved in solving a crossword puzzle. It involves evaluating and interpreting available clues. Complex interactions are the norm rather than the exception in psychology, and understanding them depends on the development of sophisticated techniques and theories.

Psychology has the same goals as any other science: to describe, understand, predict, and learn how to control or modify the process that it studies. Once these goals have been achieved, it can help us to understand the nature of our experience and come to conclusions that can be applied directly to people’s lives.<eos>"

The proprietor of the museum, Carol Sherry, sees each product as embodying its own sad story. The museum is a viable, profit-making business. It is a testament to the fact that most products fail. The museum was started by ex-marketing man Robert McMath, who intended to accumulate a reference library of consumer products. McMath had a lot of products that failed, but he didn't let that discourage him. He kept collecting new products, and his hoard eventually came to consist overwhelmingly of unsuccessful ones.

The museum is a reminder that we all have a lot of failures in our lives. But it also shows that we can overcome our failures and achieve our goals.<eos>"

Everyone knows that sports teams have an advantage when they play at home. But does anyone know why? Most of us probably think we do; after all, it seems obvious. But professional sport is changing faster than at any time in its history and much of what we used to take for granted is now open to question.

There are two main reasons why home advantage exists. First, the home team has the advantage of playing in front of their own crowd. The crowd can generate a lot of noise and energy, which can help the home team to perform better. Second, the home team has the advantage of being familiar with their own environment. They know the layout of the field, the weather conditions, and the crowd. This can give the home team an edge in terms of strategy and execution.

However, there are some factors that can reduce home advantage. One factor is travel. If the away team has to travel a long distance to the home team's city, they may be tired and not able to perform as well. Another factor is the weather. If the weather is extreme, such as very hot or very cold, it can also affect the performance of the home team.

Despite these factors, home advantage still exists. There are a number of studies that have shown that home teams win more games than away teams. This is because of the psychological effects that playing at home have on the home team. When the home team is playing at home, they feel more confident and are more likely to win the game.<eos>"

There is a debate about whether talent is born or acquired. However, the majority of experts believe that practice is more important than talent. This is known as the 10,000-hours rule. According to this rule, if you practice for 10,000 hours, you will become an expert in your field.

However, there are some exceptions to this rule. For example, if you are born with a natural talent for a particular sport, you may not need to practice as much to become an expert. Additionally, if you have a lot of support and opportunity, you may be able to achieve your goals faster.<eos>"

A recent report found that many children living in wealthy countries feel lonely and unhappy. The reason for this is that these children have been spending too much time indoors, watching TV or playing on computers, and have lost contact with the natural world. This is a problem that has been discussed before, and the solution is simple: children need to spend more time outside.

A follow-up study found that most of the children interviewed said they would be happier if they could go outside more. Many adults also talk nostalgically about the freedom of their own youth, when they spent long summer days playing outside. However, it is important to remember that the adults who are talking about their own youth are the ones who have imposed the protective regime on their own children.

There are some good arguments in the book about the relationship between the fear of danger and child-focused consumerism. However, the author's arguments go too far and she does not provide enough evidence to support them. For example, she likens the modern treatment of children to a subtle form of racism. This is a very strong and controversial statement that is not supported by evidence.<eos>"

I am a research bio-psychologist with a PhD. I have done a lot of school and I am a good problem-solver. However, my schooling has not helped me solve all of life's problems. Most problems in life cannot be solved with a formula or memorized answers. They require the judgement, wisdom and creative ability that come from life experiences.

For children, those experiences are embedded in play. Play is the natural means by which adults and mammals have always educated themselves. It includes the abilities to think creatively, to get along with other people and co-operate effectively, and to control their own impulses and emotions.

Children need more play. If we care about our children and future generations, we must reverse the horrid trend that has been occurring over the past half century. We must give childhood back to children.<eos>"

In many countries, there are a lot of young people in their twenties who use social media to find work. There are two popular social networking sites that are often used for job hunting: Twitter and LinkedIn. These sites offer the chance for direct contact with potential employers. However, with greater access comes a greater chance to make mistakes.

For example, a young jobseeker in the US contacted a senior marketing executive via LinkedIn. The marketing executive had a lot of influential people in her contact list. The young jobseeker felt that he could use this list to help him land a job. However, the marketing executive was not happy with this idea. She sent a rude and sarcastic rejection note that has since gone viral.

If this incident makes young people think more carefully about how they use social media in a professional capacity, it may have actually ended up doing them a favour. It has drawn attention to an unfortunate truth. Social media is a potentially dangerous tool for jobhunters who don’t know how to use it. And a worrying number are getting it wrong.

To be successful on professional networking sites, you need to be clear and concise in your message, and keep the tone humble. You should also avoid sending impersonal, blanket emails. If you do these things, you have a better chance of getting a positive response from potential employers.<eos>"

Newspapers have been struggling in recent years. Their circulation has fallen and they are no longer the main source of news for most people in the US. Some people predict that newspapers will soon be extinct, but history shows that old media have a habit of surviving. Newspapers were once new media, and they became the dominant medium for news in the mid-19th century thanks to the steam press, the railway, and the telegraph.

Today, we have a lot of ways to get news. We can read online, watch TV, or listen to the radio. We can also access news on our phones and computers. This is all very different from the way people got news in the medieval world. In the medieval world, there was no internet or TV. People had to rely on newspapers or other forms of media to get their news.

Despite all of the changes, newspapers still exist. They may not be as popular as they once were, but they are still an important source of news for many people. Perhaps newspapers will continue to exist for many years to come.<eos>"

If humans were truly at home under the light of the moon and stars, we would go in darkness happily. Instead, we are creatures who are adapted to living in the sun’s light. We have engineered the night to receive us by filling it with light. This kind of control has some negative effects called light pollution.

Light pollution is mostly caused by bad lighting design. It washes out the darkness of night, altering light levels and light rhythms to which many forms of life have adapted. It affects migration, reproduction, feeding, and other aspects of life.

We have lit up the night as if it were an unoccupied country. It is as essential to maintaining our biological welfare as light itself. Denying darkness is futile. It causes various physical ailments and messes with our regular sleep-wake cycle.

Living in a glare of our own making, we have cut ourselves off from our evolutionary and cultural heritage. We have forgotten the scale of our being, which is best measured against the dimensions of a deep night with the Milky Way arching overhead.<eos>"

Journal-based peer review is a process that ensures the quality of scientific research papers. It is often praised for preventing the publication of flawed or nonsensical papers. However, the process can also be time-consuming, sometimes delaying the publication of a paper by a year. Despite its drawbacks, journal-based peer review remains essential for ensuring the trustworthiness of published literature.

Preprints, which are drafts of papers that are posted online without having been peer reviewed, are a growing trend that is changing the way scientists publish their work. Preprints bring academics back to the core of research publication, which is to disseminate new results quickly. They also make it easier for reviewers to critique and discuss papers.

Preprints have some advantages over traditional journal publication. They enable informal scientific discussions on a global scale and provide an outlet for negative results. They also increase the number of times papers are read and cited. By harnessing the web's culture of openness and accessibility, preprints have the potential to improve the scientific publishing process.<eos>"

When I teach literature, students often answer that a poem is like a painting in words. Their answers usually don't satisfy me or them. One day, I asked students to choose an object and write one paragraph describing it empirically and another in the first person, from the point of view of the item itself. The exercise led to much amusement and discussion.

A poem is a thing made, like a painting or a machine. Poets sometimes compare poems to wild animals or machines, but such comparisons don't always hold up. The most productive thing about trying to define a poem is the debate. Whether you view a poem as a machine or a wild animal, this process can change your conception of what a machine or wild animal is.

A poem is a product of writing and rewriting just like an article, story, or novel. It never really becomes what they usually are – a thing created in order to become a commodity.<eos>"

Sleeping is one of my favorite travel experiences, but I don't talk about it very much because I feel a little guilty. When friends share details of their well-planned trips, I smile and don't say much. What would they think if they knew that my own travel itineraries include naps and lazy mornings. Better sleep is one of travel's happy side effects. When I visited Mexico's Yucatán coast, I was surprised by how many hours I spent sleeping. There were lots of noisy birds, but it didn't matter. Surrounded by strange smells and sounds, I could plunge into a sleep that was more profound and dream-filled than I imagined possible. Sleep is something else too: it's an experience that changes rhythm, sometimes dramatically, from place to place. People obsess about jet lag, but I suspect that the difficulties I experience recovering from long journeys have more to do with local and cultural adjustment than time zones. When I finally fall into the local sleep pattern, I feel I have truly arrived.<eos>"

I was flying east all night and woke up to see that it was already daylight. The landscape below was empty and looked like a dream. I could see no signs of human life and the view was amazing. I shook my head and smiled at my neighbour who woke up and smiled at me. He was a salesman from Moscow who was flying to the outer limits of civilisation. His English was not very good, but I managed to explain to him that I was flying to a city in Siberia called Magadan. He said that there was no road from Magadan and I explained that I had reason to believe that there was a road. We talked for a while and I invited him to join me on my trip. He agreed to come and we started planning the trip. It was going to be a long journey and I was excited to see what adventures we would have.<eos>"

In the Red Bull Air Race, twelve pilots race through a series of pylons between 15 and 25 meters high. They negotiate sharp turns, barrel rolls and loops at speeds of up to 370 km per hour. I was invited to find out what it feels like to take part. Before the flight, I had to sign two forms. One confirmed that I was in good health, the other that I would empty all my pockets. I also learned that I would have to try to stay orientated throughout the flight. The pilot explained that I should look at the horizon and relax. I was also asked to promise that when I was flying upside down, I would relax and enjoy the view. Half an hour before the flight, I had a safety briefing in which I was told not to touch anything. By the time we were taxiing down the runway, I was ready to fly. I ignored all instructions received and would not relax and enjoy the flight. This is the cruel paradox of high-speed acrobatic flying. In order to survive it without passing out, you have to keep calm and focused. You have to tense up at the right time and you have to relax at the right time. Panicking is a bad idea. The flight was over in 10 minutes. It had been 'soft' compared to what the pilots endure when they race.<eos>"

Doug Allan is a wildlife cameraman who films wild animals in cold places. If you have ever been amazed by footage of polar bears in a nature documentary, it's probably been filmed by him. Allan was born in a cold place and he has a passion for diving and survival in cold places. He became a marine biologist and commercial diver, and he learned about survival in cold places through diving.

One day, Allan was working in Antarctica when a TV crew turned up to film a wildlife documentary. They asked Allan to take them to different places, and after 48 hours, he realized that being a wildlife cameraman ticked all the boxes: travel, adventure, and underwater.

Allan has worked on many major TV wildlife series. He says that his value is field experience in cold conditions. He has a feel for it, and he has spent a lot of time on sea ice. He also says that wildlife filming is full of great successes, but also failures and embarrassments.

Now Allan would like to make his own film about climate change in the Arctic. He says he would be able to make an extraordinary documentary.<eos>"

In 2004, Pen Hadow became the first person to trek to the North Pole alone and without being resupplied on the way. He swam through cold waters, fought frostbite and polar bears. He also made it to the South Pole the same year. Now he is back in the Arctic preparing for an expedition he says is even more ambitious.

Pen is a strong and determined person. He has a lot of physical endurance and he is also very organized. He is going to set out on a three-month, 1,000 kilometer trek to the North Pole. He will take detailed measurements of the thickness and density of the ice. Nobody has ever done this before. The results of his expedition will be of vital importance to the scientific community.

Pen is married to Mary, a horsewoman. They live in the country with their two children. Pen is worried about being away from his family while he is in the Arctic. He knows that it will be difficult to stay away from his family, but he also knows that his mission is important.

Pen believes his mission reconnects exploration with the search for knowledge that drove previous generations into the unknown. He says, ""Making it to the North Pole was ultimately a personal ambition, and of limited value to anyone beyond the polar adventuring community. This time, scientists will profit from the data, and we’re creating a platform in which to engage as many people as possible in what’s happening in the Arctic Ocean.""<eos>"

I had a break from competition. I was successful as an Olympian, but I didn’t have anything to do. I wanted to stay in shape and be able to fight for an Olympic place if my dream rekindled. So I entered marathons and triathlons. I also spoke to some of my rowing colleagues about a race. I knew that if I entered the race, I would want to win. I also had to take into account the loss of earnings that would result from being away from home. Participating in the race would mean I wouldn’t just be talking about past achievements. I’d actually be doing something again which I could bring in: rowing across the Atlantic. I learned a lot while planning this adventure, but one of the biggest lessons was to be thankful for the easy life of a full-time athlete.<eos>"

Last year, I went to the Arctic Circle in Finland to work with huskies. I was 26 and I was feeling restless. I found a small company run by Anna and Pasi, and they agreed to take me on as a husky dog handler. From December to February, there is plenty of business taking tourists out on sled rides. The work is very physical and the hours are long.

I started packing straight away. I flew to Helsinki and then took a bus to the farm. Anna asked me if I wanted to be thrown in at the deep end. I followed the sound of barking and joined the team. I was able to learn the basics of dog-sledding quickly, but everything else seemed to be very complicated.

By the end of my first week, my head was spinning with instructions and my muscles ached from dragging heavy sleds. But I was triumphant. I emailed my friends and told them I could chop with an axe, hammer a nail, and use a circular saw in the snow.<eos>"

On that day, Radcliffe raced past the finish line. The press was there to make sense of her extraordinary run. Her time would have qualified her to compete in the men's marathon at the world championships in Paris. Journalists asked her about the benefits of emu oil, a product that Olympic gold medallist, Cathy Freeman, had recommended. Radcliffe says that the achievement never really sank in. She felt that it was what she was going to do that day and so it just sort of flowed over her. During the race, her husband and coach, Gary Lough, was in a car with her support team, listening to the radio coverage. With 800m left to run, Radcliffe began to calculate. She knew she could finish in under 2 hours 16 minutes if she crossed the line in less than three minutes. She ran the remaining distance in 2 mins 25 secs. At the finish, she thought, ""I can run quicker than that."" She knew that her marathon was her career peak and that she would never run as fast again.<eos>"

When I first started my cookery programme, In Search of Perfection, I was not sure how people would react to it. There had been a lot of talk about the food revolution happening in Britain, and I was confident that we had created a series of programmes that made a unique contribution to that. I watched the first programme and was relieved that it was well-received. The success of the show led to many other projects, including a book based on my experiences at the restaurant I own. Each project is like a journey, whether it's into the past, the mind, or cooking techniques. I wrote several books in a series called 'Perfection', each one accompanying its own TV programme of the same name. In these books, the journey is often physical, with passports and suitcases and itineraries. The latest book in the series, In Search of Total Perfection, takes you on a journey around the world to meet extraordinary artisans. These people have spent years perfecting their craft. Perfection is subjective. Even choosing which dishes to include in the series was a challenge. But I knew I had to include something for everyone. Despite the book's title, I didn't claim that the recipes were definitive. But I did believe that I could pin down some of the things that made these dishes work.<eos>"

Your dad might be right. Spending too much time online can be unhealthy. But it can also have some benefits. Generally, research shows that teenagers who use social media have a lot of friends, a good sense of identity and belonging, and are developing the skills they need to be successful in the digital age.

Social networking has become an important part of modern childhood. It's like hanging out at the youth club, but online. You can share your interests, connect with people who have similar interests, and learn new things.

If you're not outgoing, social networking can be a great way to connect with others. You can communicate with people from all over the world, and practice your social skills. If you're a quiet person with a specialized interest, social networking can also be a great way to connect with others who share your interests.

Social networking can also be a creative force. You can make videos, write blogs, and share your photos with the world. It can also help you develop your skills in teamwork and collaboration.

So, if you're a teenager, and you're not sure whether you should spend more time online or not, the answer is: it's up to you. But, there are a lot of benefits to using social media responsibly.<eos>"

We packed a lot of things into the car, including suitcases, coolers, and clothes. We also had a lot of fun on the road. We drove straight west and stopped at a town in Oklahoma. We learned the rule of the road: cattle get the right-of-way.

We continued our journey and stopped at several other places, including the Great Sand Dunes and Pagosa Springs, Colorado. We also saw a lot of bears. It was a memorable trip.

After the trip, I was sad to be home, but I was also happy that I had a lot of fun. I have a lot of photos from the trip that I can look at and remember.<eos>"

Rose Frost was sixteen years old and was going to live with her grandmother, Daisy. Her family was separating for two years. Her father had an assignment overseas, and her mother would be joining him, but Rose and her sister Amy were staying in England. Amy was completing her final school courses and was going to live in a college with her own kitchen and study area.

Rose was moving to her grandmother’s house. She had never known her grandfather and had vague holiday memories of her grandmother. Her parents had not been enthused about the idea of her living with her grandmother, but Daisy had insisted that it was no trouble.

Rose was sensible and very mature for her age. She knew about healthy eating, about keeping fit, and getting enough sleep. But this time Rose had insisted on one thing: she wanted her independence. Living with Daisy would be fulfilling all her needs, but Rose wanted to play music loud if she wanted, and to invite friends over or go out without having to ask permission every time.

In five weeks’ time, Rose would begin the arduous task of starting at a new school, meeting new friends, forming bonds, and basically beginning her life again. It was her fourth senior school in five years, so she felt like a veteran at it now. At least she knew this was the last time as she would be starting her final two years at school.<eos>"

My name is Charlotte Grainger. My primary school teacher first thought that I might write a novel. I thought that writing a book would be a big achievement and I didn't know what other teenagers were doing. When I turned 13, I decided to attempt writing a novel. The novel I started then is about to be published. It's a huge achievement. The narrative is assured and action packed. Nothing about it, except the age of its heroine, suggests that it was written by a teenager.

I was surprised to see a teenager sitting in the office of my publishers. But I knew that I was going to interview a 15-year-old girl about her book. The book is a big achievement. It's well-written and exciting. I read a lot of books by famous fantasy writers, but I was worried about whether I was capable of writing a book. I also read a book called How Not to Write a Novel. It helped me to understand the basics of writing.

Getting your book published is hard, no matter your age. But I'm grateful for the support I received. I know that writers sink or swim according to their talents. So I don't take things for granted.<eos>"

Imagine you're riding a rollercoaster in an amusement park. You come to a stop and take a deep breath. Then, the rollercoaster starts to move quickly and turns sharply. Your stomach feels like it's in the air. You feel scared and excited at the same time.

Amusement parks are a big industry. To create the thrills and excitement that guests seek, there are teams of engineers and designers working behind the scenes. It's a challenging job to design a rollercoaster. You have to make sure that the ride is safe and exciting. You also have to introduce new and innovative ideas to keep visitors wanting more.

The teams behind rollercoasters must work together to create a strong narrative, be it a space adventure or a high-paced chase in the jungle. They must also consider the latest advances in technology, such as virtual reality. But in the end, the physical rollercoaster experience will remain king for many years to come.<eos>"

At 25, Miranda Ellington has accomplished a great deal as a choreographer. She creates works for many theatres and dance companies. She also still dances from time to time. It's surprising to her that she can fit both activities into her busy schedule.

As a choreographer, Miranda is essentially in a teaching role. She enjoys working with young students. She finds that working with students is easier than working with professionals because they're open to taking risks and are hungry for success.

When Miranda starts working with a new group, she concentrates on the dance steps and the music dictates what she does. If dancers aren’t responding well to a particular composer’s music, that can be frustrating, but she still has to find solutions.

Miranda doesn’t believe in attaching herself to one institution. She feels it's valuable to keep establishing contacts with new people. She has to be prepared to adapt the way she works each time she goes somewhere new.

The conversation turns to the recent documentary on professional ballet dancers and choreographers. Miranda says that the documentary does a good job of giving viewers an accurate portrayal of life inside a dance company.

Miranda has done such a range of work that it's hard to categorize her. She sees herself as someone who wants to widen her horizons.<eos>"

I have a friend who asked me why I travel when I can see everything on television. I agreed that you can see amazing things on TV, but why sit at home on your sofa when there’s so much out there to experience. I guess that conversation gave me the idea for my crazy four-day trip, and a film that aimed to get people to turn off their television sets. One of my friends was getting rid of his old sofa, which became the star of the film. I fixed the sofa with some wheels and cables and connected it to old seatbelts. I put my luggage on the seats and slept on the sofa each night, including one night on the beach. Several friends joined me on the trip, helping to pull the sofa along and encouraging me to keep going. I’ve been on several expeditions on foot in recent years, but this was something completely new. Not only was it the longest distance I have ever walked, but it was also on main roads, which meant I could stop at a roadside café and relax on the sofa with a cappuccino instead of having the wind blowing away my sandwiches while I sit on a rock. I got used to telling people, ""No, I’m not doing it for charity, I’m not training for a marathon"". When someone at work asks me about my weekend, I’d rather explain how I dragged a sofa 100 miles across southern England than discuss the latest show on TV. You’ll be able to see the film on my website.<eos>"

When I read about guided swimming trips in the sea around some small Greek islands, I was excited. I'd never tried organized group trips before. My brother was busy, so I decided a group holiday might suit me. The man at the Greek port was curious when I asked for a single ferry ticket. I explained that I wouldn't be alone for long; I'd be joining ten others to swim around the tiny islands. We did a short swim to split us into speed groups, then it was time for our first proper swim. I was nervous because I'd never swum such a long distance in the open sea before. Soon, the waves got bigger and I was at the back of the slow group. I watched faster swimmers moving ahead like dolphins. I wanted to complete this first distance, though, and was delighted when I finally managed it on my own. The following days followed a routine: jumping in; reaching a comfortable speed; stopping to admire the scenery. As the swims grew greater in distance, so did my speed and pleasure at completing them. There seemed little need for the support boat. I can hardly wait to come again next year.<eos>"

I'm glad I started working as a flight attendant. I've been to many places, including the US and Australia. I work with great people, have a lot of time off, and life is always exciting.

When I was a child, I often flew unaccompanied to boarding school. Sometimes I felt lonely, so I would ask the flight attendants to let me help give out meals to passengers. That's what I remembered later when I was working in the bank and needed a new direction. There were a lot of young people at the interview, and many were accepted. They were all highly qualified like me, and were changing careers.

Before the interview, I practiced what to say. I mentioned my strengths and previous work experience, and I got the job. I'd recommend this kind of work to anyone, as there are so many things that make it worthwhile. The free flights I get aren't the most important thing. Most airline staff are incredibly hard-working, and there's a saying – 'no-one's finished till everyone's finished.' It's like a big family – even though we don’t see each other all the time, we're still close.<eos>"

At the summer camp where I work, I really enjoy seeing the children succeed at things they never thought they could do. Most of the children know how to swim and play table-tennis, but rock climbing is a new experience for most of them. Some children feel very nervous, but after some encouragement they agree to try and they all get to the top in the end. This makes them feel great. We do get children who miss home at the beginning of the week. It's not the really young ones who feel like that the most – it's actually the ten- to thirteen-year-olds. We don't let them use their mobile phones all the time. We tell them they can phone home after lunch and sometimes after dinner. Most children are fine in a couple of days and at the end of their week's stay, they all come up to us and thank us because they have had a great time.<eos>"

Rock the Planet, a musical show where actors also have to be good musicians, opened in London last year. The show was voted 'Best Musical' four times in the USA. It was challenging to do the show with an all-British cast of actors because the UK has limits on how many performances young actors can do. Luckily, the director found plenty of talented UK-based actors. The theatre in London is bigger than the US venue, but it's been full every night.

I met 11-year-old Jamie, one of the show’s actors. He said that he gets paid to play and that he was very pleased with himself when he finally got a song right. He also told me about his school lessons and his classmates' reaction to the show.
