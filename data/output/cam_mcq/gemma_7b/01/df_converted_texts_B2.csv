Some time ago, there was a website that talked about the risks of public check-ins, which are online announcements of your whereabouts. The website said that when you post something online, you are also telling everyone in the world where you are. This made people realize that there can be some downsides to sharing so much information online.

The internet has opened up a lot of new opportunities to share your life with the world. You can write a blog, post photos, and share your thoughts with anyone who wants to see them. However, you should be aware that the internet can also be a dangerous place. If you post something online, it can be seen by anyone. This means that you should be careful about what you say online.

In the early days of the internet, there was a young man named Justin Hall who started a blog. He wrote about his life and shared his photos and art with the world. However, things went wrong when people started finding out his home address and posting it online. This made Hall feel unsafe and he had to stop blogging.

Heather Armstrong is another example of how the internet can be a dangerous place. She had a blog and wrote about her job and her life. However, one day an anonymous person sent the address of her blog to all of her bosses. This led to her being fired from her job.

These two stories show that the internet can be a great place to share your life, but you should also be aware of the risks. If you post something online, it can be seen by anyone. So, you should be careful about what you say online.<eos>"

A long time ago, some scientists started a campaign to warn people about a movie called What the Bleep Do We Know. The movie showed that there is a lot about the universe that we don't understand. Even the most experienced scientists admit that they don't have all the answers. Some people felt that the movie was dangerous and issued warnings about it. The movie was very popular, but I didn't understand why people were so excited about it at first. However, when the movie described some new discoveries, I started to see what all the fuss was about. One of the discoveries was that water molecules can be affected by thoughts. I had heard rumours about this before, but the movie gave me some evidence to support it. The evidence was not very convincing, but it was still interesting. The movie also talked about other discoveries, such as the nature of the universe and the existence of life on Earth. These discoveries were amazing and showed me that the universe is far stranger than I could ever imagine.<eos>"

Writing novels is like planting a forest, while writing short stories is more like planting a garden. The two processes complement each other, creating a complete landscape that I treasure. Writing novels takes a long time and a lot of commitment, while writing short stories is more manageable and allows me to experiment and express myself freely.

I have been writing novels and short stories since I began my career as a fiction writer. I usually write a novel after finishing a group of short stories, and vice versa. It takes me about a week to complete a short story, which is much faster than writing a novel.

Short stories are like guideposts to my heart, and I feel happy as a writer to be able to share my intimate feelings with my readers.<eos>"

Science is a powerful force that has both improved and threatened human existence. It has made our lives easier and has also challenged our very existence. Science has its beauty and its dangers, and it has been used for both good and evil.

Science has been used to explain the natural world, from the tiniest particles to the vastness of the universe. It has also been used to develop new technologies and treatments for diseases. However, science has also been used to create weapons and destroy lives.

The history of science is filled with conflict and change. Scientists have constantly been modifying and overthrowing theories. Sometimes, these changes have been minor, but other times they have been major. The struggle between old and new theories has often been bitter and contentious.

Despite its challenges, science continues to progress. It is a field that is constantly evolving and changing. Scientists are always learning new things and developing new theories. Science is a powerful tool that can be used to improve the world, but it is also a dangerous force that can be used to destroy it.<eos>"

From around 2015, major publishers started to report that sales of ebooks had plateaued or even fallen in some cases. This has raised concerns about the long-term potential of ebooks in the publishing industry. Some people believe that the ebooks hype may have driven unwise investment, with companies losing confidence in the power of the word on the page. Despite the evidence, the question of whether ebooks will 'kill' the print book still continues to surface.

The idea of one medium 'killing' another has often followed the unveiling of new technologies. Even before the advent of digital technologies, critics have predicted the demise of existing media. For example, when television was invented, many people thought that radio would die. But radio ended up surviving by finding new uses.

The emergence of new technology often causes us to adjust our bond with something that has become an integral part of our day-to-day life. As a result, as technology moves on, we find ourselves longing for what we used to know, but no longer have. This is why entire industries develop around retro products and older technologies.<eos>"

Every day, I wake up early to write about how some of the greatest minds of the past have approached their work. I write about their daily routines and how they made the time each day to do their best work. I also write about my own struggles with creativity and productivity.

I have a lot of concerns about creativity and productivity. How do you do meaningful creative work while also earning a living? Is it better to devote yourself wholly to a project or to set aside a small portion of each day? And when there doesn’t seem to be enough time for all you hope to accomplish, must you give things up or can you learn to condense activities, to do more in less time, to ‘work smarter, not harder’?

I have tried to provide examples of how a variety of brilliant and successful people have confronted many of the same challenges. I wanted to show how grand creative visions translate to small daily increments; how one’s working habits influence the work itself, and vice versa.

This book is about people’s routines. It’s about the circumstances of creative activity, not the product; it deals with manufacturing rather than meaning. But it’s also, inevitably, personal. I have documented all of my sources in the Notes section, which I hope will also serve as a guide to further reading.<eos>"

Charles Spence is a Professor of Experimental Psychology at Oxford University in the UK. He has studied how the senses interact to form our perception of flavour. Through his studies, he has influenced what we eat and drink. He has also studied how the environment affects taste.

Spence has written a book called The Perfect Meal, which is packed with insights about food and drink. It is a fascinating book for anyone who loves to eat and drink.

Spence's lab is not very high-tech. It has soundproof booths and stacks of ancient-looking audio-visual equipment. He can afford to work more creatively with cooks because he keeps his overheads low.

Spence has been helping famous brands reduce salt and sugar in their products. He says that it is in their interests to help loyal customers stay alive for longer.

Spence has also studied the effects of sound on flavour. He has found that higher-pitched music enhances sweetness, and lower-pitched and brassy sounds make food taste bitter.<eos>"

Our brains are very busy these days. We have a lot of information to deal with, including facts, rumors, and things that are not true. We also do more things ourselves now than we used to. For example, we make our own reservations and find things in shops. We do a lot of different things at once, but it's not multitasking. It's more like spinning plates. When we think we're multitasking, we're actually switching from one task to another very quickly. This can be stressful and make it harder to focus on the task at hand. Multitasking also makes it harder to learn new information and make decisions. It's a real problem, especially with email. We feel obligated to answer emails, but it's impossible to do that and get anything else done.<eos>"

In a Swedish zoo, a chimpanzee named Santino would sometimes break up concrete into pieces and throw them at visitors. Was he being spiteful? In caves in the US, female bats help unrelated fruit bat mothers if they can’t find the right birthing position. Are they being caring? Fifty years ago, people thought that animals didn’t have consciousness, feelings or moral systems. But recently that has partially changed. Thanks to research into the behaviour of bats, chimps, and other animals, emotions of animals have gone from being a taboo area of investigation to being tentatively explored. It is a change that has in recent years filtered through the scientific strata to a selection of popular science books. And it has started a debate that may never be solved by science: can animals be said to have consciousness?

The debate about animal consciousness raises a second question: conscience – a person’s moral sense of right and wrong that guides their behaviour. In a recent experiment involving cows, it became apparent that those that successfully opened the gate themselves showed more pleasure than those that had to have the gate opened for them. If, as this research seems to imply, cows enjoy problem-solving, what does it mean for the production and consumption of beef? The observations may not be disputed, but the interpretation of them is. Some people believe that the only logically consistent response to the new research is to stop eating meat. Others believe that we should at the very least re-evaluate our view of animal cognition. Still others believe that we should just stop anthropomorphising animals. The debate is ongoing and there is no clear answer.<eos>"

Critical thinking is a way of understanding what we read or listen to in a deeper way. It involves interacting with the text and thinking about it in a way that goes beyond simply remembering facts.

There is some concern that technology is changing the way we approach complex problems and making it more difficult to really think. For example, the amount of information available online can be overwhelming and can make it difficult to focus on a single task. Additionally, the use of visual media, such as video games and television, can distract people from reading and writing.

However, there is also evidence that technology can have a positive impact on critical thinking. For example, video games can teach decision-making and analytical skills. They can also help people to explore ideas and concepts that might otherwise be inaccessible or off limits.

It is important to understand the subtleties of how technology affects thinking and analysis. By understanding how technology can be used to enhance critical thinking, we can help to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to think critically.<eos>"

When Matthew Crawford is not writing or thinking about how we should live, he works as a motorcycle mechanic. He wrote two books about the benefits of manual trades and how to cope with modernity.

Crawford says that our attention is being pulled in many directions. We are constantly being interrupted and it is becoming more and more difficult to think or remember conversations we’ve had. This is because everyone is trying to protect themselves from the irritation of constantly being interrupted.

Crawford also talks about the impact that technology has had on our ability to connect with others. He says that we are more conscious of other things we might be doing and that this has a social impact. We’d rather send a text message to a friend, free from the risk of having a conversation.

Crawford's proposed solution has two parts. First, we need regulation of noise and distraction in public space. More importantly, though, Crawford advocates skilled practices as a way of engaging with the world in a more satisfying way.<eos>"

""What do you do for a living?"" is a common question that we often answer in a few words. However, if you're a philosopher, it's a bit harder to deal with. It's because describing yourself as a philosopher sounds rather pretentious. Saying you study or teach the subject is fine, but to say you are a philosopher is, in the eyes of many, to claim access to some mystical truth or enlightenment above one’s fellows.

There are a few reasons why this misconception exists. One reason is that philosophers have established themselves as people who judge the activities of others and celebrate intellectual life. Another reason is that the academic discipline of philosophy has grown increasingly removed from lived experiences.

Philosophy can help people look a little more closely at the practices and behaviours that define their lives. Sometimes this might reveal something we already know; at other times we might discover that our beliefs are hard to justify. Either way, merely by examining these ideas, we’ll be doing something for the benefit of everyone.<eos>"

Foodies, gourmands, chefs and others who love food might expect that reflecting on what and how we eat can contribute to culinary pleasure. However, philosophical discussions of food have often been about other topics, such as the acquisition of knowledge or the pursuit of pleasure. Food is inherently social and cultural. It derives from historical contexts and is shared with those in our communities. It also brings people together and provides infrastructure for growing and distributing food.

Once food has been prepared, people will start talking and writing about it. They enjoy the privilege of being able to taste and describe food tastes. But why do these people enjoy such a privileged status? One philosopher has reminded us that tasting what we eat is not some sort of special expertise. Another aspect of food is aesthetics. We talk about paintings or symphonies being beautiful, but not the taste of food. And there are undoubtedly many ethical issues that attach to food.

A separate matter is the extent to which cooking in restaurants and in the home differ. Home cooks have a special duty to their guests, while those who cook for a living have obligations to their employer and to the food itself. Food and dining can play a role in bridging cultural gaps. We can come to appreciate others by learning to enjoy their food and forge personal bonds with people from other cultures by coming together to eat.<eos>"

Rob Daviau is a US designer who creates 'legacy' board games. These games are different from traditional board games because they have a permanent impact on the game. For example, in one game called Risk Legacy, players might have to rip up cards, deface the board, or open packets containing new rules. The games play out over a fixed number of sessions and long-held grudges become woven into the fabric of the game.

Legacy board games were not expected to become popular, but most players love the concept. They see it as one of the biggest advances in game design for several years. The legacy format draws on video games and the demand for episodic entertainment fuelled by popular TV series.

Daviau feels a sense of ownership, but he is also keen to see where others take the idea. He suspects gamers will soon be asking: 'Enough of that, what's new?'<eos>"

Once upon a time, there was an octopus named Inky who lived in a tank at the New Zealand National Aquarium. One night, Inky managed to escape from his tank and swim across the floor to a narrow drain that led to the Pacific Ocean. It was a story that was shared online and was popular among children.

One of the reasons why people find stories like Inky's so interesting is because they involve anthropomorphism, which means treating animals like humans. In the case of octopuses, this pleasure is especially pronounced because of their intelligence and their physical differences from humans.

Scientists have found that animals have many of the same abilities as humans, such as the ability to consider the past and the future, to demonstrate empathy and self-awareness, and to anticipate the motives of others. However, there are some things that humans can do that animals cannot, such as fully-developed language.

It is important to remember that animals are not humans. They have their own unique ways of thinking and behaving. However, we can learn from animals and appreciate their intelligence.<eos>"

Once upon a time, there was a technology called robotics that has the potential to change the world. Robots have already been used in the automotive and manufacturing industries for many years. Experts say that in the next few years, robots will be used in many other industries.

One of the main challenges with robotics is that it can lead to job loss. However, it can also create new jobs. For example, robots can build houses much faster than humans. They can also be used to clean supermarkets and stock shelves.

Another challenge with robotics is that it can lead to social unrest. Some people are afraid that robots will take away their jobs and their ability to interact with others. However, experts say that this is not necessarily true. They say that robots can create new jobs and make it easier for people to interact with each other.

In order to prepare for the robotic workforce of tomorrow, we need to invest in education and training programs. We also need to develop new regulatory frameworks to ensure our safety and privacy.<eos>"

My grandparents' garden was a beautiful place. It was located on the bank of a river and sloped gently down towards the water. You couldn't reach the river but you could hear the sound of the water and the birds that sang in the trees above. I imagined that all gardens were like this – a place of escape, peace and solitude.

My father was a quiet and withdrawn person. He had a few phrases that he liked to use, one of them being 'It's immaterial to me'. He was probably disappointed that he hadn't made more of his life. He left school without qualifications and became apprenticed to a plumber. Plumbing was not something he was passionate about. It was just what he did.

I always wanted to like the piano but it did its best to intimidate me. The only thing I did like about it were the two brass candlesticks that jutted out from the front. I'd walk along the river bank looking for a suitable spot where I could take off the painful sandals and leave them with my picnic while I ventured out, tentatively, peering through the water for any fish that I could scoop up with the net and take home.

One day my father announced that there was a vacancy for an apprentice gardener in the Parks Department. I thought you might be interested. I like to feel that somewhere deep down inside him, although he hated gardening himself, he'd watched me doing it for long enough and noticed the keenness and the passion for all things that grew and flowered and fruited that hadn't disappeared.<eos>"

The silence at Centre Court during the Wimbledon tennis championships is very quiet. You can bounce the ball, serve, and hit it, and you hear the echo of your shot.

The quiet of the Centre Court is good for your game. It helps you to focus and concentrate on the point you are playing.

The silence is broken by a sudden noise when a point is done. There is applause, cheers, and people shouting your name. You hear them, but as if from a long way away. You are so focused on the game that you have no sense of the people watching you.

It's a tough job that requires a lot of hard work and dedication. To protect your work, you can draw a little 'c' for 'copyright' and put a circle around the letter.<eos>"

Twenty years ago, I was moving house and had a lot of things to get rid of. Among other things, I decided to throw away an electric guitar that my dad had bought me for my 16th birthday. I felt sad about throwing it away, but I took it to the rubbish dump and was about to put it on a pile of rubbish. Suddenly, a young man came up to me and asked if I was going to throw it away. I said yes and he asked if he could have it. I gave it to him and felt sad that I had done that.

A few months later, I received an email from someone I didn't know. It was from a dealer and restorer of guitars called Keith Rushton. He said he had my guitar and offered to sell it back to me. I was so happy to get my guitar back and I started playing it again.

I had forgotten all about my dad's habit of putting name-and-address stickers on everything I had, including my guitar. My dad had been very keen for me to learn the classical guitar, but I couldn't make much progress. So I switched to the electric guitar and started playing undemanding stuff.

Now that I'm learning it again, I guess I'll have to form a band. My son's learning the saxophone; maybe I can play with him. Or maybe there are other people of my age who have had a similar experience to mine. Maybe we could call ourselves 'The Regainers'!'<eos>"

There has been a lot of talk about sleep lately. Sleep is very important for our mental, physical, and social well-being. It seems that people who have the hardest time sleeping appreciate how important sleep is the most.

Dreams are important too. They help us find new patterns and create combinations that break through our usual habits of thinking. When we dream, we bring things together in fresh, often surprising ways.

When we wake up from a dream, our brains are still active. We can use our dreams to fuel our thoughts and creativity. Even a troubling dream can provide some kind of fluency and inspiration.

So, we all need to dream. It is important for our brains to be functioning fully and for us to think creatively and flexibly.<eos>"

It was twenty years ago that Susie Ray left London for a small coastal town in south-west England. She has a studio with a beautiful sea view and hangs photographs of her two daughters on the walls. Susie is a copyist artist who is able to reproduce the richness of an early-20th-century impressionist masterpiece as easily as the brilliance of a 16th-century Caravaggio portrait.

The problem is that Susie is in great demand. She has painted the works of numerous great artists, including Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh. Her reproductions are so faithful that art experts mistake them for the originals.

Susie has always been open about what she does. When she reproduces an old masterpiece, she will make it look as authentic as possible. However, she will put her own signature on the back of the canvas.

When younger painters approach Susie for advice, she stresses the importance of learning to draw and to represent things accurately. She also emphasises how much she’s studied to be able to do what she does.<eos>"

Jordan Romero is 13 years old and wants to be the youngest person to climb Mount Everest. If he succeeds, he could become one of the most famous teenagers of his generation. Young people are spending more time on computers and games consoles, so Jordan hopes to inspire kids to climb their own mountains or venture outdoors. His team includes his father, Paul, and mother, Karen. They call themselves 'Team Romero.' If Jordan can climb Everest and Vinson Massif in Antarctica, he will become the youngest person to have climbed the Seven Summits. Few people achieve this under the age of thirty. Jordan has already climbed five of the Seven Summits and might actually do it before his teenage years are over.

There are some concerns about Jordan's climb. Many people think that it is not a good idea to take a young person up such a dangerous mountain. They worry about the emotional strength and experience of a teenager. However, Jordan's parents believe that their own experience as climbers and their son's development will help him. They also talk to him regularly to make sure he hasn't lost his motivation.

Jordan's climb is also a challenge for him because it is becoming more popular to blog about achievements and turn them into record-setting challenges. This means that Jordan has to offer something spectacular to inspire others. He has to blog about his climb, sit for photo shoots, and give interviews. He has to offer something that is even more impressive than climbing Everest.<eos>"

When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, it's probably not classical music they're listening to. Most people our age can name a lot of pop groups, but ask any of my friends if they know who Brahms was and they probably won't have a clue. I'm doing a music degree, but the people on my course know no more about classical music than anyone else my age. If you don't know who wrote the music, you are unlikely to own any recordings of their work. The statistics are not very encouraging for a lover of classical music. Apparently only a small percentage of concert tickets sold last year were for classical music events, and the average classical recording sells a small number of copies. I still find that hard to believe. So, what has caused this decline in interest for classical music? The main reason is that classical music just doesn't hold much attraction for most people, particularly teenagers. There are a few reasons why teenagers don't like classical music. First, the pace and rhythm of classical music are not very appealing to us. Second, classical music is structurally complex and requires a lot of time and concentration to appreciate. Third, the subject matter of classical music is not very relatable to teenagers. Finally, the way we listen to music has changed. Nowadays, we can find any music we want at the click of a mouse, and the sound track to our lives is rarely classical.<eos>"

Mum caught Jess by the arm and asked her to come with her to the study. There was a painting on the table, which was one of Grandpa's. It was unlike anything he had done before and clearly nowhere near finished. Mum spoke to Jess about the painting and asked her if she knew anything about it. Jess shook her head and said she had never seen it before. The picture was strange and beautiful. There was a river in the picture that was not real. The riverbank was almost insignificant. There were no animals or people in the picture. It felt right that way. Mum spoke again and said the painting had a name. The name was 'River Boy.' The words seemed to carry a strange resonance. Jess looked round at Mum and said, ""There is no boy."" Mum laughed and said, ""Exactly. Strange, isn’t it?""

The painting was unusual because Grandpa never gave his pictures names. He just painted them and left others to make sense of them. Mum was hoping that Jess might know something about the painting. She knew that Jess was a muse for Grandpa. A muse is someone who inspires an artist.<eos>"

When I woke up this morning, I didn't mean to damage my bedroom carpet. It just seemed like a good idea at the time, as things so often do. But afterwards you wonder why you thought that, only by then it’s too late. This is something that happens to me rather a lot.

I have a corner cabinet that Gran gave me when she moved out of her house into a flat. It’s really cute and I keep my collection of shells and fossils and interesting stones there. Gran knew I’d always loved her corner cabinet. I was so excited when she gave it to me.

But the thing is, it is a corner cabinet. That is why it is shaped like a triangle. It has to stand in a corner. I’ve only got two corners in my bedroom. I’d tried fitting Gran’s cabinet into the angle between the roof and the floor, but it was just the tiniest little bit too tall. If I could only slice a couple of centimetres off the bottom of it... That was when it came to me. If I couldn’t slice anything off Gran’s cabinet, how about cutting a hole in the carpet? It just seemed like the obvious solution.<eos>"

The novel 'The Borrowers' is about a family of tiny people who live hidden in the walls and floors of a house. They secretly borrow things from the normal-sized people in order to survive. When I was asked to direct a TV adaptation of the novel, I knew it was going to be hard to live up to people’s expectations. The author had told me she wanted the series to be from the Borrowers' perspective, not a human one, which made filming much more complex.

The most crucial thing was getting the scale right. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans, so I had to be much further away from the camera than on a normal shoot. When filming the human surroundings the Borrowers found themselves in, the crew had to crawl along the ground and film from no higher than 15 centimetres, in order to get the Borrowers' perspective.

One big challenge was finding a way to get the shadows right when the images of the supposedly tiny Borrowers were combined with a background image of ordinary-sized surroundings. We developed a unique technique for this. The costumes were also a big challenge. I had them made out of heavy canvas material so that they stuck out in the way that dolls’ clothes do. Unfortunately, the weather was really hot during filming. I don’t think either of them thanked me for my attention to detail with those costumes!<eos>"

In the United States, teenage girls are expected to be Student Council presidents and have part-time jobs, volunteer, and excel in all of these fields. Being an American teenager today is challenging. Teenagers have a lot of homework, tests, and extra-curricular activities, jobs, chores, and responsibilities at home. They also have to maintain a social life.

Despite these stresses, teenagers still face negative stereotypes. Some people think that teenagers are lazy, disrespectful, rebellious, loud, reckless, and self-absorbed. However, this is not always true. Many teenagers are hard-working and dedicated students. They are also involved in their communities and are always willing to help others.

In addition to their studies and personal activities, teenagers also have to deal with the challenges of sleep deprivation. Many teenagers start their days early and end them late, leaving them with fewer than the recommended nine hours of sleep a night. This can lead to problems in school and other areas of life.

Despite the challenges, teenagers are still making their mark on the world. They are taking the initiative to make their communities better and are proving that they are capable of great things.<eos>"

The Earth to Sky Calculus Club is a group of teenagers who live in Bishop, a mountain town in the US, surrounded by wilderness. They have launched over fifty balloons to the edge of space. It's a long-running science project that includes astronomy experiments and backcountry adventures.

One weekend, I joined the club to release a high-altitude balloon. We inflated the balloon and secured it to a lunch box. Inside the lunch box was a camera, an instrument to measure altitude, and a thermometer. We also attached two GPS trackers to the lunch box.

Finally, it was time for lift-off. We chanted ""five, four, three, two, one"" and the balloon began to ascend. We watched the balloon rise and tracked its path with powerful flashlights. After the launch, some of the students stayed to watch the shooting stars.

The recovery team found the lunch box the next day. It was in a canyon, high on a flat rock, in the middle of a cascading waterfall. Although the camera hadn't recorded any shooting stars, it was a perfect opportunity to argue over the effects of atmospheric waves and share stories of adventure.<eos>"

When you travel by car with your family, even when you're young, you probably know that you're not 'there yet,' even as you ask over and over 'Are we there yet?' It's not 'there' anymore once you get there. It's 'here'. If you really think there's a chance that you're 'there' yet, you should be asking 'Are we here yet?'. And I'm sure there's no one who wishes they were 'there yet' more than the mums and dads fielding that question over and over every single long car trip.

When you're travelling by car, you can have a lot of fun. You can watch DVDs, listen to music, or play puzzles. You can also act as co-pilot and help your parents to keep everything running smoothly. But sometimes, things can go wrong. For example, your brother or sister might put their foot on your side of the seat or hurl their whole body over into your space. If this happens, it can lead to a fight. But don't worry, your parents will be there to help you. They'll yell at your sibling and separate you from them. And once the fight is over, you can continue to enjoy your trip.<eos>"

John and Zuzi Morgan have opened a café in Oxford, UK, where people can enjoy coffee, cake, and board games. They hope that people will enjoy the experience so much that they will want to repeat it. Zuzi explains why they decided to turn their love of tabletop games into a full-time business: 'There's so much technology. Everybody's busy on their mobile phones and other gadgets. We wanted to bring people back together in a way that’s not just staring at screens. It’s a natural thing in people. We're supposed to be together and communicating with each other.'

The games that are played in John and Zuzi's café are called 'Eurogames'. They are known for their gentle themes, such as farming and landscape-building. The first Eurogame was created by a German designer, Klaus Teuber. Players establish settlements on an island and trade resources with the other players. The games that follow this type of game are called 'co-operative' games. In these games, every player wins or loses as a team member. Pandemic, a Eurogame in which players must collaborate to solve global problems, was created by a North American, Matt Leacock. He was inspired by a Eurogame called Lord of the Rings.

The growth of the video games industry has also contributed to the success of these modern, ingeniously designed board games. Video games and board games have learned a lot from each other. More people are open to playing games than ever before. Tabletop gaming has become more than entertainment. It's a way to bring people together and share experiences.<eos>"

We have started using a new piece of equipment called a night-vision scope, which allows us to see the ducks in the dark. We are concerned about black ducks because their numbers have fallen greatly and we don’t know if there is enough food on the east coast for these animals. We have lots of information about their daytime activities, but nothing about what they do at night, because we simply haven’t had the equipment. But this new ‘scope’ will produce really clear pictures, even on moonless nights, so we’ll be able to find out more and make better decisions about looking after the area where they live based on what we learn. It is hard work. There are four of us, each working six hours daily. We have studied ducks in different locations, and I have had to take a boat to some sites and make notes on every duck I see. The weather hasn’t been very helpful – some nights are mild, but more often it’s wet. Oh, and it’s so quiet I’ve needed lots of coffee to stop me falling asleep!

The only other living creatures we saw were dolphins and birds. We stopped for hours to explore the rock pools on the beaches along the coast. They were full of amazing coloured fish. It was great to be able to stop caring about how quickly or slowly the day was passing. We never forgot lunch or dinner, though, which we all made together over camp fires. When I finally fell asleep on the boats each evening, it really felt like stress-free living. When the time came to leave, I was sad. But I knew if I stayed, I'd miss family and friends.

My teacher asked me if I would be interested in training with the team. I enjoyed the session, but I thought I would need to develop my skills before I took part in a real match. It took me a while to agree, but a few weeks later, I found myself playing against a team from another school. My parents came to watch, but it made me more nervous. But it was OK in the end. I practised every day and did really well. I joined an adult team before I moved abroad to a special sports academy in the USA when I was fifteen. The coach there trains Olympic basketball players. It was fantastic to work with him. However, I can’t say I enjoyed my first experience of living far from my parents. At home, I’d never been able to spend much time with my friends due to all the training, so that wasn’t such a change for me. I got used to my new life in the end, though, and my English improved quickly too! I turned professional at the age of eighteen, three years after arriving in the USA. I was taller than most players in the professional league, but I was much too light for my height, so I had to get that right first. I joined a team and have never regretted it.<eos>"

Seven years ago, I was studying tourism in college, but I needed to find a part-time job because my course was expensive. I decided to become a weekend tour guide in my home city, Chicago. It was a lot of fun giving tours to visitors. I got to see the city that I’d been living in my whole life through the eyes of tourists. After finishing my studies, I decided to go into tour guiding full-time. To become a full-time tour guide, I had to learn a lot of things. I had to know a lot about the city, including its history and architecture. I also had to be able to answer hundreds of questions about Chicago. After completing my training, I became a licensed tour guide. Tour guiding is not just about knowing facts. You also need to be able to be entertaining and tell interesting stories. You need to be able to react to changing situations and make sure that visitors are happy. If they are not, they could post a negative review online. Like most tour guides, I know that these reviews are really important, so I make sure that my tours are fun and stress-free.<eos>"

My name is Ella and I'm 22. Last year I went to Thailand for two weeks with my sister Josie. We went to help as volunteers at an elephant sanctuary. It was our first time doing something like that. We collected the elephants' food and washed them in the river. We also led the elephants on foot into the forest area. The evenings were fun. We talked and played games. Now that we're back in the UK, Josie doesn't often talk about Thailand. But if anyone asks her if she enjoyed her time at the sanctuary, she says she loved it.<eos>"

My name is Gina D’Costa and I own a flower shop in the UK. We sell flowers to people who buy them for friends, their homes, or businesses. Sometimes we provide flowers for photoshoots and weddings. One time I decorated a castle with flowers for a wedding. It was a lot of work, but I was proud of the job we had done.

My day starts early, at 4 a.m., when I go to the market to buy fresh flowers. It's usually cold and dark at that time, but I don't mind. The market is full of beautiful flowers from all over the world. I choose the flowers that I think will be best for my customers. Sometimes it's difficult to find the flowers that people want, but I try to get the best possible price.

Back at the shop, I look at customer orders and set up vases with the flowers I've bought. Then I create bunches of flowers and work out how much the orders will cost. Customers are often surprised by how expensive the flowers are, but I sometimes have to ask them to think again about what they'd like.

I like my job because I can put together the nicest possible flowers for the amount of money someone wants to spend. I wouldn't want any other job.<eos>"

My city has a modern cinema that shows all the latest films I want to see, and there are also lots of films for kids at the weekends. It’s close to where I live, but a year ago, I realized something was missing – the experience of discussing a film in detail with a group of people after watching it with them. So, together with two friends, I started a film club. We decided that we didn’t want to hire a cinema to show the films. Instead, we choose a different location in the city each month. For example, we rented an old factory to show a film that was set in Antarctica. It was very cold, and this created the perfect atmosphere for the film, which was brilliant. Some places we use are even free, as the owners make money by selling snacks during the film. We’re happy to make enough to cover our costs – we’re not trying to make a profit. Each time we show a film, everything is a bit easier for us. We also know how many tickets we’ve sold because everything’s online. There’s still always plenty to do, but when people of all ages come up at the end to say what a great experience they’ve had, it’s wonderful. We’ve started a blog, too, because we know that most people now go online for information about films, rather than read reviews in local papers. We’ve also tried putting up a few posters in cafés. Nothing’s as successful as word of mouth, though – people recommending us to their friends.<eos>"

Taking photographs was always my favorite activity when I was a child. When I was 15, I knew that if I wanted to take my hobby to the next level, I had to do something special. So I decided to start a personal project: I would take one photograph every day for a whole year of my life. Many young photographers had done the same thing before me, but it seemed like a really great idea to me. After a few weeks, I put my photos onto a website for young photographers. I was surprised to find that there were others who liked the way I saw and photographed things. I was also enjoying photographing a wide range of subjects. Someone suggested that if my photographs all had a common topic or idea to connect them, my project would be even better. So I began to concentrate more on taking photos of nature scenes, especially of birds and the sky. A lot of them were black and white photographs, which was different to what many other young photographers were doing. As a result, I sometimes had doubts about my project, and I almost gave up several times. But I trusted my own feelings and became more confident about my photographic style and choices. One day I showed my project to my art teacher at school. She told me about a national photography competition for people my age. So I entered some of my photos, just for fun. I’ll never forget the moment when the judges told me that I had won first prize. It was the first time I realised that maybe my photography really was good, and that I might actually be able to work as a professional photographer. I now have my own photography studio and I’ve never regretted my career choice.<eos>"

Last year, I joined the National Youth Challenge (NYC) because I wanted to learn new skills and have new experiences. In the NYC, you can do many different activities to challenge yourself and learn new things. There are different levels, from beginner to advanced, run by adult volunteers called 'leaders'. When you complete each level, you get a certificate.

When I first joined, my leader suggested that my first challenge should be helping to organise activities at a local children’s club for two hours a week. I was a bit hesitant at first, but I decided to take up the challenge. Soon, I was spending all my free time at the children’s club. It meant a lot more to me than just getting the certificate. And when I finished the challenge, the NYC leader let me keep on volunteering at the club because I’d built up some great relationships with the children. Now I’m there for about four hours a week and I always really look forward to going.

Because of what I’ve learned at the children’s club, I’ve decided that when I finish school in three years’ time I want to go to college to become a qualified youth worker – someone who works with children. I’ve never thought about my future job before, and the idea of youth work had never entered my mind. This has been my favourite part of the NYC so far and I’ve improved my own communication skills while at the same time helping others. I’ve got several other NYC certificates now and yes, one of them is for camping.<eos>"

I was born in Denver, USA, and started snowboarding when I was eight years old. My dad took me to a resort in the mountains, about two hours from Denver. The hill was very steep, so my dad had to do a lot of persuading to get me on a board. I was young, so I hadn’t even thought about asking him if I could start snowboarding, but he was already into it and wanted me to love it too. I managed to do well and started competing aged ten. I enjoy taking part in competitions and winning too. I have a lot of fun training and studying during the summer. It’s the best way of dealing with not being able to do what I love so much. I have to think carefully about my future. Snowboarding is such a huge part of my life now, but I also feel it’s important to have something else I can do, just in case I don’t succeed as a professional snowboarder or if I get injured.<eos>"

When I was fifteen, I wanted everything my friends had. I didn't plan ahead, like what I wanted to do when I left school. One day, my best friend got a new phone and I thought I should have one too. My parents said I could only have it if I paid for it myself, so I decided to work part-time and save as much as I could. It was a valuable lesson. I worked every Saturday in a café, but I didn't really enjoy it. My parents suggested starting my own little business instead. I'd seen my mum making necklaces for herself, so I asked if I could have a go at that. It was easy to learn. I sold my first items of jewellery to my friends and family. They were delighted with them, but I still needed convincing that they looked good enough to be popular with the public. There was only one way to find out, so I rented a market stall with my mum. There were lots of tourists where I live, and they bought lots of my things. Soon we were receiving calls from all over the country from people looking to buy more. It was a big success. Since then, I've made thousands of pounds through my business, mostly online. It's been such a lot of fun so far.<eos>"

When Janine Stuart was young, she wrote a novel called Being Amelia which became a bestseller. The book is partly based on Janine’s life. In one interview, Janine said that because of her family’s moves, she had become good at making new friends. She also understood what it was like to be the only new student in a class.

Janine started her novel one summer, when she was feeling bored at home. Her mother had always dreamed of becoming a published author herself, and her teachers had always encouraged her to write. So, it seemed like a natural way for Janine to pass the time.

The book is about a character named Amelia who also faced some difficult challenges. Despite the book having pictures of happy teenagers on the cover, the people in the story actually face some difficult challenges. This is what really allows readers to believe in them.

Janine is still getting used to being a famous writer. She said that she would like to give advice to other young writers, but they have to find what works for them.<eos>"

The castle isn’t very beautiful, but our apartment is comfortable. The island feels very sociable in the summer, and there are often parties on the beach. In the winter, there are not as many people living on the island. But the adults all support each other and help with repairs on the island.

The biggest change for me was travelling by boat every day. I was looking forward to going on stormy days, when there are huge waves, but the ferries don’t run then.

I went to the mountains in northern Scotland with my family, where we saw lots of birds. I spent hours watching them with my parents, who taught me how to tell the difference between species and how to find the best places to see them. It was amazing, and I joined a local young birdwatchers’ club. My goal is to see 200 different bird species, and I’ve almost achieved that. I’ve been to many places to see birds, including Egypt and South America. I also think that birdwatching clubs should try to get more young people interested in this hobby. Everyone needs to connect with nature, whatever their age, and it doesn’t have to cost much money.<eos>"

But my family knew I often became keen on new hobbies and then dropped them, so they thought the same thing would happen with football. But it never did. I was already dreaming of playing football professionally when I was older. And the opportunity came sooner than I’d hoped. I played in local tournaments, and one of the referees noticed that I was a promising player, so he asked the manager of a professional women’s club to watch me play. After that, she asked me to join her club. I started regular training with a big club as a young 13-year-old. I improved enormously.

One of the most interesting things happening in further and higher education in the UK and around the world is the move to encourage novice students to get involved in research as early as possible. Research is not just for famous scholars or scientists. It can also be seen as a natural way to build knowledge and skills.

There are different ways to do research. You can do it in a big way, like the highly trained few who do groundbreaking research, or you can do it in a smaller way, like asking questions about your own interests. No matter how you do it, research is about asking questions, thinking critically about the information you have, and making your own conclusions.

In college and higher education, having an enquiring mind, identifying problems and questions, critically exploring and evaluating information and ideas that you read about or hear about, and constructing your own responses and your own knowledge to add to the debates are all learning activities which are expected of you.

Critical thinking is particularly important in research. We need to be able to not just repeat what we’ve read and take everything in as if it was proven fact, but to engage with it, think about it, test it out, identify whether what we’re being told is presented in such a way as to trick us into agreement, or whether it is logical, reasoned and backed by evidence.<eos>"

Cities have been centers of intellectual life since the 18th century. They provide a place for people to gather and discuss ideas. However, city life is not always easy. It can be exhausting and overwhelming. Scientists have found that cities actually dull our thinking, sometimes dramatically so. One of the main reasons for this is the lack of nature in cities. Studies have shown that people who can see trees from their windows recover more quickly from illness. Even small glimpses of nature improve brain performance.

In recent years, it has become clear that living in cities has a number of negative effects on our mental and physical health. These effects include fatigue, stress, and depression. However, there is also evidence that living in cities can have some positive effects on our creativity and innovation.

The key to mitigating the psychological damage of the metropolis while maintaining its unique benefits is to find ways to integrate nature into city life. This can be done through a variety of methods, such as creating more parks and green spaces, and making it easier for people to access nature.<eos>"

The mind is a complex thing that takes place inside people's heads. We have neuroimaging techniques to prove it. But the study of the mind should not stop at the skin or the skull. There is evidence that things and neurons participate in human cognitive life. From the viewpoint of archaeology, stone objects, body ornaments, engravings, clay tokens and writing systems play an active role in human evolution and the making of the human mind.

The mind and the brain are often equated. Most of what we know about the human mind has been uncovered through isolating people from the material culture they are usually surrounded by in order to study them. But it often goes unnoticed that much of our thinking takes place outside our heads.

My approach sees the human mind as an unfinished project, in a permanent state of on-going evolution. It is important to keep in mind that whatever actual form the 'stick' might have taken in the history of our species, its primary function was that of a pathway instead of a boundary. Through the 'stick', the human species feels, discovers, and makes sense of the environment, but also enacts the way forward.<eos>"

Photography has significantly changed the course of civilization and the way we perceive the world. It has been especially impactful in the United States, where photography quickly became part of American culture at all levels. Historians believe that photography is arguably the country’s greatest single contribution to the visual arts. No other art form has US work loomed so large.

Photography has been appealing because it is a mechanical process that matches the growing enthusiasm for technology in the US. It also brought the wonders and sights of the world into the front room with an immediacy that was breathtaking. Additionally, photography has been important for creating and sustaining impressions of self and family, and for representing everyday realities.

Photographs are records of events, people, and things. They embody a certain objectivity, but also carry with them an inescapable element of subjectivity. If we want to understand a photograph historically, we need to pay attention to its purpose and function within a given cultural matrix.<eos>"

In 1890, William James, an American philosopher and physician, defined psychology as the ""science of mental life."" This definition is still a good starting point for understanding psychology today. We all have a mental life, so we have some idea about what this means. However, even though the concept can be studied in rats and monkeys as well as humans, it remains a somewhat elusive one.

Psychology is about the mind or brain, but psychologists do not understand nearly enough about its workings to be able to comprehend the part that it plays in the experience and expression of our hopes, fears, and wishes, or in our behaviour during experiences as varied as giving birth or watching a football match.

The endeavour of psychology is much like that involved in solving a crossword puzzle. It involves evaluating and interpreting available clues. Complex interactions are the norm rather than the exception in psychology, and understanding them depends on the development of sophisticated techniques and theories.

Psychology has the same goals as any other science: to describe, understand, predict, and learn how to control or modify the process that it studies. Once these goals have been achieved, it can help us to understand the nature of our experience and come to conclusions that can be applied directly to people’s lives.<eos>"

Everyone knows that sports teams have an advantage when they play at home. But does anyone know why? Most of us probably think we do; after all, it seems obvious. But professional sport is changing faster than at any time in its history and much of what we used to take for granted is now open to question.

There are two main reasons why home advantage exists. First, the home team has the advantage of playing in front of their own crowd. The crowd can generate a lot of noise and energy, which can help the home team to perform better. Second, the home team has the advantage of being familiar with their own environment. They know the layout of the field, the weather conditions, and the crowd. This can give the home team an edge in terms of strategy and execution.

However, there are some factors that can reduce home advantage. One factor is travel. If the away team has to travel a long distance to the home team's city, they may be tired and not able to perform as well. Another factor is the weather. If the weather is extreme, such as very hot or very cold, it can also affect the performance of the home team.

Despite these factors, home advantage still exists. There are a number of studies that have shown that home teams win more games than away teams. This is because of the psychological effects that playing at home have on the home team. When the home team is playing at home, they feel more confident and are more likely to win the game.<eos>"

There is a debate about whether talent is born or acquired. However, the majority of experts believe that practice is more important than talent. This is known as the 10,000-hours rule. According to this rule, anyone can become an expert in anything with 10,000 hours of practice. However, this is not always the case. There are many examples where people have not achieved their goals despite practicing for many hours.

Epstein argues that there are two main factors that contribute to excellence: hardware (the product of nature) and software (nurture). He believes that both factors are necessary for an athlete to be successful. However, he also acknowledges that there are some cases where genes really matter.<eos>"

A recent report found that a large number of children living in wealthy industrialized countries feel unhappy, lonely, and dissatisfied. The reason for this unhappiness is that these children have been spending too much time indoors, watching TV or playing on computers, and have lost contact with the natural world.

In her book, Kith, Jay Griffiths argues that this is the heart of the problem. She believes that children need to be allowed to roam and explore the wild woods of their home territory, and to take risks.

A follow-up study to the report interviewed a sample of children and found that a large number said that they would be happier if they could simply go outside more. Many of today’s over-40s talk nostalgically about the freedom of their own youth, and they often forget that they are the ones who have imposed that protective regime on their own children.

Griffiths' book has some good arguments about the importance of children's freedom and autonomy. However, she does not provide enough information about how to achieve this freedom and autonomy.<eos>"

I am a research bio-psychologist with a PhD. I have done a lot of school and I am a good problem-solver. However, my schooling has not helped me solve all of life's problems. Most problems in life cannot be solved with a complex formula or memorized answers. They require the judgement, wisdom and creative ability that come from life experiences.

For children, those experiences are embedded in play. Play is the natural means by which adults and mammals have always educated themselves. The most important skills children everywhere must learn in order to live happy, productive, moral lives are skills that cannot be taught in school. Such skills include the abilities to think creatively, to get along with other people and co-operate effectively, and to control their own impulses and emotions.

Play is also important for social development. Children everywhere are born with a strong drive to play with other children. Such play is the means by which they acquire social skills and practise fairness and morality, which they will need in order to participate fully later in life.

If we care about our children and future generations, we must reverse the horrid trend that has been occurring over the past half century. We must give childhood back to children. Children must be allowed to follow their inborn drives to play and explore, so that they can grow into intellectually, socially, emotionally and physically strong adults fit for an unpredictable future.<eos>"

In many countries, there are a lot of young people in their twenties who use social media to find work. There are two popular social networking sites that are often used for job hunting: Twitter and LinkedIn. These sites offer the chance for direct contact with potential employers. However, with greater access comes a greater chance to make mistakes.

For example, a young jobseeker in the US contacted a senior marketing executive via LinkedIn. The marketing executive had a lot of influential people in her contact list. The young jobseeker felt that he could use this list to help him land a job. However, the marketing executive was not happy with this idea. She sent a rude and sarcastic rejection note that has since gone viral.

If this incident makes young people think more carefully about how they use social media in a professional capacity, it may have actually ended up doing them a favour. It has drawn attention to an unfortunate truth. Social media is a potentially dangerous tool for jobhunters who don’t know how to use it. And a worrying number are getting it wrong.

To be successful on professional networking sites, you need to be clear and concise in your message, and keep the tone humble. You should also avoid sending impersonal, blanket emails. If you do these things, you have a better chance of getting a positive response from potential employers.<eos>"

Newspapers have been struggling in recent years due to declining circulation and the rise of online news. In the UK, the circulation of most national dailies has fallen by a third to half since 2000. Despite the challenges, old media have a habit of surviving. Newspapers were once new media, and they became the dominant medium for news in the mid-19th century thanks to the steam press, the railway, and the telegraph.

Today, we have a wealth of ways to get news online. We can read articles, watch videos, and listen to podcasts. We can also personalize the news to our own interests and priorities. This is a world away from the straitjacket of newspaper publication. Yet few if any providers seem alive to the new medium’s capacity for spreading understanding and enlightenment. Instead, the anxiety is always to be first with the news, to maximise reader comments, to create heat, sound and fury and thus add to the sense of confusion.<eos>"

If humans were truly at home under the light of the moon and stars, we would go in darkness happily. Instead, we are diurnal creatures, with eyes adapted to living in the sun’s light. We have engineered the night to receive us by filling it with light. This kind of control is no different from the feat of damming a river. Its benefits come with consequences – called light pollution.

Light pollution is largely the result of bad lighting design. It washes out the darkness of night, altering light levels and light rhythms to which many forms of life, including ourselves, have adapted. Wherever man-made light spills into the natural world, some aspects of life are affected.

Light is a powerful biological force, and on many species it acts as a magnet attracting them to it. It was once thought that light pollution only affected astronomers, but it also affects other creatures, such as birds and frogs. Denying darkness is futile. It is as essential to maintaining our biological welfare as light itself.

In the end, humans are no less trapped by light pollution than the frogs in a pond near a brightly lit highway. Living in a glare of our own making, we have cut ourselves off from our evolutionary and cultural heritage – the light of the stars and the rhythms of day and night.<eos>"

The founder of a large company recently announced that his company would no longer track employees’ paid holiday time. The company was inspired by an internet company that has implemented a similar policy. The founder's daughter wrote him an email suggesting the idea. The company has 50,000 employees and provides a variety of services. The policy allows employees to take as much leave as they want as long as they feel comfortable that their absence will not damage the business. However, there are some concerns about the practicality of this policy. For example, it could lead to increased guilt and stress for employees, which could in turn lead to a decrease in productivity. Additionally, it could lead to pressure from colleagues and office gossip. The policy could also make it difficult for employees to maintain a healthy work-life balance.

However, there are some concerns about the effectiveness of journal-based peer review. Preprints are a new way to share research papers that have not been peer-reviewed. They bring academics back to what research publication is all about: the rapid dissemination of new results. Preprints also enable informal scientific discussions and provide a platform for negative results.

When I teach literature, students often answer that a poem is like a painting in words. Their answers usually don't satisfy me or them. One day, I asked students to choose an object and write one paragraph describing it empirically and another in the first person, from the point of view of the item itself. The exercise led to much amusement and discussion.

A poem is a thing made, like a painting or a machine. Poets sometimes compare poems to wild animals or machines, but such comparisons don't always hold up. The most productive thing about trying to define a poem is the debate. Whether you view a poem as a machine or a wild animal, this process can change your conception of what a machine or wild animal is.

A poem is a product of writing and rewriting just like an article, story, or novel. It never really becomes what they usually are – a thing created in order to become a commodity.<eos>"

Sleeping is one of my favorite travel experiences, but I don't talk about it very much because I feel a little guilty. When friends share details of their well-planned trips, I smile and don't say much. What would they think if they knew that my own travel itineraries include naps and lazy mornings. Better sleep is one of travel's happy side effects. When I visited Mexico's Yucatán coast, I was surprised by how many hours I spent sleeping. There were lots of noisy birds, but it didn't matter. Surrounded by strange smells and sounds, I could plunge into a sleep that was more profound and dream-filled than I imagined possible. Sleep is something else too: it's an experience that changes rhythm, sometimes dramatically, from place to place. People obsess about jet lag, but I suspect that the difficulties I experience recovering from long journeys have more to do with local and cultural adjustment than time zones. When I finally fall into the local sleep pattern, I feel I have truly arrived.<eos>"

It was her thirtieth birthday today and they were having a family get-together. She was also looking forward to meeting the friend Jen was bringing with her.

An hour later Mia had shut up shop and was letting herself in at the back door of Medlar House. She had a long commute from work. Four years ago, when Luke, the youngest of their children, had left home, Mia had had the idea of converting the unused barn to the side of the house into a light and airy space from which she could run her own business. She knew that there was a demand for hats. From day one, after Jen had helped her to create a website to promote the business, Mia’s Hats was a success.<eos>"

I was flying east all night and woke up to see that it was already daylight. The landscape below was empty and looked like a dream. I could see no signs of human life and the view was amazing. I shook my head and smiled at my neighbour who woke up and smiled at me. He was a salesman from Moscow who was flying to the outer limits of civilisation. His English was not very good, but I managed to explain to him that I was flying to a city in Siberia called Magadan. He said that there was no road from Magadan and I explained that I had reason to believe that there was a road. We talked for a while and I invited him to join me on my trip. He agreed to come and we started planning the trip. It was going to be a long journey and I was excited to see what adventures we would have.<eos>"

In the Red Bull Air Race, twelve pilots race through a series of pylons between 15 and 25 meters high. They negotiate sharp turns, barrel rolls and loops at speeds of up to 370 km per hour. I was invited to find out what it feels like to take part. Before the flight, I had to sign two forms. One confirmed that I was in good health, the other that I would empty all my pockets. I also learned that I would have to try to stay orientated throughout the flight. The pilot explained that I should look at the horizon and relax. I was also asked to promise that when I was flying upside down, I would relax and enjoy the view. Half an hour before the flight, I had a safety briefing in which I was told not to touch anything. By the time we were taxiing down the runway, I was ready to fly. I ignored all instructions received and would not relax and enjoy the flight. This is the cruel paradox of high-speed acrobatic flying. In order to survive it without passing out, you have to keep calm and focused. You have to tense up at the right time and you have to relax at the right time. Panicking is a bad idea. The flight was over in 10 minutes. It had been 'soft' compared to what the pilots endure when they race.<eos>"

Doug Allan is a wildlife cameraman who films wild animals in cold places. If you have ever been amazed by footage of polar bears in a nature documentary, it's probably been filmed by him. Allan was born in a cold place and he has a passion for diving and survival in cold places. He became a marine biologist and commercial diver, and he learned about survival in cold places through diving.

One day, Allan was working in Antarctica when a TV crew turned up to film a wildlife documentary. They asked Allan to take them to different places, and after 48 hours, he realized that being a wildlife cameraman ticked all the boxes: travel, adventure, and underwater.

Allan has worked on many major TV wildlife series. He says that his value is field experience in cold conditions. He has a feel for it, and he has spent a lot of time on sea ice. He also says that wildlife filming is full of great successes, but also failures and embarrassments.

Now Allan would like to make his own film about climate change in the Arctic. He says he would be able to make an extraordinary documentary.<eos>"

In 2004, Pen Hadow became the first person to trek to the North Pole alone and without being resupplied on the way. He swam through cold waters, fought frostbite and polar bears. He also made it to the South Pole the same year. Now he is back in the Arctic preparing for an expedition he says is even more ambitious.

Pen is a confident and driven explorer. He has to be. This time, there is far more at stake. He and two colleagues will set out on a three-month, 1,000 kilometer trek to the North Pole, taking detailed measurements of the thickness and density of the ice. Nobody has ever done this before, and the results will be of vital importance to the scientific community.

Pen is married to Mary, a horsewoman, who says he has a ‘spine of steel’ and who shares his love of the outdoors. They live in the country with their two children. Pen is concerned about being away from his family this time. He knows it will be difficult to stay away from them while he is in the Arctic.

Pen believes his mission reconnects exploration with the search for knowledge that drove previous generations into the unknown. He says, ""Making it to the North Pole was ultimately a personal ambition, and of limited value to anyone beyond the polar adventuring community. This time, scientists will profit from the data, and we’re creating a platform in which to engage as many people as possible in what’s happening in the Arctic Ocean.""<eos>"

I had a break from competition. I was successful as an Olympian, but I didn’t have anything to do. I wanted to stay in shape and be able to fight for an Olympic place if my dream rekindled. So I entered marathons and triathlons. I also spoke to some of my rowing colleagues about a race. I knew that if I entered the race, I would want to win. I also had to take into account the loss of earnings that would result from being away from home. Participating in the race would mean I wouldn’t just be talking about past achievements. I’d actually be doing something again which I could bring in: rowing across the Atlantic. I learned a lot while planning this adventure, but one of the biggest lessons was to be thankful for the easy life of a full-time athlete.<eos>"

Last year, I went to the Arctic Circle in Finland to work with huskies. I was 26 and I was feeling restless. I found a small company run by Anna and Pasi, and they agreed to take me on as a husky dog handler. From December to February, there is plenty of business taking tourists out on sled rides. The work is very physical and the hours are long.

I started packing straight away and I flew to Helsinki. The bus north was long but it was worth it. I arrived at the farm after dark and I was handed a pair of boots and turned out into the cold. I followed the sound of barking and joined the team of huskies. It was a lot of fun and I was able to learn how to drive a snowmobile.

By the end of my first week, I was exhausted but I was also triumphant. I emailed my friends and told them that I could chop with an axe, hammer a nail, and use a circular saw in the snow.<eos>"

On that day, Radcliffe raced past the finish line. The press was there to make sense of her extraordinary run. Her time would have qualified her to compete in the men's marathon at the world championships in Paris. Journalists were interested in her natural treatment, emu oil, which had been recommended by Olympic gold medallist, Cathy Freeman. Radcliffe feels that her achievement never really sank in. She was proud of what she had accomplished and felt that it was what she was meant to do that day. During the race, her husband and coach, Gary Lough, was in a car with her support team, listening to the radio coverage. With 800m left to run, Radcliffe began to calculate. She knew she could finish in under 2 hours 16 minutes if she crossed the line in less than three minutes. She ran the remaining distance in 2 mins 25 secs. At the finish, she was proud of her accomplishment. Many women were inspired to take up long-distance running after seeing Radcliffe's run.<eos>"

When I first started my cookery programme, In Search of Perfection, I was not sure how it would be received. There had been a lot of talk about the food 'revolution' happening in Britain, and I was certain that we had produced a series of programmes that made a genuinely innovative contribution to that. I watched the first programme and was relieved that it was successful. The success of the show paved the way for other fascinating projects, including a book based on my experiences at the restaurant I own. In each project, there is a sense of being on a journey, whether it is into the past, into the mind, or into cookery techniques. I wrote several books in a series called 'Perfection', each one accompanying its own TV programme of the same name. In these books, the journey was often physical, with passports and suitcases and itineraries. The latest book in the series, In Search of Total Perfection, takes you on a journey around the globe to meet extraordinary artisans. These people have spent decades pursuing their own ideals of perfection. Perfection is subjective. Even the simple task of choosing which dishes to include in the series turned out to be a nightmare. Despite the challenges, we eventually came up with a list that included something for everyone. The book and TV series gave me the opportunity to explore memory and nostalgia in food, and to get out and look into all sorts of foods, people and places I'd never encountered before.<eos>"

""It's not good to spend too much time online. You need to get out into the real world,"" Dad said. He's difficult to argue with, so I decided to find out what people who have studied the subject say – and it's quite interesting.

Generally, research shows that most teenagers who use social media have a wide circle of real-life friends, a good sense of identity and belonging, and are developing the essential technical skills we need to be citizens of a digital age.

Social networking has become an integral part of modern childhood. Teenagers don’t just consume media like adults do – they inhabit it. It performs a similar function to hanging around at the youth club, as today’s parents used to do when they were younger.

Adolescence is a time when you are asking, who am I? Social networking can help you develop that self-identity. You can post notices about your favourite music or sports, discover what you enjoy, and you are constantly reminded that other people have different ways of looking at things.

Teenagers who use social networking as a creative force will reap the benefits when they become adults and enter the world of work. Collaboration is a real 21st-century skill, and an important part of being employable in a digital age.<eos>"

When most people think of a family vacation, I guess a road trip through the western states in the US and Canada doesn’t come to mind. However, my parents clearly weren’t looking to put their feet up as they organized our summer vacation this year. My dad seemed to have taken it upon himself to plan the ultimate family bonding trip.

We packed our car full of suitcases, coolers, and clothing. We set off on 'The Family Great American Road Trip'. As we drove west, we stopped at a town in Oklahoma under the darkest star-filled skies in the nation. We learned the rule of the road: cattle get the right-of-way. We moved on to Pagosa Springs, Colorado, and climbed mountains. We learned that what are marked as Jeep roads are best left to Jeep drivers.

Our journey was filled with adventures. We visited Yellowstone National Park and watched the setting sun cast its shadows over bear habitats close to the roads. We also had a close encounter with a bear. After watching a rainstorm blow through, we made our free-fall back south again.

Three thousand photos chronicling our crazy journey waited to be sifted through and rediscovered. I knew that for me, the things I’d remember would be the unplanned, the spontaneous.<eos>"

Rose Frost was sixteen years old and was going to live with her grandmother, Daisy. Her family was separating for two years. Her father had an assignment overseas, and her mother would be joining him, but Rose and her sister Amy were staying in England. Amy was completing her final school courses and would be living under the guardianship of the college Head. It was her last year at school, so it would have been unfair on Amy to move.

Rose was excited about living with her grandmother because she would have her own room, with its own kitchen and study area. She would also have free access to the Internet and phone. Her grandmother was not the typical frail old lady figure, and she seemed to attend more social events than the Queen of England herself.

Rose had a talk with her mother prior to the move. She was sensible and very mature for her age. She knew about healthy eating, about keeping fit, and getting enough sleep. But this time Rose had insisted on one thing: she wanted her independence. She wanted to play music loud if she wanted, and to invite friends over or go out without having to ask permission every time.

Rose was moving to a new school and was excited to start her final two years at school. She felt like a veteran at it now. For Rose, it was a new moment in time, a new glass shard in the mosaic that was her life.<eos>"

My name is Charlotte Grainger. My primary school teacher first thought that I might write a novel. I thought that writing a book would be a big achievement and I didn't know what other teenagers were doing. When I turned 13, I decided to attempt writing a novel. The novel I started then is about to be published. It's a huge achievement. The narrative is assured and action packed. Nothing about it, except the age of its heroine, suggests that it was written by a teenager.

I was surprised to see a teenager sitting in the office of my publishers. But I knew that I was going to interview a 15-year-old girl about her book. The book is a big achievement. It's well-written and exciting. I read a lot of books by famous fantasy writers, but I was worried about whether I was capable of writing a book. I also read a book called How Not to Write a Novel. It helped me to understand the basics of writing.

Getting your book published is hard, no matter your age. But I'm grateful for the support I received. I know that writers sink or swim according to their talents. So I don't take things for granted.<eos>"

Our instructor, Gareth, told us that speed is our friend, not our enemy. We looked down the ski slope and felt nervous. One guy, David, had a lot of experience and he pushed forward, skiing down the slope towards the jump. He hit the ramp and flew upwards, arms flailing in the air. We held our breath. He hit the ground and flipped head-first into the snow. Gareth informed us that speed is an unpredictable beast. I didn’t feel like I was cut out for this freestyle stuff. I had enjoyed messing about on previous skiing holidays, but I knew I wasn’t one of those teenagers who spent their time doing freestyle tricks on ramps and half pipes. I was afraid of being ridiculed. But my parents decided to have a winter holiday at a training centre for freestyle skiing in the US. It had a huge indoor facility near the slopes, with trampolines, and ski jumps covered in artificial snow. We practised our moves indoors and then headed outside to try them for real. It was difficult to convince my body to ignore what my brain was saying and to race straight towards the jump. But I managed to land properly and felt like I was walking on air.<eos>"

Imagine you're riding a rollercoaster in an amusement park. You come to a stop and take a deep breath before the carriage starts to move slowly upwards. There is a pause, then a sharp drop and your stomach is suspended in the air. You feel scared and excited as you hurtle quickly forwards, sharply left, and upside down. Your senses are overwhelmed, and you let out a roar of fear.

Amusement parks are a huge industry that attracts millions of visitors each year. To create the thrills and excitement that guests seek, there are teams of highly inventive engineers and designers. The skill of designing rollercoasters is a complex one. It requires a balance of pleasure and fear, safety and novelty.

The teams behind rollercoasters must work together to create a strong narrative that works with any innovations. They must also consider the physical coaster experience and ensure that the ride is thrilling but safe.

However, as technology has transformed industry after industry, rollercoaster designers will also have to embrace the latest advances, such as virtual reality. But experts say that virtual reality will not replace the physical coaster experience.<eos>"

At 25, Miranda Ellington has accomplished a great deal as a choreographer. She creates works for many theatres and dance companies. She also still dances from time to time. It's surprising to her that she can fit both activities into her busy schedule.

As a choreographer, Miranda is essentially in a teaching role. She enjoys working with young students. She finds that working with students is easier than working with professionals because they're open to taking risks and are hungry for success.

When Miranda starts working with a new group, she concentrates on the dance steps and the music dictates what she does. If dancers aren’t responding well to a particular composer’s music, that can be frustrating, but she still has to find solutions.

Miranda doesn’t believe in attaching herself to one institution. She feels it's valuable to keep establishing contacts with new people. She has to be prepared to adapt the way she works each time she goes somewhere new.

The conversation turns to the recent documentary on professional ballet dancers and choreographers. Miranda says that the documentary does a good job of giving viewers an accurate portrayal of life inside a dance company.

Miranda has done such a range of work that it's hard to categorize her. She sees herself as someone who wants to widen her horizons.<eos>"

A friend asked me why I travel when I can see everything on television. I agreed that you can see amazing things on TV, but why sit at home when there’s so much to experience out there. I guess that conversation gave me the idea for my crazy four-day trip, and a film that aimed to get people to turn off their television sets. I had a mate getting rid of his old sofa, so I fixed it up and connected it to some old seatbelts. I put my luggage on the seats and slept on the sofa each night, including one night on the beach. Several friends joined me on the way, helping to pull the sofa along and encouraging me to keep going. I’ve been on several expeditions on foot in recent years, but this was something completely new. Not only was it the longest distance I have ever walked, but it was also on main roads, which meant I could stop at a roadside café and relax on the sofa with a cappuccino instead of having the wind blowing away my sandwiches while I sit on a rock. I got used to telling people, ""No, I’m not doing it for charity, I’m not training for a marathon"".

My brother was busy, so I decided a group holiday might suit me. The man at the Greek port was curious when I asked for a single ferry ticket. I explained that I wouldn't be alone for long; I'd be joining ten others to swim around the tiny islands. We did a short swim to split us into speed groups, then it was time for our first proper swim. I was nervous because I'd never swum such a long distance in the open sea before. Soon, the waves got bigger and I was at the back of the slow group. I watched faster swimmers moving ahead like dolphins. I wanted to complete this first distance, though, and was delighted when I finally managed it on my own. The following days followed a routine: jumping in; reaching a comfortable speed; stopping to admire the scenery. As the swims grew greater in distance, so did my speed and pleasure at completing them. There seemed little need for the support boat. I can hardly wait to come again next year.<eos>"

I'm glad I started working as a flight attendant. It's not easy, but it's a great job for young people. I've been to many places, including the US and Australia. I work with amazing people, and I have a lot of time off. Life is always exciting, which makes it a great job for a young person like me.

When I was a child, I often flew unaccompanied to boarding school. I felt lonely, so I would ask the flight attendants to let me help give out meals to passengers. Sometimes they would let me. I guess that's what I remembered later, when I was working in the bank and I was feeling unhappy. I decided to look for a new direction and I found the perfect job. There were a lot of young people at the interview, and many were just like me. They were changing careers and they were highly qualified. Before the interview, I practiced what I was going to say. I mentioned my strengths and previous work experience, and I got the job.

I'd recommend this kind of work to anyone. There are so many things that make it worthwhile. The free flights I get aren't the most important thing. Most airline staff are incredibly hard-working, and there's a saying – 'no-one's finished till everyone's finished.' It's like a big family – even though we don’t see each other all the time, we're still close. When I'm not working, I don't have to take work home. And if I do get difficult passengers, which is rare, I always know the flight will soon be over and I'll probably never see them again.<eos>"

Most of the children know how to swim and play table-tennis, but rock climbing is a new experience for most of them. Some children feel very nervous, but after some encouragement they agree to try and they all get to the top in the end. This makes them feel great. We do get children who miss home at the beginning of the week. It's not the really young ones who feel like that the most – it's actually the ten- to thirteen-year-olds. We don't let them use their mobile phones all the time. We tell them they can phone home after lunch and sometimes after dinner. Most children are fine in a couple of days and at the end of their week's stay, they all come up to us and thank us because they have had a great time.<eos>"

Rock the Planet, a musical show where actors also have to be good musicians, opened in London last year. The show was voted 'Best Musical' four times in the USA. It was challenging to do the show with an all-British cast of actors because the UK has limits on how many performances young actors can do. Luckily, the director found plenty of talented UK-based actors. The theatre in London is bigger than the US venue, but it's been full every night.

I met 11-year-old Jamie, one of the show’s actors. He said that he gets paid to play and that he was very pleased with himself when he finally got a song right. He also told me about his school lessons and his classmates' reaction to the show.
