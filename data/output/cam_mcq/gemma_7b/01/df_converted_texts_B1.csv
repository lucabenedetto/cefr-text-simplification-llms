Some time ago, there was a website that talked about the risks of public check-ins. It said that if you post your location online, people you don't know can see it. This made people realize that there are some downsides to sharing everything on the internet.

The internet has a lot of opportunities for people to share their lives. You can write a blog, post photos, and share your thoughts with the world. But you should be careful about what you share online. If you put your personal information on the internet, people might be able to find it and use it against you.

There are some people who have learned from the mistakes of others. Heather Armstrong is one of them. She had a blog where she wrote about her life. One day, someone sent the address of her blog to her boss. As a result, she lost her job. But Armstrong didn't give up. She started a new blog and wrote about her family. Today, she is a successful blogger and her writing supports her family.<eos>"

A long time ago, some scientists started a campaign to warn people about a movie called What the Bleep Do We Know. The movie showed that there is a lot about the universe that we don't understand. Some scientists felt that the movie was dangerous and issued warnings about it. The movie was very popular, but I couldn't see what all the fuss was about at first. However, when the movie moved on to describe some of the new discoveries, I started to see what the fuss was really about. One of the discoveries was that water molecules can be affected by thoughts. I had heard rumours about this before, but the movie gave me some evidence to support it. The evidence was not very convincing, but it was enough to make me believe that the discovery was real. The movie also talked about other discoveries, such as the discovery that the universe is made from an unknown form of matter and is being propelled by a mysterious force known only as 'dark energy'. These discoveries are amazing, but they also make me feel like we are further away from understanding the universe than ever before.<eos>"

Writing novels is like planting a forest, while writing short stories is more like planting a garden. The two processes complement each other, creating a complete landscape that I treasure. Writing novels takes a long time and a lot of commitment, while writing short stories is quicker and easier to complete. It's like going into a room, finishing your work, and leaving. You don’t have to worry about failing. If the idea doesn’t work out, you just shrug your shoulders and move on. Short stories are like soft shadows I have set out in the world, faint footprints I have left behind. They are like guideposts to my heart, and it makes me happy as a writer to be able to share these intimate feelings with my readers.<eos>"

Science is a powerful force that has both improved and threatened human existence. It has made our lives easier and has also challenged our very existence. Science has its beauty and its dangers, and it is important to understand both.

Science has been used to explain the universe and to cure disease. It has also been used to inspire artists and politicians. However, science has also been used to manipulate nature and to create weapons.

The history of science is filled with conflict and change. Scientists come in many colors, and their work is often characterized by conflict. However, science is also a force for progress and change. It has improved our ability to understand the world around us and to predict the future.

Science is not a harmless intellectual pastime. It has become part of the human race’s way of conceiving of and manipulating its future. We need to be aware of the potential dangers of science and to use science responsibly.<eos>"

From around 2015, major publishers started to notice that sales of ebooks had stopped growing, or even fallen in some cases. This made people question whether ebooks would continue to be popular. One publishing executive admitted that the ebooks hype may have been too much, and that his company had lost confidence in the power of the printed word. Despite the evidence, the idea that ebooks will 'kill' print books continues to be discussed. It is important to understand that digital and print can coexist in the market. The potential disappearance of the book does not mean that it will cease to stimulate our imagination or provoke intense debate.

The idea of one medium 'killing' another has been used to describe many new technologies. Even before the invention of digital technologies, people predicted that existing media would die. But new technologies have often found new uses and survived. The same is true for books. As technology changes, we find ourselves longing for what we used to know, but no longer have. This is why entire industries develop around retro products and older technologies.<eos>"

Every day, I wake up early to write about how some of the greatest minds of the past have approached their work. I write about their daily routines and how they made the time to do their best work. I also write about my own struggles with creativity and productivity.

I have a lot of concerns about creativity and productivity. How do you do meaningful creative work while also earning a living? Is it better to devote yourself wholly to a project or to set aside a small portion of each day? And when there doesn’t seem to be enough time for all you hope to accomplish, must you give things up or can you learn to condense activities, to do more in less time, to ‘work smarter, not harder’?

I have tried to provide examples of how a variety of brilliant and successful people have confronted many of the same challenges. I wanted to show how grand creative visions translate to small daily increments; how one’s working habits influence the work itself, and vice versa.

This book is about people’s routines. It’s about the circumstances of creative activity, not the product; it deals with manufacturing rather than meaning. But it’s also, inevitably, personal. I have documented all of my sources in the Notes section, which I hope will also serve as a guide to further reading.<eos>"

Charles Spence is a Professor of Experimental Psychology at Oxford University in the UK. He has studied how the senses interact to form our perception of flavour. Through his studies, he has influenced what we eat and drink. He has also studied how the environment affects taste.

Spence has written a book called The Perfect Meal, which is packed with insights about food and drink. It is a fascinating book for anyone who loves to eat and drink.

Spence's lab is not very high-tech. It has soundproof booths and stacks of ancient-looking audio-visual equipment. He can afford to work more creatively with cooks because he keeps his overheads low.

Spence has been helping famous brands reduce salt and sugar in their products. He says that it is in their interests to help loyal customers stay alive for longer.

Spence has also studied the effects of sound on flavour. He has found that higher-pitched music enhances sweetness, and lower-pitched and brassy sounds make food taste bitter.<eos>"

Our brains are very busy these days. We have a lot of information to deal with, including facts, rumors, and things that are not true. We also do more things ourselves now than we used to. For example, we make our own reservations and find things in shops. We do a lot of different things at once, but it's not always easy to keep up with everything. Our smartphones help us do all of this, but they also make it harder to focus.

When we think we're multitasking, we're actually switching from one task to another very quickly. This is not very efficient. Multitasking can also make us feel stressed and anxious. It can also make it harder to learn new information. If you do your homework and watch TV at the same time, the information from your schoolwork will not go to the right part of your brain.

Multitasking also requires a lot of decision-making. This can be very tiring for our brains. If we make a lot of small decisions, we can end up making a big decision that is not very well thought out. This is because our brains are not wired to multitask well. We are more like amateur plate spinners, frantically switching from one task to another, ignoring the one that’s not right in front of us but worried it’ll come crashing down any minute.<eos>"

In a zoo in Sweden, a chimpanzee named Santino would break up concrete into pieces at night and throw them at visitors during the day. Was he being spiteful? In caves in the US, female bats help unrelated fruit bat mothers if they can’t find the right birthing position. Are they being caring? Fifty years ago, people thought that animals didn’t have consciousness, feelings or moral systems. But recently that has partially changed. Thanks to research into the behaviour of bats, chimps, and other animals, emotions of animals have gone from being a taboo area of investigation to being tentatively explored. It is a change that has in recent years filtered through the scientific strata to a selection of popular science books. And it has started a debate that may never be solved by science: can animals be said to have consciousness?

The debate about animal consciousness raises a second question: conscience – a person’s moral sense of right and wrong that guides their behaviour. In a recent experiment involving cows, it became apparent that those that successfully opened the gate themselves showed more pleasure than those that had to have the gate opened for them. If, as this research seems to imply, cows enjoy problem-solving, what does it mean for the production and consumption of beef? The observations may not be disputed, but the interpretation of them is. There are different views on what the new research means for the future of meat consumption. Some people believe that we should stop eating meat altogether, while others believe that we should at the very least re-evaluate our view of animal cognition. The debate is ongoing and there is no clear answer.<eos>"

Critical thinking is a way of understanding things more deeply. It involves interacting with what we read or listen to in a way that helps us to think more deeply. There is a belief that argument is a way of finding the truth. Although technology can help us store and process information, it can also make it more difficult to think critically.

There are a number of things that can make it more difficult to think critically. One is the amount of poor yet charismatic thinking that we are exposed to. Another is the overwhelming amount of information that we have access to. And finally, the fact that visual media often do not allow us to reflect or analyze information.

However, there are also some ways that technology can help us to think critically. One is the fact that it can make it easier to access information. Another is the fact that it can make it easier to connect with others who are thinking critically. And finally, the fact that it can make it easier to learn new things.

It is important to understand the subtleties of how technology affects thinking and analysis. By understanding these subtleties, we can make sure that we are using technology in a way that helps us to think critically.<eos>"

When Matthew Crawford is not writing or thinking about how we should live, he works as a motorcycle mechanic. He wrote two books about the benefits of manual trades and how to cope with modernity.

Crawford says that our attention is being pulled away by many things, including advertisements, video games, and our phones. He also says that we are more conscious of other things we might be doing.

Crawford's proposed solution has two parts. First, we need regulation of noise and distraction in public space. More importantly, though, Crawford advocates skilled practices as a way of engaging with the world in a more satisfying way.

For example, if you like to cook, you can practice cooking. If you like to play hockey, you can practice playing hockey. If you like to ride motorcycles, you can practice riding motorcycles.<eos>"

""What do you do for a living?"" is a common question that people often ask. If you are a philosopher, it can be a little harder to answer this question. This is because philosophers have established themselves as people who judge the activities of others and celebrate intellectual life. They also have a lot of academic training and often write books about their ideas.

However, you don't have to be a philosopher to benefit from philosophy. You can learn from the ideas of philosophers by reading books, articles, or watching videos. You can also talk to people who are interested in philosophy.

Philosophy can help you to think more clearly about your own beliefs and values. It can also help you to understand the world around you better. If you are interested in learning more about philosophy, there are many resources available to you. You can find books, articles, and videos online.

Foodies, gourmands, chefs and others who love food might expect that thinking critically about what and how we eat can contribute to culinary pleasure. However, historically, philosophical discussions about food have been mostly about other topics, such as the acquisition of knowledge. Sometimes, philosophical conversations about food appear to be about other things, but when you look closer, you find that they are actually about deeper, but loosely connected, points.

It is interesting to note the case of the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus, who believed that the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain should be the goal of life. Epicurus' name is often used to describe people who love to eat and drink. It is also used in the names of restaurants, food shops and online recipe sites.

Food is inherently social and cultural. It is shared with our communities and provides us with dining companions and infrastructure. We interact with food more frequently and in more fundamental ways than any other commodity. So, it is an obvious topic for philosophical enquiry.

There are also ethical issues that attach to food. We can ask what we should eat and why the answers are what they are. And philosophers will always ask why the answers are what they are. Engaging in such academic debate is fully justified in relation to food.<eos>"

Rob Daviau is a US designer who creates 'legacy' board games. These games are different from traditional board games because they have a permanent impact on the game. For example, in one game called Risk Legacy, players might have to rip up cards, deface the board, or open packets containing new rules. The games play out over a fixed number of sessions and long-held grudges become woven into the fabric of the game.

Legacy board games were not expected to become popular, but most players love the concept. They see it as one of the biggest advances in game design for several years. The legacy format draws on video games and the demand for episodic entertainment fuelled by popular TV series.

Daviau feels a sense of ownership, but he is also keen to see where others take the idea. He suspects gamers will soon be asking: 'Enough of that, what's new?'<eos>"

Once upon a time, there was an octopus named Inky who lived in a tank at the New Zealand National Aquarium. One night, Inky managed to escape from his tank and swim across the floor to a drain that led to the Pacific Ocean. It was a story that was shared online and was very popular.

One of the reasons why people find stories like Inky's so interesting is because they involve anthropomorphism, which means treating animals like humans. In the case of octopuses, this pleasure is especially pronounced because of their intelligence and their bodies that are very different from our own.

Scientists have found that animals have many of the same abilities as humans, such as the ability to consider the past and the future, to demonstrate empathy and self-awareness, and to anticipate the motives of others. However, animals do not have fully-developed language like humans.

There are some people who believe that anthropomorphism is unscientific. However, Dr. Frans de Waal, who studies primates, argues that it is not unscientific, but rather the opposite – an unwillingness to recognize the human-like traits of animals.

De Waal believes that we are emerging from a dark period where animals were not treated very well. He also believes that the times are changing and that people are learning to appreciate animal intelligence more.<eos>"

Once upon a time, there was a technology called robotics that has the potential to change the world. Robots have already been used in the automotive and manufacturing industries for many years. Now, experts are saying that robots will soon be used in many other industries.

One of the main challenges with the widespread use of robots is that it will lead to job loss. However, experts also say that it will create new jobs. For example, there will be more demand for technicians and programmers.

Another challenge is that society is not prepared for the changes that robots will bring. For example, robots will make it easier for people to interact with each other. This could lead to changes in the way we work and socialize.

Despite the challenges, experts believe that robotics has the potential to improve our lives. For example, robots can help us to be more efficient and productive. They can also help us to live longer and healthier lives.

In order to prepare for the robotic workforce of tomorrow, we need to invest in education and training programs. We also need to develop new regulatory frameworks to ensure our safety and privacy.<eos>"

Because there is a place for climbers to climb, George Mallory said that he wanted to climb Mount Everest. People often wonder why people climb mountains. It is possible that the climber’s answer may inspire some to act on their dreams. Climbing can give people a feeling of freedom, but it can also be very confining. There is an apparent paradox in many forms of climbing. However, climbing can also help cultivate important virtues such as courage, humility and respect for the environment.

When people ask ""Why climb?"", US rock climber Joe Fitschen suggests that a better question would be ""Why do people climb?"". Climbing is in our genes and it is inherent in our basic makeup to take on challenges and test limits. Climbing can also help develop important virtues such as courage, humility and respect for the environment.<eos>"

My grandparents' garden was a beautiful place. It was on the bank of a river and sloped gently down towards the water. You couldn't reach the river but you could hear the sound of the water and the birds that sang in the trees above. I imagined that all gardens were like this – a place of escape, peace and solitude.

My father was a quiet and withdrawn person. He had a few phrases that he liked to use, one of them being 'It's immaterial to me'. He was probably disappointed that he hadn't made more of his life. He left school without qualifications and became apprenticed to a plumber. Plumbing was not something he was passionate about. It was just what he did.

I always wanted to like the piano but it did its best to intimidate me. The only thing I did like about it were the two brass candlesticks that jutted out from the front. I'd walk along the river bank looking for a suitable spot where I could take off the painful sandals and leave them with my picnic while I ventured out, tentatively, peering through the water for any fish that I could scoop up with the net and take home.

One day my father announced that there was a vacancy for an apprentice gardener in the Parks Department. I thought you might be interested. I like to feel that somewhere deep down inside him, although he hated gardening himself, he'd watched me doing it for long enough and noticed the keenness and the passion for all things that grew and flowered and fruited that hadn't disappeared.<eos>"

They assume that our conversations about the weather are actually about the weather. This is not true. Our conversations about the weather are not really about the weather at all.

Shirley talked about what it takes to do voiceovers. You have to bring the script to life for an audience who can’t see you. You also have to be able to create the right sounds from the back of your throat.

After school, Shirley enrolled on a drama course and had some occasional work singing jingles for TV adverts. One day, she was asked to try out for the part of a rabbit in the soundtrack for a cartoon. Amazingly, she ended up getting a major part.

Twenty years ago, I was moving house and had a lot of things to get rid of. I decided to throw away an electric guitar that my dad had bought me for my 16th birthday. I felt sad about throwing it away, but I took it to the rubbish dump and was about to put it on a pile of rubbish. Suddenly, a young man came up to me and asked if I was going to throw it away. I said yes and he asked if he could have it. I gave it to him and felt sad that I had thrown it away.

A few months later, I got an email from someone I didn't know. It was from a dealer and restorer of guitars called Keith Rushton. He said he had my guitar and offered to sell it back to me. I was so happy to get my guitar back and I started playing it again.

I had forgotten all about my dad's habit of putting name-and-address stickers on everything I had, including my guitar. My dad had been very keen for me to learn the classical guitar, but I couldn't make much progress. So I switched to the electric guitar and started playing undemanding stuff.

Now that I'm learning it again, I guess I'll have to form a band. My son's learning the saxophone; maybe I can play with him. Or maybe there are other people of my age who have had a similar experience to mine. Maybe we could call ourselves 'The Regainers'!'<eos>"

There has been a lot of talk about sleep lately. Sleep is very important for our mental, physical, and social well-being. It seems that people who have the hardest time sleeping appreciate how important sleep is the most.

Dreams are important too. They help us find new patterns and create combinations that break through our usual habits of thinking. When we dream, we bring things together in fresh, often surprising ways.

When we wake up from a dream, our brains are still active. We can use our dreams to help us think creatively and flexibly. We need to dream in order to function fully in our complex world.<eos>"

It was twenty years ago that Susie Ray left London for a small coastal town in south-west England. She has a studio with a beautiful sea view and hangs photographs of her two daughters on the walls. Susie is a copyist artist who can reproduce the richness of an early-20th-century impressionist masterpiece as easily as the brilliance of a 16th-century Caravaggio portrait.

The problem is that Susie is very popular. She has painted the works of numerous great artists, including Renoir, Monet and Van Gogh. Her reproductions are so faithful that art experts mistake them for the originals.

Susie has always been open about what she does. When she reproduces an old masterpiece, she will make it look as authentic as possible. However, she will put her own signature on the back of the canvas.

When younger painters approach Susie for advice, she stresses the importance of learning to draw and to represent things accurately. She also emphasises how much she’s studied to be able to do what she does.<eos>"

Jordan Romero is 13 years old and wants to be the youngest person to climb Mount Everest. If he succeeds, he could become one of the most famous teenagers of his generation. Young people are spending more time on computers and games consoles, so Jordan hopes to inspire kids to climb their own mountains. He wants to encourage kids to venture outdoors. Jordan's team for the climb includes his father, Paul, and mother, Karen. They call themselves 'Team Romero.' If Jordan can climb Everest and Vinson Massif in Antarctica, he will become the youngest person to have climbed the Seven Summits. Few people achieve this under the age of thirty. Jordan has already climbed five of the Seven Summits and might actually do it before his teenage years are over.

There are some concerns about Jordan's climb. Some people think that a young climber might not be emotionally strong enough or have enough experience. But Jordan's parents believe that their own experience as climbers will help them. They also think that watching Jordan develop gives them confidence.

Jordan's motivation is also a question. Is this just an ambitious father taking his own love of adventure to a dangerous extreme? But Paul insists that this project isn't about him trying to become famous for his son's achievements. He says, 'If Jordan comes home tomorrow and says he's done with mountain climbing and wants to play basketball instead, we’ll shut this whole project down and go to the gym.'<eos>"

When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, it's probably not classical music they're listening to. Most people our age can name a lot of pop groups, but ask any of my friends if they know who Brahms was and they probably won't have a clue. I'm doing a music degree, but the people on my course know no more about classical music than anyone else my age. If you don't know who wrote the music, you are unlikely to own any recordings of their work. The statistics are not very encouraging for a lover of classical music. Apparently only a small percentage of concert tickets sold last year were for classical music events, and the average classical recording sells a small number of copies. I still find that hard to believe. So, what has caused this decline in interest for classical music? The main reason is that classical music just doesn't hold much attraction for most people, particularly teenagers. There are a few reasons why teenagers don't like classical music. First, the pace and rhythm of classical music are not very appealing to us. Second, classical music is structurally complex and difficult to listen to. Third, the subject matter of classical music is not very relatable to teenagers. Finally, the way we listen to music has changed. Nowadays, we can find any music we want at the click of a mouse, and the sound track to our lives is rarely classical.<eos>"

Mum caught Jess by the arm and asked her to come with her to the study. There was a painting on the table, which was one of Grandpa's. It was unlike anything he had done before and clearly nowhere near finished. Mum spoke to Jess about the painting and asked her if she knew anything about it. Jess shook her head and said she had never seen it before. The picture was strange and beautiful. There was a river in the picture that was not real. The riverbank was almost insignificant. There were no animals or people in the picture. It felt right that way. Mum spoke again and said the painting had a name. The name was 'River Boy'. The words seemed to carry a strange resonance. Jess looked round at Mum and said, ""There is no boy."" Mum laughed and said, ""Exactly. Strange, isn’t it?""

The painting was unusual because it had a name. Mum thought that it was a good painting and she was hoping that Jess might know something about it.<eos>"

When I woke up this morning, I didn't mean to damage my bedroom carpet. It just seemed like a good idea at the time. I was trying to find a way of fitting my corner cabinet into a corner. Gran had given me the cabinet when she moved out of her house into a flat. It's really cute.

But the thing is, it is a corner cabinet. That is why it is shaped like a triangle. It has to stand in a corner. I've only got two corners in my bedroom. I'd tried fitting Gran’s cabinet into the angle between the roof and the floor, but it was just the tiniest little bit too tall. If I could only slice a couple of centimetres off the bottom of it... That was when it came to me. If I couldn’t slice anything off Gran’s cabinet, how about cutting a hole in the carpet? It just seemed like the obvious solution.<eos>"

The novel 'The Borrowers' is about a family of tiny people who live hidden in the walls and floors of a house. They borrow things from the normal-sized people in order to survive. When I was asked to direct a TV adaptation of the novel, I knew it was going to be hard to live up to people’s expectations. The author had told me she wanted the series to be from the Borrowers' perspective, not a human one, which made filming much more complex.

The most crucial thing was getting the scale right. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans, so I had to be much further away from the actors than I would normally be. When filming the human surroundings the Borrowers found themselves in, the crew had to crawl along the ground and film from no higher than 15 centimetres, in order to get the Borrowers' perspective.

One big challenge was finding a way to get the shadows right when the images of the supposedly tiny Borrowers were combined with a background image of ordinary-sized surroundings. We developed a unique technique for this. The costumes were also a big challenge. They had to be made out of heavy canvas material so that they stuck out in the way that dolls’ clothes do. Unfortunately, the weather was really hot during filming. I don’t think either of them thanked me for my attention to detail with those costumes!<eos>"

Mom pulled up at the corner of my new school, Palm Grove High School. She looked around nervously, searching for journalists that weren’t there.

Chloe Morgan loves science, especially Palaeontology. She started to be interested in the subject when she was fifteen. It happened by chance when her younger brother was going through the dinosaur phase. Chloe was reluctant to help at first, but she ended up lending him a hand with a science project. She also found an article about recent discoveries in Palaeontology that blew her mind. She knew that this was something she wanted to commit herself to.

Paleontology is not a common career choice for young people, but Chloe was determined to make it her dream. She met her first professional palaeontologist, Matt Cornelius, who was famous already despite being quite young. They talked for a while and Chloe felt more at ease. She was worried that he would think she was annoying, but he was patient and willing to listen.

Dinosaurs continue to fascinate us because they speak to the innate explorer in all of us. They are mysterious and there is much to learn about them. Palaeontology is a great form of time travel. It allows us to learn about the past and to appreciate the beauty of the natural world.<eos>"

When you travel by car with your family, even when you're young, you probably know that you're not 'there yet,' even when you ask over and over 'Are we there yet?' It's not 'there' anymore once you get there. It's 'here'. If you really think there's a chance that you're 'there' yet, you should be asking 'Are we here yet?'. And I'm sure there's no one who wishes they were 'there yet' more than the mums and dads fielding that question over and over every single long car trip.

When you're travelling by car, you can have a lot of fun. You can watch DVDs, listen to music, or play puzzles. You can also act as co-pilot and help your parents to keep the car running smoothly. But sometimes, things can go wrong. For example, your brother or sister might put their foot on your side of the seat or start acting out. If this happens, you might get angry and start fighting. But don't worry, your parents will probably be there to help you. They'll yell at your sibling and separate you from them. And once the fighting is over, you can relax and enjoy your trip.<eos>"

We have started using a new piece of equipment called a night-vision scope, which allows us to see the ducks in the dark. We are worried about black ducks because their numbers have fallen hugely. We don’t know whether there’s enough food on the east coast for these animals. We have lots of information about their daytime activities, but nothing about what they do at night, because we simply haven’t had the equipment. But this new ‘scope’ will produce really clear pictures, even on moonless nights, so we’ll be able to find out more and make better decisions about looking after the area where they live based on what we learn. It is hard work. We work six hours a day. We have studied ducks in different locations. I have had to take a boat to some sites and make notes on every duck I see. The weather hasn’t been very helpful. Sometimes it is mild, but more often it is wet. Oh, and it is so quiet I need lots of coffee to stop me falling asleep!

Have you ever wondered what it's like to perform in a circus? Sophia Grayson is from Circus Experience, a centre that teaches young people circus skills. She says her course is popular because it includes many skills, such as juggling, throwing and catching things, trapeze, which involves flying through the air, and other circus skills. On the year-long course, students gradually increase the amount of risk they take in each class and parents come along to certain classes to watch progress.

To be successful in the circus, you must keep practising and be fit. You also need to have imagination and never stop improving your skills. Being fit is very important for circus artists, like athletes, who train daily to keep strong. Training is very important, but the best performers are those who want success, have imagination and never stop improving skills.

The course also covers business planning. Many previous students set up businesses all over the world, and are happy to share their experiences. However, Sophia warns, it's not a profession for making money. ""The work typically means not having a regular salary. It's also competitive - but great fun!""<eos>"

Sometimes we also provide flowers for photo sessions and weddings. One time I decorated a castle with flowers for a wedding. It was a lot of work, but I was proud of the job we’d done. My day starts early, usually around 4 a.m., when I go to the market to buy fresh flowers. It’s cold and dark at that time, but I don’t mind. The market has a lot of different flowers. I like to choose flowers that are pink, but I have to remember that what I like and what other people want are not necessarily the same thing. Sometimes I have to argue with the flower-sellers about prices, but it’s a necessary part of the job. Back at the shop, I look at customer orders and set up vases with the flowers I’ve bought. Then I create bunches of flowers and work out how much the orders will cost. Customers are often surprised by how expensive the flowers are, but I sometimes have to ask them to think again about what they’d like. I like thinking about how I can put together the nicest possible flowers for the amount of money someone wants to spend. That’s what you have to do when you’re selling things. I wouldn’t want any other job.<eos>"

My city has a modern cinema that shows all the latest films I want to see, and there are also lots of films for kids at the weekends. It’s close to where I live, but a year ago, I realized something was missing – the experience of discussing a film in detail with a group of people after watching it with them. So, together with two friends, I started a film club. We decided that we didn’t want to hire a cinema to show the films. Instead, we choose a different location in the city each month. For example, we rented an old factory to show a film that was set in Antarctica. It was very cold, and this created the perfect atmosphere for the film, which was brilliant! Some places we use are even free, as the owners make money by selling snacks during the film. We’re happy to make enough to cover our costs – we’re not trying to make a profit. Each time we show a film, everything is a bit easier for us. We also know how many tickets we’ve sold because everything’s online. There’s still always plenty to do, but when people of all ages come up at the end to say what a great experience they’ve had, it’s wonderful. We’ve started a blog, too, because we know that most people now go online for information about films, rather than read reviews in local papers. We’ve also tried putting up a few posters in cafés. Nothing’s as successful as word of mouth, though – people recommending us to their friends.<eos>"

Taking photographs was always my favorite activity when I was a child. When I was 15, I knew that if I wanted to take my hobby to the next level, I had to do something special. So I decided to start a personal project: I would take one photograph every day for a whole year of my life. Many young photographers had done the same thing before me, but it seemed like a really great idea to me. After a few weeks, I put my photos on a website for young photographers. I was surprised to find that there were others who liked the way I saw and photographed things. I was also enjoying photographing a wide range of subjects. Someone suggested that if my photographs all had a common topic or idea to connect them, my project would be even better. So I began to concentrate more on taking photos of nature scenes, especially of birds and the sky. A lot of them were black and white photographs, which was different to what many other young photographers were doing. Sometimes I had doubts about my project, and I almost gave up several times. But I trusted my own feelings and became more confident about my photographic style and choices. One day I showed my project to my art teacher at school. She told me about a national photography competition for people my age. So I entered some of my photos, just for fun. I’ll never forget the moment when the judges told me that I had won first prize. It was the first time I realised that maybe my photography really was good, and that I might actually be able to work as a professional photographer. Now I have my own photography studio and I’ve never regretted my career choice.<eos>"

Last year, I joined the National Youth Challenge (NYC) because I wanted to learn new skills and have new experiences. In the NYC, you can do many different activities to challenge yourself and learn new things. There are different levels, from beginner to advanced, run by adult volunteers called 'leaders'. When you complete each level, you get a certificate.

When I first joined, my leader suggested that my first challenge should be helping to organise activities at a local children’s club for two hours a week. I was a bit hesitant at first, but I decided to take up the challenge. Soon, I was spending all my free time at the children’s club. It was a lot more to me than just getting the certificate. I also made some great friends and learned new skills.

Now I’m there for about four hours a week and I always really look forward to going. Because of what I’ve learned at the children’s club, I’ve decided that when I finish school in three years’ time I want to go to college to become a qualified youth worker. I never thought about my future job before starting at the club. This has been my favourite part of the NYC so far and I’ve improved my own communication skills while at the same time helping others.<eos>"

I was born in Denver, USA. When I was eight years old, my dad took me to a resort in the mountains, about two hours from Denver. The hill was very steep, so my dad had to do a lot of persuading to get me on a board. I was so young, I hadn’t even thought of asking him if I could start snowboarding, but he was already into it and wanted me to love it too. I managed to do well. After this experience, I started to love snowboarding and improve my ability. I started competing aged ten. I enjoy taking part in competitions and winning too. I also get to spend lots of time with my friends. It’s the best way of dealing with not being able to do what I love so much. I have to think carefully about my future. Snowboarding is such a huge part of my life now, but I also feel it’s important to have something else I can do, just in case I don’t succeed as a professional snowboarder or if I get injured.<eos>"

When I was fifteen, I wanted everything my friends had. I didn't plan ahead, like what I wanted to do when I left school. One day, my best friend got a new phone and I thought I should have one too. My parents said I could only have it if I paid for it myself, so I decided to work part-time and save as much as I could. It was a valuable lesson. I worked every Saturday in a café, but I didn't really enjoy it. My parents suggested starting my own little business instead. I asked my mum if I could have a go at making necklaces. It was easy to learn. I sold my first items of jewellery to my friends and family. They were delighted with them, but I still needed convincing that they looked good enough to be popular with the public. There was only one way to find out, so I rented a market stall with my mum. Lots of people bought my things. Soon we were receiving calls from all over the country from people looking to buy more. It was a big success. Since then, I've made thousands of pounds through my business, mostly online. It's been such a lot of fun so far.<eos>"

My name is Tom. I am fifteen years old. Three years ago, my family and I moved to a castle on a small island. My dad was invited to be the manager of the castle. He works for an organisation that looks after historical buildings. It was a long time before the rest of us agreed Dad should take the job. But once we moved, we quickly got used to island life. The castle isn’t very beautiful, but our apartment is comfortable. The island feels very sociable in the summer, and there are often parties on the beach. In the winter, there are not as many people living on the island. But the adults all support each other and help with repairs on the island. The biggest change for me was travelling by boat every day. I was looking forward to going on stormy days, but the ferries don’t run then. And I’ve discovered that if I miss the bus to the harbour after school, I also miss the last ferry home. So I always tell my schoolmates to hurry up when they come home to stay with me.<eos>"

I live in a beautiful house in Scotland, surrounded by countryside. I love nature and wild animals, and I started a new hobby called birdwatching six years ago. I went to the mountains in northern Scotland with my family, where we saw lots of birds. I spent hours watching them with my parents, who showed me how to tell the difference between species and how to find the best places to see them. It was amazing, and I joined a local young birdwatchers’ club. My goal is to see 200 different bird species, and I’ve almost achieved that. I’ve been to many places to see birds, including Egypt and South America. I also think that birdwatching clubs should try to get more young people interested in this hobby. Everyone needs to connect with nature, whatever their age, and it doesn’t have to cost much money.<eos>"

I started playing football when I was 7. I would rush home from school to play with other boys and girls. I loved it, and I was good at it. But my family thought that I would drop out like I had with other hobbies. But it never did. I was already dreaming of playing football professionally when I was older. And the opportunity came sooner than I’d hoped. I played in local tournaments, and one of the referees noticed that I was a promising player. He asked the manager of a professional women’s club to watch me play. After that, she asked me to join her club. I started regular training with a big club as a young 13-year-old. I improved enormously. But people still weren’t sure I’d ever be a star player, which made me feel a bit upset. But my coach encouraged me to just be myself, and believe in myself. He even let me play in one of the club’s championship matches, much earlier than I’d expected. I’ve never run so hard in my life – I didn’t want the other players to blame me for losing. Then by pure luck, I got the winning goal. And next month, I’m running a football tournament in my area. The aim is to get teenagers interested in football, and to have a chance to chat to other players in my club.<eos>"

One of the most interesting things happening in higher education in the UK and around the world is that students are being encouraged to do research earlier in their studies. This means that research is not just for famous scholars or scientists. It can also be done by everyone.

There are different ways to do research. You can do it by reading books, articles, and websites. You can also do it by talking to people and asking questions. If you are a student, you can make a contribution to knowledge by making your own research. You can do this by asking questions, finding answers, and sharing your findings with others.

Critical thinking is an important part of research. It means that you need to be able to think about what you read and hear, test it out, and identify whether it is logical and backed by evidence. You should not just take everything you read or hear as fact. Instead, you should question it and think about it for yourself.<eos>"

Cities have been centers of intellectual life since the 18th century. They have also been places where people have faced challenges. For example, the same cafes in London that stimulated discussion also spread cholera. The modern city is a place of creativity, but it is also a place where people feel overwhelmed. Scientists have begun to study how the city affects the brain, and the results are alarming. They have found that cities actually dull our thinking, sometimes dramatically so. One of the main reasons for this is the lack of nature in cities. Studies have shown that people who can see trees from their windows recover more quickly from illness. Even small glimpses of nature improve brain performance. The city is full of distractions and requires a lot of attention. It is like a powerful supercomputer that is constantly being overloaded. Natural settings, on the other hand, don't require as much attention. They allow us to relax and replenish our brains. If you are experiencing mental problems, you should consider taking a walk in a natural place.<eos>"

The mind is a complex thing that takes place inside people's heads. We have neuroimaging techniques to prove it. But the study of the mind should not stop at the skin or the skull. There is evidence that things and neurons participate in human cognitive life. From the viewpoint of archaeology, stone objects, body ornaments, engravings, clay tokens and writing systems play an active role in human evolution and the making of the human mind.

The mind and the brain are often equated. Most of what we know about the human mind has been uncovered through isolating people from the material culture they are usually surrounded by in order to study them. But it often goes unnoticed that much of our thinking takes place outside our heads.

My approach sees the human mind as an unfinished project, in a permanent state of on-going evolution. It is important to keep in mind that whatever actual form the 'stick' might have taken in the history of our species, its primary function was that of a pathway instead of a boundary. Through the 'stick', the human species feels, discovers, and makes sense of the environment, but also enacts the way forward.<eos>"

Photography has had a significant impact on the United States. It became part of US culture at every level, from the practical and scientific, to the industrial, to the aesthetic. Historians say that photography is arguably the country’s greatest single contribution to the visual arts. In no other art form has US work loomed so large.

Photography has been appealing because it is a mechanical process that matches a growing enthusiasm for technology. It also brought the wonders and sights of the world into the front room with an immediacy that was breathtaking. Additionally, photography has been important for creating and sustaining an impression of self and family, and for representing everyday realities.

If we want to understand a photograph historically, we need to pay attention to its purpose and function within a given cultural matrix. We also need to consider the placement and framing of the image.<eos>"

In 1890, William James, an American philosopher and physician, defined psychology as the 'science of mental life.' This definition is still a good starting point for understanding psychology today. We all have a mental life, so we have some idea about what this means. However, even though the concept can be studied in rats and monkeys as well as humans, it remains a somewhat elusive one.

Psychology is about the mind or brain, but psychologists do not understand nearly enough about its workings to be able to comprehend the part that it plays in the experience and expression of our hopes, fears, and wishes, or in our behaviour during experiences as varied as giving birth or watching a football match.

The endeavour of psychology is much like that involved in solving a crossword puzzle. It involves evaluating and interpreting available clues. Complex interactions are the norm rather than the exception in psychology, and understanding them depends on the development of sophisticated techniques and theories.

Psychology has the same goals as any other science: to describe, understand, predict, and learn how to control or modify the process that it studies. Once these goals have been achieved, it can help us to understand the nature of our experience and come to conclusions that can be applied directly to people’s lives.<eos>"

Everyone knows that sports teams have an advantage when they play at home. But does anyone know why? Most of us probably think we do; after all, it seems obvious. But professional sport is changing faster than at any time in its history and much of what we used to take for granted is now open to question.

There are two main reasons why home advantage exists. First, the home team has the advantage of playing in front of their own crowd. The crowd can generate a lot of noise and energy, which can help the home team to perform better. Second, the home team has the advantage of being familiar with their own environment. They know the stadium, the locker rooms, and the practice facilities. This can give the home team an edge in terms of performance and concentration.

However, there are some changes that have recently occurred that have made home advantage less effective. For example, travel has become much easier, so players are no longer as tired when they travel to away games. Additionally, modern-day stadiums are more similar to each other, so there is less difference in the playing conditions between home and away games.

Despite these changes, home advantage still exists. There are a number of factors that can contribute to home advantage, including the team's spirit, the players' testosterone levels, and the crowd's energy.<eos>"

The more I practice, the luckier I get, said Gary Player. This quote is famous and is valued by athletes and coaches. However, there are some arguments about who said it first and what it really means. Player didn’t literally mean lucky, he was speaking ironically. He meant that the more you practice, the better you get. Up to a point. Where that point is, is at the heart of the nature-nurture debate. The debate is about whether talent is born or acquired. But it is not a balanced debate. It is more like a basketball game between giants and dwarves. Nurture has been victorious. The theory that expertise in any field can be attained with 10,000 hours’ practice is true. But it is not always the case. There are other factors that can influence success, such as genes, environment, and opportunity.<eos>"

A recent report found that many children living in wealthy countries feel lonely and unhappy. The reason for this is because they have been spending too much time indoors and not enough time outside. In her book, Kith, Jay Griffiths argues that this is the heart of the problem. She says that children need to be able to roam and explore the natural world. A follow-up study found that a large number of children would be happier if they could simply go outside more. Many adults talk nostalgically about the freedom of their own youth, but they rarely stop to reflect that they are the ones who have imposed that protective regime on their own children. Griffiths believes that children need to take risks and learn from their mistakes.<eos>"

I am a researcher who has a lot of education and I am good at solving problems. But my schooling has not helped me much with this. Most problems in life cannot be solved with a formula or memorized answers. They require the judgement, wisdom and creative ability that come from life experiences.

For children, those experiences are embedded in play. Play is the natural means by which adults and mammals have always educated themselves. It is also important for children to learn social skills, fairness and morality.

We need to give children more play. If we care about our children and future generations, we must reverse the horrid trend that has been occurring over the past half century. We must give childhood back to children.<eos>"

There are two popular social networking sites that are often used for job hunting: Twitter and LinkedIn. These sites give people the chance to connect directly with potential employers. However, with greater access to social media comes a greater chance to make mistakes.

For example, a young jobseeker in the US contacted a senior marketing executive via LinkedIn. The marketing executive was not impressed by the young jobseeker's message and sent a rude rejection note. This note has since gone viral. It is a warning to young people about how to use social media for job hunting.

Newspapers have been struggling in recent years. Their circulation has fallen and they are no longer the main source of news for most people in the US. Some people predict that newspapers will soon be extinct, but history shows that old media have a habit of surviving. Newspapers were once new media, and they became the dominant medium for news in the mid-19th century. However, the internet has changed the way we get news. Now, we can get news online from a variety of sources, including search engines, algorithms, and social media. This makes it easier for people to personalize their news and get the information they need. However, there are still some challenges with online news. For example, it can be difficult to verify the accuracy of information and it can be difficult to find documents or events cited in news stories. Despite these challenges, newspapers still have a lot to offer. They can provide us with information, analysis, and opinion. They can also help us to connect with our community and to learn new things.<eos>"

If humans were truly at home under the light of the moon and stars, we would go in darkness happily. Instead, we are creatures who are adapted to living in the sun’s light. We have engineered the night to receive us by filling it with light. This kind of control has some negative effects called light pollution.

Light pollution is mostly caused by bad lighting design. It washes out the darkness of night, altering light levels and light rhythms to which many forms of life have adapted. It affects migration, reproduction, feeding, and other aspects of life.

We have lit up the night as if it were an unoccupied country. It is as essential to maintaining our biological welfare as light itself. Denying darkness is futile. It causes various physical ailments and messes with our regular sleep-wake cycle.

Living in a glare of our own making, we have cut ourselves off from our evolutionary and cultural heritage. We have forgotten the scale of our being, which is best measured against the dimensions of a deep night with the Milky Way arching overhead.<eos>"

The founder said that the idea came to him after reading an email from his daughter. The email sounded like it was written by a copywriter from the company's media team.

The founder said that employees can take as much leave as they want, as long as they feel comfortable that their work can be completed on time. However, there are some problems with this policy. First, it is difficult to be sure that all of the work can be completed on time. Second, it can lead to increased guilt and stress for employees.

Journal-based peer review is a process that ensures the quality of scientific research papers. It is often praised for preventing the publication of flawed or nonsensical papers. However, the process can also be time-consuming, sometimes delaying the publication of a paper by a year. Despite its drawbacks, journal-based peer review remains an essential part of scientific publishing. Preprints, which are drafts of papers that are posted online without having been peer reviewed, are a growing trend that is changing the way scientists publish their work. Preprints bring academics back to the core of research publication, which is to disseminate new results quickly. They also make it easier for researchers to critique and build upon others' work. Preprints have the potential to improve the overall quality of scientific research and make it more accessible to the public.<eos>"

When I teach literature, students often answer that a poem is like a painting in words. Their answers usually don't satisfy me or them. One day, I asked a group to choose an object and write one paragraph describing it empirically, as a scientist might, and another in the first person, from the point of view of the item itself. The exercise led to much amusement and discussion.

A poem is a thing made, like a painting or a machine. Poets sometimes compare poems to wild animals or machines, but such comparisons don't always hold up. The most productive thing about trying to define a poem is the debate. Whether you view a poem as a machine or a wild animal, this process can change your conception of what a machine or wild animal is.

A poem is a product of writing and rewriting just like an article, story, or novel. It never really becomes what they usually are – a thing created in order to become a commodity.<eos>"

When friends share details of their well-planned trips, I smile and don't say much. What would they think if they knew that my own travel itineraries include naps and lazy mornings. Better sleep is one of travel's happy side effects. When I visited Mexico's Yucatán coast, I was surprised by how many hours I spent sleeping. There were lots of noisy birds, but it didn't matter. Surrounded by strange smells and sounds, I could plunge into a sleep that was more profound and dream-filled than I imagined possible. Sleep is something else too: it's an experience that changes rhythm, sometimes dramatically, from place to place. People obsess about jet lag, but I suspect that the difficulties I experience recovering from long journeys have more to do with local and cultural adjustment than time zones. When I finally fall into the local sleep pattern, I feel I have truly arrived.<eos>"

One day, he was working in Antarctica and a TV crew turned up to film a wildlife documentary.

Allan has worked on many major TV wildlife series. He says that it is easier to film today than when he started 35 years ago. Today, you can shoot a lot and look at it immediately. You used to have to think what shots you needed next, and what you had missed. You shot less. Film was very expensive. Today you can have too much material.

Allan says that wildlife filming is full of great successes, but also failures and embarrassments. He has had some challenges, but he has also had some amazing experiences.

Pen is married to Mary, a horsewoman. They live in the country with their two children. Pen is worried about being away from his family while he is in the Arctic. He knows that it will be difficult to stay away from his family, but he also knows that his mission is important.

Pen believes his mission reconnects exploration with the search for knowledge that drove previous generations into the unknown. He says, ""Making it to the North Pole was ultimately a personal ambition, and of limited value to anyone beyond the polar adventuring community. This time, scientists will profit from the data, and we’re creating a platform in which to engage as many people as possible in what’s happening in the Arctic Ocean.""<eos>"

I had a break from my training. I was going to do some writing and TV work, and speak to businesses and schools. I also wanted to stay in shape, so I entered marathons and triathlons. There was a race I was thinking about doing, but I was not sure if I was ready. I spoke to some of my rowing colleagues about the race, but they were not very enthusiastic. I knew that if I entered the race, I would want to win. I also had to take into account the cost of the race and the loss of earnings that would result from being away from home. Participating in the race would mean I’d actually be doing something again which I could bring in: rowing across the Atlantic. I learned a lot while planning this adventure, but one of the biggest lessons was to be thankful for the easy life of a full-time athlete.<eos>"

Last year, I went to the Arctic Circle in Finland to work with huskies. I was 26 and I was feeling restless. I found a small company run by Anna and Pasi, and they agreed to take me on as a husky dog handler. From December to February, there is plenty of business taking tourists out on sled rides. The dogs are almost hysterical with excitement, straining against the ropes in their desperation to be off. I was able to join the team for three months. The work is very physical and the hours are long. But I am triumphant. I can chop with an axe, hammer a nail, and use a circular saw. 'In the snow.'<eos>"

On that day, Radcliffe ran very fast and won the race. The press was there to see her run. They said that her time would qualify her to compete in the men's marathon at the world championships in Paris. Journalists were interested in her treatment, emu oil, which was recommended by Olympic gold medallist, Cathy Freeman.

Radcliffe was surprised that she had won. She felt that it was what she was going to do that day. She and her team had said they weren’t going to set a limit on anything. During the race, her husband and coach, Gary Lough, was in a car with her support team. They were listening to the radio coverage.

Radcliffe began to calculate as she ran. She knew that if she crossed the line in less than three minutes, she could finish in under 2 hours 16 minutes. She ran very fast and finished the race in 2 hours 16 minutes and 25 seconds.

After the race, everyone wanted to know how Radcliffe had won. Her physiotherapist, Gerard Hartmann, had stayed with her for weeks and provided daily sessions to counter the pain she was experiencing. He said that Radcliffe was one of the most painful athletes he had ever worked with.

Radcliffe did not know that the marathon was her career peak. However, she did leave a lasting legacy. Many women were inspired to take up long-distance running.<eos>"

When I first started my cooking programme, I was not sure how people would react to it. There had been a lot of talk about the food revolution in Britain, and I was certain that we had created a series of programmes that made a genuinely innovative contribution to that. I watched the first programme and was relieved that it was well-received. The success of the show led to many other projects, including a book based on my experiences at the restaurant I own. In each project, there is a sense of being on a journey. I wrote several books in a series called 'Perfection', each one accompanying its own TV programme of the same name. In these books, the journey was often physical, with passports and suitcases and itineraries. The latest book in the series is called 'In Search of Total Perfection'. It is about meeting extraordinary artisans and exploring new foods. Perfection is subjective. Even the simple task of choosing which dishes to include in the series turned out to be a challenge. Despite the book's title, I knew that I wouldn't be claiming the recipes were definitive. But I reckoned that, by using my technical skill and scientific knowledge, I could pin down some of the things that made these dishes work.<eos>"

We were driving to Marrakech when the van broke down and crashed into a field. John got out and opened the hood of the car. He stood there for a long time looking at the engine. He said, ""Actually, I haven't a clue what I'm doing."" Mum and I started to laugh. The field was big and there was nothing in it except grass and flowers. We sat on the side of the road and waited for Mum and John to stop laughing. We watched John walk away. Mum stretched out on the grass. She asked me to tell her a story. I told her about the birds I heard in London. The tea was very sweet. We stayed at the café all day. When it began to get dark, John said that he would have to have the van towed into Marrakech. We followed John into the hotel. We slept in the garden. The next day, we started to move our van. We watched it being dragged behind a rope. I was worried about how we would get home. I thought it might be easier if we could take a boat straight to London. Then I must have fallen asleep.<eos>"

Lucy was talking to two other pianists at the Prague Classical Music Festival. They were older than her and good enough English speakers. They talked about the pieces they were playing, where else they’d travelled recently, and where they were going next.

Lucy had not wanted to go to the festival, but she had made it. Her dad bought her a white-gold necklace with an L pendant to congratulate her. Her little brother Gus was excited about the festival. Grace Chang, her teacher, took Lucy out for a special dinner to strategize a repertoire.

In the elevator to their suite after the party, her grandfather turned to her. ‘You did well in there, Lucy. I’m proud of you. This is an important festival, and there’s a buzz about you. They all know who you are.’<eos>"

Your dad might be right. Spending too much time online can be unhealthy. But it can also have some benefits. Generally, research shows that teenagers who use social media have a lot of friends, a good sense of identity and belonging, and are developing the skills they need to be successful in the digital age.

There are a few things that you can do with social media that can help you develop your skills and identity. You can post notices about your favorite music or sports, discover what you enjoy, and connect with others who have similar interests. You can also use social media to collaborate with others to create content and share it with the world.

If you're not outgoing or have a specialized interest, social media can be a great way to connect with others. You can join groups of like-minded people, share your interests, and learn new skills. You can also use social media to build your brand awareness and increase your employability.<eos>"

When most people think of a family vacation, I guess a road trip through the western states in the US and Canada doesn’t come to mind. However, my parents planned a special vacation this year. They wanted to have a family bonding trip. They said, ""Not enough people do this anymore."" I was excited, but I was also worried about my privacy. We packed a lot of things into the car, including suitcases, coolers, and clothes. We set off on our journey.

We traveled west and stopped at a town in Oklahoma. The sky was very dark and there was a lot of dust. We learned that cattle get the right-of-way. We continued our journey and stopped at a mountain town in Colorado. It was a beautiful place. We climbed mountains and learned that Jeep roads are best left to Jeep drivers. We also visited a national park and saw a lot of bears.

Our trip was over and I was sad to be home. But I was also happy that I had a lot of new memories. I had a lot of photos to look at and I knew that I would never forget my family vacation.<eos>"

Rose Frost was sixteen years old and was going to live with her grandmother, Daisy. Her family was separating for two years. Her father had an assignment overseas, and her mother would be joining him, but Rose and her sister Amy were staying in England. Amy was completing her final school courses and would be living under the guardianship of the college Head. It was her last year at school, so it would have been unfair on Amy to move.

Rose was excited about living with her grandmother. There would be lots of dinner invitations, coffee requests, and shopping trips. Her grandmother was not the typical frail old lady figure. She was a social go-getter and had an uncanny knack of bringing people together.

Rose was sensible and very mature for her age. She knew about healthy eating, about keeping fit, and getting enough sleep. But this time Rose had insisted on one thing: she wanted her independence. She wanted to play music loud if she wanted, and to invite friends over or go out without having to ask permission every time.

Rose had never been a wild child. Her school reports had always been good and her exam results exemplary. This had worked in her favour. In five weeks’ time, Rose would begin the arduous task of starting at a new school, meeting new friends, forming bonds, and basically beginning her life again.<eos>"

My name is Charlotte Grainger. My primary school teacher first thought that I might write a novel. I thought that writing a book would be a big achievement and I didn't know what other teenagers were doing. When I turned 13, I decided to attempt writing a novel. The novel I started then is about to be published. It's a big achievement. The narrative is assured and action packed. Nothing about it, except the age of its heroine, suggests that it was written by a teenager.

I was surprised to see a teenager sitting in the office of my publishers. But I knew that I was going to interview a 15-year-old girl about her book. The book is a huge achievement. It's well-written and exciting. I read a lot of books by famous fantasy writers, but I was worried about whether I was capable of writing a book. I also read a book called How Not to Write a Novel. It helped me to understand the basics of writing.

Getting your book published is hard, no matter your age. But I'm grateful for the support I received. I know that writers sink or swim according to their talents. So I don't take things for granted.<eos>"

Our instructor, Gareth, told us that speed is our friend, not our enemy. We looked down the ski slope and felt nervous. One guy, David, had a lot of experience and he pushed forward, skiing down the slope towards the jump. He hit the ramp and flew upwards, arms flailing in the air. We held our breath. He hit the ground and flipped head-first into the snow. Gareth said that speed is an unpredictable beast. I didn’t feel like I was cut out for this freestyle stuff. I had enjoyed messing about on previous skiing holidays, but I knew I wasn’t one of those teenagers who spent their time doing freestyle tricks on ramps and half pipes. I was afraid of being ridiculed. But my parents decided to have a winter holiday at a training centre for freestyle skiing in the US. It had a huge indoor facility near the slopes, with trampolines, and ski jumps covered in artificial snow. We practised our moves indoors and then headed outside to try them for real. It was difficult to convince my body to go fast enough, but I managed to land properly. I felt like I was walking on air. But that was short-lived. On the final run of the day, I forced myself not to reduce speed as I approached the jump, became airborne, and landed appropriately in the landing zone.<eos>"

Imagine you're riding a rollercoaster in an amusement park. You come to a stop and take a deep breath. Then, the rollercoaster starts to move quickly and turns sharply. Your stomach feels like it's in the air. You feel scared and excited at the same time.

Amusement parks are a big industry. To create the thrills and excitement that guests seek, there are teams of engineers and designers working behind the scenes. It's a challenging job to design a rollercoaster. You have to make sure that the ride is safe and exciting at the same time.

The teams behind rollercoasters must work together to create a strong narrative, be it a space adventure or a high-paced chase in the jungle. They also have to consider the latest advances in technology. But, in the end, gut instincts, years of experience and trial-and-error are what work best.<eos>"

At 25, Miranda Ellington has accomplished a lot as a choreographer. She creates works for many theatres and dance companies. She also still dances from time to time. It's surprising to her that she can fit both activities into her busy schedule.

As a choreographer, Miranda is like a teacher. She enjoys working with young students. She finds it easier to work with students than professionals because they're open to trying new ideas and are hungry for success.

When Miranda starts working with a new group, she focuses on the dance steps and the music dictates what she does. If the dancers aren't responding well to a particular composer's music, that can be frustrating, but she still has to find solutions.

Miranda doesn't like to be attached to one institution. She feels it's valuable to keep establishing contacts with new people. She has to be prepared to adapt the way she works each time she goes somewhere new.

The conversation turns to the recent documentary on professional ballet dancers and choreographers. Miranda says that the documentary gives a realistic portrayal of life inside a dance company. She also talks about what makes a great ballet or other dance production.

Miranda has done a wide range of work, so it's hard to categorize her. She doesn't like to be labeled or to have her expertise limited to one area.<eos>"

A friend asked me why I travel when I can see everything on television. I agreed that you can see amazing things on TV, but why sit at home when there’s so much to experience out there. I guess that conversation gave me the idea for my crazy trip, and a film that aimed to get people to turn off their television sets. I had a mate getting rid of his old sofa, so I fixed it up and connected it to some old seatbelts. I put my luggage on the seats and slept on the sofa each night. Several friends joined me on the way, helping to pull the sofa along and encouraging me to keep going. I’ve been on several expeditions on foot in recent years, but this was something completely new. Not only was it the longest distance I have ever walked, but it was also on main roads, which meant I could stop at a roadside café and relax on the sofa with a cappuccino instead of having the wind blowing away my sandwiches while I sit on a rock. I got used to telling people, ""No, I’m not doing it for charity, I’m not training for a marathon"". When someone at work asks me about my weekend, I’d rather explain how I dragged a sofa 100 miles across southern England than discuss the latest show on TV. You’ll be able to see the film on my website.<eos>"

When I read about swimming trips in the sea around some small Greek islands, I was excited. I'd never tried group trips before. My brother was busy, so I decided to join a group holiday. The man at the port was curious when I asked for a single ticket. I explained that I wouldn't be alone; I'd be joining ten others to swim around the tiny islands. We had exchanged emails before we set off, but there was little time to chat before our first swim. Our guides explained that a support boat would accompany us throughout, and made sure we knew how to communicate with it. We did a short swim to split us into speed groups, then it was time for our first proper swim. I was nervous because I'd never swum such a long distance in the sea before. But I managed to complete the distance on my own. The following days followed a routine: jumping in; reaching a comfortable speed; stopping to admire the scenery. As the swims grew greater in distance, I was able to swim faster and enjoy the pleasure of completing them. There seemed little need for the support boat. I can hardly wait to come again next year.<eos>"

I like being a flight attendant. It's not easy, but it's a great job for young people. I've been to many places, like the US and Australia, and I work with amazing people. I also have a lot of time off. Life is always exciting, which makes it a great job.

When I was a child, I often flew unaccompanied to boarding school. I felt lonely, so I would ask the flight attendants to let me help give out meals to passengers. Sometimes they would let me. I guess that's what I remembered later, when I was working in the bank and I was feeling unhappy. I decided to look for a new job. There were a lot of young people at the interview, and many were accepted. They were often highly qualified like me, and they were changing careers.

Before the interview, I practised what to say. I mentioned my strengths and previous work experience, and I got the job. I'd recommend this kind of work to anyone, as there are so many things that make it worthwhile. But the free flights I get aren’t top of the list. Most airline staff are incredibly hard-working, and there’s a saying – ‘no-one’s finished till everyone’s finished.’ It's like a big family – even though we don’t see each other all the time, we're still close. When I'm not working, I don’t have to take work home. And if I do get difficult passengers, which is rare, I always know the flight will soon be over and I’ll probably never see them again.<eos>"

At the summer camp where I work, I really enjoy seeing the children succeed at things they never thought they could do. Most of the children know how to swim and play table-tennis, but rock climbing is a new experience for most of them. Some children feel very nervous, but after some encouragement they agree to try and they all get to the top in the end. This makes them feel great. We also get children who miss home at the beginning of the week. It's not the really young ones who feel like that the most – it's actually the ten- to thirteen-year-olds. We don't let them use their mobile phones all the time. We tell them they can phone home after lunch and sometimes after dinner. Most children are fine in a couple of days and at the end of their week's stay, they all come up to us and thank us because they have had a great time.<eos>"

Rock the Planet, a musical show where actors also have to be good musicians, opened in London last year. The show was voted 'Best Musical' four times in the USA. It was challenging to do the show with an all-British cast of actors because the UK has limits on how many performances young actors can do. Luckily, the director found plenty of talented UK-based actors. The theatre in London is bigger than the US venue, but it's been full every night.

I met 11-year-old Jamie, one of the show’s actors. He said that he gets paid to play and that he was very pleased with himself when he finally got a song right. He also told me about his school lessons and his classmates' reaction to the show.

The show is on in London for another year, and is well worth seeing.<eos>"
