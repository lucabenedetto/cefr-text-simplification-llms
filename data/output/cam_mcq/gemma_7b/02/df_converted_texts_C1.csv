Some time ago, there was a website that talked about the risks of public check-ins. It said that if you post something online, it can be seen by a lot of people. This made people think about the downsides of sharing things on the internet.

There are a lot of opportunities to share things on the internet, but it can also be dangerous. If you put something on the internet, it can be seen by anyone. This is called the 'online distribution effect'.

In the early days of the internet, there was a young man named Justin Hall who started a blog. He shared a lot of personal information on his blog, and people loved it. But one day, his blog was taken down because someone sent the address of his blog to his boss. This made Hall feel bad, but he didn't give up. He started a new blog and continued to share his personal information.

Today, Hall is a successful blogger. He has a lot of followers and his writing supports his family. He has learned that the internet can be a great way to share your thoughts and experiences, but it can also be dangerous.<eos>"

A long time ago, some scientists started a campaign to warn people about a movie called What the Bleep Do We Know? which showed that there is a lot about the universe that we don’t understand. It was a very interesting movie. At first, I couldn’t see what all the fuss was about, but then when the movie moved on to describe some of the discoveries, I started to see what the fuss was really about. One of the discoveries was that water molecules can be affected by thoughts. I had heard rumours about this before, but the movie gave me some evidence to support it. The evidence was not very convincing, but it was enough to make me believe that the discovery was real. The movie also talked about other discoveries, such as the discovery that the universe is made from an unknown form of matter and is being propelled by a mysterious force known only as ‘dark energy’. These discoveries are amazing, but they also make me feel a little helpless. It is now clear that many, if not most, natural phenomena can never be understood to the level once believed possible.<eos>"

Writing novels is like planting a forest, and writing short stories is more like planting a garden. The two processes complement each other, creating a complete landscape. Writing novels takes a long time and a lot of commitment, while writing short stories is more like finishing a quick task. It takes me about a week to get a short story into shape. You can create a story out of the smallest things, and you don’t have to worry about failing. Short stories are like guideposts to my heart, and it makes me happy as a writer to be able to share these intimate feelings with my readers.<eos>"

Science is a powerful force that has greatly impacted human life. It has improved our lives and presented challenges. It has also inspired artists and thinkers. Science has its beauty and its dangers. It has been used to explain the universe and to cure diseases.

However, science is not perfect. It is constantly changing and evolving. Scientists often disagree with each other about the best way to explain things. Sometimes, scientific theories are overthrown and replaced by new ones. This is because science is always learning new things.

Science has also been used to control nature. We have the ability to manipulate the environment and to predict the future. This has both positive and negative consequences. We need to be careful when using science to control nature. We need to make sure that science is used responsibly.<eos>"

From around 2015, major publishers started to report that sales of ebooks had plateaued, or even fallen in some cases. This has raised concerns about the future of ebooks in the publishing industry. Some people believe that the ebook hype has led to unwise investment and that the book may be replaced by digital formats. However, despite the evidence, the idea that ebooks will 'kill' the print book continues to persist.

The reason why this idea is so powerful is because it taps into our emotions and our attachment to different media. We often develop a close connection with objects that become a core part of our life. When a new technology emerges, it can disrupt our bond with these objects and make us feel nostalgic for what we used to know. As a result, we find ourselves longing for what we have lost and often develop new appreciation for older technologies.<eos>"

Every day, I wake up early to write about how some of the greatest minds of the past have approached their work. I write about their daily routines and habits to provide a new perspective on their personalities and careers. I also write about my own struggles with creativity and productivity.

My book is about the circumstances of creative activity, not the product. It deals with manufacturing rather than meaning. But it’s also, inevitably, personal. I talk about my own challenges and how I have learned to manage my time and energy to be more creative and productive.

I have included many examples of how other successful people have confronted similar challenges. I wanted to show how grand creative visions translate to small daily increments; how one’s working habits influence the work itself, and vice versa.

As much as possible, I have let my subjects speak for themselves, in quotes from letters, diaries and interviews. In other cases, I have cobbled together a summary of their routines from secondary sources.<eos>"

Charles Spence is a Professor of Experimental Psychology at Oxford University in the UK. He has studied how the senses interact to form our perception of flavour. Through his studies, he has influenced what we eat and drink. He has also studied how the environment affects taste.

Spence has written a book called The Perfect Meal, which is packed with insights about food and drink. It is a fascinating book for anyone who loves to eat and drink.

Spence's lab is not very high-tech. It has soundproof booths and stacks of ancient-looking audio-visual equipment. He can afford to work more creatively with cooks because he keeps his overheads low.

Spence is currently helping famous brands reduce salt and sugar. He points out that it is in their interests to help loyal customers stay alive.

What, one wonders, are dinner parties like in the Spence household? They're all extensions of the lab to Spence.<eos>"

Our brains are very busy these days. We have a lot of information to deal with, including facts, rumors, and things that are not true. We also do more things ourselves now than we used to. For example, we make our own reservations and find things in shops. We do a lot of different things at once, but it doesn't mean that we can actually do more than one thing at a time.

When we think we're multitasking, we're actually switching from one task to another very quickly. This is called divided attention. It takes a lot of energy to switch tasks, and it can make us feel stressed and tired.

Multitasking also makes it harder to learn new information. If you're trying to learn new information while multitasking, the information will not go to the right part of your brain. It will go to the striatum, which is used to store procedures and skills. This makes it harder to remember the information later.

In addition to being stressful and tiring, multitasking also requires a lot of decision-making. When you're multitasking, you have to make a lot of small decisions, such as whether to answer a text message or not. This can be very tiring, and it can also lead to making bad decisions.<eos>"

In a zoo in Sweden, a chimpanzee named Santino spent his nights breaking up concrete into pieces to throw at visitors during the day. Was he being spiteful? In caves in the US, female bats help unrelated fruit bat mothers if they can’t find the right birthing position. Are they being caring? Fifty years ago, people thought that animals had behaviours that produced measurable outcomes, and science recorded those outcomes. But recently that has partially changed. Thanks to research into the behaviour of bats, chimps, and other animals, emotions of animals have gone from being a taboo area of investigation to being tentatively explored. The new research has started a debate about whether animals can be said to have consciousness and conscience. If animals do have consciousness, what does it mean for the production and consumption of beef? The observations may not be disputed, but the interpretation of them is. Some people believe that we should stop eating meat, while others believe that we should at least re-evaluate our view of animal cognition. The debate is complex and there is no easy answer.<eos>"

Critical thinking is a way of understanding what we read or listen to in a deeper way. It involves interacting with the text and thinking about it in a way that goes beyond the surface meaning.

There is a belief that argument is a way of finding the truth. Although technology can help us store and process information more easily, it can also make it more difficult to think critically.

One of the main problems is that technology can distract us from focusing on a single thing. It can also make it easier to get overwhelmed by information. As a result, many people are not able to think critically about complex problems.

Another problem is that technology can make it difficult to reflect on and analyze information. This is because most visual media are real-time media that do not allow time for reflection, analysis, or imagination.

Despite these challenges, there are some ways to use technology to improve critical thinking skills. For example, reading on the internet can help us to analyze information more deeply. Playing video games can also help us to develop critical thinking skills.

It is important to understand the subtleties of how technology affects thinking and analysis. By understanding these subtleties, we can use technology to our advantage to improve our critical thinking skills.<eos>"

When Matthew Crawford is not writing or thinking about how we should live, he works as a motorcycle mechanic. He wrote two books about the benefits of manual trades and how to cope with modernity.

Crawford says that our attention is being pulled in many directions. We are constantly being interrupted and it is becoming more and more difficult to think or remember conversations we’ve had. And because everyone is trying to protect themselves from the irritation of constantly being interrupted, we close ourselves off and no longer want to do simple things like chat to strangers.

Crawford also talks about the impact that technology has had on our attention spans. Studies have shown that our attention wanders if a phone is merely visible on the table. It’s tempting to see the advent of this crisis as technological, but for Crawford it’s more that the technology has created the perfect vehicles for our self-obsession.

Crawford’s proposed solution has two parts. First, we need regulation of noise and distraction in public space. More importantly, though, Crawford advocates skilled practices as a way of engaging with the world in a more satisfying way.<eos>"

""What do you do for a living?"" is a common question. If you are a philosopher, it is a little harder to answer. It is because describing yourself as a philosopher sounds a bit pretentious. However, philosophers are not different from the masses. They have established themselves as people who judge the activities of others and celebrate intellectual life.

Philosophy can help people look a little more closely at the practices and behaviours that define their lives. Sometimes this might reveal something we already know; at other times we might discover that our beliefs are hard to justify. Either way, merely by examining these ideas, we’ll be doing something for the benefit of everyone.<eos>"

Foodies, gourmands, chefs and others who love food might expect that thinking critically about what and how we eat can contribute to culinary pleasure. However, philosophical discussions of food have often been about other topics, such as the acquisition of knowledge or the pursuit of pleasure. Sometimes, philosophical conversations about food appear to be superficially about food, but further examination reveals that these arguments explore deeper, but only loosely connected, points. Food is inherently social and cultural. It derives from historical contexts and is shared with those in our communities. It also brings people together and provides infrastructure for growing and distributing food. Ethical issues related to food include what we should eat and the extent to which cooking in restaurants and the home differ. Cooking in the home is often more intimate and inclusive, while cooking for a living involves different obligations and restrictions. Food and dining can play a role in bridging cultural gaps. We can come to appreciate others by learning to enjoy their food and forge personal bonds with people from other cultures by coming together to eat.<eos>"

Rob Daviau is a US designer who creates 'legacy' board games. These games are different from traditional board games because they have a permanent impact on the game. For example, players might have to rip up cards, deface the board, or open packets containing new rules. The games play out over a fixed number of sessions and long-held grudges become woven into the fabric of the game.

Daviau was asked to collaborate on a legacy version of Pandemic, a popular co-operative board game title. His next project was a board game called SeaFall. Legacy board game designers must consider all possible player choices to ensure the narrative doesn’t fall apart. To do this, designers recruit testers so they can observe how board games will unfold.

Legacy board games were never expected to go mainstream, but most players love the concept. The legacy format draws on video games and the demand for episodic entertainment fuelled by popular TV series.<eos>"

Once upon a time, there was an octopus named Inky who lived in a tank at the New Zealand National Aquarium. One night, Inky managed to escape from his tank and swim across the floor to a drain that led to the Pacific Ocean. It was a story that was shared online and was popular. One of the reasons why people enjoyed the story was because it was about anthropomorphism, which is the idea that animals are like humans. In the case of octopuses, this pleasure is especially pronounced because the creatures’ great intelligence comes packaged in bodies so vastly dissimilar to our own.

Animals have been observed exhibiting many of the key behaviors that were thought to distinguish humans from animals. They have the ability to consider the past and the future, demonstrate empathy and self-awareness, and anticipate the motives of others. Animals are far smarter than we’ve been giving them credit for.

However, there are some challenges that animals face. For example, they can be easily trapped in cages or tanks. And they can also be harmed by pollution and other human activities. But despite these challenges, animals are resilient creatures that can overcome many obstacles.<eos>"

Once upon a time, there was a technology called robotics that has the potential to change the world. Robots have already been used in the automotive and manufacturing industries for many years. Now, experts are saying that robots will soon be used in many other industries.

One of the main concerns about robotics is that it will lead to job loss. However, experts also say that it will create new jobs. For example, a company in Australia called Fastbrick Robotics has developed a robot that can lay 1,000 bricks in one hour. This robot would take two human bricklayers a long time to complete the same task.

Another concern about robotics is that it will make society less personal. However, experts also say that it will make society more efficient. For example, a company in San Francisco called Simbe Robotics has developed a robot that roams supermarket aisles alongside human shoppers. This robot makes sure that the aisles are clean and that the goods are well-stocked.

The future of robotics is bright. There are many new developments in the field of robotics that are making it possible for robots to do more and more tasks. As a result, robots are going to have a big impact on the world in the years to come.<eos>"

My grandparents' garden was a special place for me. It was located on the bank of a river and sloped gently down towards the water. You couldn't reach the river but you could hear the sound of the water and the birds that sang in the trees above. I imagined that all gardens were like this – a place of escape, peace and solitude.

My father was a quiet and withdrawn person. He had a few phrases that he liked to use, one of them being 'It's immaterial to me'. He was probably disappointed that he hadn't made more of his life. He left school without qualifications and became apprenticed to a plumber. It wasn't something he was passionate about.

I always wanted to like the piano but it did its best to intimidate me. The only thing I did like about it were the two brass candlesticks that jutted out from the front. I'd walk along the river bank looking for a suitable spot where I could take off the painful sandals and leave them with my picnic while I ventured out, tentatively, peering through the water for any fish that I could scoop up with the net and take home.

One day my father announced that there was a vacancy for an apprentice gardener in the Parks Department. I thought you might be interested. I like to feel that somewhere deep down inside him, although he hated gardening himself, he'd watched me doing it for long enough and noticed the keenness and the passion for all things that grew and flowered and fruited that hadn't disappeared.<eos>"

Any discussion of English conversation often begins with the weather. It is a traditional way to start a conversation in English.

Our conversations about the weather are not really about the weather at all. They are a form of ""grooming talk.""

There are certain fixed contexts in which weather-speak is used.

The grass is soft and the stadium is ancient. The players are dressed in white and the crowds are respectful. The quiet of the Centre Court is good for your game.

Shirley talks about what it takes to do voiceovers. You have to bring the script to life for an audience who can’t see you. You also have to be able to create the right sounds from the back of your throat.

After school, Shirley enrolled on a drama course and had some occasional work singing jingles for TV adverts. One day, she was suggested to try out for the part of a rabbit in the soundtrack for a cartoon. She ended up getting a major part.

The competition for work is fierce, and a good showreel is essential. To be successful in this profession, you need to be dogged and have a passion for human sound.

For anyone considering a career doing voiceovers, Shirley recommends attending ‘specialist workshops’ and learning the basics of voiceover work.<eos>"

Dreams are important too. We lose dreams all the time when we wake up early. When researchers deprive people of REM sleep, there is an increase in the amount and intensity of REM sleep the following night. Dreams are where we bring things together in fresh, often surprising ways. They may help us find new patterns and create combinations that break through our usual habits of thinking.

We need to dream to function fully in our complex world. We need to think creatively and flexibly as we negotiate relationships with colleagues, co-workers, family, and friends.<eos>"

It was twenty years ago that Susie Ray left London for a small coastal town in south-west England. She has a studio with a beautiful sea view. There are a lot of empty frames hanging on the walls, between photographs of her two daughters. Susie is a copyist artist who can reproduce the richness of an early-20th-century impressionist masterpiece as easily as the brilliance of a 16th-century Caravaggio portrait.

The problem is that Susie is very popular. She has painted the works of numerous great artists, including Renoir, Monet and Van Gogh. Her reproductions are so faithful that art experts mistake them for the originals.

Susie has always been open about what she does. When she reproduces an old masterpiece, she will make it look as authentic as possible. However, she will put her own signature on the back of the canvas.

When younger painters approach Susie for advice, she stresses the importance of learning to draw and to represent things accurately. She also emphasises how much she’s studied to be able to do what she does.<eos>"

During Ellen MacArthur's racing days, the sea was her greatest passion. She had a special connection with the boats that took her around the world. They worked as one. When she was on land, life felt trivial. After she came second in a big race, she took you down into her boat to show you how she prepared for the race. She talked about the careful planning that had gone into provisioning and housekeeping. The boat was her world and she looked after it because her life depended on it.

Now, she sees the world as a boat. It is a small, beautiful, and fragile thing whose supplies are running out. She has been working to save the planet for many years. She has been touring factories, mines, and power stations and talking to government and business about our reliance on non-renewable resources. She also launched the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a charity that works through business and education to give young people the vision to rethink and redesign a sustainable future.<eos>"

Jordan Romero is 13 years old and wants to be the youngest person to climb Mount Everest. If he succeeds, he could become one of the most famous teenagers of his generation. There are concerns about whether a young climber would be emotionally strong enough and have enough experience to develop the good judgment and reactions a climber must have in order to take part in such a project safely. However, Jordan's parents believe that their own experience as climbers will help and that watching Jordan develop gives them confidence.

Jordan has already climbed five of the Seven Summits and might actually do it before his teenage years are over. He is motivated by his goal and is focused on achieving it. The more adventurous the record, the more interest it generates. This gives Jordan a dilemma. He has to blog, sit for photo shoots and give interviews in order to inspire others. He has to offer something spectacular. Like climbing Everest.<eos>"

When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, it's probably not classical music they're listening to. Most people our age can name a lot of pop groups, but few of us know who Brahms was. I started doing a music degree, but the people on my course know no more about classical music than anyone else. If you don’t know who wrote the music, you are unlikely to own any recordings of their work. Classical music just doesn’t hold much attraction for most people, and that is particularly true of teenagers. There are a few reasons why teenagers don’t like classical music. First, the pace and rhythm of classical music are not very appealing to us. Second, classical music is structurally complex and difficult to listen to. Third, the subject matter of classical music is not very relevant to our lives. Finally, the way we listen to music has changed. Nowadays, we can find any music we want at the click of a mouse, and the sound track to our lives is rarely classical.<eos>"

Bonnie Wyndham got out of her mother’s car and looked at Almonside School. It was a funny school, with lots of buildings hidden away amongst the trees. There was a riding centre and a science block.

I met Cody Simpson a long time ago. He is a 15-year-old Australian who has already released a lot of successful songs. I don't know how a surfer guy ended up on a stage in front of thousands of fans, but it's a story that's worth hearing.

When I was young, I started playing the guitar and writing songs. I was also swimming and surfing a lot. I had my life set up and I was very busy. One day, I posted some videos of myself singing and playing the guitar on the internet. They changed everything. People started sending me messages saying they wanted to see more of my videos. So I started recording more videos at home and posting them online. The responses were overwhelming.

I was a very talented swimmer. I was training hard with some of the best coaches and putting my focus into perfecting my sport. But then record labels came calling, and I had to make a tough choice. I had to choose between staying in Australia and continuing swimming, or taking a huge risk and moving to the US. I decided to take the risk.

It was very difficult to choose a career at such a young age. I had to break the news to my swimming coach and my friends. They were shocked. I'm kind of the quiet kid, and I think it's important to be that way in this crazy work.

Of course, we all have days of doubt. Sometimes when I'm left alone for a while I sit and think, ""How did my decision affect my little brother and sister?"" But my family's always reassuring me that they're there to support me and encourage me in everything that I do.

Success comes from a willingness to say 'yes' to your big break, even when it's a little scary to do so. It all just happened so fast and unexpectedly. Now, to be going to countries I never thought I’d visit in my life, and to be playing in front of hundreds of thousands of fans – it's like something that I think lots of people dream of and try to achieve. But I know it won’t last forever.<eos>"

Mum caught Jess by the arm and asked her to come with her to the study. There was a painting on the table. It was one of Grandpa's, but it was different from his other paintings. It was not finished and it was strange. There was a river in the picture. It was not a real river, it was a fantasy river. The picture was beautiful, but it was also mysterious. There were no animals or people in the picture. It felt like there was no place for living things in this remote vision. But Jess was captivated by the picture. She thought about the coming of autumn after a long, rich summer. Mum spoke again. She said the painting had a name. It was called 'River Boy'. The words seemed to carry a strange resonance.

When I woke up this morning, I didn't mean to damage my bedroom carpet. It just seemed like a good idea at the time. I was trying to find a way of fitting my corner cabinet into a corner. Gran had given me the cabinet when she moved out of her house into a flat. It's really cute and I keep my collection of shells and fossils and interesting stones there.

The problem was, the cabinet was too tall. If I could only slice a couple of centimetres off the bottom of it... That was when it came to me. If I couldn’t slice anything off Gran’s cabinet, how about cutting a hole in the carpet? It just seemed like the obvious solution. What Dad calls lateral thinking.<eos>"

The novel 'The Borrowers' is about a family of tiny people who live hidden in the walls and floors of a house. They secretly borrow things from the normal-sized people in order to survive. When I was asked to direct a TV adaptation of the novel, I knew it was going to be hard to live up to people’s expectations. The author had told me she wanted the series to be from the Borrowers' perspective, not a human one, which made filming much more complex. The most crucial thing was getting the scale right. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans, so we had to be much further away from the camera than on a normal shoot. We also had to film from a low angle to get the Borrowers' perspective. One big challenge was finding a way to get the shadows right. We developed a unique technique for this. The costumes were also a big challenge. They were made out of heavy canvas material so that they stuck out in the way that dolls’ clothes do. Unfortunately, the weather was really hot during filming. We had to work hard and fast. But it all came together in the end, and I think the series was pretty successful in conveying the magic of the books.<eos>"

Mom pulls to a stop at the corner of my new school, Palm Grove High school. She looks around nervously, searching for journalists that aren’t there. I tell her everything is going to be fine. She kisses her fingertip and touches my cheek right before I get out of the car. Then she’s off, leaving me alone with this whole new school and situation to deal with.

I walk in the school’s main office and get my schedule. English Literature, first period. Cool, I can deal with that. But I’m late. English is in Room 214, second floor. I studied the map the night before, as I didn’t want to look like a complete buffoon searching for my classes.

The teacher takes roll and I slip in undetected. The girl next to me smiles and talks to me. I look down at my expensive platforms with the tan embroidered flowers. Oh no, I knew I should have worn different shoes. Dead giveaway.

The teacher pauses in the roll taking and looks at me. ‘Desert... McGraw?’ she says hesitantly. ‘Here.’ The teacher then smiles and introduces herself as Ms. Smigla.

The average American teenage girl is expected to be the Student Council president, have a part-time job, volunteer, and excel in all of these fields. Being an American teenager today is challenging. There are a lot of stresses that teenagers have, including homework, tests, extracurricular activities, jobs, chores, and responsibilities at home. Despite these stresses, teenagers still have to deal with negative stereotypes about them. These stereotypes often include being lazy, disrespectful, rebellious, loud, reckless, and self-absorbed. However, not all teenagers are like this. Many teenagers are hardworking, responsible, and caring. They are also using technology to their advantage to make their lives easier. For example, students can now take their work on the go with them and do their homework wherever they happen to be. With the introduction of smart phones, tablets, and social media, students can now take their work on the go and do their homework wherever they happen to be. This has created what appears to be a cell phone addiction. Many teenagers start their days early and often end after midnight. This schedule is crammed with school, after-school activities, family obligations, and homework. And then, they must get up and do it all again the next day, with fewer than the recommended nine hours of sleep a night.<eos>"

The teenage members of the Earth to Sky Calculus Club live in Bishop, a mountain town in the US, surrounded by wilderness. They have launched over fifty balloons to the edge of space. It's a long-running science project that includes astronomy experiments and backcountry adventures. I joined them one weekend in late spring. They were releasing a high-altitude balloon, hoping to record shooting stars.

As it got dark, the teenagers secured a soft insulated lunch box to the bottom of the balloon. Inside was a camera, an instrument to measure altitude, and a thermometer. Two GPS trackers were mounted on the outside of the lunch box to help the group find it later. They used a gas tank to inflate the balloon and watched it ascend.

After the launch, most of the students went home, but a few stayed to watch the shooting stars. They lay on blankets on the mountainside and gazed at a sky so clear, it was hard to believe you're just four hours from Los Angeles.

It took the recovery team 11 hours to find the lunch box. It was in a canyon, high on a flat rock, in the middle of a cascading waterfall. The camera hadn't recorded any shooting stars. Sure, it's a bit of a disappointment, but it's also a perfect opportunity to argue over the effects of atmospheric waves, and how they might work above mountain ridges.<eos>"

When you travel by car with your family, even when you're young, you probably know that you're not 'there yet,' even as you ask over and over 'Are we there yet?' It's not 'there' anymore once you get there. It's 'here'. If you really think there's a chance that you're 'there' yet, you should be asking 'Are we there yet?'. And I'm pretty sure there's no one who wishes they were 'there yet' more than the mums and dads fielding that question over and over every single long car trip.

The journey is full of fun things to do. You can watch endless DVDs, listen to music, or play puzzles. You can also act as co-pilot in the passenger seat, map in hand, and help your parents keep everything running smoothly.

But sometimes, things don't go as planned. Your sibling might put their foot on your side of the seat, or they might breathe on you. If this happens, you might get angry and start fighting. But don't worry, your parents will be there to help you. They'll yell at your sibling and separate you from them. And soon, the madness will subside.

Over the years, your parents have developed strategies for dealing with kids on the back seat. One of their strategies is to answer the question 'Are we there yet?' with the answer 'No, you're not there yet.' This usually keeps everyone quiet for a while.<eos>"

John and Zuzi Morgan have opened a café in Oxford, UK, where people can enjoy coffee, cake, and play board games. They hope that people will enjoy the experience so much that they will want to repeat it.

The games that are played in John and Zuzi's café are called Eurogames. They are known for their gentle themes, such as farming and landscape-building. The first Eurogame was created by a German designer, Klaus Teuber. Players establish settlements on an island and trade resources with the other players.

Pandemic is a Eurogame in which players must collaborate to solve global problems. It was created by a North American, Matt Leacock. Leacock was inspired by a Eurogame called Lord of the Rings. He wanted to see if he could design a game that would be just as enjoyable as Lord of the Rings. Pandemic was a runaway success.

The growth of the video games industry has also helped to the success of Eurogames. Video games and board games have learned a lot from each other. Now there are more people who are open to the idea of playing a game than ever before.<eos>"

To help her keep her balance and not to fall, she carried a long stick, weighing eight kilograms. Helen took lessons from an expert high-wire walker.

I work at a university in the US. My team and I are learning more about water birds, especially one called the American black duck. We have started using a new piece of equipment called a night-vision scope, which allows us to see the ducks in the dark. We are worried about black ducks because their numbers have fallen hugely. We don’t know whether there’s enough food on the east coast for these animals. We have lots of information about their daytime activities, but nothing about what they do at night, because we simply haven’t had the equipment. But this new ‘scope’ will produce really clear pictures, even on moonless nights, so we’ll be able to find out more and make better decisions about looking after the area where they live based on what we learn. It is hard work. We work six hours a day. We have studied ducks in different locations, and I have had to take a boat to some sites and make notes on every duck I see. The weather hasn’t been very helpful – some nights are mild, but more often it’s wet. Oh, and it’s so quiet I’ve needed lots of coffee to stop me falling asleep!

Have you ever wondered what it's like to perform in a circus? Sophia Grayson is from Circus Experience, a centre that teaches young people circus skills. She says her course is popular because it includes many skills, such as juggling, throwing and catching things, trapeze, which involves flying through the air, and many other things. On the year-long course, students gradually increase the amount of risk they take in each class and parents come along to certain classes to watch progress. Sophia explains that to be successful in the circus, you must keep practising and be fit. Training is very important, but the best performers are those who want success, have imagination and never stop improving skills. People often think that circus performers suffer injuries or that they only work for a short time each year. But, actually, the real issue is looking ahead because you can only be on the road while you’re young and then you really need to consider other options.<eos>"

I had dreamt of visiting the area ever since I saw it on TV as a child. So I asked Harry if I could go too – until he finally agreed. There were storms in the area we were going to, but luckily the weather was calm. We joined the group and set off in small boats. The guide had mentioned that very few people lived along that coast, and sure enough, the only other living creatures we saw on that first morning were dolphins and birds. We stopped for hours to explore the rock pools on the beaches along the coast. They were full of amazing coloured fish. And it was great to be able to stop caring about how quickly or slowly the day was passing. We never forgot lunch or dinner, though, which we all made together over camp fires. When I finally fell asleep on the boats each evening, it really felt like stress-free living. When the time came to leave, I was sad. But I knew if I stayed, I’d miss family and friends.

I took visitors around the city and I discovered that I enjoyed giving those tours. I felt like I was seeing the city in a new way.

All Chicago guides have to be able to answer hundreds of questions about the city. After several months, I gained my tour guide qualification and registered as an independent tour guide. Being a tour guide is more than just knowing historical facts or making sure you don’t lose anyone from your group. You also need to be able to be entertaining and tell interesting stories, and be able to react to changing situations. If a place that you thought was open is actually closed, or a route changes, you need to be able to adapt quickly. I need to make sure visitors are happy with my tours, otherwise they could post a negative review online. Like most tour guides, I realise that these reviews are really important, as good reviews attract more customers. That’s why making tours fun and stress-free is essential.<eos>"

It was a lot of work, but I was proud of the job we’d done.

My day starts early, at 4 a.m., when I go to the market to buy fresh flowers. It’s usually cold and dark at that time, but I don’t mind. The market is full of beautiful flowers from all over the world. I like to choose flowers that are perfect for my customers. Sometimes it’s not easy to find the right flowers, but I try to get the best possible price.

Back at the shop, I look at customer orders and set up vases with the flowers I’ve bought. Then I create bunches of flowers and work out how much the orders will cost. Customers are often surprised by how expensive the flowers are, but I sometimes have to ask them to think again about what they’d like.

I like my job because I can put together the nicest possible flowers for the amount of money someone wants to spend. I wouldn’t want any other job.<eos>"

My city has a modern cinema that shows all the latest films I want to see, and lots of films for kids at the weekends. It’s close to where I live, but a year ago, I realized something was missing – the experience of discussing a film in detail with a group of people after watching it with them. So, together with two friends, I started a film club. We decided early on that we didn’t want to hire a cinema to show the films. Instead, we choose a different location in the city each month. For example, we rented an old factory to show a film that was set in Antarctica. It was very cold, and this created the perfect atmosphere for the film, which was brilliant! Some places we use are even free, as the owners make money by selling snacks during the film, which means we can keep our prices low. We’re happy to make enough to cover our costs – we’re not trying to make a profit. Each time we show a film, everything is a bit easier for us, especially now we’ve got our own reliable equipment. We also know how many tickets we’ve sold because everything’s online – no more concerns about empty seats! There’s still always plenty to do, but when people of all ages come up at the end to say what a great experience they’ve had, it’s wonderful. We’ve started a blog, too, because we know that most people now go online for information about films, rather than read reviews in local papers. We’ve also tried putting up a few posters in cafés. Nothing’s as successful as word of mouth, though – people recommending us to their friends. And the audience love the special activities we put on with each film – last month it was a movie quiz, which everybody enjoyed.<eos>"

Taking photographs was always my favorite activity when I was a child. When I was 15, I knew that if I wanted to take my hobby to the next level, I had to do something special. So I decided to start a personal project: I would take one photograph every day for a whole year of my life. Many other young photographers had done the same thing before me, but it seemed like a really great idea to me. After a few weeks, I decided to put my photos onto a website for young photographers. I was surprised to discover that there were others who liked the way I saw and photographed things. I was also enjoying photographing a wide range of subjects. Someone suggested that if my photographs all had a common topic or idea to connect them, my project would be even better. So I began to concentrate more on taking photos of nature scenes, especially of birds and the sky. A lot of them were black and white photographs, which was different to what many other young photographers were doing. As a result, I sometimes had doubts about my project, and I almost gave up several times. In the end, however, I trusted my own feelings, and became more confident about my photographic style and choices. One day I showed my project to my art teacher at school. She told me about a national photography competition for people my age. So I entered some of my photos, just for fun. I’ll never forget the moment when the judges told me that I had won first prize; I was so happy, as my project meant so much to me. It was the first time I realised that maybe my photography really was good, and that I might actually be able to work as a professional photographer. I now have my own photography studio and I’ve never regretted my career choice.<eos>"

Last year, I joined the National Youth Challenge (NYC) because I wanted to learn new skills and have new experiences. In the NYC, you can do many different activities to challenge yourself and learn new things. There are different levels, from beginner to advanced, run by adult volunteers called 'leaders'. When you complete each level, you get a certificate.

When I first joined, my leader suggested that my first challenge should be helping to organise activities at a local children’s club for two hours a week. I was a bit hesitant at first, but I decided to take up the challenge. Soon, I was spending all my free time at the children’s club. It meant a lot more to me than just getting the certificate. And when I finished the challenge, the NYC leader let me keep on volunteering at the club because I’d built up some great relationships with the children. Now I’m there for about four hours a week and I always really look forward to going.

Because of what I’ve learned at the children’s club, I’ve decided that when I finish school in three years’ time I want to go to college to become a qualified youth worker – someone who works with children. I’ve improved my own communication skills while at the same time helping others. I’ve got several other NYC certificates now and yes, one of them is for camping.<eos>"

I was born in Denver, USA, and started snowboarding when I was eight years old. My dad took me to a resort in the mountains, about two hours from Denver. The hill was very steep, so my dad had to do a lot of persuading to get me on a board. I was young, so I hadn’t even thought of asking him if I could start snowboarding, but he was already into it and wanted me to love it too. I managed to do well. After this experience, I started competing aged ten. I enjoy taking part in competitions and winning too. I have a lot of fun training and studying during the summer. It’s the best way of dealing with not being able to do what I love so much. I have to think carefully about my future. Snowboarding is such a huge part of my life now, but I also feel it’s important to have something else I can do, just in case I don’t succeed as a professional snowboarder or if I get injured.<eos>"

When I was fifteen, I wanted everything my friends had. I didn't plan ahead, like I had no idea what I wanted to do when I left school. One day, my best friend got a new phone and I thought I should have one too. My parents said I could only have it if I paid for it myself, so I decided to work part-time and save as much as I could. I owe my parents a lot for making me do that – it taught me a really valuable lesson. I worked every Saturday in a café, but I didn’t really enjoy it. My parents suggested starting my own little business instead. I started making necklaces and selling them to my friends and family. They were delighted with them, but I still needed convincing that they looked good enough to be popular with the public. There was only one way to find out, so I rented a market stall with my mum. There are always lots of tourists where I live, and they bought lots of my things to give to family and friends when they got back home. Soon we were receiving calls from all over the country from people looking to buy more. They thought we were a big company, employing loads of people to produce my designs, when in fact we were just two people on a market stall. That was when I knew it could work, and it was time to take the next step – creating a website. Since then, I’ve made thousands of pounds through my business, mostly online. It’s been such a lot of fun so far.<eos>"

When Janine Stuart was young, she wrote a novel called Being Amelia which became a bestseller. The book is partly based on Janine’s life. In one interview, Janine said, ‘Because of my family’s moving around a lot, I’ve become good at making new friends. I understand what it’s like to be the only new student in a class, and that helped me to write about how the main character, Amelia, gets on in a new school.

Janine started her novel one summer, when she was feeling bored at home. Her mother had always dreamt of becoming a published author herself, and her teachers had always encouraged her to write, so it seemed like a natural way for Janine to pass the time. The year before, she’d entered a short story competition on a young writers’ website and won first prize. That’s why, when Janine finished Being Amelia and sent it to a publishing company, the people who worked there were immediately keen to read it. They loved it, and a year later, Janine’s novel was on sale in bookshops.

One review of Being Amelia mentions how, despite the book having pictures of happy teenagers on the cover, the people in the story actually face some difficult challenges. This is what really allows readers to believe in them. The reviewer says that although Janine is still very young, and Being Amelia isn’t a particularly long novel, she’s clearly shown that she’s a better writer than several other best-selling authors.<eos>"

My name is Tom. I am fifteen years old. Three years ago, my family and I moved to a castle on a small island. My dad was invited to be the manager of the castle. He works for an organisation that looks after historical buildings. It was a long time before the rest of us agreed Dad should take the job. But once we moved, we quickly got used to island life. The castle isn’t very beautiful, but our apartment is comfortable. The island feels very sociable in the summer, and there are often parties on the beach. During the winter, there are not as many teenagers as I had hoped. But the adults all support each other, and help with repairs on the island. The biggest change for me was travelling by boat every day. I was looking forward to going on stormy days, when there are huge waves, but the ferries don’t run then. And I’ve discovered that if I miss the bus to the harbour after school, I also miss the last ferry home, which is worrying. So when schoolmates come home to stay with me, I’m always telling them to hurry up!<eos>"

I live in a beautiful house in Scotland, surrounded by countryside. I love nature and wild animals, and I started a new hobby called birdwatching six years ago. I went to the mountains in northern Scotland with my family, where we saw lots of birds. I spent hours watching them with my parents, who showed me how to tell the difference between species and how to find the best places to see them. It was amazing, and I joined a local young birdwatchers’ club. My goal is to see 200 different bird species, and I’ve almost achieved that. I’ve been to many places to see birds, including Egypt and South America. I also think that birdwatching clubs should try to get more young people interested in this hobby. Everyone needs to connect with nature, whatever their age, and it doesn’t have to cost much money.<eos>"

I started playing football when I was 7. I would rush home from school to play with other boys and girls. I loved it, and I was good at it. But my family knew I often became keen on new hobbies and then dropped them, so they thought the same thing would happen with football. But it never did. I was already dreaming of playing football professionally when I was older. And the opportunity came sooner than I’d hoped. I played in local tournaments, and a referee noticed that I was a promising player. He asked the manager of a professional women’s club to watch me play. After that, she asked me to join her club. I started regular training with a big club as a young 13-year-old. I improved enormously. But people still weren’t sure I’d ever be a star player, which made me feel a bit upset. But my coach encouraged me to just be myself, and believe in myself. I played in one of the club’s championship matches, much earlier than I’d expected. I scored the winning goal.

One of the most interesting things happening in further and higher education in the UK and around the world is the move to encourage novice students to get involved in research as early as possible. Research is not just for famous scholars or scientists. It can also be seen as a natural way to build knowledge and skills.

There are different ways to do research. You can do it in a big way, like the highly trained few who do groundbreaking research, or you can do it in a smaller way, like asking questions about your own interests. Most students have always been researchers. You have been carrying out some elements of research for projects and answered questions at school or in the workplace since your first few days there.

In college and in higher education, having an enquiring mind, identifying problems and questions, critically exploring and evaluating information and ideas that you read about or hear about, and constructing your own responses and your own knowledge to add to the debates are all learning activities which are expected of you.

Critical thinking is particularly important in research. We need to be able to engage with the research of others, think about it, test it out, and identify whether what we’re being told is presented in such a way as to trick us into agreement, or whether it is logical, reasoned and backed by evidence.<eos>"

Cities have always been centers of intellectual life. They have been places where people gather to discuss ideas and share their thoughts. However, city life is not always easy. It can be exhausting and overwhelming. Scientists have begun to study how the city affects the brain, and the results are not always positive. They have found that cities can actually dull our thinking, sometimes dramatically so. One of the main reasons for this is the lack of nature in cities. Studies have shown that people who can see trees from their windows recover more quickly from illness. Even small glimpses of nature can improve brain performance. This is because nature provides a break from the urban grind. It also helps us to focus better and concentrate. In addition to the lack of nature, cities also have a lot of other challenges, such as traffic, noise, and pollution. These challenges can be very tiring for the brain. They can make it difficult to concentrate and focus. However, there are ways to mitigate the psychological damage of the metropolis. One way is to create vibrant urban parks. Another way is to find ways to reduce traffic and noise pollution. By taking these steps, we can make cities more livable and more conducive to creativity and innovation.<eos>"

The mind is a complex thing. It is often thought to be located inside the head. However, there is evidence to suggest that the mind is more than just the brain. Things and neurons also play a role in human cognitive life.

From the viewpoint of archaeology, it is clear that stone objects, body ornaments, engravings, clay tokens and writing systems have been used to help humans think. These objects are often called cognitive extensions. They become part of the human mind and make it easier to think.

The mind is also connected to the material world. When we use tools or make things, our minds become more active. This is called metaplasticity. It is the ability of the mind to change and develop as it interacts with the material world.

MET, or Material Engagement Theory, is a new theory that explores the different ways in which things become cognitive extensions or are incorporated by the human body. It also investigates how those ways might have changed since earliest prehistory.<eos>"

Photography has had a significant impact on the United States. It became part of US culture at every level, from the practical and scientific, to the industrial, to the aesthetic. Photography has been hailed as one of the greatest single contributions of the US to the visual arts. It has moved to the centre of US intellectual and aesthetic discourse.

There are a few reasons why photography was so appealing to Americans. First, it was a mechanical process that matched the growing enthusiasm for technology. Second, the camera was the perfect tool for representing the self and family. Third, photography was a way of creating and sustaining an impression of self and family. Finally, the photograph’s inherent realism was in harmony aesthetically with a tendency towards realism.

Photography has also been used by artists in a variety of ways. For the last several decades, beginning with the U.S. artist Andy Warhol’s exploitation of the photograph in individual paintings, silk screens, and multiples, artists have been incorporating photographs into their work.<eos>"

In 1890, William James, an American philosopher and physician, defined psychology as the 'science of mental life.' This definition is still a good starting point for understanding psychology today. We all have a mental life, so we have some idea about what this means. However, even though the concept can be studied in rats and monkeys as well as humans, it remains a somewhat elusive one.

Psychology is about the mind or brain, but psychologists do not understand nearly enough about its workings to be able to comprehend the part that it plays in the experience and expression of our hopes, fears, and wishes, or in our behaviour during experiences as varied as giving birth or watching a football match.

The endeavour of psychology is much like that involved in solving a crossword puzzle. It involves evaluating and interpreting available clues. Complex interactions are the norm rather than the exception in psychology, and understanding them depends on the development of sophisticated techniques and theories.

Psychology has the same goals as any other science: to describe, understand, predict, and learn how to control or modify the process that it studies. Once these goals have been achieved, it can help us to understand the nature of our experience and come to conclusions that can be applied directly to people’s lives.<eos>"

In a storehouse in a business park in Michigan, USA, there is a museum of failed products. The museum has a collection of products that were withdrawn from sale because nobody wanted to buy them. The proprietor of the museum, Carol Sherry, sees each product as embodying its own sad story. The museum is a viable, profit-making business. It was started by ex-marketing man Robert McMath, who intended to accumulate a reference library of consumer products. McMath collected new products indiscriminately, which resulted in his hoard consisting overwhelmingly of unsuccessful ones.

The museum exhibits provide evidence of the culture of optimism that exists today. Each product must have made it through a series of meetings where nobody realised the product was doomed. There is a perverse incentive for marketers to plough more money into a loser, thereby forcing some sales and preserving their dignity.

The museum also provides evidence of the effectiveness of 'positive fantasies about the future'. Spending time and energy thinking about how well things could go actually depletes most people’s motivation to achieve their goals.<eos>"

Everyone knows that sports teams have an advantage when they play at home. But does anyone know why? Most of us probably think we do; after all, it seems obvious. But professional sport is changing faster than at any time in its history and much of what we used to take for granted is now open to question.

There are two main reasons why home advantage exists. First, the home team has the advantage of playing in front of their own crowd. This can give them a boost of energy and confidence. Second, the home team has the benefit of being familiar with their own stadium. This can help them to play more effectively and to make better decisions.

However, there are some changes that have recently occurred that have made home advantage less effective. For example, travel has become much easier and the top grounds increasingly resemble one another. As a result, the impact of playing at home has declined in all major sports.

Despite these changes, there is still some evidence to suggest that home advantage still exists. For example, researchers have found that the players’ testosterone levels are higher when they are playing at home. This is probably because of the sense of territoriality that the players have when they are playing at home.<eos>"

The more I practice, the luckier I get, said Gary Player some time ago. This quote is popular among athletes and their coaches. It is easy to see why. The quote has a few problems. First, the source of the quote is disputed. Second, the meaning of the quote is enigmatic. Player didn’t literally mean lucky. He was speaking ironically. His real message was: ‘The more I practice, the better I get.’ Up to a point. Where that point is, is at the heart of the nature-nurture debate. The debate has been uneven. Nurture has been victorious. The theory that expertise in any field can be attained with 10,000 hours’ practice is true. But it is not always the case. There are other factors that can influence success. These factors include genes, environment, opportunity, and determination.<eos>"

A recent report found that many children living in wealthy countries feel lonely and unhappy. The reason for this is that these children have been spending too much time indoors, watching TV or playing on computers, and have lost contact with the natural world.

In her book, Kith, Jay Griffiths argues that this is the heart of the problem. She says that children need to be able to roam freely and explore the wild woods of their home territory.

A follow-up study found that a large number of children would be happier if they could simply go outside more. Many of today’s over-40s talk nostalgically about the freedom of their own youth. They spent long summer days playing outside, swimming in ponds, or making dens in tumbledown sheds.

Griffiths believes that children need to take risks in order to learn to avoid bigger accidents later. However, she does not provide any information about how to achieve this.<eos>"

I am a research bio-psychologist with a PhD. I have done a lot of school and I am a good problem-solver. But most problems in life cannot be solved with a formula or memorised answers. They require the judgement, wisdom and creative ability that come from life experiences.

Play is the natural means by which adults and mammals have always educated themselves. It is also important for children's development. All mammals, including humans, play when they are young. Children, who have the most to learn, play far more than any other young primates when they are allowed to do so.

Play is voluntary, which means that players are always free to quit. If you can't quit, it's not play. School has become more onerous and adult-directed sports have replaced impromptu games. Our children don’t need more school. They need more play.<eos>"

Newspapers are facing a decline in popularity. Since 2000, the circulation of most UK national dailies has fallen. Many people in the US now get their news from the internet instead of newspapers. Some people predict that newspapers will go extinct in the next 15 years. However, old media have a habit of surviving. They have survived many challenges, such as the rise of new media and the decline of print sales.

Newspapers were once new media. They became the dominant medium for news in the mid-19th century. This was due to several factors, including the steam press, the railway, and the telegraph. Today, we have a lot of new ways to get news. We can read news online, on our phones, or on our computers. We can also listen to news on the radio or watch it on TV.

Despite the challenges, newspapers continue to exist. They provide us with important information and stories. They help us to stay informed about the world around us. However, newspapers have not been very successful at telling us how the world works. Perhaps they now face extinction.<eos>"

If humans were truly at home under the light of the moon and stars, we would go in darkness happily. Instead, we are creatures who are adapted to living in the sun’s light. We have engineered the night to receive us by filling it with light. This kind of control has some negative effects called light pollution.

Light pollution is mostly the result of bad lighting design. It washes out the darkness of night, altering light levels and light rhythms to which many forms of life, including ourselves, have adapted. It affects our sleep-wake cycle, our ability to migrate, and our ability to reproduce.

We have lit up the night as if it were an unoccupied country. It is as essential to maintaining our biological welfare as light itself. Denying darkness is futile. It is as fundamental to our being as the regular oscillation of light on Earth.

So, living in a glare of our own making, we have cut ourselves off from our evolutionary and cultural heritage. We have forgotten the scale of our being, which is best measured against the dimensions of a deep night with the Milky Way arching overhead.<eos>"

Journal-based peer review is a process that ensures the quality of scientific research papers. It is often seen as a way to prevent flawed or nonsensical papers from being published. Reviewing a paper can delay its publication by up to a year. However, there are some concerns about the current system. For example, it can be difficult for reviewers to decide whether a manuscript is good enough for a particular journal. Additionally, the rewards for publishing in top journals can incentivize corner-cutting. Preprints are a new way to share research papers that have not been peer-reviewed. They bring academics back to what research publication is all about: the rapid dissemination of new results. Preprints also enable informal scientific discussions and can become an effective outlet for negative results.<eos>"

When I teach literature, students often answer that a poem is like a painting in words. Their answers usually don't satisfy me or them. One day, I asked a group to choose an object and write one paragraph describing it empirically, as a scientist might, and another in the first person, from the point of view of the item itself.

The exercise led to much amusement and discussion. When I was at school, poetry seemed to make little sense to me. I saw every poem as a confusing puzzle that got in the way of true understanding and feeling. Once school is over, poetry is, for most people, something that grabs them less and less.

A poem is a thing made. Poets sometimes compare poems to wild animals or machines. But such comparisons fall apart upon closer analysis. The most productive thing about trying to define a poem through comparison lies not in the comparison itself but in the debate.

A poem is a product of writing and rewriting just like an article, story, or novel. Yet, it never really becomes what they usually are – a thing created in order to become a commodity.<eos>"

Sleeping is one of my favorite travel experiences. I don't talk about it very much because I feel a little guilty. When friends share details of their well-planned trips, I smile and don't say much. What would they think if they knew that my own travel itineraries include naps and lazy mornings. Better sleep is one of travel's happy side effects. When I visited Mexico's Yucatán coast, I was surprised by how many hours I spent sleeping. There were lots of noisy birds, but it didn't matter. Surrounded by strange smells and sounds, I could plunge into a sleep that was more profound and dream-filled than I imagined possible. Sleep is something else too: it's an experience that changes rhythm, sometimes dramatically, from place to place. People obsess about jet lag, but I suspect that the difficulties I experience recovering from long journeys have more to do with local and cultural adjustment than time zones. When I finally fall into the local sleep pattern, I feel I have truly arrived.<eos>"

I also learned that I would have to try to stay orientated throughout the flight. The pilot told me that I should relax and enjoy the view, but I couldn't relax. The race was over in 10 minutes. It had been 'soft' compared to what the pilots endure when they race.<eos>"

Doug Allan is a wildlife cameraman who films wild animals in cold places. If you have ever been amazed by footage of polar bears in a nature documentary, it's probably been filmed by him. Allan was born in a cold place and he has a passion for diving. He became a marine biologist and commercial diver. One day, he was working in Antarctica when he was asked to film a wildlife documentary. He ended up taking the crew to different places and after 48 hours, he realized that being a wildlife cameraman ticked all the boxes: travel, adventure, and underwater.

Allan has filmed many major TV wildlife series. He says that it is easier to film today than when he started 35 years ago. Today, you can shoot a lot and look at it immediately. You used to have to think what shots you needed next, and what you had missed. You shot less. Film was very expensive. Today you can have too much material.

Allan says that wildlife filming is full of great successes, but also failures and embarrassments. He has had some challenges, but he has also had some amazing experiences. He would like to make his own film about climate change in the Arctic. He says he would be able to make an extraordinary documentary.<eos>"

In 2004, Pen Hadow became the first person to trek to the North Pole alone and without being resupplied on the way. He swam through cold waters, fought frostbite and polar bears. He also made it to the South Pole the same year. Now he is back in the Arctic preparing for an expedition he says is even more ambitious.

Pen is a strong and determined person. He has a lot of physical endurance. He is also very organized and has a lot of experience in polar expeditions. He is married to Mary, a horsewoman, who also loves the outdoors. They live in the country with their two children.

Pen is going to the North Pole to collect data about the ice. This data will be used to help scientists understand what is happening to the Arctic Ocean. Pen believes his mission reconnects exploration with the search for knowledge that drove previous generations into the unknown.<eos>"

I had a break from my training. I was going to do something else. Being a successful Olympian is a special thing. I had the chance to do more writing and TV work, and to speak to businesses and schools. But there wasn’t anything on the horizon to get my competitive teeth into. I knew that I wished to stay in shape, so that I would be in a position to fight for an Olympic place if that dream reignited within me. So I entered marathons and triathlons. That should have been enough, but there was still the TV presenter Ben Fogle’s nagging invitation at the back of my mind. I was beginning to miss that feeling, but I still wasn’t ready to commit to the regime of training seven days a week. I spoke to some of my rowing colleagues about whether they fancied the race; I didn’t receive any enthusiastic responses. I knew that if I entered the race, even though it is billed primarily as an adventure, I would want to win. I got in contact with Ben. We spoke about the remaining costs of the race. We felt we stood a better chance than most, but it would still take work to secure it. Of course, I also had to take into account the loss of earnings that would result from being away from home. I had to weigh up the pros and cons of doing the race. I decided to do it. I learned a lot while planning this adventure, but one of the biggest lessons was to be thankful for the easy life of a full-time athlete.<eos>"

Last year, I went to work with huskies in the Arctic Circle in Finland. I was 26 and I was feeling restless. I found a small company run by Anna and Pasi. They agreed to take me on as a husky dog handler for the winter season. From December to February, there is a lot of business taking tourists out on sled rides. They started with a few dogs, which expanded to more than 100. Recently, they took over a second property. I could join the team for three months, but I knew the hours would be long and the conditions would be tough. I started packing right away.

When I arrived at the farm, I was handed a pair of boots and turned out into the cold. The dogs were running back and forth, pulling sleds. I was able to join the team and help with the dogs. It was a lot of work, but I was triumphant. I emailed my friends and told them I could chop with an axe, hammer a nail, and use a circular saw in the snow.<eos>"

On that day, Radcliffe ran very fast and won the race. The press was there to make sense of her extraordinary run. Her time was so good that it would have qualified her to compete in the men's marathon at the world championships in Paris. Journalists were interested in her and asked her about the benefits of emu oil. Cathy Freeman had recommended this oil to heal the wounds caused by a freak accident. Radcliffe feels that her achievement never really sank in. She can see it must have been a really big deal at that time. She and her team said they weren’t going to set a limit on anything. That was their motto: no limits. During the race, her husband and coach was in a car with her support team, listening to the radio coverage. After 16 kilometres, her agent questioned whether she could keep up such a pace. But her physiotherapist was not worried. With 800m left to run, Radcliffe began to calculate. She knew she could finish in under 2 hours 16 minutes if she crossed the line in less than three minutes. She ran very fast and finished the race in 2 hours 16 minutes and 25 seconds. At the finish, she felt proud of her accomplishment. She knew that she would never run as fast again.<eos>"

When I first started my cookery programme, In Search of Perfection, I was not sure how it would be received. There had been a lot of talk about the food 'revolution' happening in Britain, and I was certain that we had produced a series of programmes that made a genuinely innovative contribution to that. I watched the first programme and was relieved that it was successful. The success of the show paved the way for other fascinating projects, including a book based on my experiences at the restaurant I own. In each project, there is a sense of being on a journey. I wrote several books in a series called 'Perfection', each one accompanying its own TV programme of the same name. In these books, the journey was often a very physical one, with passports and suitcases and itineraries. The latest book in the series, In Search of Total Perfection, is about travelling the globe to meet extraordinary artisans. These people have spent decades pursuing their own ideals of perfection. Perfection is subjective. Even the simple task of choosing which dishes to include in the series turned out to be a nightmare. Despite the challenges, I managed to include something for everyone. The book's title is a bit misleading. I knew from the outset that I wouldn't be claiming the recipes were in any way 'definitive'. But I reckoned that, by using my technical skill and scientific knowledge, I could pin down some of the things that made these dishes work.<eos>"

We were driving to Marrakech when the van broke down and crashed into a field. John got out and opened the hood of the car. He stood there for a long time looking at the engine. He said, ""Actually, I haven't a clue what I'm doing."" We all started to laugh. Bea was worried, ""We can't stay here forever."" The field was big. There was nothing much in it, just grass and flowers. We sat on the side of the road and waited for Mum and John to stop laughing. We watched John walk away. Mum stretched out on the grass. She asked me to tell her a story. I told her about the birds I heard in London. The tea was very sweet. We stayed at the café all day. When it began to grow dark, John said, ""I suppose it's a miracle it got us this far."" Mum made an open-air bed for us in the hotel garden. We went to sleep. The next day, we were sitting in the truck watching our van being towed into Marrakech. Bea was sitting in the front of the truck. I kept wondering how we'd get home again. I thought it might be easier if we could take a boat straight to London. Then I must have fallen asleep.<eos>"

Lucy was talking to two other pianists at the welcome party in the hotel ballroom. They were older than her and good enough English speakers. They talked about the pieces they were playing, where else they’d travelled recently, and where they were going next.

Lucy had not wanted to go to the festival, but she had made it. Her dad bought her a white-gold necklace with an L pendant to congratulate her. Her little brother Gus was excited about the festival. Grace Chang, her teacher, took Lucy out for a special dinner to strategize a repertoire.

In the elevator to their suite after they’d left the party, her grandfather turned to her. ‘You did well in there, Lucy. I’m proud of you. This is an important festival, and there’s a buzz about you. They all know who you are.’<eos>"

Dad said that spending too much time online is not good. He thinks that teenagers should get out into the real world. However, research shows that most teenagers who use social media have a wide circle of real-life friends, a good sense of identity and belonging, and are developing the essential technical skills we need to be citizens of a digital age.

Social networking has become an integral part of modern childhood. Teenagers don’t just consume media like adults do, they inhabit it. It can help teenagers develop a sense of identity, help them deal with teenage issues and get on with their peers, and help them develop social skills.

Teenagers who use social networking as a creative force will reap the benefits when they become adults and enter the world of work. They can collaborate with others to create content and then share it with others. This can help them develop valuable skills that will be helpful in the workplace.<eos>"

When most people think of a family vacation, I guess a trip through the western states in the US and Canada doesn’t come to mind. However, my parents clearly weren’t looking to put their feet up as they organized our summer vacation this year. My dad seemed to have taken it upon himself to plan the ultimate family bonding trip. We packed a lot of stuff into the car, including suitcases, coolers, and clothing. We set off on our journey, which was called 'The Family Great American Road Trip'. As we drove west, we had a lot of adventures. We stopped at a town in Oklahoma under the darkest star-filled skies. We learned the rule of the road: cattle get the right-of-way. We also visited the Great Sand Dunes and Pagosa Springs, Colorado. We learned that what are marked as Jeep roads are best left to Jeep drivers. We saw a lot of wind farms and bears. We had a close encounter with a bear on the road. As we drove on, life back home faded away. We stayed in a rustic hotel with no internet or cell phone services. However, I got to experience the most wonderful views I’ve ever seen. After watching a rainstorm blow through, we made our free-fall back south again. I was glad to be home with my family. Three thousand photos chronicling our journey waited to be sifted through and rediscovered.<eos>"

She knew about healthy eating, about keeping fit, and getting enough sleep. But this time Rose had insisted on one thing: she wanted her independence. Living with Daisy would be fulfilling all her needs. But Rose wanted to play music loud if she wanted, and to invite friends over or go out without having to ask permission every time.

Charlotte Grainger was inspired to write a novel by her primary school teacher. She thought that writing a book would be a challenge and that it was something she could do. When she was 13 years old, she started writing her novel. It is about to be published. Charlotte is proud of her accomplishment. The book is well-written and action-packed. It is not obvious that it was written by a teenager.

Charlotte acknowledges the limitations of her youth. She says that she was trying to ask big questions, not answer them. She also says that she doesn't think her understanding of the world is limited by her age. She was just interested in exploring the theme of taking responsibility.

Charlotte has a theory about teenagers and the way they are 'betrayed' by the fiction that is specifically aimed at them. She says that there are three types of teenager depicted in novels. There's the outsider who becomes acceptable to society, the naïve teenager who knows nothing about the big wide world, and the awkward teenage character who isn’t socially skilled. Repeatedly reading about these character types irritated her.<eos>"

He flew upwards, arms flailing in the air. We held our breath because something was wrong. He hit the ground and flipped head-first into the snow. Gareth said that speed is an unpredictable beast. I wasn’t cut out for this freestyle stuff, but I enjoyed messing about and practising turns in the snow. My parents decided to have a winter holiday at a training centre for freestyle skiing in the US. We practised our moves indoors and headed outside to try them for real.

Imagine you're riding a rollercoaster in an amusement park. You come to a stop and take a deep breath. Then, the rollercoaster starts to move quickly and turns sharply. Your stomach feels like it's in the air. You feel scared and excited at the same time.

Amusement parks are a big industry. To create the thrills and excitement that guests seek, there are teams of engineers and designers working behind the scenes. It's a challenging job to design a rollercoaster. You have to make sure that the ride is safe and exciting. You also have to make sure that the ride is unique and interesting.

The teams behind rollercoasters must work together to create a strong narrative, be it a space adventure or a high-paced chase in the jungle. They must also use their creativity and experience to test and refine the ride.

However, as technology has transformed industry after industry, rollercoaster designers will also have to embrace the latest advances, such as virtual reality. But, according to experts, virtual reality is not going to replace the physical rollercoaster experience.<eos>"

At 25, Miranda Ellington has achieved a lot as a choreographer. She creates works for many theatres and dance companies. She also dances from time to time. It's surprising that she fits both activities into her busy schedule.

As a choreographer, Miranda is like a teacher. She enjoys working with young students. She helps them learn new dance moves and improve their skills. She also likes to work with professionals. But she finds that working with students is easier because they are more open to new ideas.

When Miranda starts working with a new group, she focuses on the dance steps and the music. If the dancers are not responding well to the music, she has to find solutions. Sometimes, she has to go back to the drawing board and select a new piece of music.

Miranda doesn't like to be attached to one institution. She likes to keep establishing contacts with new people. She also likes to be open to new ideas.

The conversation turns to the recent documentary on professional ballet dancers and choreographers. Miranda says that the documentary is accurate and shows the hard work and dedication involved in ballet. She also says that it's important to aim high, even if you know you won't achieve perfection.<eos>"

I have a friend who asked me why I travel when I can see everything on television. I agreed that you can see amazing things on TV, but why sit at home on your sofa when there’s so much out there to experience. I guess that conversation gave me the idea for my crazy four-day trip, and a film that aimed to get people to turn off their television sets.

I had a mate who was getting rid of his old sofa. I fixed the sofa with some wheels and cables and connected it to old seatbelts. I put my luggage on the seats and slept on the sofa each night, including one night on the beach. Several friends joined me on the trip, helping to pull the sofa along and encouraging me to keep going.

This was the longest distance I have ever walked. It was also on main roads, which meant I could stop at a roadside café and relax on the sofa with a cappuccino instead of having the wind blowing away my sandwiches while I sit on a rock.

You can see the film on my website.<eos>"

When I read about guided swimming trips in the sea around some small Greek islands, I was excited. I'd never tried organised group trips before. My brother was busy, so I decided to join a group holiday. The man at the Greek port was curious when I asked for a single ferry ticket. I explained that I wouldn't be alone for long; I'd be joining ten others to swim around the tiny islands. We did a short swim to split us into speed groups, then it was time for our first proper swim. I was nervous because I'd never swum such a long distance in the sea before. Soon, the waves got bigger and I was at the back of the slow group. I watched faster swimmers moving ahead like dolphins. I wanted to complete this first distance, though, and was delighted when I finally managed it on my own. The following days followed a routine: jumping in; reaching a comfortable speed; stopping to admire the scenery. As the swims grew greater in distance, so did my speed and pleasure at completing them. There seemed little need for the support boat. I can hardly wait to come again next year.<eos>"

I'm glad I started working as a flight attendant. I've been to many places, including the US and Australia. I work with great people, and I have a lot of time off. Life is always exciting, which makes it a great job for a young person like me.

When I was a child, I often flew unaccompanied to boarding school. I felt lonely, so I would ask the flight attendants to let me help give out meals to passengers. That's what I remembered later, when I needed an escape from my banking job and began looking for a new direction. There was a lot of young people at the interview, and many were accepted. They were often highly qualified like me, and were changing careers.

Before the interview, I practised what to say. I mentioned my strengths and previous work experience, and I got the job. I'd recommend this kind of work to anyone, as there are so many things that make it worthwhile. The free flights I get aren't top of the list. Most airline staff are incredibly hard-working, and there's a saying – 'no-one's finished till everyone's finished.' It's like a big family – even though we don’t see each other all the time, we’re still close.<eos>"

At the summer camp where I work, I really enjoy seeing the children succeed at things they never thought they could do. Most of the children know how to swim and play table-tennis, but rock climbing is a new experience for most of them. Some children feel very nervous, but after some encouragement they agree to try and they all get to the top in the end. This makes them feel great. We do get children who miss home at the beginning of the week. It's not the really young ones who feel like that the most – it's actually the ten- to thirteen-year-olds. We don't let them use their mobile phones all the time. We tell them they can phone home after lunch and when they ask again, usually after dinner, we say it's a bit late to phone now, do it tomorrow. Most children are fine in a couple of days and at the end of their week's stay, they all come up to us and thank us because they have had a great time.<eos>"

Rock the Planet, a musical show where actors also have to be good musicians, opened in London last year. The show was voted 'Best Musical' four times in the USA. It was challenging to do the show with an all-British cast of actors because the UK puts more limits on how many performances young actors can do weekly. Luckily, the director found plenty of talented UK-based actors. The theatre in London is bigger than the US venue, but it's been full every night. The show's on in London for another year, and is well worth seeing.<eos>"
