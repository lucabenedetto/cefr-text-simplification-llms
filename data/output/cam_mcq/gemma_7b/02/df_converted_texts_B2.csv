Some time ago, there was a website that talked about the risks of public check-ins. It said that if you post your location online, people you don't know can see it. This made people realize that there are some downsides to sharing everything on the internet.

The internet has a lot of opportunities for people to share their lives. You can write a blog, post photos, and share your thoughts with the world. But you should be aware that what you write online can have real-world consequences.

In the early days of the internet, there was a young man named Justin Hall who started a blog. He shared a lot of personal information on his blog, and people loved it. But one day, Hall's blog was taken down because someone sent the address of his blog to his boss. This made Hall realize that the internet can be a dangerous place.

Heather Armstrong is another person who has experienced the risks of sharing information online. She had a blog where she wrote about her job and her life. One day, an anonymous person sent the address of Armstrong's blog to her boss. As a result, Armstrong lost her job.

These two stories show that the internet can be a great place to share your thoughts and experiences, but you should be careful about what you write. If you expect your writing to make people want to be with you, you'll be disappointed.<eos>"

A long time ago, some scientists started a campaign to warn people about a movie called What the Bleep Do We Know? It showed that there is a lot about the universe that we don't understand. Even though scientists can be a bit arrogant sometimes, they don't claim to have all the answers. Some people felt that the movie was dangerous and issued warnings about it. The movie was a must-see for everyone, but I couldn't see what all the fuss was about at first. It was when the movie described some new discoveries that I started to see what the fuss was really about. One of the discoveries was that water molecules can be affected by thoughts. I had heard rumours about this before, but the movie didn't give much evidence to support it. Still, lots of people find this evidence to be very convincing. The movie's claims were not too bizarre. They were based on real scientific discoveries. The universe is made of an unknown form of matter and is being propelled by a mysterious force known as 'dark energy'. The movie also talked about other discoveries, such as the lag between conscious perception and reality and the birthplace of modern humans. These discoveries are amazing and show that the universe is far stranger than anyone could have believed.<eos>"

Writing novels is like planting a forest, while writing short stories is more like planting a garden. The two processes complement each other, creating a complete landscape that I treasure.

Writing novels takes a long time and a lot of commitment. It's like planting a forest, which takes years to grow. Writing short stories is more like planting a garden, which takes less time and requires less commitment.

Since the beginning of my career, I have alternated between writing novels and short stories. I write novels when I have finished a group of short stories, and I write short stories when I have finished a novel.

Writing short stories is a necessary change of pace for me. It's like jazz improvisation, with the story taking me where it wants to. You can create a story out of the smallest things and you don't have to worry about failing.<eos>"

Science is a powerful force that has greatly improved our lives and also threatened our existence. It has the ability to explain the universe and cure diseases. Science has also been used to inspire artists and politicians. However, science also has its challenges and limitations. One of the biggest challenges is the conflict between old and new theories. Scientists often disagree with each other about the best way to explain things. This can lead to a lot of debate and controversy. Despite its challenges, science continues to progress. It has brought us many new discoveries and has improved our ability to understand the world around us. Science is also a tool that can be used to predict the future. It is important to be aware of the potential benefits and risks of scientific advancements. We need to be careful not to misuse science or exploit its power.<eos>"

From around 2015, major publishers started to report that sales of ebooks had plateaued, or even fallen in some cases. This has raised concerns about the long-term potential of ebooks in the publishing industry. Some people believe that the ebooks hype may have been overly optimistic, and that the decline in sales is a sign that digital and print books can no longer coexist. However, despite the evidence, the idea that ebooks will 'kill' print books continues to persist. This idea is powerful because it taps into our fears about change and loss. It also reflects our emotional connection to books and other media. As technology changes, we often find ourselves longing for what we used to know, but no longer have. This is why entire industries develop around retro products and older technologies. The spread of the printing press, for example, made people seek out original manuscripts. The shift from silent to sound movies, and from analog to digital photography, have also stimulated nostalgia for older forms. E-readers have also stimulated a new appreciation for the material quality of 'old' books.<eos>"

Charles Spence is a Professor of Experimental Psychology at Oxford University in the UK. He has studied how the senses interact to form our perception of flavour. Through his studies, he has influenced what we eat and drink. He has also studied how the environment affects taste.

Spence has written a book called The Perfect Meal, which is packed with insights about food and drink. He has also helped famous brands reduce salt and sugar in their products.

Spence's lab is not very high-tech. It has soundproof booths and stacks of ancient-looking audio-visual equipment. He can afford to work more creatively with cooks because he keeps his overheads low.

Spence has collaborated with Heston Blumenthal, a renowned experimental chef. They have worked together to create new dishes that are based on sensory science.<eos>"

Our brains are very busy these days. We have a lot of information to deal with, including facts, rumors, and things that are not true. We also do more things than ever before. Thirty years ago, people used to make our airline reservations and help us find what we needed in shops. Now we do most things ourselves. We have smartphones that help us do all this and more. But there’s a problem. Although we think we’re multitasking, we’re actually switching from one task to another very rapidly. This is not very efficient. Multitasking can also make us feel stressed and anxious. It can also make it harder to learn new information and make decisions. To make matters worse, multitasking requires a lot of decision-making. We rapidly spiral into a depleted state in which we can end up making truly bad decisions about something important.<eos>"

In a zoo in Sweden, a chimpanzee named Santino would break up concrete into pieces and throw them at visitors. Was he being spiteful? In caves in the US, female bats help unrelated fruit bat mothers if they can’t find the right birthing position. Are they being caring? Fifty years ago, people thought that animals had behaviours that produced measurable outcomes, and science recorded those outcomes. But recently that has partially changed. Thanks to research into the behaviour of bats, chimps, and other animals, emotions of animals have gone from being a taboo area of investigation to being tentatively explored. The new research has started a debate about whether animals can be said to have consciousness and conscience. If animals do have consciousness, what does it mean for the production and consumption of beef? The observations may not be disputed, but the interpretation of them is. Some people believe that we should stop eating meat, while others believe that we should at least re-evaluate our view of animal cognition. The debate is complex and there is no easy answer.<eos>"

Critical thinking is a way of understanding what we read or listen to in a deeper way. It involves analyzing, evaluating, and judging information based on your own experiences and understanding.

There is a concern that technology is changing the way we approach complex problems and making it more difficult to really think. For example, the amount of information available online can be overwhelming and make it difficult to focus on a single task. Additionally, the use of visual media, such as video games and television, can distract people from reading and writing.

However, there is also evidence that technology can have a positive impact on critical thinking. For example, video games can help to improve decision-making and analytical skills. They can also help to develop imagination, induction, reflection, and vocabulary.

It is important to understand the subtleties of how technology affects thinking and analysis. By understanding how technology can be used to improve critical thinking, we can help to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to think critically.<eos>"

When Matthew Crawford is not writing or thinking about how we should live, he works as a motorcycle mechanic. He wrote two books about the benefits of manual trades and how to cope with modernity.

Crawford says that our attention is being pulled away by many things, including advertisements, video games, and our phones. He also says that we are more conscious of other things we might be doing.

Crawford's proposed solution has two parts. First, we need regulation of noise and distraction in public space. More importantly, though, Crawford advocates skilled practices as a way of engaging with the world in a more satisfying way.

No representation can replicate the feel of the hockey puck on ice, or gravel under your tyres at high speed. Each relies on their good judgment of a complicated subject and the ability to manage the presence of others in the same space.<eos>"

""What do you do for a living?"" is a common question that we often answer in a few words. However, if you're a philosopher, it's a bit harder to deal with. Philosophers are no different from the masses, but the misconception that they are mystical or enlightened above their fellows is persistent.

One reason for this misconception is that philosophers have established themselves as people who judge the activities of others and celebrate intellectual life. Another reason is that academic philosophy has grown increasingly removed from lived experiences.

Philosophy can help people look a little more closely at the practices and behaviours that define their lives. Sometimes this might reveal something we already know; at other times we might discover that our beliefs are hard to justify. Either way, merely by examining these ideas, we’ll be doing something for the benefit of everyone.<eos>"

Foodies, gourmands, chefs and others who love food might expect that reflecting on what and how we eat can contribute to culinary pleasure. However, philosophical discussions of food have often been about other topics, such as the acquisition of knowledge or the pursuit of pleasure. Sometimes, philosophical conversations about food appear to be about food, but further examination reveals that these arguments explore deeper, but only loosely connected, points. Food is inherently social and cultural. It is shared with those in our communities and provides us with dining companions and infrastructure. Ethical issues related to food include what we should eat and the extent to which cooking in restaurants and the home differ. Cooking in the home is often more intimate and inclusive, while cooking for a living has different obligations and restrictions. Food and dining can play a role in bridging cultural gaps. We can come to appreciate others by learning to enjoy their food and forge personal bonds with people from other cultures by coming together to eat.<eos>"

Rob Daviau is a US designer who creates 'legacy' board games. These games are different from traditional board games because they have a permanent impact on the game. For example, in one game, players might have to rip up cards or deface the board. The games play out over a fixed number of sessions and long-held grudges become woven into the fabric of the game.

Daviau was asked to collaborate on a legacy version of Pandemic, a popular co-operative board game title. His next project was a board game called SeaFall. Legacy board game designers must consider all possible player choices to ensure the narrative doesn’t fall apart. To do this, designers recruit testers so they can observe how board games will unfold.

Legacy board games were never expected to go mainstream, but most players love the concept. The legacy format draws on video games and the demand for episodic entertainment fuelled by popular TV series.<eos>"

Once upon a time, there was an octopus named Inky who lived in a tank at the New Zealand National Aquarium. One night, Inky managed to escape from his tank and swim into the Pacific Ocean. It was a story that was shared online and was very popular.

One of the things that makes the story interesting is that it involves anthropomorphism, which means treating animals like humans. In the case of octopuses, this is especially true because they are very intelligent creatures. Scientists have found that animals have many of the same abilities as humans, such as the ability to consider the past and the future, to demonstrate empathy and self-awareness, and to anticipate the motives of others.

However, there is also a problem with anthropomorphism. It can lead us to make assumptions about animals that are not true. For example, we might think that because octopuses are intelligent, they are also able to learn human languages. This is not true. Octopuses do not have the ability to learn human languages.

Despite these challenges, de Waal believes that we are beginning to learn to appreciate animal intelligence more. He points out that there are many examples of animals helping humans, such as dogs guiding blind people and dolphins helping people find lost objects.<eos>"

Once upon a time, there was a technology called robotics that has the potential to change the world. Robots have already been used in the automotive and manufacturing industries for many years. Experts say that in the next few years, robots will be used in many other industries.

There are a lot of different opinions about the impact of robotics on jobs. Some people believe that robots will take over all of the work that humans do. However, others believe that robots will create new jobs.

The truth is that robots will definitely impact lower-skilled people. However, there are ways for people to move up or adapt to the changing job market. One way is to get training in STEM fields.

In addition to the challenges presented by the increased use of robots, there are also a number of opportunities. For example, companies that are able to take advantage of this shift in technology can grow rapidly.

In conclusion, the future of work is changing rapidly. We need to be prepared for the challenges and opportunities that robotics presents. By investing in education and training, we can ensure that we are able to compete in the global economy.<eos>"

Because it's there, the mountaineer George Mallory is said to have answered a reporter's question about why he wanted to climb Mount Everest. The reporter was probably thinking about the general public's desire to understand why anyone would participate in such a dangerous and seemingly pointless pursuit. It is possible that the climber's answer may inspire some to act on their dreams. It challenges a certain type of person to face the unknown. Yet its real merit lies in its generality, which reminds us that there may be no other reason for climbing than adventure and fun.

There are different types of climbing activities, such as playing around on boulders or scaling Himalayan peaks. Each activity has its own set of rules. The style used to tackle any climb depends on the rules of that particular activity. Climbing can be a very freeing and confining activity. It can give you a feeling of freedom, but it can also restrict you. There is an apparent paradox in many forms of climbing. But one can also argue that the limited options available give the climber’s life a simplicity that is itself a form of freedom.<eos>"

My grandfather's garden was a beautiful place. It was on the bank of a river and sloped gently down towards the water. You couldn't reach the river but you could hear the sound of the water and the birds that sang in the trees above. I imagined that all gardens were like this – a place of escape, peace and solitude.

My father was a quiet and withdrawn person. He had a few phrases that he liked to use, one of them being 'It's immaterial to me'. He was probably disappointed that he hadn't made more of his life. He left school without qualifications and became apprenticed to a plumber. Plumbing was not something he was passionate about. It was just what he did.

I always wanted to like the piano but it did its best to intimidate me. The only thing I did like about it were the two brass candlesticks that jutted out from the front. I'd walk along the river bank looking for a suitable spot where I could take off the painful sandals and leave them with my picnic while I ventured out, tentatively, peering through the water for any fish that I could scoop up with the net and take home.

One day my father announced that there was a vacancy for an apprentice gardener in the Parks Department. I thought you might be interested. I like to feel that somewhere deep down inside him, although he hated gardening himself, he'd watched me doing it for long enough and noticed the keenness and the passion for all things that grew and flowered and fruited that hadn't disappeared.<eos>"

When John Maloof bought a box of old photo negatives at an estate auction, he discovered the mystery of Vivian Maier. Maloof was looking for images to use in a book about the history of the Portage Park neighbourhood in Chicago. Instead, he found 30,000 images by Maier, a street photographer with a keen eye for capturing compelling images. Since then, Maloof has amassed an archive of Maier’s life and work.

Maier was born in 1926 in New York and spent much of her childhood in France. In 1951, she returned to New York and in 1956 came to Chicago to work as a nanny. Maier always had a camera with her and dressed in oversized coats, broad-brimmed hats and stout shoes. She was a private person but had strong opinions about movies and politics.

Maier’s work is the purest form of art. Her images lean toward women, children, the old, the poor, the abstract. Maloof often wonders if he’ll ever work his way through all the negatives. The funny thing is he had no real interest in photography until he discovered Maier’s work. Inspired by her architectural shots, Maloof actually went out on the street and began to take his own pictures.<eos>"

In the early 1950s, a young Englishwoman named Jane Goodall arrived in Africa. She spent most of her life in Africa and became known for her work as a scientist, activist, and environmentalist.

Goodall's most important contribution to science was her research on chimpanzees. She discovered that chimpanzees eat meat, create and use tools, and share with humans a similar set of emotions and social systems. Her work has been widely influential and has helped to change the way humans think about themselves.

Goodall's book, The Chimpanzees of Gombe, is the single most authoritative work on chimpanzees. It is a comprehensive guide to everything we know about chimpanzees. Goodall's work has also been instrumental in changing the way we study animals. She helped to create a new field of study called primatology, which is the study of primates.

Even as a child, there were a few early indicators of the person Jane Goodall would become. One day, when she was five years old, she crawled inside a henhouse to find out how hens lay eggs. This event is a symbol of Goodall's curiosity and determination.<eos>"

Her voices are recognisable to people who have seen children’s TV and cartoons, and to people who have seen computerised employee programmes about health and safety.

Shirley talks about what it takes to do voiceovers. You have to bring the script to life for an audience who can’t see you. You also have to be able to create the right sounds from the back of your throat.

Adult female actors are frequently asked to provide the voices for small boys and girls. Their voices are lighter than those of male actors. To get a job doing voiceovers, you need to have a strong showreel and be persistent.

For anyone considering a career doing voiceovers, Shirley recommends attending ‘specialist workshops’ and having a passion for human sound.<eos>"

It was twenty years ago that Susie Ray left London for a small coastal town in south-west England. She is a copyist artist who can reproduce the richness of an early-20th-century impressionist masterpiece as easily as the brilliance of a 16th-century Caravaggio portrait.

Susie has been in great demand since she started her career as a copyist artist. She has painted the works of numerous great artists, including Renoir, Monet and Van Gogh. Her reproductions are so faithful that art experts mistake them for the originals.

However, Susie has never been tempted to pass off her copies as the real thing. She believes that doing it badly would be letting the artist down. She also knows that making fakes tends to end up in trouble.

Susie has always been open about what she does. She will make it look as authentic as possible, but she will put her own signature on the back of the canvas.

When younger painters approach Susie for advice, she stresses the importance of learning to draw and to represent things accurately. She also emphasises how much she’s studied to be able to do what she does.<eos>"

During Ellen MacArthur's racing days, the sea was her greatest passion. She had a unique connection with her boats, which worked as one. When she was on land, life felt trivial. After she came second in a solo round-the-world race, she took you into her boat and showed you how she prepared for the race. She talked about the careful planning that went into provisioning, working out exactly how much food and supplies she would need. Her housekeeping was just as impressive as her sailing. The boat was her world and she looked after it because her life depended on it.

Now, Ellen sees the world as a boat. She has been working to save the planet. She believes that we have to design a way of not using up our precious resources. She also launched the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a charity that works through business and education to give young people the vision to rethink and redesign a sustainable future.<eos>"

Jordan Romero is 13 years old and wants to be the youngest person to climb Mount Everest. If he succeeds, he could become one of the most famous teenagers of his generation. Young people are spending more time on computers and games consoles, so Jordan hopes to inspire kids to climb their own mountains. He has already climbed five of the Seven Summits and might actually do it before his teenage years are over.

There are some people who think that taking a young climber up the world’s highest mountain is a bad idea. They say that a young climber might have the necessary physical strength, but they doubt whether a teenager would be emotionally strong enough. They also couldn’t see how a young person could have gained enough experience to develop the good judgment and reactions a climber must have in order to take part in such a project safely.

But Jordan’s parents believe that their own experience as climbers will help them. They weigh up the risks all the time, but they think that their son is strong and mature enough to handle the challenge. They also know that Jordan is motivated and has a goal that he is working towards.

Jordan is excited about his goal and is focused on achieving it. He knows that there will be challenges, but he is determined to overcome them. He also knows that if he wants to inspire others, he has to play the media game and offer something spectacular.<eos>"

When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, it's probably not classical music they're listening to. Most people our age can name a lot of pop groups, but few of us know who Brahms was. I started doing a music degree, but the people on my course know no more about classical music than anyone else. If you don’t know who wrote the music, you are unlikely to own any recordings of their work. The statistics are not very encouraging for a lover of classical music. Apparently only a small percentage of concert tickets sold last year were for classical music events, and the average classical recording sells very few copies.

There are a few reasons why teenagers don’t like classical music. First, the pace and rhythm of classical music are not very appealing to us. We like to talk fast, play fast, and think fast. Second, classical music is structurally complex and requires time and concentration to appreciate. Third, the subject matter of classical music is not very relatable to teenagers. Finally, the way we listen to music has changed. Nowadays, you can find any music you want at the click of a mouse, and yet the sound track to our lives is rarely classical.<eos>"

I met Cody Simpson a long time ago. He is a 15-year-old Australian singer who has already released a lot of successful songs. I don't know exactly how he ended up on a stage in front of thousands of fans, but I do know that he started singing when he was very young. He started writing songs when he was seven years old. He was also a very talented swimmer. He was training hard with some of the best coaches and putting his focus into perfecting his sport.

But then record labels came calling, and he had a tough choice to make. He had to choose between staying in Australia and continuing swimming, or taking a huge risk and moving with his entire family to the US. He decided to take the risk. He packed his bags and went with his family halfway around the world, giving up one dream in the hope of making another one come true.

Of course, there are days when he feels doubt. But he knows that his family is always there to support him and encourage him in everything that he does. Success comes from a willingness to say 'yes' to your big break, even when it's a little scary to do so.<eos>"

Mum caught Jess by the arm and asked her to come with her to the study. There was a painting on the table, which was one of Grandpa’s. It was unlike anything he had done before and clearly nowhere near finished. Mum spoke about the painting and asked Jess if she knew anything about it. Jess shook her head and said she had never seen it before. The picture was strange and beautiful. There was a river in the picture, but it was not a real river. The riverbank was almost insignificant. There were no animals or people in the picture. It felt right that way. There seemed no place for living things in this remote vision. Yet, Jess was captivated by the painting. Mum spoke again and said the painting had a name. There was something in her voice that betrayed her enthusiasm. Jess read the name of the painting aloud. It was called 'River Boy.' The words seemed to carry a strange resonance. There was a further mystery. Jess looked round at Mum. 'There is no boy.' 'Exactly. Strange, isn’t it?' Mum said. She knew why. Grandpa never gave his pictures names. He just painted them and left others to make sense of them, if they could.<eos>"

When I woke up this morning, I didn't mean to damage my bedroom carpet. It just seemed like a good idea at the time. I was trying to find a way of fitting my corner cabinet into a corner. Gran had given me the cabinet when she moved out of her house into a flat. It's really cute and I keep my collection of shells and fossils and interesting stones there.

The problem was, the cabinet was too tall to fit into the angle between the roof and the floor. If I could only slice a couple of centimetres off the bottom of it... That was when it came to me. If I couldn't slice anything off Gran’s cabinet, how about cutting a hole in the carpet? It just seemed like the obvious solution. What Dad calls lateral thinking.<eos>"

The novel 'The Borrowers' is about a family of tiny people who live hidden in the walls and floors of a house. They secretly borrow things from the normal-sized people in order to survive. When I was asked to direct a TV adaptation of the novel, I knew it was going to be hard to live up to people’s expectations. The author had told me she wanted the series to be from the Borrowers' perspective, not a human one, which made filming much more complex.

The most crucial thing was getting the scale right. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans, so I had to be much further away from the camera than on a normal shoot. When filming the human surroundings the Borrowers found themselves in, the crew had to crawl along the ground and film from no higher than 15 centimetres.

One big challenge was finding a way to get the shadows right when the images of the supposedly tiny Borrowers were combined with a background image of ordinary-sized surroundings. We developed a unique technique for this. The costumes were also a big challenge. I had them made out of heavy canvas material so that they stuck out in the way that dolls’ clothes do. Unfortunately, the weather was really hot during filming. I don’t think either of them thanked me for my attention to detail with those costumes!<eos>"

Mom pulled up at the corner of my new school, Palm Grove High School. She looked around nervously, searching for journalists. I don't know how long it will take before the trouble starts. It always does. The fake smiles, the wannabe friends, the people who want free tickets to one of my dad's concerts. I told her, ""Everything's going to be fine."" She kissed her fingertip and touched my cheek right before I got out of the car. Then she was off, leaving me alone with this whole new school and situation.

I walk in the school's main office and ask for my schedule. The secretary seems confused. She types 'McGraw' on her keyboard and then prints my schedule. English Literature, first period. Cool, I can deal with that. I'll be late, though. English is in Room 214, second floor. I studied the map the night before, as I didn't want to look like a complete buffoon searching for my classes. When I get to the door, I hear the teacher already taking roll. I slip in undetected and sit down at the last desk in the second row. The girl next to me smiles. She scans over my very normal and, might I add, very clever outfit – jeans and a T-shirt. Ha! Nobody will ever suspect me now!

The teacher pauses in the roll taking and looks at me. 'Desert... McGraw?' she says hesitantly. 'Here.' The teacher then smiles and introduces herself as Ms. Smigla. She talks a lot and eventually hands us our course outlines. After we review them and she tells us all about books we're required to read this year, she actually gives us time to socialize!

The average American teenage girl is expected to be the Student Council president, have a part-time job, volunteer, and excel in all of these fields. Being an American teenager today is challenging. There are a lot of stresses that teenagers have, including homework, tests, extracurricular activities, jobs, chores, and responsibilities at home. Despite these stresses, teenagers still have to deal with negative stereotypes about them. These stereotypes often include being lazy, disrespectful, rebellious, loud, reckless, and self-absorbed. However, not all teenagers are like this. Many teenagers are hardworking, responsible, and caring. They are also using technology to their advantage to make their lives easier. For example, students can now take their work on the go with them and do their homework wherever they happen to be. With the introduction of smart phones, tablets, and social media, students can now take their work on the go and do their homework wherever they happen to be. This has created what appears to be a cell phone addiction. Many teenagers start their days around 6 a.m. or 7 a.m. and often end after midnight. This schedule is crammed with school, after-school activities, family obligations, and homework. And then, he or she must get up and do it all again the next day, with fewer than the recommended nine hours of sleep a night.<eos>"

The teenage members of the Earth to Sky Calculus Club live in Bishop, a mountain town in the US, surrounded by wilderness. They have launched over fifty balloons to the edge of space. It's a long-running science project that includes astronomy experiments and backcountry adventures. I joined them one weekend in late spring. They were releasing a high-altitude balloon to record shooting stars.

As it got dark, the teenagers secured a soft insulated lunch box to the bottom of the balloon. Inside was a camera, an instrument to measure altitude, and a thermometer. Two GPS trackers were mounted on the outside of the lunch box to help the group find it later. They used a gas tank to inflate the balloon and watched it ascend.

After the launch, most of the students went home, but a few stayed to watch the shooting stars. They lay on blankets on the mountainside and gazed at a sky so clear, it was hard to believe you're just four hours from Los Angeles.

It took the recovery team 11 hours to find the lunch box. It was in a canyon, high on a flat rock, in the middle of a cascading waterfall. The camera hadn't recorded any shooting stars. Sure, it's a bit of a disappointment, but it's also a perfect opportunity to argue over the effects of atmospheric waves, and how they might work above mountain ridges.<eos>"

When you travel by car with your family, even when you're young, you probably know that you're not 'there yet,' even as you're asking over and over 'Are we there yet?' It's not 'there' anymore once you get there. It's 'here'. So if you really think there's a chance that you're 'there' yet, you should be asking 'Are we there yet?'.

When you travel by car, there are a lot of things you can do. You can watch DVDs, listen to music, or play puzzles. You can also act as co-pilot and help your parents keep the car running smoothly.

But sometimes, things don't go as planned. Your sibling might put their foot on your side of the seat or hurl their whole body over into your space. If this happens, you might get angry and start fighting. But your parents will probably be there to help you calm down and keep you safe.

Over the years, your parents have developed strategies for dealing with kids on the back seat. One strategy is to answer the question 'Are we there yet?' with the answer 'No, you're not there yet.' This usually keeps everyone quiet for a while.<eos>"

John and Zuzi Morgan have opened a café in Oxford, UK, where people can enjoy coffee, cake, and board games. They hope that people will enjoy the experience so much that they will want to repeat it.

The games that are played in John and Zuzi's café are called Eurogames. They are known for their gentle themes and easy rules. The first Eurogame was created by a German designer named Klaus Teuber. It is called The Settlers of Catan. Players build settlements on an island and trade resources with each other.

There are also co-operative games where everyone wins or loses as a team. Pandemic is a popular co-operative game. It is about solving global problems. Pandemic was created by a North American designer named Matt Leacock. He was inspired by a Eurogame called Lord of the Rings.

The growth of the video games industry has also helped to the success of Eurogames. Video games have made it more acceptable to play games in public. As a result, more people are open to playing board games.

In conclusion, tabletop gaming has become more than entertainment. It has become a way for people to share their love of games and interact with each other in a physical way.<eos>"

Television presenter Helen Skelton has completed many dangerous challenges for charity, including a desert marathon run and a journey down the Amazon river in a tiny boat. For her latest challenge, Helen walked on a high wire, a long thin piece of metal, 66 meters above the ground. There was no safety net, only a belt around her waist attached to another wire above. To help her keep her balance and not to fall, she carried a long stick, weighing eight kilograms. Helen took lessons from an expert high-wire walker. Although she already had a few circus skills, she quickly discovered that high-wire walking was completely different. The training was a shock, said Helen. 'I didn’t realise how strong I’d need to be. Every day started at 8 am with a run up a steep hill; then came an hour of exercises, with another hour of them after my day practising on the wire. I also had to learn how to fall onto the wire so that if I slipped I could carry on. Every time I fell on the wire it hurt badly. But it was essential to keep a positive attitude: if I was nervous and started shaking, so would the wire!' The day of the actual challenge was windy and Helen controlled herself by taking deep breaths as she moved step by step along the wire. The 150-meter walk took 15 minutes. 'That was the scariest thing I’ve done,' she admitted afterwards. 'I’m glad it’s over!'<eos>"

I work at a university in the US. My team and I are learning more about water birds, especially one called the American black duck. We have started using a new piece of equipment called a night-vision scope, which allows us to see the ducks in the dark. We are worried about black ducks because their numbers have fallen hugely and we don’t know whether there’s enough food on the east coast for these animals. We haven’t had any information about what they do at night, because we simply haven’t had the equipment. But this new ‘scope’ will produce really clear pictures, even on moonless nights, so we’ll be able to find out more and make better decisions about looking after the area where they live based on what we learn. It is hard work. There are four of us, each working six hours daily. We have studied ducks in different locations, and I have had to take a boat to some sites and make notes on every duck I see. The weather hasn’t been very helpful – some nights are mild, but more often it’s wet. Oh, and it’s so quiet I’ve needed lots of coffee to stop me falling asleep! We’ve only missed one working day so far, because the snow was too deep even for our special snow vehicles. Still I like the challenge of it, especially compared to what the summer will bring – hours in a laboratory, where we’ll look at our results together. It’ll be hard to be stuck inside – but it’s essential to do this. And I wouldn’t change it for anything!<eos>"

Have you ever wondered what it's like to perform in a circus? Sophia Grayson is from Circus Experience, a centre that teaches young people circus skills. She says her course is popular because it includes many skills, such as juggling, throwing and catching things, trapeze, which involves flying through the air, and many other things. On the year-long course, students gradually increase the amount of risk they take in each class and parents come along to certain classes to watch progress.

To be successful in the circus, you must keep practising and be fit. You also need to have imagination and never stop improving your skills. Being fit is really important for circus artists, like athletes, who train daily to keep strong. Training is very important, but the best performers are those who want success, have imagination and never stop improving skills.

The course also covers business planning. Many previous students set up businesses all over the world, and are happy to share their experiences. However, Sophia warns, it's not a profession for making money. ""The work typically means not having a regular salary. It's also competitive - but great fun!""<eos>"

After several months, I gained my tour guide qualification and registered as an independent tour guide. Being a tour guide is more than just knowing historical facts or making sure you don’t lose anyone from your group. You also need to be able to be entertaining and tell interesting stories, and above all, you need to be able to react to changing situations. I need to make sure visitors are happy with my tours, otherwise they could post a negative review online. Like most tour guides, I realise that these reviews are really important, as good reviews attract more customers. That’s why making tours fun and stress-free is essential.<eos>"

My day starts early, at 4 a.m., when I go to the market to buy fresh flowers. It's usually cold and dark at that time, but I don't mind. The market is full of beautiful flowers from all over the world. I choose the flowers that people want and set up vases with them.

Sometimes, customers are surprised by how expensive flowers are. I have to ask them to think again about what they'd like. But I like thinking about how I can put together the nicest possible flowers for the amount of money someone wants to spend. That's what you have to do when you're selling things. I wouldn't want any other job.<eos>"

My city has a modern cinema that shows all the latest films I want to see, and lots of films for kids at the weekends. It’s close to where I live, but a year ago, I realised something was missing – the experience of discussing a film in detail with a group of people after watching it with them. So, together with two friends, I started a film club. We decided to keep the costs low, so we don’t hire a cinema. Instead, we choose a different location in the city each month. We’ve been to some free places and also places where the owners make money by selling snacks. We’re happy to make enough to cover our costs – we’re not trying to make a profit. Each time we show a film, everything is a bit easier for us. We also know how many tickets we’ve sold because everything’s online. There’s still always plenty to do, but when people of all ages come up to say what a great experience they’ve had, it’s wonderful. We’ve started a blog, too, because we know that most people now go online for information about films, rather than read reviews in local papers. We’ve also tried putting up a few posters in cafés. Nothing’s as successful as word of mouth, though – people recommending us to their friends.<eos>"

Taking photographs was always my favorite activity as a child. When I was 15, I felt that if I wanted to take my hobby to the next level, I had to do something special. So I decided to start a personal project: I would take one photograph every day for a whole year of my life. I was amazed to discover that there were others who liked the way I saw and photographed things. I was also enjoying photographing a wide range of subjects. Then someone suggested that if my photographs all had a common topic or idea to connect them, my project would be even better – and I agreed. So I began to concentrate more on taking photos of nature scenes, especially of birds and the sky. A lot of them were black and white photographs, which was very different to what many other young photographers were doing – they were all taking colour photos. As a result I sometimes had doubts about my project, and I almost gave up several times. In the end, however, I trusted my own feelings, and became more confident about my photographic style and choices. One day I showed my project to my art teacher at school. She told me about a national photography competition for people my age. So I entered some of my photos, just for fun. I’ll never forget the moment when the judges told me that I had won first prize; I was so happy, as my project meant so much to me. It was the first time I realised that maybe my photography really was good, and that I might actually be able to work as a professional photographer.<eos>"

Last year, I joined the National Youth Challenge (NYC) because I wanted to learn new skills and have new experiences. In the NYC, you can do many different activities to challenge yourself. There are different levels, from beginner to advanced, run by adult volunteers called 'leaders'. When you complete each level, you get a certificate.

When I first joined, my leader suggested that my first challenge should be helping to organise activities at a local children’s club for two hours a week. I was a bit hesitant at first, but I decided to take up the challenge. Soon, I was spending all my free time at the children’s club. It meant a lot more to me than just getting the certificate. And when I finished the challenge, the NYC leader let me keep on volunteering at the club because I’d built up some great relationships with the children. Now I’m there for about four hours a week and I always really look forward to going.

Because of what I’ve learned at the children’s club, I’ve decided that when I finish school in three years’ time I want to go to college to become a qualified youth worker – someone who works with children. I’d never thought about my future job before starting at the club, and the idea of youth work had never entered my mind. This has been my favourite part of the NYC so far and I’ve improved my own communication skills while at the same time helping others. I’ve got several other NYC certificates now and yes, one of them is for camping.<eos>"

I was born in Denver, USA, and started snowboarding when I was eight years old. My dad took me to a resort in the mountains, about two hours from Denver. The hill was very steep, so my dad had to do a lot of persuading to get me on a board. I was young, so I hadn’t even thought about asking him if I could start snowboarding, but he was already into it and wanted me to love it too. I managed to do well. After this experience, I started competing aged ten. I enjoy taking part in competitions and winning too. I have a lot of fun training and studying during the summer. It’s the best way of dealing with not being able to do what I love so much. I have to think carefully about my future. Snowboarding is such a huge part of my life now, but I also feel it’s important to have something else I can do, just in case I don’t succeed as a professional snowboarder or if I get injured.<eos>"

When I was fifteen, I wanted everything my friends had. I didn't plan ahead, like what I wanted to do when I left school. One day, my best friend got a new phone and I thought I should have one too. My parents said I could only have it if I paid for it myself, so I decided to work part-time and save as much as I could. I owe my parents a lot for making me do that – it taught me a really valuable lesson. I worked every Saturday in a café, but I didn’t really enjoy it. My parents suggested starting my own little business instead. I started making necklaces and selling them to my friends and family. They were delighted with them, but I still needed convincing that they looked good enough to be popular with the public. There was only one way to find out, so I rented a market stall with my mum. There are always lots of tourists where I live, and they bought lots of my things to give to family and friends when they got back home. Soon we were receiving calls from all over the country from people looking to buy more. It's been such a lot of fun so far.<eos>"

When Janine Stuart was young, she wrote a novel called Being Amelia which became a bestseller. The book is partly based on Janine’s life. In one interview, Janine said that because of her family’s moving around a lot, she had become good at making new friends. She also said that she understood what it was like to be the only new student in a class.

Janine started her novel one summer, when she was feeling bored at home. Her mother had always dreamed of becoming a published author herself, and her teachers had always encouraged her to write. So, it seemed like a natural way for Janine to pass the time. The year before, she’d entered a short story competition on a young writers’ website and won first prize. That’s why, when Janine finished Being Amelia and sent it to a publishing company, the people who worked there were immediately keen to read it. They loved it, and a year later, Janine’s novel was on sale in bookshops.

One review of Being Amelia mentions how, despite the book having pictures of happy teenagers on the cover, the people in the story actually face some difficult challenges. This is what really allows readers to believe in them. The reviewer says that although Janine is still very young, and Being Amelia isn’t a particularly long novel, she’s clearly shown that she’s a better writer than several other best-selling authors.<eos>"

My name is Tom. I am fifteen years old. Three years ago, my family and I moved to a castle on a small island. My dad was invited to be the castle's manager. He works for an organisation that looks after historical buildings. It was a big change for us, but we quickly got used to island life.

The castle isn’t very beautiful, but our apartment is comfortable. The island feels very sociable in the summer, and there are often parties on the beach. During the winter, we only see the other families who live on the island. There aren’t as many teenagers among them as I had hoped. But the adults all support each other, and help with repairs on the island.

The biggest change for me was travelling by boat every day, back to my old school. I was looking forward to going on stormy days, when there are huge waves, but the ferries don’t run then. And I’ve discovered that if I miss the bus to the harbour after school, I also miss the last ferry home, which is worrying. So when schoolmates come home to stay with me, I’m always telling them to hurry up!<eos>"

I live in a beautiful house in Scotland, surrounded by countryside. I love nature and wild animals, and I started a new hobby called birdwatching six years ago. I went to the mountains in northern Scotland with my family, where we saw lots of birds in their natural environment. I spent hours watching them with my parents, who showed me how to tell the difference between species and how to find the best places to see them. It was amazing, and I joined a local young birdwatchers’ club. My goal is to see 200 different bird species, and I’ve almost achieved that. I’ve been to many places to see birds, including Egypt and South America. I also think that birdwatching clubs should try to get more young people interested in this hobby. Everyone needs to connect with nature, whatever their age, and it doesn’t have to cost much money.<eos>"

One of the most interesting developments in further and higher education in the UK has been the move to encourage novice students to become involved with research as early as possible. Research is not just for established scholars or scientists. It is a natural and fundamental way to build knowledge and skills.

There are different ways to do research. One way is to do what is called 'blue skies' research, which is the traditional view of research carried out full-time by the highly trained few. Another way is to do a more everyday enquiry approach, which involves much careful work and thoughtful questions.

Most students have always been researchers. You have been carrying out some elements of research for projects and answered questions at school or in the workplace since your first few days there. You have also been developing research and enquiry approaches and skills when exploring where to go on holiday, how to grow seeds successfully, how to fix things around the house, and how to train your dog.

Critical thinking is particularly important in research. We need to be able to engage with the research of others, think about it, test it out, and identify whether what we’re being told is presented in such a way as to trick us into agreement, or whether it is logical, reasoned and backed by evidence.<eos>"

Cities have been centers of intellectual life for centuries. They have been places where people gather to discuss ideas and share their thoughts. However, city life is not always easy. It can be exhausting and overwhelming. Scientists have begun to study how the city affects the brain, and the results are alarming. They have found that cities actually dull our thinking, sometimes dramatically so. One of the main reasons for this is the lack of nature in cities. Studies have shown that people who have access to nature recover more quickly from illness. Even small glimpses of nature can improve brain performance.

Another reason why cities are so tiring is the constant need to pay attention to our surroundings. In a city, there are always many distractions. We have to constantly be on alert for potential threats and navigate through confusing urban grids. This takes a lot of energy and effort. Natural settings, on the other hand, don't require the same amount of cognitive effort. They allow us to relax and replenish our minds.

The question remains: Why do cities continue to grow? Despite their drawbacks, cities offer many benefits, such as access to resources, job opportunities, and cultural events. However, it is important to find ways to mitigate the psychological damage of city life while maintaining its unique benefits.<eos>"

The mind is more than just the brain. It is a complex system that includes our thoughts, feelings, and emotions. There is a lot of evidence to show that things, as well as neurons, play a role in human cognitive life. From the earliest days of human history, people have used tools and other objects to extend their minds. For example, people use tools to make numbers and symbols, and they use stone to strike other stones. These tools have made it easier for people to think and solve problems.

My approach to understanding the mind is called Material Engagement Theory (MET). MET explores the different ways in which things become cognitive extensions or are incorporated by the human body. It also investigates how those ways might have changed since earliest prehistory. MET offers a new way of understanding how different forms of material culture may have provided a powerful mechanism of defining, but also transforming, what we are and how we think.<eos>"

Photography has had a significant impact on the world, especially in the United States. It became part of US culture at every level, from the practical and scientific to the aesthetic and recreational. Historians say that photography is arguably the country’s greatest single contribution to the visual arts. It has moved to the centre of US intellectual and aesthetic discourse.

There are a few reasons why photography was so appealing to people in the US. Firstly, it was a mechanical process that matched the growing enthusiasm for technology. Secondly, the camera was the perfect tool for representing oneself and family. Thirdly, photography was a way of creating and sustaining an impression of self and family. Finally, the photograph’s inherent realism was in harmony with the tendency towards realism in US art.

Photography has also been used by artists in a variety of ways. For example, Andy Warhol used photographs in his paintings and multiples. Artists have been incorporating photographs into their work for several decades. Photographic vision has come to seem not at odds with painting in the history of art, but the indispensable accessory to painting.<eos>"

In 1890, William James, an American philosopher and physician, defined psychology as the 'science of mental life.' This definition is still a good starting point for understanding psychology today. We all have a mental life, so we have some idea about what this means. However, even though the concept can be studied in rats and monkeys as well as humans, it remains a somewhat elusive one.

Psychology is about the mind or brain, but psychologists do not understand nearly enough about its workings to be able to comprehend the part that it plays in the experience and expression of our hopes, fears, and wishes, or in our behaviour during experiences as varied as giving birth or watching a football match.

The endeavour of psychology is much like that involved in solving a crossword puzzle. It involves evaluating and interpreting available clues. The clues themselves have to be derived from careful observation, based on accurate measurement, analysed with all possible scientific rigour, and interpreted using logical and reasoned arguments which can be subjected to public scrutiny.

Psychology has the same goals as any other science: to describe, understand, predict, and learn how to control or modify the process that it studies. Once these goals have been achieved, it can help us to understand the nature of our experience and come to conclusions that can be applied directly to people’s lives.<eos>"

In a storehouse in a business park in Michigan, USA, there is a museum of failed products. The museum has a collection of products that were withdrawn from sale because nobody wanted to buy them. The proprietor of the museum, Carol Sherry, sees each product as embodying its own sad story. The museum is a viable, profit-making business. It is a testament to the fact that most products fail. The museum was started by ex-marketing man Robert McMath, who intended to accumulate a reference library of consumer products. However, his collection ended up consisting mostly of unsuccessful products. The museum is a reflection of the culture of optimism that exists today. People often focus on the positive aspects of things and ignore the negative ones. This obsession with optimism is particularly prevalent in the self-help field. It is important to remember that failure is a natural part of life. It is a learning experience that can help you to grow and become stronger.<eos>"

Everyone knows that sports teams have an advantage when they play at home. But does anyone know why? Most of us probably think we do; after all, it seems obvious. But professional sport is changing faster than at any time in its history and much of what we used to take for granted is now open to question.

There are two main reasons why home advantage exists. First, the home team has the advantage of playing in front of their own crowd. This can give them a boost of energy and confidence. Second, the home team has the benefit of being able to make adjustments to the game plan based on the crowd's reaction.

However, there are some changes that have recently occurred that have made home advantage less effective. For example, travel has become much easier and the top grounds increasingly resemble one another in their soulless efficiency. As a result, the impact of playing at home has declined in all major sports.

Despite these changes, there is still some evidence to suggest that home advantage still exists. For example, researchers found that the players’ testosterone levels were higher before home matches than they were before away matches. This sense of territoriality may be connected to some primitive urge to defend home turf against interlopers.<eos>"

The more I practice, the luckier I get, said Gary Player. This quote is famous and is valued by athletes and their coaches. However, the meaning of the quote is not clear. Player didn’t literally mean lucky, he was speaking ironically. His real message was: ‘The more I practice, the better I get.’ Up to a point. Where that point is, is at the heart of the nature-nurture debate. The debate has seemed as uneven as a basketball game between giants and dwarves: nurture has been victorious. The theory that expertise in any field can be attained with 10,000 hours’ practice is true. But it is often neither. There are other factors that can influence a person’s ability, such as genes, environment, and determination.<eos>"

A recent report found that many children living in wealthy countries feel lonely and unhappy. The reason for this is that these children have been spending too much time indoors, watching TV or playing on computers, and have lost contact with the natural world.

In her book, Kith, Jay Griffiths argues that this is the heart of the problem. She believes that children need to be allowed to roam and explore the wild woods of their home territory.

A follow-up study found that a large number of children would be happier if they could simply go outside more. Many of today’s over-40s talk nostalgically about the freedom of their own youth. They spent long summer days playing outside, swimming in ponds, or making dens in tumbledown sheds.

Griffiths also has some concerns about the way children are being treated today. She argues that the fear of danger that makes parents want to keep kids at home clearly plays into the hands of the toy and gadget industry. She also has some spirited paragraphs on recent trends such as the tendency to prescribe medication as a ‘cure’ for fidgeting, restless children, or to insist that kids wear goggles to take part in traditional playground games.<eos>"

I am a research bio-psychologist with a PhD. I have done a lot of school and I am a good problem-solver. But most problems in life cannot be solved with a formula or memorised answers. They require the judgement, wisdom and creative ability that come from life experiences.

Play is the natural means by which adults and mammals have always educated themselves. It is also important for children's development. All mammals, including humans, play when they are young. The more you have to learn, the more you play.

Children need more play. If we care about our children and future generations, we must reverse the horrid trend that has been occurring over the past half century. We must give childhood back to children.<eos>"

In many countries, there are a lot of young people in their twenties who use social media to find work. There are two popular social networking sites that are often used for job hunting: Twitter and LinkedIn. These sites offer the chance for direct contact with potential employers. However, with greater access comes a greater chance to make mistakes.

For example, a young jobseeker in the US contacted a senior marketing executive via LinkedIn. The marketing executive was not impressed by the young jobseeker's message and sent a rude rejection note. This note has since gone viral. It is a warning to young people about how to use social media for job hunting.

Newspapers are facing a decline in popularity. Since 2000, the circulation of most UK national dailies has fallen by a third to half. Many people in the US now get their news from the internet instead of newspapers. Some people predict that the last printed newspaper will be buried within 15 years. However, old media have a habit of surviving. Even vinyl records have made a comeback. Newspapers were once new media, but they became the dominant medium for news in the mid-19th century. There are a lot of advantages to reading news online, such as the ability to dip in and out, personalise the news, and get minute-by-minute updates.

If humans were truly at home under the light of the moon and stars, we would go in darkness happily. Instead, we are creatures who are adapted to living in the sun’s light. We have engineered the night to receive us by filling it with light. This kind of control has some negative effects called light pollution.

Light pollution is mostly the result of bad lighting design. It washes out the darkness of night, altering light levels and light rhythms to which many forms of life have adapted. It affects migration, reproduction, feeding, and other aspects of life.

We have lit up the night as if it were an unoccupied country. It is as essential to maintaining our biological welfare as light itself. Denying darkness is futile. It causes various physical ailments and messes with our regular sleep-wake cycle.

Living in a glare of our own making, we have cut ourselves off from our evolutionary and cultural heritage. We have forgotten the scale of our being, which is best measured against the dimensions of a deep night with the Milky Way arching overhead.<eos>"

The founder of a large company recently announced that his company would no longer track employees’ paid holiday time. The company was inspired by an internet company that has implemented a similar policy. The founder's daughter wrote him an email about the policy, which sounded like it was written by a copywriter from his media team. The company has 50,000 employees and provides a variety of services. The policy seems better suited for a smaller company where employees have a better idea of each other’s workloads and schedules. However, there are some potential problems with the policy. For example, it could lead to increased guilt and stress for employees, which could lead to a decrease in productivity. It could also lead to pressure from colleagues and office gossip. Additionally, it could make it difficult for employers to track employee hours accurately. Overall, I am not sure whether this policy will be successful.<eos>"

Journal-based peer review is a process that ensures the quality of scientific research papers. It is often seen as a way to prevent flawed or nonsensical papers from being published. However, peer review can also delay the publication of a paper by up to a year. This raises the question of whether the benefits of peer review outweigh the costs. Preprints, which are drafts of papers that are posted online without having been peer reviewed, may be a way to address some of these issues. Preprints bring academics back to the core of research publication, which is to disseminate new results quickly. They also make it easier for papers to be read, critiqued, and built upon. Additionally, preprints can increase the number of times papers are read and cited by others.<eos>"

When I ask my students about poems, they often give me answers that are like ""a painting in words."" These answers usually don't satisfy me or them. One day I asked a group to choose an object and write one paragraph describing it empirically, as a scientist might, and another in the first person, from the point of view of the item itself. The exercise led to much amusement and useful discussion.

A poem is a thing made. It can be compared to wild animals or machines, but these comparisons don't really help us understand what a poem is. The most productive thing about trying to define a poem is the debate. It can help us experiment with our thoughts and see things in a new way.

A poem is also a product of writing and rewriting. It's like an article, story, or novel, but it never really becomes what they usually are – a thing created in order to become a commodity.<eos>"

Better sleep is one of travel's happy side effects. When I visited Mexico's Yucatán coast, I was surprised by how many hours I spent sleeping. There were lots of noisy birds, but it didn't matter. Surrounded by strange smells and sounds, I could plunge into a sleep that was more profound and dream-filled than I imagined possible. Sleep is something else too: it's an experience that changes rhythm, sometimes dramatically, from place to place.

Allan was born in a cold place and he has a passion for diving in cold water. He became a marine biologist and commercial diver. One day, he was working in Antarctica and a TV crew turned up to film a wildlife documentary. Allan took the crew to different places and after 48 hours, he realized that being a wildlife cameraman was the perfect job for him.

Allan has worked on many major TV wildlife series. He says that it is easier to film today than when he started 35 years ago. Today, you can shoot a lot and look at it immediately. You used to have to think what shots you needed next, and what you had missed. You shot less. Film was very expensive. Today you can have too much material.

Allan says that wildlife filming is full of great successes, but also failures and embarrassments. He has had some challenges, but he has also had some amazing experiences. He would like to make his own film about climate change in the Arctic. He says he would be able to make an extraordinary documentary.<eos>"

He will be trekking for three months, 1,000 kilometers to the North Pole, taking detailed measurements of the thickness and density of the ice. Nobody has ever done this before. The results of his expedition will be of vital importance to the scientific community.

Pen is married to Mary, a horsewoman, who says he has a ‘spine of steel’ and who shares his love of the outdoors. They live in the country with their two children. Pen is concerned about being away from his family while he is in the Arctic. He knows that if he calls them, they will remind him how far away he is.

Pen is spending these last days before departure preparing his kit, obsessively. He knows that being part of a team is actually more stressful than being alone. He also has to worry about his age and the fact that he has not done enough training.

Pen believes his mission reconnects exploration with the search for knowledge that drove previous generations into the unknown. He says that his expedition is important work and that nobody else can do it.<eos>"

I had a break from competition. I was successful as an Olympian, but I didn’t have anything to do. I wanted to stay in shape and I also wanted to compete. So I entered marathons and triathlons. I was also invited to row across the Atlantic with a TV presenter. I was tempted, but I knew I wasn’t ready to commit to the training regime. I also had to think about the cost of the race and the loss of earnings. But I decided to do it anyway. I learned a lot while planning this adventure. One of the biggest lessons was to be thankful for the easy life of a full-time athlete.<eos>"

Last year, I went to work with huskies in the Arctic Circle in Finland. I was 26 and I was feeling restless. I found a small company run by Anna and Pasi. They agreed to take me on as a husky dog handler for the winter season. From December to February, there is plenty of business taking tourists out on sled rides. The dogs are almost hysterical with excitement, straining against the ropes in their desperation to be off. I was able to join the team for three months. The work is very physical and the hours are long. But I am triumphant. I can chop with an axe, hammer a nail, and use a circular saw. 'In the snow.'<eos>"

On that day, Radcliffe ran very fast and won the race. Her time was so good that it would have qualified her to compete in the men's marathon at the world championships in Paris. Journalists were interested in her run and asked her about a natural treatment called emu oil. Cathy Freeman had recommended this treatment to heal her wounds. Radcliffe was surprised that she had won the race and felt that it was what she was meant to do that day. During the race, her husband and coach, Gary Lough, was in a car with her support team. They were worried about her pace and her ability to finish the race. But Radcliffe was determined to win and she ran very fast. At the finish line, she was exhausted but happy. She knew that she had achieved her goal and that she would leave a lasting legacy.<eos>"

When my first cookery programme, In Search of Perfection, first came out, I was nervous about how it would be received. I had created a series of programmes that I thought made a genuinely innovative contribution to the food 'revolution' sweeping through Britain. I was worried that people would not appreciate an approach to cooking that involved not just techniques but also history, nostalgia and science. I watched the first programme and was relieved that it was well-received. The success of the show paved the way for other fascinating projects, including a book based on my experiences at the restaurant I own. In each project, there is a sense of being on a journey. I wrote several books in a series called 'Perfection', each one accompanying its own TV programme of the same name. In these books, the journey was often physical, with passports and suitcases and itineraries. In Search of Total Perfection is the latest in the series, and it takes you on a journey around the world to meet extraordinary artisans. Despite the book's title, I knew that I wouldn't be claiming the recipes were in any way 'definitive'. But I reckoned that, by using my technical skill and scientific knowledge, I could pin down some of the things that made these dishes work.<eos>"

We were driving to Marrakech when the van broke down and crashed into a field. John got out and opened the hood of the car. He stood there for a long time looking at the engine. He said, ""Actually, I haven't a clue what I'm doing."" We all laughed. The field was big and there was nothing much in it. There was grass and flowers. We sat on the side of the road and waited for Mum and John to stop laughing. We watched John walk away. Mum stretched out on the grass. She asked me to tell her a story. I told her about two birds I heard talking. The birds talked about breadcrumbs and other birds. They also talked about the weather. I told her about the argument the birds had over a worm. Bea said, ""That's stupid, no-one understands bird language."" I agreed. But my voice didn't sound very convincing. Bea was upset. I flushed. How could I be lying if I remembered every single word? The more I thought about it, the more I wasn't sure. I went to sleep.<eos>"

Lucy was talking to two other pianists at the Prague Classical Music Festival. They were older than her and good enough English speakers. They talked about the pieces they were playing, where they had travelled recently, and where they were going next.

Lucy had not wanted to go to the festival, but she had made it. Her dad bought her a white-gold necklace with an L pendant to congratulate her. Her little brother Gus was excited about the festival. Grace Chang, her teacher, took Lucy out for a special dinner to strategize a repertoire.

In the elevator to their suite after the party, her grandfather turned to her. 'You did well in there, Lucy. I’m proud of you. This is an important festival, and there’s a buzz about you. They all know who you are.'<eos>"

Your dad might be right. Spending too much time online can be unhealthy. But research shows that most teenagers who use social media have a lot of friends, a good sense of identity and belonging, and are developing the skills they need to be successful in the digital age.

Social networking has become an important part of modern childhood. Teenagers use social media to connect with friends, share their thoughts and ideas, and learn new things. It can also help you develop your sense of self-identity and creativity.

If you're not outgoing or have a specialized interest, social networking can be a great way to connect with others. You can join groups of people who share your interests, share your photos and videos, and learn new skills.

Social networking can also help you develop your employability skills. If you have a lot of friends on social media, you can use that to your advantage when you're looking for a job. You can connect with potential employers and share your resume and cover letter.<eos>"

When most people think of a family vacation, I guess a road trip through the western states in the US and Canada doesn’t come to mind. However, my parents clearly weren’t looking to put their feet up as they organized our summer vacation this year. My dad seemed to have taken it upon himself to plan the ultimate family bonding trip.

We packed our car full of suitcases, coolers, and clothing. We set off on 'The Family Great American Road Trip'. As we drove west, out through the Oklahoma panhandle, we had a lot of adventures. We stopped for the night near a town in Oklahoma under the darkest star-filled skies. We learned the rule of the road: cattle get the right-of-way. We moved on to Pagosa Springs, Colorado, and climbed mountains. We learned that what are marked as Jeep roads are best left to Jeep drivers. We passed countless wind farms and watched the setting sun cast its shadows over bear habitats close to the roads.

Our trip was bittersweet to be home again, but I had a lot of fun. I got to experience the most wonderful views I’ve ever seen. I knew that for me, the things I’d remember would be the unplanned, the spontaneous.<eos>"

Rose Frost was sixteen years old and was going to live with her grandmother, Daisy. Her family was separating for two years. Her father had an assignment overseas, and her mother would be joining him, but Rose and her sister Amy were staying in England. Amy was completing her final school courses and was not moving. To Amy’s delight, she had been given the best room at the college. The free access to the Internet and phone had also not gone unnoticed. Rose was moving to her grandmother’s house. It was only vague holiday memories that Rose recalled of her grandmother. She had never known her grandfather. Her parents had not been enthused by the idea of her living with her grandma, but Daisy had insisted that it was no trouble. Rose was sensible and very mature for her age. She knew about healthy eating, about keeping fit, and getting enough sleep. But this time Rose had insisted on one thing: she wanted her independence. Living with Daisy would be fulfilling all her needs. But Rose wanted to play music loud if she wanted, and to invite friends over or go out without having to ask permission every time. Surely she could be trusted to do these small things now? She didn’t want to be nagged about homework or staying out late, and most of all she didn’t want to be dragged around by her grandmother.<eos>"

Our instructor, Gareth, told us that speed is our friend, not our enemy. We looked down the ski slope and saw David, who had some experience, skiing off down the slope towards the jump. He hit the ramp and flew upwards, arms flailing in the air. Something was wrong and we held our breath. He hit the ground and flipped head-first into the snow. Gareth said that speed is an unpredictable beast. I didn’t think I was cut out for this freestyle stuff, but I decided to try. We practised our moves indoors and then headed outside to try them for real. There were more setbacks before I finally landed properly. But I was proud of myself for achieving such an elusive goal.<eos>"

Imagine you're riding a rollercoaster in an amusement park. You come to a stop and take a deep breath. Then, the rollercoaster starts to move quickly and turns sharply. Your stomach is suspended in the air. You feel scared and excited. Amusement parks are a big industry. To create the thrills and excitement that guests seek, there are teams of highly inventive engineers and designers.

The skill of designing rollercoasters is to combine the pieces together in the right way. It's a very fine line between making the ride thrilling and making it feel like you've been bumped around. To create a great ride, the teams must piece together a strong narrative, be it a space adventure or a high-paced chase in the jungle.

However, as technology has transformed industry after industry, rollercoaster designers will also have to embrace the latest advances, such as virtual reality. But, according to experts, virtual reality can only add a veneer to the physical coaster experience.<eos>"

At 25, Miranda Ellington has accomplished a great deal as a choreographer. She creates works for many theatres and dance companies. She also still dances from time to time. It's puzzling to her why she fits both activities into her busy schedule.

As a choreographer, Miranda is essentially in a teaching role. She enjoys working with young students. She finds it easier to work with students than professionals because they're open to taking risks and are hungry for success.

When Miranda starts working with a new group, she concentrates on the dance steps and the music dictates what she does. If dancers aren’t responding well to a particular composer’s music, that can be frustrating, but she still has to find solutions.

Miranda doesn’t believe in attaching herself to one institution. She has to be prepared to adapt the way she works each time she goes somewhere new.

The conversation turns to the recent documentary on professional ballet dancers and choreographers. The documentary gives viewers an accurate portrayal of life inside a dance company. It was painful to watch but not at all manufactured for the cameras.

Miranda has done such a range of work that it's hard to categorize her. She sees herself as someone who wants to widen her horizons.<eos>"

I was asked why I travel when I can see everything on television. I agreed that you can see amazing things on TV, but why not experience them in person? This conversation gave me the idea for my crazy four-day trip. I made a film that aimed to get people to turn off their television sets. My friend was getting rid of his old sofa, which became the star of the film. I fixed the sofa with some wheels and cables and connected it to old seatbelts. I put my luggage on the seats and slept on the sofa each night. Several friends joined me on the trip, helping to pull the sofa along and encouraging me to keep going. It was the longest distance I have ever walked and it was on main roads, which meant I could stop at a roadside café and relax on the sofa with a cappuccino. I got used to telling people, ""No, I’m not doing it for charity, I’m not training for a marathon"". When someone at work asks me about my weekend, I’d rather explain how I dragged a sofa 100 miles across southern England than discuss the latest show on TV. You’ll be able to see the film on my website.<eos>"

When I read about guided swimming trips in the sea around some small Greek islands, I was excited. I'd never tried organized group trips before. My brother was busy, so I decided a group holiday might suit me. The man at the Greek port was curious when I asked for a single ferry ticket. I explained that I wouldn't be alone for long; I'd be joining ten others to swim around the tiny islands. We did a short swim to split us into speed groups, then it was time for our first proper swim. I was nervous because I'd never swum such a long distance in the open sea before. Soon, the waves got bigger and I was at the back of the slow group. I watched faster swimmers moving ahead like dolphins. I wanted to complete this first distance, though, and was delighted when I finally managed it on my own. The following days followed a routine: jumping in; reaching a comfortable speed; stopping to admire the scenery. As the swims grew greater in distance, so did my speed and pleasure at completing them. There seemed little need for the support boat. I can hardly wait to come again next year.<eos>"

I'm glad I started working as a flight attendant. I've been to many places, including the US and Australia. I work with great people, have a lot of time off, and life is always exciting.

When I was a child, I often flew unaccompanied to boarding school. I felt lonely, so I would ask the flight attendants to let me help give out meals to passengers. That's what I remembered later when I decided to change my job. There was a lot of young people at the interview, and many were like me, changing careers.

I practiced what to say at the interview, more than just saying I love to travel. Instead, I mentioned my strengths and previous work experience. I got the job! I'd recommend this kind of work to anyone, as there are so many things that make it worthwhile.

When I'm not working, I don't have to take work home. And if I do get difficult passengers, which is rare, I know the flight will soon be over and I'll probably never see them again.<eos>"

At the summer camp where I work, I really enjoy seeing the children succeed at things they never thought they could do. Most of the children know how to swim and play table-tennis, but rock climbing is a new experience for most of them. Some children feel very nervous, but after some encouragement they agree to try and they all get to the top in the end. This makes them feel great. We do get children who miss home at the beginning of the week. It's not the really young ones who feel like that the most – it's actually the ten- to thirteen-year-olds. We don't let them use their mobile phones all the time. We tell them they can phone home after lunch and sometimes after dinner. Most children are fine in a couple of days and at the end of their week's stay, they all come up to us and thank us because they have had a great time.<eos>"

Rock the Planet, a musical show where actors also have to be good musicians, opened in London last year. It was voted 'Best Musical' four times in the USA. The UK has limits on how many performances young actors can do weekly. Because of this, there were more actors needed in the UK. Luckily, the director found plenty of talented UK-based actors. The theatre in London is bigger than the US venue, but it's been full every night. The show's on in London for another year, and is well worth seeing.<eos>"
