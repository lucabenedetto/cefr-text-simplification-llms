Some time ago, there was a website that talked about the risks of public check-ins. It said that if you post something online, it can be seen by a lot of people. This made people think about the downsides of sharing things online. The internet has a lot of opportunities to share your life with the world. You can use it to become famous or wealthy. But you also need to be careful because the internet can be a dangerous place.
In the early days of the internet, there was a young man named Justin Hall who started posting things online. He was one of the first bloggers. He shared a lot of personal information about himself, including photos and art. One day, Hall's site was hacked and his private information was shared with the world. This made people lose trust in him. Hall's story is a warning about the risks of sharing things online.
Another example of the risks of sharing things online is the story of Heather Armstrong. She had a blog where she wrote about her job and her personal life. One day, an anonymous person sent the address of Armstrong's blog to her boss. This led to her being fired from her job. Armstrong's story is a reminder that we need to be careful about what we share online."

A long time ago, some scientists started a campaign to warn people about a movie called What the Bleep Do We Know? It showed that there is a lot about the universe that we don't understand. Even though some scientists can be a bit arrogant, they don't claim to have all the answers. Some people felt that the movie was very dangerous and issued warnings about it. The movie was a must-see for everyone. But for the first twenty minutes, I couldn’t see what all the fuss was about. Then, the movie started to talk about some new discoveries and I began to see what the fuss was really about. One of the discoveries was that water molecules can be affected by thoughts. I had heard rumours about this before, but the movie didn’t give much evidence to support it. Still, lots of people find this evidence to be very convincing. But before we get too excited, we need to have some good proof that the effect is real. The movie's claims were not bizarre enough. They were too easy to believe. The real problem is that we don’t have enough evidence to support the claims made in the movie."

Writing novels is like planting a forest, and writing short stories is more like planting a garden. The two processes complement each other, creating a complete landscape that I treasure.
Writing novels takes a long time and a lot of commitment. It's like planting a forest, which takes years to grow. Writing short stories is more like planting a garden, which takes less time and is easier to complete.
I write novels and short stories alternately. Once I finish a novel, I feel like writing some short stories. And once I have written a group of short stories, I feel like writing a novel.
Writing short stories is a necessary change of pace for me. It's like taking a break from the forest and planting a garden. It's also easier to create a story out of the smallest things.
I find writing short stories to be a rewarding experience. It's like setting out soft shadows in the world and leaving faint footprints. It also makes me happy to be able to share my intimate feelings with my readers."

Science is a powerful force that has improved our lives and threatened our existence. It has also inspired us to dream big and to understand the universe. Science has its beauty and its perils, but it is also important and fallible.
Scientists come in many different colors, and they often disagree with each other. But they always keep working to learn new things and to improve their theories. Sometimes, scientific theories change very quickly. But science always keeps moving forward.
Science has also had a big impact on the world. It has helped us to understand the universe and to control it. But science also has the potential to harm us. We have to be careful to use science responsibly.
Science is a complex and challenging field, but it is also a rewarding one. It is a field that can teach us about ourselves and the world around us. It is a field that can help us to improve our lives and to make the world a better place."

From around 2015, there was a time when major publishers started to report that sales of ebooks had stopped growing, or even fallen in some cases. This made people question whether ebooks would continue to be popular. One publishing executive admitted that the ebooks hype may have been too much, and that his company had lost confidence in the power of the printed word. Despite the evidence, the idea that ebooks will ""kill"" print books still continues to be discussed.
The idea of one medium replacing another is not new. It has happened many times before. For example, when television was invented, people thought that radio would die. But radio ended up surviving by finding new uses. The same thing happened with the introduction of the phonograph, movies, and other technologies.
The idea of the disappearing book is a powerful one because it taps into our emotions. We create strong bonds with objects that we use regularly, and the emergence of a new technology can disrupt those bonds. As a result, we often find ourselves longing for what we used to know, but no longer have.
This is why entire industries develop around retro products and older technologies. For example, the spread of the printing press made people seek out original manuscripts. The shift from silent to sound movies stimulated nostalgia for the older form. The same happened with the shift from analog to digital photography, and from vinyl records to CDs."

Every day, I wake up early and do some things that help me write. I make coffee, brush my teeth, and write about how some of the greatest minds of the past have approached writing. I also write about my own life and my struggles with creativity and productivity.
I have a lot of concerns about creativity and productivity. How do you do meaningful creative work while also earning a living? Is it better to devote yourself wholly to a project or to set aside a small portion of each day? And when there doesn’t seem to be enough time for all you hope to accomplish, must you give things up or can you learn to condense activities, to do more in less time, to ‘work smarter, not harder’?
I have tried to provide examples of how a variety of brilliant and successful people have confronted many of the same challenges. I wanted to show how grand creative visions translate to small daily increments; how one’s working habits influence the work itself, and vice versa.
This book is about people’s routines. It’s about the circumstances of creative activity, not the product; it deals with manufacturing rather than meaning. But it’s also, inevitably, personal. I have documented all of my sources in the Notes section, which I hope will also serve as a guide to further reading."

Howard became a palaeontologist because he was interested in dinosaurs. He wanted to become a palaeontologist since he was young. He studied delicate creatures revealed on the surface of grey rocks. He finished his doctoral thesis and got a job at a college in London. He was surprised to find that he got the job, but he was also disappointed that he did not get the job he wanted. He often found himself contrasting the orderly nature of his professional life with the anarchy of private concerns. But he was grateful that he had the job and that he could support himself by doing the sort of work he wanted to do."

Charles Spence is a Professor of Experimental Psychology at Oxford University in the UK. He has studied how the senses interact to form our perception of flavour. Through his studies, he has influenced what we eat and drink. He has also studied how the person who orders first in a restaurant enjoys their food most and how much we consume more food when eating with others.
Spence's lab is un-space-age. It has soundproof booths and stacks of ancient-looking audio-visual equipment. He can afford to work more creatively with cooks because he keeps his overheads low.
Spence is currently helping famous brands through reductions in salt and sugar. He points out that it is in their interests to help loyal customers stay alive for longer.
What, one wonders, are dinner parties like in the Spence household? They're all extensions of the lab to Spence."

Our brains are very busy these days. We have a lot of information to deal with, including facts, rumors, and things that are not true. We also do more things ourselves now than we used to. For example, we make our own reservations and find things in shops. We do a lot of different things at once, but it's not multitasking. It's more like spinning plates. When we think we're multitasking, we're actually switching from one task to another very quickly. This can be stressful and make it harder to focus on the task at hand. Multitasking also makes it harder to learn new information and make decisions. It's a real problem, especially with email. We feel obligated to answer emails, but it's impossible to do that and get anything else done."

In a Swedish zoo, there is a chimpanzee named Santino who breaks up concrete into pieces at night. Was he being spiteful? In caves in the US, female bats help unrelated fruit bat mothers if they can’t find the right birthing position. Are they being caring? Fifty years ago, people thought that animals didn’t have consciousness or feelings. But recently that has changed. Thanks to research into the behaviour of bats, chimps, and other animals, we now know that animals have emotions. It is a change that has started a debate about whether animals can be said to have consciousness. This debate is complex and there is no easy answer. But it is important because it raises questions about our relationship with animals and our responsibility to them."

Critical thinking is a way of understanding what we read or listen to in a deeper way. It involves thinking about the information and forming your own opinion. There is a belief that argument is a way of finding the truth. Although technology can help us store and process information, it can also make it more difficult to think critically.
There are a few things that can make it harder to think critically. One is the amount of poor yet charismatic thinking that we are exposed to. Another is the fact that we are often distracted by real-time media and multi-tasking. As a result, many people – particularly those who are younger – wind up underachieving and not making the most of their capabilities.
However, there are also some ways that technology can help us to think critically. One is that it can give us access to a wealth of information. Another is that it can make it easier to learn new things. Finally, it can help us to connect with others and share our ideas."

When Matthew Crawford is not writing or thinking about how we should live, he works as a motorcycle mechanic. He wrote two books about the benefits of manual trades and how to cope with modernity.
Crawford says that our attention is being pulled away by many things, including advertisements, video games, and our phones. He also says that we are more conscious of other things we might be doing.
Crawford's proposed solution has two parts. First, we need regulation of noise and distraction in public space. More importantly, though, Crawford advocates skilled practices as a way of engaging with the world in a more satisfying way.
For example, if you like to cook, you can practice your skills by making a meal for your family and friends. If you like to play hockey, you can practice your skills by playing with your friends. If you like to ride motorcycles, you can practice your skills by riding around town."

""What do you do for a living?"" is a common question. If you are a philosopher, it is a little harder to answer. It is because describing yourself as a philosopher sounds a bit pretentious. However, there are some good reasons why philosophers are important.
One reason is that philosophers have established themselves as people who judge the activities of others and celebrate intellectual life. They have also argued that a life lived in contemplation is the most virtuous of all.
Another reason is that philosophy can help people look a little more closely at the practices and behaviours that define their lives. It can help people to understand themselves better and to make better decisions.
Philosophy is a valuable tool that can be used to improve our lives. It can help us to think more clearly, to be more compassionate, and to live more fulfilling lives."

Foodies, gourmands, chefs and others who love food might expect that thinking critically about what and how we eat can contribute to culinary pleasure. However, historically, philosophical discussions of food have been mostly about other topics, such as the acquisition of knowledge. Sometimes, philosophical conversations about food appear to be about other things, but further examination reveals that these arguments explore deeper, but only loosely connected, points.
Food is inherently social and cultural. It is shared with those in our communities and provides us with dining companions and infrastructure. We interact with food more frequently and in more fundamental ways than any other commodity. Therefore, it is an obvious topic of philosophical enquiry.
Once food has been prepared, people will start talking and writing about it. But why do these people enjoy such a privileged status? One philosopher has reminded us that tasting what we eat is not some sort of special expertise, but rather that influential food critics are simply better at describing food tastes. Another aspect of food is aesthetics. We talk about paintings or symphonies being beautiful, but not the taste of food. Some philosophers have argued that, given the rise of modern gastronomy, food has earned its proper place in aesthetic discourse along with sculpture or poetry.
There are undoubtedly many ethical issues that attach to food. We can ask what we should eat and our answers will often reveal our ethical beliefs. And philosophers will always ask why the answers are what they are."

Rob Daviau is a designer from the US who creates legacy board games. These games are different from traditional board games because they have a permanent impact on the game. For example, in one game, players might have to rip up cards or deface the board. The games play out over a fixed number of sessions and long-held grudges become woven into the fabric of the game.
Daviau was asked to collaborate on a legacy version of Pandemic, a popular co-operative board game title. His next project was a board game called SeaFall. Legacy board game designers must consider all possible player choices to ensure the narrative doesn’t fall apart. To do this, designers recruit testers so they can observe how board games will unfold.
Legacy board games were never expected to go mainstream, but most players love the concept. The appeal of an unfolding adventure trumped any concerns about longevity. The legacy format draws on video games and the demand for episodic entertainment fuelled by popular TV series."

Once upon a time, there was an octopus named Inky who lived in New Zealand. One night, Inky managed to escape from his tank and swim into the Pacific Ocean. It was a story that was shared online. One of the things that makes this story interesting is that it involves anthropomorphism, which means treating animals like humans. Octopuses are especially good at anthropomorphism because they are very intelligent creatures. They can open jars, recognize faces, and use coconut shells as armor.
Anthropomorphism is often thought to be unscientific, but Dr. Frans de Waal, who studies primates, argues that it is not. He says that anthropodenial, which is the opposite of anthropomorphism, has too often characterized our attitudes toward other species. Animals have been observed exhibiting many of the same behaviors as humans, such as the ability to consider the past and the future, to demonstrate empathy and self-awareness, and to anticipate the motives of others.
However, de Waal remains skeptical of Inky’s happy ending. He points out that, while captive octopuses have escaped their tanks before, it’s probably overly optimistic to think that Inky figured out how to get to the drain leading to the ocean. But de Waal is aware of the power of viral stories to fuel appreciation of animal intelligence. He once ran an experiment to test whether capuchin monkeys can experience envy. The study was published in a prominent scientific journal soon afterwards. But what really convinced people of the findings was a one-minute video clip of the experiment, released ten years later."

Once upon a time, there was a technology called robotics that has the potential to change the world. Robots have already been used in the automotive and manufacturing industries for many years. Now, experts are saying that robots will soon be used in many other industries.
One of the main challenges with the widespread use of robots is that it will lead to job loss. However, experts also say that it will create new jobs. For example, there will be more jobs for technicians and programmers.
Another challenge is that society is not prepared for the changes that robots will bring. For example, robots will make it easier for people to interact with each other. This could lead to changes in the way we work and socialize.
Despite the challenges, experts believe that robotics has the potential to improve our lives. For example, robots can help us to be more efficient and productive. They can also help us to live longer and healthier lives.
In order to prepare for the robotic workforce of tomorrow, we need to invest in education and training programs. We also need to develop new regulatory frameworks to ensure our safety and privacy."

Because it's there, the mountaineer George Mallory is said to have said about why he wanted to climb Mount Everest. People have a desire to understand why anyone would participate in such a seemingly meaningless and life-threatening pursuit. Climbing can inspire some to act on their dreams and challenge a certain type of person to face the unknown. It also has the ability to provide freedom and fun.
There are different types of climbing activities, such as playing around on boulders or scaling Himalayan peaks. The style used to tackle any climb depends on the rules of that particular activity. Climbing can be a very confining and restricting activity, but it can also be a simple and freeing experience.
When asked why people climb, there are different answers. Some people climb because it is in their genes, while others climb because it helps cultivate important virtues such as courage, humility and respect for the environment. Climbing can also help develop traits and virtues that allow one to flourish and live well in our non-climbing world."

Alfred Brendel is a famous pianist who has been playing classical music for many years. He is known for his intellectual and disciplined personality. He has written and played a lot of music, but he has not taught very many students. Those who knew him well saw a playful side to his character, but that was seldom on display in his concerts.
Brendel has a special relationship with a young boy named Kit Armstrong. Kit is a talented musician who is learning from Brendel. Brendel has noticed that Kit has a phenomenal memory and that he is a phenomenal sight reader. He also has a great ability to listen to his own playing and to understand what Brendel is saying.
Brendel is proud of Kit's accomplishments. He says that Kit is a very gifted musician and that he has a bright future ahead of him. However, he also warns that it is important to be patient and to not expect too much from young musicians.
Now that Brendel is older, he is still busy composing music and playing the piano. He says that he is grateful for all of the things he has accomplished in his life."

My grandparents' garden was a special place for me. It was located on the bank of a river and was very peaceful. I imagined that all gardens were like this. They were places of escape, peace and solitude.
My father was a quiet and withdrawn person. He had a few phrases that he liked to use, one of them being 'It's immaterial to me'. He was probably disappointed that he hadn’t made more of his life. He left school without qualifications and became apprenticed to a plumber. It wasn’t something he was passionate about.
I always wanted to like the piano but it did its best to intimidate me. The only thing I did like about it were the two brass candlesticks that jutted out from the front. I was never allowed to play it. Instead lessons were booked for my sister.
I liked to spend time on the river. I would go there and imagine myself in another world. I would walk along the river bank and look for a spot where I could take off my sandals and leave them with my picnic while I ventured out, tentatively, peering through the water for any fish that I could scoop up with the net and take home.
One day my father announced that there was a vacancy for an apprentice gardener in the Parks Department. I thought I might be interested. Dad had gone against his better judgement. He might still have preferred it if I became a carpenter. But I like to feel that somewhere deep down inside him was a feeling that things might just turn out for the best. If I stuck at it."

When I score a goal, people often say that it's just luck, but it isn't. I have worked hard to improve my skills since I was a kid. If I'm teaching kids, the most important thing I try to get across is to enjoy learning skills. I used to do all sorts of sports at school, but football was the only thing I was really passionate about. I want to make sure that my son has the same opportunities that I had.

When John Maloof bought a box of old photo negatives at an estate auction, he discovered the mystery of Vivian Maier. Maloof was looking for images to use in a book about the history of the Portage Park neighbourhood in Chicago. Instead, he found 30,000 images by Maier, a street photographer with a keen eye for capturing compelling images. Since then, Maloof has amassed an archive of Maier’s life and work. He has a lot of her cameras, film, prints, negatives, movies and audiotapes.
Maier was born in 1926 and spent much of her childhood in France. She returned to New York in 1951 and came to Chicago in 1956 to work as a nanny. Maier always had a camera with her and dressed in oversized coats, broad-brimmed hats and stout shoes. She was a private person but had strong opinions about movies and politics.
Maier’s work is the purest form of art. Her images lean toward women, children, the old, the poor, the abstract. There is so much more to this work than Maloof thought. Now their goal is to get her name out there."

The silence at Centre Court during the Wimbledon tennis championships is very quiet. You can bounce the ball and hit it, and you hear the echo of your shot. The grass is soft and the stadium is ancient. The players are dressed in white and the crowds are respectful. The quiet of the Centre Court is good for your game. It helps you to focus on the point you are playing and to shut everything else out.
When a point is done, there is a lot of noise. People cheer and applaud. You hear them, but it feels like they are coming from a long way away. You are so focused on the game that you don't notice the number of people watching you.

In the early 1950s, a young Englishwoman named Jane Goodall arrived in Africa. She spent most of her life in Africa and became known for her work as a scientist, activist, and environmentalist.
Goodall's research on chimpanzees has been very influential. She discovered that chimpanzees eat meat, use tools, and have emotions like humans. Her book, The Chimpanzees of Gombe, is the most authoritative work on chimpanzees.
Goodall's work has also changed the way humans think about themselves. She has helped us to understand that we are more closely related to chimpanzees than we thought. She has also helped us to understand that we share many of the same emotions and social behaviors as chimpanzees.
Even as a child, there were some early indicators of the person Jane Goodall would become. One day, when she was five years old, she crawled inside a henhouse to find out how hens lay eggs. This event showed that Goodall was always curious and had a strong interest in science."

During my first conversation, Shirley Ford spoke to me in the voice of a young boy, his tired mother, and a fast-talking alien. Her voices are recognisable to people who have seen children’s TV and cartoons, and to people who have seen computerised employee programmes about health and safety.
Shirley talks about what it takes to do voiceovers. You have to bring the script to life for an audience who can’t see you. You also have to be able to create the right sounds from the back of your throat.
After school, Shirley enrolled on a drama course and had some occasional work singing jingles for TV adverts. One day, she was asked to try out for the part of a rabbit in the soundtrack for a cartoon. She ended up getting a major part.
Shirley has learned to create the right sounds from the back of her throat and to avoid always sounding like the same child. She collects new voices as she watches children’s TV.

Dreams are important too. We lose dreams all the time when we wake up early. When researchers deprive people of REM sleep, there is an increase in the amount and intensity of REM sleep the following night. Dreams are where we bring things together in fresh, often surprising ways.
We need to dream to be creative and flexibly. We live in a complex world. All of us need our brains to be functioning fully. We need to think creatively and flexibly as we negotiate relationships with colleagues, co-workers, family, and friends."

It was twenty years ago that Susie Ray left London for a small coastal town in south-west England. She has a studio with a beautiful sea view and hangs photographs of her two daughters on the walls. Susie is a copyist artist who can reproduce the richness of an early-20th-century impressionist masterpiece as easily as the brilliance of a 16th-century Caravaggio portrait.
The problem is that Susie is very busy. She has painted the works of numerous great artists, including Renoir, Monet and Van Gogh. Her reproductions are so faithful that art experts mistake them for the originals.
Susie has always been open about what she does. When she reproduces an old masterpiece, she will make it look as authentic as possible. However, she will put her own signature on the back of the canvas.
When younger painters approach Susie for advice, she stresses the importance of learning to draw and to represent things accurately. She also emphasises how much she’s studied to be able to do what she does."

Ellen MacArthur was a racer who loved the sea. She had a special connection with her boats. They worked together like one. When she was on land, she felt like everything was trivial. After she won a race, she took you on a tour of her boat. She talked about the careful planning that went into provisioning and housekeeping. She said that preparation was everything. She also started a charity to help young people rethink and redesign a sustainable future."

Jordan Romero is 13 years old and wants to be the youngest person to climb Mount Everest. If he succeeds, he could become one of the most famous teenagers of his generation. He wants to inspire kids to climb their own mountains or venture outdoors. His team includes his father, Paul, and mother, Karen. They call themselves 'Team Romero.' If Jordan can climb Everest and Vinson Massif in Antarctica, he will become the youngest person to have climbed the Seven Summits. Few people achieve this under the age of thirty. Jordan has already climbed five of the Seven Summits and might actually do it before his teenage years are over.
There are some people who think that taking a young climber up the world’s highest mountain is a bad idea. They say that a young climber might have the necessary physical strength, but they doubt whether a teenager would be emotionally strong enough. They also say that a young person couldn’t have gained enough experience to develop the good judgment and reactions a climber must have in order to take part in such a project safely.
But Jordan’s parents believe that their own experience as climbers will help. They also believe that watching Jordan develop gives them confidence. They talk to him regularly to make sure he hasn’t lost the motivation to do it.
Jordan says that he just focuses on achieving his goal. He knows that achievement too often replaces enjoyment during such challenges, but he wants to inspire others."

When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, it's probably not classical music they're listening to. Most people can name a few pop groups, but not many know who Brahms was. I started doing a music degree, but the people on my course know no more about classical music than anyone else my age. If you don’t know who wrote the music, you are unlikely to own any recordings of their work. Classical music is not very popular among teenagers. There are a few reasons why this is the case. First, the pace and rhythm of classical music are not very appealing to us. Second, classical music is not structurally very simple. Third, the subject matter of classical music is not very relatable to teenagers. Finally, the way we listen to music has changed. Nowadays, you can find any music you want at the click of a mouse. The sound track to our lives is rarely classical."

I met Cody Simpson a long time ago. He is a very successful singer from Australia. He has already released a lot of popular songs. I don't know how a surfer guy ended up on a stage in front of so many people, but it's a story that is interesting.
Cody started playing the guitar and writing songs when he was young. He was also a very talented swimmer. He was training hard with some of the best coaches and putting his focus into perfecting his sport. But then record labels came calling, and he had to make a tough choice. He had to choose between staying in Australia and continuing swimming, or taking a huge risk and moving to the US.
Cody decided to take the risk. He packed his bags and went with his family halfway around the world. He gave up one dream in the hope of making another one come true. Of course, there are always days of doubt. But Cody is always positive. He knows that success comes from a willingness to say 'yes' to your big break, even when it's a little scary to do so."

I woke up and looked at the river. The ice was shining in the sunlight. I helped my grandfather to protect the buildings from flooding. I worked hard all last week. My grandfather didn’t notice. I saw a boy on the river bank. He was trying to balance on an ice shelf. I put on my wetsuit and jacket. I checked my lucky chain. It was a silver chain that my grandfather brought back from South America. I went to the kitchen and got a banana. My mom smiled at me. She said, ""You're up early for a Saturday."" I headed downstairs and saw Grandpa. He was angry. He said, ""What's the point of training? You didn’t win the competition."" I felt sad. But I took a deep breath and tried to forget about it. I went outside and went to the boathouse."

Mum caught Jess by the arm and asked her to come with her to the study. There was a painting on the table. It was one of Grandpa’s, but it was different from his other paintings. It was not finished and it was strange. The picture had a river that was not real. There were no animals or people in the picture. It felt like there was no place for living things. But Jess was captivated by the picture. She thought about the coming of autumn after a long, rich summer. Mum spoke again. She said the painting had a name. The name was 'River Boy'. It was a strange name. Jess didn’t understand why the painting had a name. And there was another mystery. The painting was missing a boy. Mum said she knew it was a mistake. But she couldn’t resist asking Grandpa about it."

When I woke up this morning, I didn't mean to damage my bedroom carpet. It just seemed like a good idea at the time. I was trying to find a way of fitting my corner cabinet into a corner. Gran had given me the cabinet when she moved out of her house into a flat. It's really cute and I keep my collection of shells and fossils and interesting stones there.
But the thing is, it is a corner cabinet. That is why it is shaped like a triangle. It has to stand in a corner. I've only got two corners in my bedroom. I'd tried fitting Gran’s cabinet into the angle between the roof and the floor, but it was just the tiniest little bit too tall. If I could only slice a couple of centimetres off the bottom of it... That was when it came to me. If I couldn’t slice anything off Gran’s cabinet, how about cutting a hole in the carpet? It just seemed like the obvious solution."

The novel 'The Borrowers' is about a family of tiny people who live hidden in the walls and floors of a house. They borrow things from the normal-sized people in order to survive. When I was asked to direct a TV adaptation of the novel, I knew it was going to be hard to live up to people’s expectations. The author had told me she wanted the series to be from the Borrowers' perspective, not a human one, which made filming much more complex.
The most crucial thing was getting the scale right. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans, so I had to be much further away from the camera than on a normal shoot. When filming the human surroundings the Borrowers found themselves in, the crew had to crawl along the ground and film from no higher than 15 centimetres.
One big challenge was finding a way to get the shadows right. We developed a unique technique for this. The costumes were also a big challenge. They were made out of heavy canvas material so that they stuck out in the way that dolls’ clothes do. Unfortunately, the weather was really hot during filming.
Most of the action that takes place away from the Borrowers’ home had to be shot with the actors separated from their surroundings. We filmed them in front of a blue screen on an otherwise empty set. It was a challenge for them to react to things that weren’t physically there."

Mom pulls to a stop at the corner of my new school, Palm Grove High school. She looks around nervously, looking for journalists that aren’t there. I tell her everything is going to be fine. She kisses her fingertip and touches my cheek right before I get out of the car. Then she’s off, leaving me alone with this whole new school, whole new situation to deal with.
I walk in the school’s main office and ask for my schedule. The secretary seems confused and makes a face. But I get my schedule and it’s cool. English Literature, first period. I’ll be late, though. English is in Room 214, second floor. I hear the teacher taking roll and slip in undetected. The girl next to me smiles and I feel a little nervous. She has a lot of expensive-looking stuff. Ha! Nobody will ever suspect me now!
The teacher introduces herself and gives us our course outlines. After we review them and she tells us all about books we’re required to read this year, she actually gives us time to socialize. All teachers should realize the importance of this. I make a new friend and talk to her for a while. She’s cool. I tell her my dad is an artist and she doesn’t care. Excellent."

In the United States, teenage girls are expected to be Student Council president and have part-time jobs, volunteer, and excel in all of these fields. Being an American teenager today is challenging. There is a lot of pressure on teenagers to do well in school, have a social life, and take care of themselves.
Teenagers have a lot of homework, tests, and extra-curricular activities. They also have jobs, chores, and responsibilities at home. All of this takes up a lot of time, and it can be difficult to maintain a social life.
Despite the challenges, teenagers are still able to do many things. They can take their work on the go with them, do their homework wherever they are, and connect with friends and family through social media.
However, teenagers also have a lot of stress. They often have to wake up early and go to school late at night. This can make it difficult to get enough sleep. Many teenagers don't get the recommended nine hours of sleep a night. This can lead to problems in school and other activities.
Despite the challenges, teenagers are still able to make a positive impact on the world. They can volunteer, help others, and make the world a better place."

The teenage members of the Earth to Sky Calculus Club live in Bishop, a mountain town in the US, surrounded by wilderness. They have launched over fifty balloons to the edge of space. It's a long-running science project that includes astronomy experiments and backcountry adventures. I joined them one weekend in late spring. They were releasing a high-altitude balloon to record shooting stars.
As it got dark, the teenagers secured a soft insulated lunch box to the bottom of the balloon. Inside was a camera, an instrument to measure altitude, and a thermometer. Two GPS trackers were mounted on the outside of the lunch box to help the group find it later. They used a gas tank to inflate the balloon and watched it ascend.
After the launch, most of the students went home, but a few stayed to watch the shooting stars. They lay on blankets on the mountainside and gazed at a sky so clear, it was hard to believe you're just four hours from Los Angeles.
It took the recovery team 11 hours to find the lunch box. It was in a canyon, high on a flat rock, in the middle of a cascading waterfall. The camera hadn't recorded any shooting stars. Sure, it's a bit of a disappointment, but it's also a perfect opportunity to argue over the effects of atmospheric waves, and how they might work above mountain ridges."

Chloe Morgan loves science, especially Palaeontology. She started to be interested in the subject when she was fifteen. It happened by chance when her younger brother was going through the dinosaur phase. Chloe was reluctant to help at first, but she ended up lending a hand and she was amazed by the recent discoveries in the field.
Paleontology is not a common career choice for young people, but Chloe was determined to pursue her passion. She met her first professional palaeontologist, Matt Cornelius, and he was very patient and willing to listen to her questions.
Dinosaurs continue to fascinate us because they are mysterious and because they remind us that there is still more out there to be discovered. Palaeontology is a great form of time travel and it can teach us about the past and the future."

When you travel by car with your family, even when you're young, you probably know that you're not 'there yet,' even when you ask 'Are we there yet?' over and over. Once you get there, it's not 'there' anymore, it's 'here'. If you really think there's a chance that you're 'there yet,' you should be asking 'Are we there yet?'.
When you travel by car, you can do many things, such as watching DVDs, listening to music, or playing puzzles. You can also act as co-pilot and help your parents keep everything running smoothly. But sometimes, things can go wrong. For example, your brother or sister might put their foot on your side of the seat or hurl their whole body over into your space. If this happens, you might get angry and start fighting.
Over the years, your parents have developed strategies for dealing with you on the back seat. For example, your dad might say, 'Yup. We're here. Get out of the car.' But if you're still on the highway, going fast, he might say, 'Oh, well, then maybe we're not there yet.'
So once and for all, please note: if your parents are still near enough to answer your question, then the answer is: no. You're not there yet."

John and Zuzi Morgan have opened a café in Oxford, UK, where people can enjoy coffee, cake, and play board games. They hope that people will enjoy the experience so much that they will want to repeat it. Zuzi explains why they decided to turn their love of tabletop games into a full-time business: 'There's so much technology. Everybody's busy on their mobile phones and other gadgets. We wanted to bring people back together in a way that’s not just staring at screens. It’s a natural thing in people. We're supposed to be together and communicating with each other.'
The games that are played in John and Zuzi's café are called 'Eurogames'. They are known for their gentle themes, such as farming and landscape-building. The first Eurogame was created by a German designer, Klaus Teuber. Players establish settlements on an island and trade resources with the other players. The games that follow this type of game are called 'co-operative' games. In these games, every player wins or loses as a team member. Pandemic, a Eurogame in which players must collaborate to solve global problems, was created by a North American, Matt Leacock. He was inspired by a Eurogame called Lord of the Rings.
The growth of the video games industry has also contributed to the success of these modern, ingeniously designed board games. Video games and board games have learned a lot from each other. There are more people who are open to the idea of playing games than ever before. Tabletop gaming has become more than entertainment. It’s a way to bring people together and share experiences."

One of the most interesting things happening in education in the UK and around the world is that students are being encouraged to do research earlier in their studies. This means that research is not just for famous scholars or scientists. It can also be done by everyone.
There are different ways to do research. You can do it by reading books, articles, and websites. You can also do it by talking to people and asking questions. If you are a student, you can make a contribution to knowledge by making your own research. You can do this by asking questions, finding answers, and sharing your findings with others.
Critical thinking is an important part of research. You need to be able to think about the information you are given and evaluate its validity. You also need to be able to test out the information and see if it is true. If you are not able to think critically about the information you are given, you may not be able to learn very much from your research."

Cities have always been centers of intellectual life. They have been places where people gather to discuss ideas and share their thoughts. However, city life is not always easy. It can be exhausting and overwhelming. Scientists have begun to study how the city affects the brain, and the results are not always positive. They have found that cities can actually dull our thinking, sometimes dramatically so. One of the main reasons for this is the lack of nature in cities. Studies have shown that people who can see trees from their windows recover more quickly from illness. Even small glimpses of nature can improve brain performance. This is because nature provides a break from the urban grind. It also helps us to focus better and concentrate. In addition to the lack of nature, cities also have a lot of other challenges, such as traffic, noise, and pollution. These challenges can be very tiring for the brain. They can make it difficult to concentrate and focus. However, there are ways to mitigate the psychological damage of the metropolis. One way is to create vibrant urban parks. Another way is to find ways to reduce traffic and noise pollution. By taking these steps, we can make cities more livable and more conducive to creativity and innovation."

The mind is a complex thing. It is like a stick that is used by a blind person. The stick is a part of the blind person's body. It helps the blind person to see. The mind is also a part of the human body. It helps us to think and learn.
There is a lot of evidence to show that things and neurons participate in human cognitive life. From the earliest days of human history, people have used tools and other objects to help them think. For example, people have used stone tools to make fire and to cut wood. People have also used writing systems to record their thoughts.
The study of the mind is called neuroscience. Neuroscientists use brain-scanning machines to study the brain. However, they often forget that much of our thinking takes place outside our heads. For example, when we make numbers or symbols out of clay, or use a stone to strike another stone, we are using our minds to interact with the material world.
My new theory, called Material Engagement Theory (MET), explores the different ways in which things become cognitive extensions or are incorporated by the human body. It also investigates how those ways might have changed since earliest prehistory. MET offers a new way of understanding how different forms of material culture may have provided a powerful mechanism of defining, but also transforming, what we are and how we think."

Photography has changed the course of civilization and the way we know the world. It has been especially true in the United States, where photography became part of US culture at every level. Historians say that photography is arguably the country’s greatest single contribution to the visual arts. In no other art form has US work loomed so large.
Photography has been appealing because it is a mechanical process that matches a growing enthusiasm for technology. It also brings the wonders and sights of the world into the front room with an immediacy that is breathtaking. Additionally, photography has been important for creating and sustaining an impression of self and family, and for representing everyday realities.
If we want to understand a photograph historically, then we need to pay special attention to its purpose and function within a given cultural matrix. We also need to consider the placement and framing of the photograph. If the camera’s importance to the artist was kept secret for a long time, it is now, for the contemporary artist, anything but a secret."

In 1890, William James, an American philosopher and physician, defined psychology as the 'science of mental life.' This definition is still a good starting point for understanding psychology today. We all have a mental life, so we have some idea about what this means. However, even though the concept can be studied in rats and monkeys as well as humans, it remains a somewhat elusive one.
Psychology is about the mind or brain, but psychologists do not understand nearly enough about its workings to be able to comprehend the part that it plays in the experience and expression of our hopes, fears, and wishes, or in our behaviour during experiences as varied as giving birth or watching a football match.
The endeavour of psychology is much like that involved in solving a crossword puzzle. It involves evaluating and interpreting available clues. Complex interactions are the norm rather than the exception in psychology, and understanding them depends on the development of sophisticated techniques and theories.
Psychology has the same goals as any other science: to describe, understand, predict, and learn how to control or modify the process that it studies. Once these goals have been achieved, it can help us to understand the nature of our experience and come to conclusions that can be applied directly to people’s lives."

In a storehouse in a business park in Michigan, USA, there is a museum of failed products. The museum has a collection of products that were not successful. The proprietor of the museum, Carol Sherry, sees each product as embodying its own sad story. The museum is a viable, profit-making business. It is a testament to the fact that most products fail.
The museum was started by a man named Robert McMath. McMath intended to accumulate a reference library of consumer products. He started purchasing a sample of every new item he could find. What McMath hadn’t taken into account was that most products fail. As a result, his hoard came to consist overwhelmingly of unsuccessful ones.
The culture of optimism in today's society may be responsible for the goods lining the museum’s shelves. People often have a positive outlook on life and fail to see the potential for failure. This obsession with optimism is particularly prevalent in the burgeoning ‘self-help’ field.
Psychologist Carol Dweck suggests that our experiences of failure are influenced by our beliefs about the nature of ability. If you have a fixed theory mind-set, you believe that ability is innate. If you have an incremental theory mind-set, you believe that ability evolves through challenge and hard work."

Everyone knows that sports teams have an advantage when they play at home. But does anyone know why? Most of us probably think we do; after all, it seems obvious. But professional sport is changing faster than at any time in its history and much of what we used to take for granted is now open to question.
There are two main reasons why home advantage exists. First, the home team has the advantage of playing in front of their own crowd. The crowd can generate a lot of noise and energy, which can help the home team to perform better. Second, the home team has the advantage of being familiar with their own environment. They know the layout of the field, the weather, and the crowd. This can give the home team an edge in terms of strategy and execution.
However, there are some changes that have recently occurred that have made home advantage less effective. For example, travel has become much easier, so players are no longer as tired when they travel to away games. Additionally, modern-day stadiums are more similar to each other, so there is less difference in the playing conditions between home and away games.
Despite these changes, home advantage still exists. There are a number of factors that can contribute to home advantage, including the team's spirit, the players' testosterone levels, and the crowd's energy."

The more I practice, the luckier I get, said Gary Player some time ago. This quote is famous and is valued by athletes and their coaches. It is easy to see why.

Where that point is, is at the heart of the nature-nurture debate. The debate is about whether talent is born or acquired. There are different opinions on this topic. Some people believe that talent is born, while others believe that it is acquired. But there is no clear answer. The important thing is to practice. If you practice a lot, you will get better."

A recent report found that many children living in wealthy countries feel unhappy and lonely. The reason for this is that these children have been spending too much time indoors and not enough time outside. They have lost contact with the natural world and have become dependent on technology.
A follow-up study found that the children would be happier if they could go outside more. Many of today’s over-40s talk nostalgically about the freedom of their own youth. They spent long summer days playing outside and making dens in tumbledown sheds.
There are some concerns about the way children are being treated today. Some parents are overly cautious and keep their children indoors. Others prescribe medication or insist that kids wear goggles to take part in traditional playground games.
The book also discusses the idea that children should be allowed to roam and explore the wild woods of their home territory. However, it does not provide any information about how to achieve this safely."

I am a researcher who has a lot of school and I am good at solving problems. But I don't think that my schooling has much to do with my ability to solve problems. Most problems in life can't be solved with a formula or memorized answers. They require the judgement, wisdom and creative ability that come from life experiences.
For children, those experiences are embedded in play. Play is the natural means by which adults and mammals have always educated themselves. It is also important for children to learn other skills, such as the ability to think creatively, get along with other people and co-operate effectively.
School has become more difficult and there has been a decline in playtime. Children don't need more school. They need more play. If we care about our children and future generations, we must reverse the horrid trend that has been occurring over the past half century. We must give childhood back to children."

Newspapers are not doing well. Their circulation has fallen by a third to half since 2000. Many people no longer read newspapers as their main source of news. Some people predict that newspapers will be extinct in the next 15 years. However, old media have a habit of surviving. They have survived many changes over time. For example, radio has flourished in the TV age, and cinema has held its own against videos and DVDs. Newspapers were once new media, but they became the dominant medium for news in the mid-19th century. Now, we have new ways to get news. We can read news online, on our phones, or on our computers. We can also get news from social media. All this is a world away from the straitjacket of newspaper publication.

If humans were truly at home under the light of the moon and stars, we would go in darkness happily. Instead, we are creatures who are adapted to living in the sun’s light. We have engineered the night to receive us by filling it with light. This kind of control has some negative effects called light pollution.
Light pollution is mostly the result of bad lighting design. It washes out the darkness of night, altering light levels and light rhythms to which many forms of life, including ourselves, have adapted.
Light pollution affects many aspects of life. It can affect migration, reproduction, feeding, and our health. It can also make it difficult for birds to find their way and sing.
Living in a glare of our own making, we have cut ourselves off from our evolutionary and cultural heritage. We have forgotten the scale of our being, which is best measured against the dimensions of a deep night with the Milky Way arching overhead."

The founder of a large company recently announced that his company would no longer track employees’ paid holiday time. The company was inspired by an internet company that has implemented a similar policy. The founder said that his employees can take as much leave as they want, as long as they feel comfortable that their work can be completed on their return. However, there are some concerns about this policy. First, it is difficult to be sure that your work can be completed on your return. There is always a mountain of work to come back to after a holiday. Second, there could be pressure from colleagues and office gossip concerning who was off when, and for how long. Third, if the feelings of safety and entitlement that statutory leave provides are removed, people may feel unable to take the leave they require for fear of appearing lazy. Finally, the policy could result in a sort of paralysis, where workers did not feel able to take their entitled leave or continue to use their statutory rights as a guideline, leaving the policy obsolete."

Journal-based peer review is a process that ensures the quality of scientific research papers. It is often seen as a way to prevent flawed or nonsensical papers from being published. Reviewing a paper can delay its publication by up to a year. However, it is important to note that journal-based peer review has its limitations. Preprints are a new way to share research papers that have not been peer-reviewed. They bring academics back to what research publication is all about: the rapid dissemination of new results. Preprints also make it easier for people to critique and discuss papers. They could also become an effective outlet for negative results."

When I ask my students about poems, they often give me answers that are like ""a painting in words."" Their answers rarely satisfy me or them. One day I asked a group to choose an object and write one paragraph describing it empirically, as a scientist might, and another in the first person, from the point of view of the item itself. The exercise led to much amusement and useful discussion.
A poem is a thing made. It can be like a wild animal or a machine. But the most productive thing about trying to define a poem through comparison lies not in the comparison itself but in the debate. Poems can surprise us, even though they don't become commodities."

I bought a metal detector soon after I was married. It cost a lot of money then, but it was worth it. I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first outing.

I hid it in my wardrobe. I was anxious, but I knew I had to do something to protect it. Finally, I carried it into the council office. The torc was authenticated and eventually sold to my local council. The proceeds were split between me and the owner of the field. The torc has been far more than just a lucky windfall.

Sleeping is one of my favorite travel experiences, but I don't talk about it very much because I feel a little guilty. When friends share details of their well-planned trips, I smile and don't say much. What would they think if they knew that my own travel itineraries include naps and lazy mornings. Better sleep is one of travel's happy side effects. When I visited Mexico's Yucatán coast, I was surprised by how many hours I spent sleeping. There were lots of noisy birds, but it didn't matter. Surrounded by strange smells and sounds, I could plunge into a sleep that was more profound and dream-filled than I imagined possible. Sleep is something else too: it's an experience that changes rhythm, sometimes dramatically, from place to place. People obsess about jet lag, but I suspect that the difficulties I experience recovering from long journeys have more to do with local and cultural adjustment than time zones. When I finally fall into the local sleep pattern, I feel I have truly arrived."

I was flying east and woke up to see that it was already daylight. The landscape below was empty and looked like a dream. I could see no signs of life and the view was amazing. I shook my head and smiled at my neighbour. He woke up and smiled at me. He was a salesman from Moscow and was flying to the outer limits of civilisation. His English was not very good, but I managed to explain to him that I was flying to a city in Siberia. He was not convinced. He said that there was no road and that I could not ride a bicycle. I explained that I had reason to believe that there was a road. We talked for a while and I gave him a note. He read the note and said OK. It was six years later that I was going to join Al in Siberia. I was working as a geography teacher and I was doing well. The job was challenging and fulfilling. I had a lot of holidays and I was able to go meet Al. He was having an extraordinary adventure and I envied him. He was proving wrong the sceptics who had told him he could not do it. He was doing something that scared him nearly every day and it made him feel alive."

In the Red Bull Air Race, twelve pilots race through a series of pylons. They negotiate sharp turns, barrel rolls and loops at speeds of up to 370 km per hour. I was invited to find out what it feels like to take part. I had to sign two forms before the flight. One confirmed that I was in good health, the other that I would empty all my pockets. I also had to try to stay orientated throughout the flight. I was told to relax and enjoy the view. Half an hour before the flight, I had a safety briefing. I was told not to touch anything. By the time we were taxiing down the runway, I was ready to fly. I started to relax and enjoy the flight. However, I couldn’t relax completely. The flight was over in 10 minutes. It had been 'soft' compared to what the pilots endure when they race."

Doug Allan is a wildlife cameraman who films wild animals in cold places. If you have ever seen footage of polar bears in a nature documentary, it's probably been filmed by him. Allan was born in a cold place and he loves cold places. He trained as a marine biologist and commercial diver. Diving was his first passion, where he learned about survival in cold places.
One day, Allan was working in Antarctica when a TV crew turned up to film a wildlife documentary. They asked Allan to take them to different places and after 48 hours, he realized that being a wildlife cameraman was the perfect job for him.
Allan has worked on many major TV wildlife series. He says that his value is field experience in cold conditions. He has a feel for it and he has spent a lot of time on sea ice.
Wildlife filming is full of great successes, but also failures and embarrassments. Once, Allan was in the Orkneys to film kittiwakes. Unfortunately, he could not identify which birds they were.
Now Allan would like to make his own film about climate change in the Arctic. He says he would be able to make an extraordinary documentary."

In 2004, Pen Hadow became the first person to trek to the North Pole alone and without being resupplied on the way. He swam through cold waters, fought frostbite and polar bears. He also made it to the South Pole the same year. Now he is back in the Arctic preparing for an expedition he says is even more ambitious.
Pen is a strong and determined person. He has to be to do what he is doing. This time, however, there is far more at stake. He will set out on a three-month, 1,000 kilometer trek to the North Pole, taking detailed measurements of the thickness and density of the ice. Nobody has ever done this before, and the results will be of vital importance to the scientific community.
Pen is married to Mary, a horsewoman, who says he has a ‘spine of steel’ and who shares his love of the outdoors. They live in the country with their two children. Pen is concerned about being away from his family this time. He knows it will be difficult to stay away from them while he is in the Arctic.
Pen believes his mission reconnects exploration with the search for knowledge that drove previous generations into the unknown. He says, ""Making it to the North Pole was ultimately a personal ambition, and of limited value to anyone beyond the polar adventuring community. This time, scientists will profit from the data, and we’re creating a platform in which to engage as many people as possible in what’s happening in the Arctic Ocean."""

I had a break from my training. I was going to do something else. Being a successful Olympian is a special thing. I had the chance to do more writing and TV work, and to speak to businesses and schools. But there wasn’t anything on the horizon to get my competitive teeth into. I knew that I wished to stay in shape, so that I would be in a position to fight for an Olympic place if that dream reignited within me. So I entered marathons and triathlons. That should have been enough, but there was still the TV presenter Ben Fogle’s nagging invitation at the back of my mind. I was beginning to miss that feeling, but I still wasn’t ready to commit to the regime of training seven days a week. I spoke to some of my rowing colleagues about whether they fancied the race; I didn’t receive any enthusiastic responses. I knew that if I entered the race, even though it is billed primarily as an adventure, I would want to win. I got in contact with Ben. We spoke about the remaining costs of the race. We felt we stood a better chance than most, but it would still take work to secure it. Of course, I also had to take into account the loss of earnings that would result from being away from home. I had to weigh up the pros and cons of doing the race. I decided to do it. I learned a lot while planning this adventure, but one of the biggest lessons was to be thankful for the easy life of a full-time athlete."

Last year, I went to the Arctic Circle in Finland to work with huskies. I was 26 and I was feeling restless. I found a small company run by Anna and Pasi. They agreed to take me on as a husky dog handler for the winter season.
From December to February, there is a lot of business taking tourists out on sled rides. The company started with six dogs, and it grew to more than 100. Recently, they took over a second property. I could join the team for three months, but I knew the hours would be long and the conditions would be tough.
I arrived at the farm and was handed a pair of boots and turned out into the cold. I followed the sound of barking and joined the team of husky guides. It was a lot of fun, but it was also very difficult. I had to learn how to drive a snowmobile and how to feed and water the dogs. But I was triumphant. I emailed my friends and told them I could chop with an axe, hammer a nail, and use a circular saw in the snow."

On that day, Radcliffe ran very fast and won the race. The press was there to make sense of her extraordinary run. Her time was so good that it would have qualified her to compete in the men's marathon at the world championships in Paris. Journalists asked her about the benefits of emu oil, which Olympic gold medallist, Cathy Freeman, had recommended. Radcliffe feels that her achievement never really sank in. She was proud of what she had accomplished and felt that it was what she was meant to do that day. During the race, her husband and coach, Gary Lough, was in a car with her support team, listening to the radio coverage. With 800m left to run, Radcliffe began to calculate. She knew she could finish in under 2 hours 16 minutes if she crossed the line in less than three minutes. She ran quickly and finished the race in 2 hours 16 minutes and 25 seconds. After the race, everyone wanted to know how she had beaten the grace and skill of the East African runners. Her physiotherapist, Gerard Hartmann, had stayed with her for weeks and provided daily sessions to counter the pain she was experiencing. He says that Radcliffe was so strong that he had to go deep into her muscles and ice his thumbs afterwards. During that period, Hartmann gave so much of his time to Radcliffe that his other athletes became resentful."

When I first started a cookery programme called In Search of Perfection, I was not sure how people would react to it. There had been a lot of talk about the food revolution happening in Britain, and I was confident that we had created a series of programmes that made a new contribution to that. But I was still worried about whether people would appreciate an approach to cooking that involved more than just techniques. I watched the first programme and was relieved that it was well-received. The success of the show led to other projects, including a book based on my experiences at the restaurant I own. In each project, there is a sense of adventure, whether it's into the past, into the mind, or into cookery techniques. I wrote several books in a series called 'Perfection', each one accompanying its own TV programme of the same name. In these books, the journey was often physical, with passports and suitcases and itineraries. The latest book in the series is called In Search of Total Perfection. It takes you on a journey around the world to meet extraordinary artisans. Despite the book's title, I knew that I wouldn't be claiming the recipes were perfect. But I thought that, by using my skills and knowledge, I could pin down some of the things that made these dishes work."

We were driving to Marrakech when the van broke down and crashed into a field. John got out and opened the hood of the car. He stood there for a long time looking at the engine. He said, ""Actually, I haven't a clue what I'm doing."" Mum and I started to laugh. The field was big and there was nothing in it except grass and flowers. We sat on the side of the road and waited for Mum and John to stop laughing. We watched John walk away. Mum stretched out on the grass. She asked me to tell her a story. I told her about two birds I heard talking. The birds talked about breadcrumbs and other birds. I also told her about the weather and the argument they had over a worm. Bea said, ""That's stupid, no-one understands bird language."" I felt sad. But my voice didn't sound very convincing. Bea said, ""Liar."" I was angry. How could I be lying if I remembered every single word? The more I thought about it, the more I wasn't sure. I started to worry about how we would get home. I thought it might be easier if we could take a boat straight to London. Then I must have fallen asleep."

Your dad might be right. Spending too much time online can be unhealthy. But research shows that most teenagers who use social media have a lot of friends, a good sense of identity and belonging, and are developing the skills they need to be successful in the digital age.
There are a few things that social networking can do for you. It can help you develop your self-identity, connect with others who share your interests, and help you be creative. If you're not outgoing, social networking can be a more comfortable way to communicate. If you're a quiet person with a specialized interest, social networking can help you connect with others who share your passion.
Social networking is also becoming a creative force. Teenagers are making videos, podcasting and blogging about the things that interest them. Photo-sharing sites are transforming creativity. Keen photographers can network with each other, learn skills, swap images and deepen their own interest.
So, if you're a teenager, and you're not sure what to do with your time, social networking might be a great way to spend your time. You can use it to connect with friends, learn new skills, and express yourself creatively."

When most people think of a family vacation, I guess a trip through the western states in the US and Canada doesn’t come to mind. However, my parents clearly weren’t looking to put their feet up as they organized our summer vacation this year. My dad seemed to have taken it upon himself to plan the ultimate family bonding trip. We packed a lot of stuff into the car, including suitcases, coolers, and clothing. We set off on our journey and traveled for many miles. We stopped at a town in Oklahoma and learned the rule of the road: cattle get the right-of-way. We also visited the Great Sand Dunes and Pagosa Springs, Colorado. We learned that what are marked as Jeep roads are best left to Jeep drivers. We saw a lot of interesting sights on our trip, including wind farms and bear habitats. We also had a close encounter with a bear. After watching a rainstorm blow through, we made our way back south. It was bittersweet to be home again, but I was glad that I hadn’t fought with my brother."

Rose Frost was sixteen years old and was going to live with her grandmother, Daisy. Her family was separating for two years. Her father had an assignment overseas, and her mother would be joining him, but Rose and her sister Amy were staying in England. Amy was completing her final school courses and would be living under the guardianship of the college Head. It was her last year at school, so it would have been unfair on Amy to move.
Rose was moving to her grandmother’s house. She had never known her grandfather and had vague holiday memories of her grandmother. Her parents had not been enthused by the idea of her living with her grandmother, but Daisy had insisted that it was no trouble.
Rose was sensible and very mature for her age. She knew about healthy eating, about keeping fit, and getting enough sleep. But this time Rose had insisted on one thing: she wanted her independence. Living with Daisy would be fulfilling all her needs, but Rose wanted to play music loud if she wanted, and to invite friends over or go out without having to ask permission every time.
In five weeks’ time, Rose would begin the arduous task of starting at a new school, meeting new friends, forming bonds, and basically beginning her life again. It was her fourth senior school in five years, so she felt like a veteran at it now. At least she knew this was the last time as she would be starting her final two years at school."

Our instructor, Gareth, told us that speed is our friend, not our enemy. We looked down the ski slope and saw David, a skilled freestyle skier, going first. He flew upwards, arms flailing in the air. We held our breath because something was wrong. He hit the ground and flipped head-first into the snow. Gareth said that speed is an unpredictable beast. I had never tried freestyle skiing before, but I thought it would be fun. My parents decided to have a winter holiday at a training centre for freestyle skiing in the US. We practised our moves indoors and then headed outside to try them for real. It was difficult to convince my body to go fast, but I managed to land properly. I felt like I was walking on air. But that was short-lived. On the final run of the day, I forced myself not to reduce speed, became airborne, and landed appropriately in the landing zone."

Imagine you're riding a rollercoaster in an amusement park. You come to a stop and take a deep breath. Then, the rollercoaster starts to move quickly and turns sharply. Your stomach feels like it's in the air. You feel scared and excited at the same time.
Amusement parks are a big industry. To create the thrills and excitement that guests seek, there are teams of engineers and designers working behind the scenes. It's a challenging job to design a rollercoaster. You have to make sure that the ride is safe and exciting. You also have to make sure that the ride is unique and interesting.
The teams behind rollercoasters must work together to create a strong narrative, be it a space adventure or a high-paced chase in the jungle. They must also use their creativity and experience to test and refine the ride.
However, as technology has transformed industry after industry, rollercoaster designers will also have to embrace the latest advances, such as virtual reality. But, according to experts, virtual reality will not replace the physical rollercoaster experience."

At 25, Miranda Ellington has achieved a lot as a choreographer. She creates works for many theatres and dance companies. She also dances from time to time. It's a lot of work to be a choreographer. It's like being in a teaching role and working with young students. They are open to new ideas and willing to try new things.
When Miranda starts working with a new group, she concentrates on the dance steps and the music dictates what she does. Sometimes, it can be frustrating if the dancers don't respond well to the music. But she still has to find solutions.
Miranda doesn't like to be too set in her ways. She feels it's valuable to keep establishing contacts with new people. She also thinks that aiming high is appreciated by audiences.
The conversation turns to the recent documentary on professional ballet dancers and choreographers. The documentary is accurate and shows the hard work and dedication involved in ballet.
Miranda has done a lot of different work. She doesn't like to be labeled or to have a narrow focus. She wants to widen her horizons."
