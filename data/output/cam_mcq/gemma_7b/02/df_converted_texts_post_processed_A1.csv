Some time ago, there was a website that talked about the dangers of sharing your location online. The website said that if you post your location on the internet, everyone can see it. This is true, and it can be dangerous.
There are a lot of things that you can do on the internet, but you should be careful about what you post. If you post something online, it can be seen by anyone. This is called the ""online distribution effect.""
If you are not careful about what you post online, it can have a negative impact on your life. For example, if you post a picture of yourself on the internet, someone could use that picture to blackmail you. If you write something negative about someone else on the internet, that person could be upset.
It is important to remember that your digital life is intertwined with your real life. If you do something online that you regret, it can have a lasting impact on your life."

A long time ago, some scientists started a campaign to warn people about a movie called What the Bleep Do We Know? It showed that there is a lot about the universe that we don't understand. Even though some scientists can be a bit arrogant, they don't claim to have all the answers. Some people felt that the movie was very dangerous and issued warnings about it. The movie talked about new discoveries that showed that the universe is far stranger than anyone had expected. One of the discoveries was that water molecules can be affected by thoughts. This is a very amazing claim, but it is also very difficult to prove. The movie didn't give much evidence to support this claim. However, lots of people find this kind of evidence pretty compelling. The movie also talked about other discoveries, such as the discovery of the existence of dark energy and the discovery that our conscious perception of events lags behind reality. These discoveries are very astounding, but they also raise a lot of questions. It is clear that science is still a long way from being complete. We still have a lot to learn about the universe."

I like to write novels and short stories. Writing novels is like planting a forest, and writing short stories is like planting a garden. The two processes complement each other, creating a complete landscape that I treasure.
I write novels and short stories alternately. Once I finish a novel, I want to write some short stories. And once I have written a group of short stories, I feel like focusing on a novel.
Writing short stories is a necessary change of pace for me. It takes me less time to write a short story than it takes to write a novel. And I can create a story out of the smallest things.
I find writing short stories is a great way to learn from your mistakes. You can use what you learn from your mistakes in the next story you write."

Science is a powerful force that has improved our lives and threatened our existence. It has also inspired us to dream big and to understand the world around us. Science has its beauty and its dangers, but it is also important for our future.
Science has changed a lot over time. There have been many scientists who have made important discoveries. Some of the most important discoveries include radioactivity, X-rays, the discovery of the electron and the nucleus, and quantum mechanics.
Science has also been used to control nature. We have been able to use science to improve our lives in many ways, such as by developing new medicines and technologies. However, science has also been used to harm nature. We have polluted the air and water, and we have destroyed many ecosystems.
Science is a complex and challenging field, but it is also an important one. We need to continue to learn about science so that we can use it to improve our lives and protect our planet."

From around 2015, books sales started to go down. Some publishers were not happy. They said that the ebook hype had driven unwise investment. But despite the fact that digital and print books can coexist, the question of whether the ebook will ‘kill’ the print book still continues to surface.
The idea of one medium ‘killing’ another has happened many times before. For example, when television was invented, people said that radio would die. But radio ended up surviving. And the same thing happened with the introduction of the phonograph and the internet.
The idea of the disappearing book is a powerful one. It tells us much more about the mixture of exhilaration and fear we feel about innovation and change. It also tells us about our emotional bonds with different media.
As technology moves on, we find ourselves longing for what we used to know, but no longer have. That's why entire industries develop around retro products and older technologies."

Every day, I wake up early and do some things to write about how some of the greatest minds of the past made their time to do their best work. I write about the details of my subjects’ daily lives, such as when they sleep, eat, and work. I also write about my own concerns, such as how to do meaningful creative work while also earning a living.
I have a lot of different sources that I used to write this book. I have read biographies, magazine profiles, and newspaper obituaries to learn about other writers’ working schedules. I have also used the work of biographers, journalists, and scholars to learn more about the subject.
This book would not have been possible without the research of all of these people. I have documented all of my sources in the Notes section, which I hope will also serve as a guide to further reading."

Howard became a palaeontologist because he was interested in dinosaurs. He wanted to become a palaeontologist since he was young. He studied delicate creatures on the surface of grey rocks. He got a job as a palaeontologist. He was grateful for the job, even though it was not perfect. He often found himself contrasting the orderly nature of his professional life with the anarchy of private concerns. One day, his briefcase was stolen. He was fuming, but he was able to reschedule his lecture and report the theft. He also learned of a new collection of fossils. He was excited about the challenge and knew that this would ensure his professional future."

Charles Spence is a professor of experimental psychology at Oxford University in the UK. He studies how the senses interact to form our perception of flavour. Through his studies, he has influenced what we eat and drink. He has also studied how the way food is presented and arranged affects taste.
Spence has written a book called The Perfect Meal, which is packed with insights about food and drink. It is a fascinating book for anyone who loves to eat and drink.
Spence's lab is not very high-tech. It has soundproof booths and stacks of ancient-looking audio-visual equipment. He can afford to work more creatively with cooks because he keeps his overheads low.
Spence is currently helping famous brands reduce salt and sugar. He points out that it is in their interests to help loyal customers stay alive for longer.
What, one wonders, are dinner parties like in the Spence household? They're all extensions of the lab to Spence."

Our brains are very busy these days. We have a lot of information to deal with, including facts, rumors, and things that are not true. We also do more things than ever before. Thirty years ago, people used to make our airline reservations and help us find things in shops. Now we do most things ourselves. We have smartphones that help us do many things at once. But there is a problem with multitasking. It makes us less efficient. It also increases the production of stress hormones and makes it harder to focus. If you are trying to focus on a task and have an email sitting in your inbox, your effective IQ can be reduced by almost 10 points. It also makes it harder to make decisions. If you do your homework and watch TV at the same time, the information from your schoolwork will go to the wrong part of your brain."

In a zoo in Sweden, there is a chimpanzee named Santino who breaks up concrete into pieces at night. Was he being spiteful? In caves in the US, female bats help fruit bat mothers if they can’t find the right birthing position. Are they being caring? Fifty years ago, people thought that animals didn’t have consciousness or feelings. But recently that has changed. Thanks to research into the behaviour of bats and other animals, we now know that animals have emotions. It is a change that has started a debate about whether animals can be said to have consciousness. This debate is very difficult to solve. It is a philosophical one. Given that even defining consciousness is near impossible, can we ever hope to know what it is like to be a bat?"

Critical thinking is a way of understanding and thinking about what we read or listen to. It is like trying to find the truth. There is a lot of debate about how technology affects critical thinking. Some people believe that technology makes it easier to think critically, while others believe that it makes it harder.
There are some things that technology can do that make it easier to think critically. For example, computers can store and process a lot of information. They can also make it easier to find information. However, there are also some things that technology can do that make it harder to think critically. For example, the constant stream of information that we have access to today can be overwhelming. It can also make it difficult to focus on a single task.
It is important to understand how technology affects critical thinking. We need to be aware of the both the positive and negative aspects of technology. We also need to be aware of the ways that technology can be used to improve our critical thinking skills."

When Matthew Crawford is not writing or thinking about how we should live, he works as a motorcycle mechanic. He wrote two books about the benefits of manual trades and how to cope with modernity.
Crawford says that our attention is being pulled away by many things, such as advertisements and video games. It is becoming more and more difficult to think or remember conversations we’ve had. And because everyone is trying to protect themselves from being interrupted, we close ourselves off and no longer want to do simple things like chat to strangers.
Crawford has some solutions for this problem. First, we need to regulate noise and distraction in public space. More importantly, though, Crawford advocates skilled practices as a way of engaging with the world in a more satisfying way.
For example, if you like to cook, you can cook a meal for your friends. If you like to play hockey, you can play hockey. If you like to ride motorcycles, you can ride motorcycles. These activities require you to use your judgment and manage the presence of others in the same space."

""What do you do for a living?"" is a common question. It's a question that we often answer in a few words. But if you're a philosopher, it's a little harder. Philosophers have established themselves as people who judge the activities of others and celebrate intellectual life. But philosophers are no different from the masses. They have the same problems and concerns as everyone else.
However, there are some things that philosophers do that other people don't. They spend a lot of time thinking about ideas and trying to understand the world. They also write books and articles about their ideas. And sometimes, they teach others about their ideas.
If you're interested in learning more about philosophy, there are a few things you can do. You can read books and articles about philosophy. You can also talk to a philosopher. And you can take a philosophy class."

Foodies, gourmands, chefs and others who love food might expect that thinking about food can contribute to culinary pleasure. However, historically, philosophical discussions of food have been mostly about other topics. When philosophers talk about eating, it is often a metaphor for something else, like knowledge or pleasure. Sometimes, philosophical conversations about food appear to be about food, but they actually explore deeper points. It is interesting to note the case of the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus, who believed in the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain. Epicurus' name is often used to describe people who love eating and drinking. Food is also social and cultural. It is shared with our communities and provides us with dining companions and infrastructure. We interact with food more frequently and in more fundamental ways than any other commodity. That is why food is a natural topic for philosophical enquiry. Once food has been prepared, people will start talking and writing about it. But why do these people enjoy such a privileged status? One philosopher has said that tasting what we eat is not some sort of special expertise, but rather that influential food critics are simply better at describing food tastes. Another aspect of food is aesthetics. We talk about paintings or symphonies being beautiful, but not the taste of food. Some philosophers have argued that, given the rise of modern gastronomy, food has earned its proper place in aesthetic discourse along with sculpture or poetry. But food is destroyed – eaten – by the process of enjoying it, which is not the case when we view, read or listen. There are undoubtedly many ethical issues that attach to food. We can ask what we should eat and why the answers are what they are. Whatever the answers, they will often reveal our ethical beliefs."

Rob Daviau is from the US and he designs legacy board games. He felt that the traditional board games he had played as a child were no longer entertaining or challenging enough. So, he started to wonder how board games might evolve. Could they have a storyline? Could decisions made in one session carry over into another? He adapted a classic board game called Risk and created a new version called Risk Legacy. Unlike previous board games, decisions made during gameplay had a permanent impact. Players might have to rip up cards, deface the board, or open packets containing new rules. The games play out over the course of a fixed number of sessions and long-held grudges become woven into the fabric of the game.
Legacy board games were never expected to go mainstream. But most players, like Russell Chapman, loved the concept. They see it as one of the biggest advances in game design for several years."

Once upon a time, there was an octopus named Inky who lived in New Zealand. One night, Inky escaped from his tank and went to the ocean. It was a story that was shared online. The story is fun because it is about animals being like humans. Octopuses are very smart creatures. They can open jars, recognize faces, and use coconut shells as armor. They can also play with other animals.
But some people don't think that animals are smart. They think that animals are not like humans. This is called anthropodenial. Dr. Frans de Waal is a scientist who studies animals. He says that anthropodenial is not true. Animals have many of the same skills as humans. They can think about the past and the future, demonstrate empathy, and be self-aware.
There are a lot of things that humans and animals can do. We can both learn from each other. We can learn to appreciate the beauty of animals. We can also learn to protect animals."

Once upon a time, there was a technology called robotics that is very powerful. Robots have been used in factories and cars for a long time. Now, experts say that robots will be used in many more places. Many people think that robots will take over their jobs, but that is not true. Robots can do some things that humans can do, but they cannot do everything. They need humans to teach them how to do things.
There are also new types of robots that are being developed. These robots are called consumer robots. They are designed to live in people's homes and interact with people in many ways. They can do things like cook, clean, and entertain.
The development of robotics is a big change, but it also presents a lot of opportunities. Companies that are able to take advantage of this shift can grow and become very successful. However, there are also challenges that need to be addressed, such as the need for new regulatory frameworks to ensure our safety and privacy.
In order to prepare for the robotic workforce of tomorrow, we need to invest in education and training programs. We also need to develop new technologies that will help people to learn and adapt to the changing job market."

The mountaineer George Mallory said that he wanted to climb Mount Everest because there was a desire to understand why people would participate in such a dangerous activity. Climbing can give people a feeling of freedom, but it can also be very confining. There is an apparent paradox in many forms of climbing. However, climbing can also help cultivate important virtues such as courage, humility and respect for the environment.
When asked why people climb, US rock climber Joe Fitschen argues that it is because climbing is in our genes. Climbing can also help develop important traits and virtues that allow one to flourish and live well in our non-climbing world."

My Granddad had a garden that was a very special place. It was on the bank of a river and it was very peaceful. You could hear the sound of the water and the birds that sang in the trees. I imagined that all gardens were like this. They were a place of escape, peace and solitude.
My Dad was a quiet and withdrawn person. He didn’t have a lot of ambition. He worked as a plumber. He wasn’t passionate about it, but he did his job well. One day, he announced that there was a vacancy for an apprentice gardener in the Parks Department. He thought I might be interested. I was excited about the opportunity to learn about gardening.

When John Maloof bought a box of old photo negatives at an estate auction, he found out that he was going to discover the mystery of Vivian Maier. Maloof was looking for images to use in a book about the history of the Portage Park neighbourhood in Chicago. Instead, he found 30,000 images by Maier, a street photographer with a keen eye for capturing compelling images. Since then, Maloof has collected an archive of Maier’s life and work. In his attic studio, there are her cameras, film, prints, and negatives. Maloof knows that he has a lot of work to do, but he is excited about the possibility of sharing Maier’s story.
Maier was born in 1926 and spent much of her childhood in France. She returned to New York in 1951 and came to Chicago in 1956 to work as a nanny. Maier was a private person who kept herself to herself and was a bit of a character. She always had a camera with her and dressed in oversized coats, broad-brimmed hats and stout shoes.
Maier’s work is the purest form of art. None of it was done for any commercial reason. Her images lean toward women, children, the old, the poor, and the abstract. Maloof is inspired by Maier’s work and has started taking his own pictures."

When a novel is described as ambitious, it usually means that it is not successful. But not so with Eleanor Catton’s book, The Luminaries. She is a young writer who has written a successful book. She was interviewed in the UK at a time when the book was very popular. She told me a story about once being stopped at passport control and asked to prove she was a writer. She pressed her novel up against the glass and the official asked, ‘Well, what’s it about?’ It was a difficult question for an author. The Luminaries is set in New Zealand in the 1860s. There is a series of crimes and a council of 12 men has been convened to solve them. The plot is very complex. Catton said she set out to write a murder mystery, but found the past offered more opportunities for complications and misunderstandings for her characters to deal with.

The silence at Centre Court is very quiet. You can bounce the ball and hit it on the grass. The grass is soft and the stadium is old. The players wear white and the crowds are respectful. The silence is good for your game. It helps you to focus on the match and not on other things. When a point is done, there is a lot of noise. People cheer and clap. You hear them, but it feels like they are far away. You are so focused that you have no sense of the people watching you. You are playing in the 2008 Wimbledon final.

There has been a lot of talk about sleep lately. When I wrote a book about people who suffer from sleeplessness, I felt like I was warning people about the dangers of not getting enough sleep. Sleep is very important for our mental, physical, and social well-being. It seems that people who have the hardest time sleeping are the ones who most appreciate how important sleep is.
When you wake up early, you are cutting off the last hour or two of sleep. This sleep is mainly REM or 'Rapid Eye Movement', the most dream-rich stage of sleep. Our most vivid, memorable and emotionally powerful dreams occur mainly in the stage of REM just before we wake up in the morning.
Dreams are important. They help us find new patterns and create combinations that break through our usual habits of thinking. They also help us to think creatively and flexibly. We need to dream in order to function fully in our complex world."

It was many years ago that Susie Ray left London for a small town in south-west England. When you walk into her studio, you see a lot of empty frames and photographs of her daughters. Susie is a copyist artist who can reproduce the richness of an early-20th-century impressionist masterpiece as easily as the brilliance of a 16th-century Caravaggio portrait.
The problem is that Susie is very busy. She has painted the works of numerous great artists, including Renoir, Monet and Van Gogh. Her reproductions are so faithful that art experts mistake them for the originals.
Susie has always been open about what she does. When she reproduces an old masterpiece, she will make it look as authentic as possible. However, she will put her own signature on the back of the canvas.
When younger painters approach Susie for advice, she stresses the importance of learning to draw and to represent things accurately. She also emphasises how much she’s studied to be able to do what she does."

Jordan Romero is 13 years old and wants to climb Mount Everest. If he succeeds, he could become one of the most famous teenagers in the world. Young people are spending more time on computers and games consoles, so Jordan hopes to inspire kids to climb their own mountains. He wants to encourage kids to venture outdoors. His team includes his father, Paul, and mother, Karen. They call themselves 'Team Romero.' If Jordan can climb Everest and Vinson Massif in Antarctica, he will become the youngest person to have climbed the Seven Summits. Few people achieve this under the age of thirty. Jordan has already climbed five of them and might actually do it before his teenage years are over.
There are some people who think that taking a young climber up the world’s highest mountain is a bad idea. They say that a young climber might not be emotionally strong enough or have enough experience. But Jordan’s parents believe that their own experience as climbers will help them. They also think that watching Jordan develop gives them confidence.
Jordan is motivated by his goal. He says, 'I just focus on achieving my goal.' If Jordan wants to inspire others, he has to play the media game. This means blogging, sitting for photo shoots and giving interviews. He has to offer something spectacular. Like climbing Everest."

When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, it's probably not classical music they're listening to. Most people can name a few pop groups, but not many know who Brahms was. I started doing a music degree, but the people on my course know no more about classical music than anyone else my age. If you don’t know who wrote the music, you are unlikely to own any recordings of their work. Classical music is not very popular among teenagers. There are a few reasons why this is the case. First, the pace and rhythm of classical music are not very appealing to us. Second, classical music is not very easy to listen to. Third, the subject matter of classical music is not very interesting to us. Finally, the way we listen to music has changed. Nowadays, you can find any music you want at the click of a mouse. So, if you're a teenager and you don't like classical music, don't worry, you're not alone."

Bonnie Wyndham got out of her mom's car and looked at Almonside School. It was a funny school with lots of buildings and trees. There was a riding centre where the horses were kept. Bonnie liked horses and she treated them with respect. She rode a horse named Maverick and had a lot of fun.
The riding centre was a nice old building with a large structure for indoor riding. There was a lot of equipment for riding horses. Bonnie put a saddle on Maverick's back and rode him around the paddock. She felt like a queen and she laughed delightedly."

I met Cody Simpson before. He is a 15-year-old Australian singer. He has already released a lot of successful songs.
Cody started singing when he was young. He was also a swimmer. He had to choose between swimming and singing. He decided to sing.
Cody is successful. He is playing in front of a lot of people. He is also helping his family.
Success comes from a willingness to say 'yes' to your big break, even when it's a little scary to do so."

I woke up and looked at the river. The ice was shining in the sunlight. I put on my wetsuit and went kayaking. I saw a boy on the river. He was trying to balance on an ice shelf. I was worried about him. I went to the kitchen and got a banana. My mom smiled at me. She said, ""Have a good session, Rex. I admire your determination to keep it up, even on these cold days!"" I smiled back at her. I ate my banana and went downstairs. I went outside and hurried towards the boathouse."

Mum caught Jess by the arm and said, ""Come with me."" She took Jess to the study and there was a painting on the table. It was one of Grandpa's paintings, but it was different from his other paintings. It was not finished and it was strange. There was a river in the painting. It was not a real river, it was a fantasy river. The picture was strange and beautiful. There were no animals or people in the painting. It felt right that way. There seemed no place for living things in this remote vision. Yet, Jess was captivated. She thought of the coming of autumn after a long, rich summer. Mum spoke again. ""It's got a name."" There was something in her voice that made Jess think of her Grandpa. He never gave his pictures names. He just painted them and left others to make sense of them. Mum turned the picture over and pointed to the words Grandpa had scrawled there. Jess read them aloud. ""River Boy."" The words seemed to carry a strange resonance. They were important to Jess, but she didn't know why."

When I woke up this morning, I didn't mean to damage my bedroom carpet. It was not an accident, but it could have been. If I had tripped over the edge of the bed, the blade of Dad's Stanley knife might have gone into the carpet and carved a big hole. I was trying to find a way of fitting my corner cabinet into a corner. Gran had given me the cabinet when she moved out of her house into a flat. It's really cute and I keep my collection of shells and fossils there.
My bedroom is small and shaped like a wedge of cheese. It has two corners. My bed is in one corner and my wardrobe is in the other. I'd tried fitting Gran’s cabinet into the angle between the roof and the floor, but it was just the tiniest little bit too tall. If I could only slice a couple of centimetres off the bottom of it... That was when it came to me. If I couldn’t slice anything off Gran’s cabinet, how about cutting a hole in the carpet? It just seemed like the obvious solution."

The novel 'The Borrowers' is about a family of tiny people who live hidden in the walls and floors of a house. They borrow things from the normal-sized people in order to survive. When I was asked to direct a TV adaptation of the novel, I knew it was going to be hard to live up to people’s expectations. The author had told me she wanted the series to be from the Borrowers' perspective, not a human one, which made filming much more complex.
The most crucial thing was getting the scale right. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans, so I had to be 10 times further away from the Borrowers than on a normal shoot. When filming the human surroundings the Borrowers found themselves in, the crew had to crawl along the ground and film from no higher than 15 centimetres.
One big challenge was finding a way to get the shadows right. We developed a unique technique for this. The costumes were also a big challenge. They were made out of heavy canvas material so that they stuck out in the way that dolls’ clothes do. Unfortunately, the weather was really hot during filming. It was a challenge to get the action right. We filmed the actors in front of a blue screen on an otherwise empty set."

My mom pulled up at the corner of my new school, Palm Grove High School. She looked around nervously, but there were no journalists there. I was excited to see how long it would take before the craziness began. It always does. The fake smiles, the wannabe friends, the people who want free tickets to one of my dad’s concerts. I told her, “Everything’s going to be fine.” She kissed her fingertip and touched my cheek right before I got out of the car. Then she was off, leaving me alone with this whole new school and situation.
I walked into the school’s main office and asked for my schedule. The secretary was not very friendly. She made a face and leaned her ear closer to me. I gave her my name and she typed it on the keyboard. She seemed confused. I guess she didn’t know me. I asked for my grade and she said, “Eleventh.” I got my schedule and it was cool. English Literature, first period. I was late, though. English is in Room 214, second floor. I studied the map the night before, as I didn’t want to look like a complete buffoon searching for my classes. When I got to the door, I heard the teacher already taking roll. I slipped in undetected and slid into the last desk in the second row. The girl next to me smiled. She was friendly. I smiled back at her.
The teacher introduced herself as Ms. Smigla. She talked a lot and eventually handed us our course outlines. After we reviewed them and she told us all about books we’re required to read this year, she actually gave us time to socialize. All teachers should realize the importance of this. I made a new friend, her name is Becca. We talked for a while and she seemed to like me. I guess she was impressed by my cool shoes."

In the United States, teenagers have a lot of responsibilities and challenges. They have homework, tests, and extra-curricular activities, as well as jobs and chores at home. They also have to deal with social life and the pressure of being teenagers.
There are some negative stereotypes about teenagers, such as being lazy, disrespectful, and rebellious. However, these stereotypes are not always true. Many teenagers are hard-working, responsible, and caring individuals.
One of the biggest challenges that teenagers face is sleep deprivation. Many teenagers start their days early and end them late, which leaves them with very little time for sleep. This can lead to problems in school and other areas of life.
Despite the challenges that teenagers face, they are still able to accomplish great things. Many teenagers are involved in volunteer work and other activities that make their communities better. They are also taking the world by storm, one generation at a time."

The teenagers of the Earth to Sky Calculus Club live in Bishop, a mountain town in the US. They have launched over fifty balloons to the edge of space. It's a long-running science project that is part astronomy experiment and part backcountry adventure.
One weekend, I joined the club to release a high-altitude balloon. We secured a soft insulated lunch box to the bottom of the balloon. Inside was a camera, an instrument to measure altitude, and a thermometer. Two GPS trackers were mounted on the outside of the lunch box to help us find it later.
Finally, it was time for lift-off. The balloon began its ascent and we watched it go up into the sky. There was quiet and a sense of collective wonder. Then the balloon disappeared into the night.
After the launch, most of the students went home, but a few stayed to watch the shooting stars. We lay on blankets on the mountainside and gazed at the sky. A meteor shot across the middle of the sky. The balloon expanded and popped in a dramatic explosion. The parachute helped the equipment inside the lunch box land safely back on Earth.
It took us 11 hours to find the lunch box. It was in a canyon, high on a flat rock, in the middle of a cascading waterfall. We were disappointed that the camera hadn't recorded any shooting stars, but we also had a lot of fun arguing over the effects of atmospheric waves."

Chloe Morgan loves science, especially Palaeontology. She started to be interested in Palaeontology when she was fifteen. It happened by chance. Her younger brother was going through the dinosaur phase, and she helped him with a science project. She also read an article about recent discoveries in the field. It was very interesting. She knew that she wanted to commit herself to Palaeontology.
Chloe's job is very varied. She spends lots of time digging up dinosaur bones, but also has to put in long hours in laboratories, analysing fossils, and writing for scientific publications. She also likes to reach out to young people and talk to them about science.
Walking with Dinosaurs was a great opportunity for Chloe to influence the way dinosaurs are portrayed on screen. She was there to offer advice if required. She had a fairly easy time of it because there was very little that she needed to comment on.
Why does Chloe feel dinosaurs continue to fascinate us? She suspects that they speak to the innate explorer in all of us. Our imaginations are drawn to the unfamiliar and the prospect of discovery. And at a time when our world seems to be shrinking, prehistoric creatures remind us that there is still more out there to be discovered."

When you travel by car with your family, even when you're young, you know that you're not 'there yet.' It's not 'there' anymore once you get there. So if you really think there's a chance that you're 'there' yet, you should be asking 'Are we there yet? '
There are a lot of things to do on long car trips. You can watch DVDs, listen to music, or play puzzles. You can also act as co-pilot and help your parents.
But sometimes things go wrong. Your brother or sister might put their foot on your side of the seat or act aggressively. If this happens, you might get angry and fight. The driver and co-pilot will try to help you calm down.
Over the years, your dad has developed some strategies for dealing with kids on the back seat. One strategy is to say, ""Yup. We're here. Get out of the car."" This usually keeps everyone quiet for a while.
So once and for all, please note: if mum and dad are still near enough to answer your question, then the answer is: no. You're not there yet."

John and Zuzi Morgan have a café in Oxford, UK, where people can enjoy coffee, cake, and play board games. They decided to turn their love of tabletop games into a full-time business because there is so much technology and people are busy on their mobile phones and gadgets.
The games that are played in John and Zuzi's café are called Eurogames. They are easy to learn and have simple rules. The first game of this type was The Settlers of Catan. Players build settlements on an island and trade resources with the other players.
Pandemic is another Eurogame that is popular. It is a cooperative game where players must work together to solve global problems. Pandemic was a runaway success and the follow-up version represented another leap forward in game design.
The growth of the video games industry has also helped to the success of Eurogames. Video games and board games have learned a lot from each other. Now there are more people who are open to the idea of playing games than ever before."

Television presenter Helen Skelton has completed many challenges for charity. She has run a marathon in the desert and travelled down the Amazon river in a small boat. For her latest challenge, Helen walked on a high wire. It was a long, thin piece of metal that was 66 meters above the ground. There was no safety net, only a belt around her waist. To help her keep her balance and not to fall, she carried a long stick. Helen took lessons from an expert high-wire walker. She learned how to fall onto the wire so that if she slipped, she could carry on. The day of the actual challenge was windy. Helen controlled herself by taking deep breaths as she moved step by step along the wire. The walk took 15 minutes. 'That was the scariest thing I’ve done,' she admitted afterwards. 'I’m glad it’s over!'"

I work at a university in the US. My team and I are learning more about water birds, especially one called the American black duck. We have a new piece of equipment called a night-vision scope that allows us to see the ducks in the dark. We are worried about black ducks because their numbers have fallen. We don’t know if there is enough food on the east coast for these animals. We have lots of information about their daytime activities, but nothing about what they do at night. We need to find out more and make better decisions about looking after the area where they live. It is hard work. There are four of us, each working six hours daily. We have studied ducks in different locations. I have had to take a boat to some sites and make notes on every duck I see. The weather hasn’t been very helpful. It is sometimes wet and cold. Oh, and it is so quiet I need lots of coffee to stop me falling asleep. We haven’t missed any working days so far. I like the challenge of it. It is hard, but it is also essential to do this.

It’s wonderful to have a private space I can go off to during the day. Sometimes I am at the food lab and others I’m out of the country buying raw materials. But that kind of variety, and lack of routine, is something I love about the job. I often go home and eat some more chocolate in the evening."

Have you ever wondered what it’s like to perform in a circus? Sophia Grayson is from Circus Experience, a centre that teaches young people circus skills. She says her course is popular because it includes many skills, like juggling, throwing and catching things, and trapeze, which involves flying through the air. On the year-long course, students learn new skills and parents come along to certain classes to watch progress. Sophia explains that to be successful in the circus, you must keep practising and be fit. You also need to have imagination and never stop improving your skills. Being fit is really important for circus artists, like athletes, who train daily to keep strong. Training is very important, but the best performers are those who want success and have imagination. People often think that circus performers suffer injuries or only work for a short time each year. But, actually, the real issue is looking ahead because you can only be on the road while you’re young and then you really need to consider other options."

She was a good swimmer and the coach at the swimming club thought she might be good enough to become a champion. But the club was far away from her home so it was difficult for her to fit in the training around her schoolwork. When they were teenagers, Jamie, who loved cycling, bought himself a special track racing bike and started taking part in competitions. Vicky thought it looked very exciting and decided to try it for herself. She says that was the best decision she ever made. Soon she was cycling every day and doing really well. The track was near her school, which meant it was no problem for her to attend training sessions after school every day. Vicky went on to have a successful career in track cycling and won several competitions. Then, when she was 28, she retired from competitive cycling. Vicky told me: ‘For years I’d loved winning competitions but I began to get a bit tired of the whole thing – and when the excitement stops, there’s no point. Luckily, I went on to have a new career.’ Vicky got a job with a charity called CycleZone. ‘We work with young people who have never enjoyed sport,’ she says. ‘The first thing we do is teach them to ride a bike. We want them to learn to believe in themselves and their own abilities. CycleZone does a great job, and it gets young people together so they’re part of a wider group.’"

Seven years ago, I was studying tourism in college. I needed to find a part-time job because my course was expensive. I decided to become a weekend tour guide in my city, Chicago. I took visitors around the city and I enjoyed giving those tours. I learned a lot about Chicago and it felt like a new experience every time. After finishing my studies, I decided to go into tour guiding full-time. To become a full-time tour guide, I had to learn a lot of things. I had to know a lot about Chicago, including its history and architecture. I also had to be able to answer hundreds of questions about the city. After completing my training, I became a licensed tour guide. Tour guiding is a lot of fun. You need to be able to be entertaining and tell interesting stories. You also need to be able to react to changing situations. If a place is closed or the route changes, you need to be able to adjust and make sure your visitors are still happy. I need to make sure that my visitors are happy with my tours. If they are not, they could post a negative review online. That's why making tours fun and stress-free is essential."

My name is Gina D’Costa and I own a flower shop in the UK. We sell flowers to people who buy them for friends, their homes, or other reasons. Sometimes we also provide flowers for hotels, offices, and photoshoots. Once I even decorated a castle with flowers for a wedding. It was a lot of work, but I was proud of the job we did.
My day starts early, at 4 a.m., when I go to the market to buy fresh flowers. It’s cold and dark, but I don’t mind. The market is full of beautiful flowers. I choose the flowers that people want and put them in vases. Then I make bunches of flowers and calculate the cost of the order.
Customers are often surprised by how expensive flowers are. Sometimes I have to ask them to think again about what they want. But I like thinking about how I can put together the nicest possible flowers for the amount of money someone wants to spend. That’s what you have to do when you’re selling things. I wouldn’t want any other job."

My city has a modern cinema that shows all the latest films I want to see, and lots of films for kids at the weekends. It’s close to where I live, but a year ago, I realized something was missing – the experience of discussing a film in detail with a group of people after watching it with them. So, together with two friends, I started a film club. We decided to have our own place to show the films, instead of hiring a cinema. We choose a different location in the city each month. Sometimes, the place is free, and sometimes we have to pay a small fee. We’re happy to make enough to cover our costs – we’re not trying to make a profit. Each time we show a film, everything is a bit easier for us. We also know how many tickets we’ve sold because everything’s online. There’s still always plenty to do, but when people of all ages come up to say what a great experience they’ve had, it’s wonderful. We’ve started a blog, too, because we know that most people now go online for information about films, rather than read reviews in local papers."

There are different levels, from beginner to advanced, run by adult volunteers called ‘leaders’. When you complete each level, you get a certificate.
When I first joined, my leader suggested that my first challenge should be helping to organise activities at a local children’s club for two hours a week. I was a bit shy at first, but I decided to take up the challenge. Soon, I was spending all my free time at the children’s club. I also made new friends and learned new skills.

I was born in Denver, USA. I started snowboarding when I was eight years old. My dad took me to a resort in the mountains. The hill was very steep, so my dad had to do a lot of persuading to get me on a board. I was young, so I hadn’t even thought of asking my dad if I could start snowboarding, but he was already into it and wanted me to love it too. I managed just fine. After this experience, I started competing aged ten. I enjoy snowboarding and I also like to compete. I have a lot of friends and I like to spend time with them. It’s the best way of dealing with not being able to do what I love so much. I have to think carefully about my future.

When I was fifteen, I wanted everything my friends had. I didn't plan ahead. One day, my best friend got a new phone and I thought I should have one too. My parents said I could only have it if I paid for it myself. So I worked part-time and saved as much as I could. I owe my parents a lot for making me do that. It taught me a really valuable lesson. I worked every Saturday in a café, but I didn’t really enjoy it. My parents suggested starting my own little business instead. I asked my mum if I could have a go at making necklaces. I’d never imagined I’d find it so easy. I sold my first items of jewellery to my friends and family. They told me they were delighted with them, but I just thought they were saying that to please me. So I still needed convincing that they looked good enough to be popular with the public. There was only one way to find out, so I rented a market stall with my mum. There are always lots of tourists where I live, and they bought lots of my things to give to family and friends when they got back home. Soon we were receiving calls from all over the country from people looking to buy more. They thought we were a big company, employing loads of people to produce my designs, when in fact we were just two people on a market stall. That was when I knew it could work, and it was time to take the next step – creating a website. Since then, I’ve made thousands of pounds through my business, mostly online."

When Janine Stuart was young, she wrote a book called Being Amelia which became popular. The book is based on Janine’s life. In one interview, Janine said, ‘Because of my family’s moving around a lot, I’ve become good at making new friends. I understand what it’s like to be the only new student in a class, and that helped me to write about how the main character, Amelia, gets on in a new school.
Janine started her novel one summer, when she was feeling bored at home. Her mom had always dreamed of becoming a published author herself, and her teachers had always encouraged her to write, so it seemed like a natural way for Janine to pass the time. The book was popular and people loved it.
One reviewer said that although Janine is still very young, and Being Amelia isn’t a particularly long novel, she’s clearly shown that she’s a better writer than several other best-selling authors. Janine is still getting used to being a famous writer."

My name is Tom. I am fifteen years old. Three years ago, my family and I moved to a castle on a small island. It was a big change, but we quickly got used to island life.
The castle is not very beautiful, but our apartment is comfortable. The island is very sociable in the summer, but there are not many teenagers among the other families. The adults all support each other and help with repairs on the island.
The biggest change for me was travelling by boat every day. I have to catch the bus to the harbour after school to get the ferry. Sometimes, the ferry doesn’t run because of the weather. And if I miss the bus, I also miss the last ferry. So I always tell my schoolmates to hurry up when they come home to stay with me.
But we also get the most fantastic views, for example when the sun goes down over the sea. Some days, though, it’s so foggy that you can’t see a thing, then within hours it’s brilliant sunshine again. It still seems amazing when that happens, even after living here all this time."

My goal is to see 200 different bird species. I’ve almost achieved that. I’ve been to many places to see birds. I also like to post videos about my hobby online. I’ve been to Egypt and South America. I’m lucky to live in the countryside. I understand why many teenagers in cities might not think of becoming birdwatchers, but there are actually plenty of birds to see."

I started playing football when I was 7. I liked to play with other boys and girls after school. I was good at it, but my family thought I would drop out like I had with other hobbies. But I didn’t. I dreamed of playing football professionally when I was older. One day, I was playing in a tournament and a referee saw me. He asked the manager of a professional women’s club to watch me play. She asked me to join her club. I started training with a big club as a young 13-year-old. I improved a lot. But people still didn’t believe I would be a star player. I felt a bit upset. But my coach encouraged me to just be myself and believe in myself. He let me play in one of the club’s championship matches. I scored the winning goal. I was very happy. Since then, I’ve scored lots more winning goals. Next month, my coach and I are running a football tournament. The aim is to get teenagers interested in football and to have a chance to chat to other players in my club. It’ll let them see the professional environment and encourage them to feel they could play for a top team, if they’re prepared to put in the work."

One of the most interesting things about studying in the UK is that students can get involved in research early on. Research is not just for famous scholars or scientists. It can also be done by everyone. You can use research skills in your studies and in your job.
When you do research, you are making knowledge. You don't just copy what you read or hear. You make your own knowledge. To make knowledge, you need to ask questions. Why? How? When? What does this mean? How might that be done? What if this were different? These are all common questions that researchers ask.
Research can be hard, but it is also important. It helps you to learn new things and to think critically about the world. It also helps you to develop your own skills and knowledge."

Cities are places where people gather to discuss ideas and share their creativity. But city life can also be challenging. It can be exhausting and overwhelming. Scientists have found that cities actually dull our thinking, sometimes dramatically so. One of the main reasons is the lack of nature. Studies have shown that people who can see trees from their windows recover more quickly from illness. Natural settings also help us to focus better and concentrate.
In recent years, it has become clear that living in cities has a lot of negative effects on our mental and physical health. But there is also a positive side to city life. Cities are centers of creativity and innovation. They have a lot of museums, art galleries, and parks. They also have a lot of opportunities for people to learn new things and meet new people.
The key to finding a balance between the benefits and drawbacks of city life is to find ways to mitigate the psychological damage of the metropolis while maintaining its unique benefits."

The mind is a complex thing. It is like a stick that is used by a blind person. The stick is a part of the blind person's body. It helps the blind person to see. The mind is also a part of the human body. It helps us to think and learn.
There are many things that can be used to help us think. These things are called tools. Tools can be made from stone, metal, or wood. They can be used to help us to cut, chop, or drill. They can also be used to help us to build things.
The mind is not just the brain. It is also the things that we use to think. When we use tools to think, we are using our minds. We can use tools to think about the past, the future, or the present. We can also use tools to think about ourselves and others.
The mind is a powerful force. It is a force that can be used to learn, create, and solve problems. It is a force that can be used to make the world a better place."

Photography has changed the world in many ways. It has been especially true in the United States, where photography became part of the culture at every level. Photography has been a big part of US history. It has moved to the centre of US intellectual and aesthetic discourse.
There are a few reasons why photography was so appealing. First, it was a mechanical process that matched the growing enthusiasm for technology. Second, the camera was the best tool to represent the self. Third, the camera was a way to create and sustain an impression of self and family. Finally, the photograph’s inherent realism was in harmony aesthetically with the tendency towards realism.
Photography has also been used in art. Artists have been incorporating photographs into their work in a variety of ways. For the last several decades, beginning with the U.S. artist Andy Warhol’s exploitation of the photograph in individual paintings, silk screens, and multiples, artists have been incorporating photographs into their work."

In 1890, William James, an American philosopher and physician, defined psychology as the 'science of mental life'. We all have a mental life and therefore have some idea about what this means. But even though the concept can be studied in rats and monkeys as well as humans, it remains a somewhat elusive one.
Psychology is about the mind or brain, but although psychologists do study the brain, they do not understand nearly enough about its workings to be able to comprehend the part that it plays in the experience and expression of our hopes, fears, and wishes, or in our behaviour during experiences as varied as giving birth or watching a football match.
The endeavour of psychology is much like that involved in solving a crossword puzzle. It involves evaluating and interpreting available clues. Complex interactions are the norm rather than the exception in psychology, and understanding them depends on the development of sophisticated techniques and theories.
Psychology has the same goals as any other science: to describe, understand, predict, and learn how to control or modify the process that it studies. Once these goals have been achieved, it can help us to understand the nature of our experience and come to conclusions that can be applied directly to people’s lives."

In a storehouse in a business park in Michigan, USA, there is a museum of failed products. The museum has a collection of products that were not successful. The proprietor of the museum, Carol Sherry, sees each product as embodying its own sad story. The museum is a viable, profit-making business. It is a testament to the fact that most products fail.
The museum was started by a man named Robert McMath. McMath intended to accumulate a reference library of consumer products. He started collecting samples of new products in the 1960s. Over time, McMath's collection grew to consist overwhelmingly of unsuccessful products.
The museum is a reminder that we should not be afraid to fail. It is important to learn from our mistakes and move on."

Everyone knows that sports teams have an advantage when they play at home. But does anyone know why? Most of us probably think we do; after all, it seems obvious. But professional sport is changing faster than at any time in its history and much of what we used to take for granted is now open to question.
There are two main reasons why home advantage exists. First, the home team has the advantage of playing in front of their own crowd. This can give them a boost of energy and confidence. Second, the home team has the advantage of being familiar with their own stadium. This can help them to play more effectively.
However, there are some changes that have recently happened that have made home advantage less effective. For example, travel has become much easier and the top grounds increasingly resemble one another. As a result, home advantage has declined in all major sports, but not by as much as one might expect.
There is one possible explanation for why home advantage should vary depending on the sport. It is because home advantage is primarily a team phenomenon and in some sports, such as basketball and football, there is a greater need for team cohesion and confidence."

The more I practice, the luckier I get, said Gary Player some time ago. This quote is famous and is used by many athletes and their coaches. It is easy to see why this quote is popular. There are two main reasons why. First, the quote is not clear. It is not easy to understand what Player really meant. Second, the quote is not fair. It does not take into account the fact that some people are born with natural talent.
However, the quote does have some truth to it. If you practice a lot, you will get better at it. But it is not always true that the more you practice, the better you will become. There are other factors that can affect your success, such as your natural talent, your environment, and your opportunity."

A recent report found that many children living in wealthy countries feel unhappy and lonely. They have been spending too much time indoors and not enough time outside. This is the main cause of their unhappiness.
A follow-up study found that most of the children would be happier if they could go outside more. Many adults talk nostalgically about the freedom of their own youth. They spent long summer days playing outside and making dens in sheds.
However, there are some risks associated with going outside. For example, children can get injured or get lost. Parents need to be aware of these risks and take steps to protect their children.
The book also discusses the importance of allowing children to have their own autonomy and to take risks. Children need to be able to learn from their mistakes and to develop their own skills."

I am a researcher who has a lot of school. I am good at solving problems. But that has little to do with the schooling I’ve had. Most problems in life cannot be solved with a formula or memorized answers. They require the judgement, wisdom and creative ability that come from life experiences.
Play is the natural means by which adults and mammals have always educated themselves. It is also important for children’s development. All mammals, including humans, play when they are young. Children who have the most to learn play the most.
Play is voluntary, which means that players are always free to quit. If you can’t quit, it’s not play. School has become more onerous and adults have replaced play with adult-directed sports and ‘play dates’.
If we care about our children and future generations, we must reverse the horrid trend that has been occurring over the past half century. We must give childhood back to children."

Newspapers are not very popular these days. Many people get their news from the internet instead. But newspapers have been around for a long time. They were once the main source of news for most people. But now, the internet is the main source of news. It is much easier to get news online. You can read news stories on your phone, computer, or tablet. You can also get news updates on your phone. This is all very different from the old days when people had to wait for the newspaper to be delivered to their house. Now, you can get news as soon as it happens. This is a good thing, but it also means that there is a lot of misinformation and error. It is important to be careful when reading news stories. You should always check your sources and make sure that the information is accurate."

If humans were truly at home under the light of the moon and stars, we would go in darkness happily. Instead, we are creatures who are adapted to living in the sun’s light. We have engineered the night to receive us by filling it with light. This kind of control is no different from the feat of damming a river. Light pollution is the result of bad lighting design. It washes out the darkness of night, altering light levels and light rhythms to which many forms of life, including ourselves, have adapted. Wherever man-made light spills into the natural world, some aspects of life are affected. Light is a powerful biological force, and on many species it acts as a magnet attracting them to it. Denying darkness is futile. It is as essential to maintaining our biological welfare as light itself. So fundamental are these rhythms to our being that messing with them is akin to altering our center of gravity."

The founder of a big company recently announced that his company will not track employees’ paid holiday time. The company is big with many employees and different services. The founder said that his employees can take as much leave as they want, as long as they feel comfortable that their work can be finished on time. However, there are some problems with this policy. First, it is difficult to be sure if your work can be finished on time. Second, there is pressure from colleagues and office gossip about who is off when and for how long. Third, if you do not take your leave, you may feel guilty and this can lead to decreased productivity. Fourth, if you feel unable to take your leave, you may feel unable to do your job properly. Overall, I am not sure if this policy will be a good one."

Journal-based peer review is a process that checks scientific research papers. It is used to make sure that the papers are accurate and well-written. Reviewing a paper can delay its publication by up to a year. But it is important to have peer review because it helps to ensure the quality of the published literature. Preprints are drafts of papers that are posted online before they have been peer-reviewed. They are a good way to share new results and get feedback from other scientists. Preprints can also be used to discuss negative results. They can also increase the number of times papers are read and cited."

I bought a metal detector soon after I was married. It cost a lot of money then, but it was worth it. I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first outing. I've also found other things that have given me pleasure, like brooches and coins. But the most important thing I found was a torc. It's a beautiful necklace of gold and silver. It's very old and rare. I hid it in my wardrobe. I was anxious, but I knew I had to do something. I unscrewed a floorboard and hid the torc underneath. The law says I have to report the find to the authorities. I also took the torc to the hospital to show a friend. Finally, I carried the torc into the council office. It was authenticated and sold to my local council. The money was split between me and the owner of the field. The torc is currently in the British Museum in London."

Sleeping is one of my favorite things to do when I travel. I don't talk about it very much because I feel a little guilty. When friends share details of their trips, I smile and don't say much. What would they think if they knew that my travel itineraries include naps and lazy mornings? Better sleep is one of travel's happy side effects. When I visited Mexico's Yucatán coast, I was surprised by how much I slept. There were lots of noisy birds, but it didn't matter. I could plunge into a sleep that was more profound, dream-filled, and enjoyable than I imagined possible. Sleep is something else too: it's an experience that changes rhythm, sometimes dramatically, from place to place. People obsess about jet lag, but I suspect that the difficulties I experience recovering from long journeys have more to do with local and cultural adjustment than time zones. When I finally fall into the local sleep pattern, I feel I have truly arrived."

I had a break from my training. I was going to do something else. Being a successful athlete is a special thing. I had the chance to do more writing and TV work, and to speak to businesses and schools. But there wasn’t anything on the horizon to get my competitive teeth into. I knew that I wanted to stay in shape, so that I would be in a position to fight for an Olympic place if that dream reignited within me. So I entered marathons and triathlons. That should have been enough, but there was still the TV presenter Ben Fogle’s nagging invitation at the back of my mind. I was beginning to miss that feeling, but I still wasn’t ready to commit to the regime of training seven days a week. I spoke to some of my rowing colleagues about whether they fancied the race; I didn’t receive any enthusiastic responses. I knew that if I entered the race, even though it is billed primarily as an adventure, I would want to win. I got in contact with Ben. We spoke about the remaining costs of the race. There was also the loss of earnings that would result from being away from home. I had to take all of that into account. Participating in the race would mean I wouldn’t just be talking about past achievements. I’d actually be doing something again which I could bring in: rowing across the Atlantic."

I arrived at the farm after dark and was handed a pair of boots and turned out into the cold. I followed the sound of barking and joined the team of husky guides. It was very cold and the dogs were very excited. I was able to learn how to drive a snowmobile and how to feed and water the dogs. But everything else seemed to be very difficult. Simple tasks such as feeding and watering the dogs became very difficult in sub-zero conditions.
But I was triumphant. I emailed my friends and told them I could chop with an axe, hammer a nail, and use a circular saw in the snow."

There had been a lot of talk about the food revolution in Britain, and I thought that we had made a good series of programmes that would make a difference. I watched the first programme and was happy that it was successful. The show was popular and it led to other interesting projects, including a book based on my experiences at the restaurant I own. In each project, there is a sense of adventure. I wrote several books in a series called 'Perfection', and in these books, the journey was often physical.

You will meet extraordinary artisans, such as a man who finds his true purpose in creating a golden pasta that tastes better than any other. These people have spent years pursuing their own ideals of perfection. Perfection is subjective. Even the simple task of choosing which dishes to include in the series turned out to be a problem.

I fixed the sofa and connected it to some cables and seatbelts. I put my luggage on the seats and slept on the sofa each night. Several friends helped me on the trip. It was the longest distance I have ever walked and it was on main roads, which meant I could stop at a roadside café and relax on the sofa with a cappuccino. You can see the film on my website."

When I read about swimming trips in the sea around some small Greek islands, I was excited. I'd never tried group trips before. My brother was busy, so I decided to join a group holiday. The man at the port was curious when I asked for a single ticket. I explained that I wouldn't be alone; I'd be joining others to swim around the islands. We did a short swim and then it was time for our first proper swim. I was nervous because I'd never swum such a long distance before. Soon, the waves got bigger and I was at the back of the slow group. I watched faster swimmers moving ahead like dolphins. I wanted to complete this first distance, though, and I was delighted when I finally managed it on my own."

I like my job as a flight attendant. I have been to many places, like the US and Australia. I work with great people, and I have a lot of time off. Life is always exciting, which makes it a good job for young people.
When I was a child, I went to a boarding school away from my family. I always flew unaccompanied when term began and ended. I felt lonely, so I would ask the flight attendants to let me help give out meals to passengers.
I decided to become a flight attendant because I liked to travel and I was good at it. There was a lot of young people at the interview, and many were accepted. We all had different strengths and experiences. I practised what to say before the interview, and I got the job.
I would recommend this kind of work to anyone. There are so many things that make it worthwhile. The free flights are not the best part. Most airline staff are hard-working, and there’s a saying – ‘no-one’s finished till everyone’s finished.’ It’s like a big family. When I’m not working, I don’t have to take work home. And if I do get difficult passengers, which is rare, I know the flight will soon be over and I’ll probably never see them again."

At the summer camp, I like seeing the children succeed at things they never thought they could do. Most of the children know how to swim and play table-tennis, but rock climbing is new for them. Some children feel nervous, but after some encouragement, they try and they all get to the top. This makes them feel great. We also get children who miss home. It's the older children who feel like that the most. We don't let them use their mobile phones all the time. We tell them they can phone home after lunch and after dinner. Most children are fine in a couple of days. At the end of their week's stay, they all come up to us and thank us because they have had a great time."

Rock the Planet, a musical show, was opened in London last year. It was very popular. The actors in the show are also good musicians. They have to play many instruments. The show was voted 'Best Musical' four times in the USA. But doing the show with an all-British cast of actors was challenging. The UK puts more limits on how many performances young actors can do weekly. Because of this, twice as many actors were required here. Luckily, the director found plenty of talented UK-based actors. The show is on in London for another year. It is well worth seeing."
