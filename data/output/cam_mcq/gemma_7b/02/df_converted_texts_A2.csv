Some time ago, there was a website that talked about the dangers of public check-ins. It said that if you put your location online, people you don't know can find out. This made people think about the downsides of sharing information on the internet.

The internet has a lot of opportunities to share your life with the world. You can write a blog, post pictures, and talk to people from all over the world. But you should be careful about what you share online. If you put your personal information on the internet, people might be able to find it and use it against you.

There are some people who have learned from the mistakes of others. Heather Armstrong is one of them. She had a blog where she wrote about her life. One day, someone sent the address of her blog to her boss. As a result, she lost her job. But Armstrong didn't give up. She started a new blog and wrote about her family. Today, she is a successful blogger and her writing supports her family.<eos>"

A long time ago, some scientists started a campaign to warn people about a movie called What the Bleep Do We Know? It showed that there is a lot about the universe that we don't understand. Even though some scientists can be a bit arrogant, they don't claim to have all the answers. Some people felt that the movie was very dangerous and issued warnings about it. The movie talked about some new discoveries that showed that the universe is far stranger than anyone had expected. One of the discoveries was that water molecules can be affected by thoughts. This is a very amazing claim, but it is also very difficult to prove. The movie didn't give much evidence to support this claim. However, lots of people find this kind of evidence pretty compelling. The movie also talked about other discoveries, such as the discovery that the universe is made from an unknown form of matter and is being propelled by a mysterious force known only as 'dark energy'. These discoveries are very astounding, but they also raise a lot of questions. It is clear that we still have a long way to go before we understand everything about the universe.<eos>"

Writing novels is like planting a forest, and writing short stories is more like planting a garden. The two processes complement each other, creating a complete landscape. Writing novels takes a long time and a lot of commitment, while writing short stories is quicker and easier to finish. You can create a story out of the smallest things, and you don’t have to worry about failing. Short stories are like guideposts to your heart, and it makes you happy as a writer to be able to share these intimate feelings with your readers.<eos>"

Science is a powerful force that has improved our lives and threatened our existence. It has also inspired us to dream big and to understand the universe. Science has its beauty and its perils, but it is also important and fallible. Scientists come in many colors, and their work is often characterized by conflict. The history of science has been filled with conflict and change. Sometimes, scientific theories are overthrown and replaced by new ones. But science always keeps moving forward. It is a constantly evolving field that is always learning new things. Science has also had a big impact on the world. It has helped us to understand our planet and our place in the universe. It has also helped us to develop new technologies and treatments. Science is a powerful tool that can be used for good or for evil. We need to be aware of the power of science and use it responsibly.<eos>"

From around 2015, books sales started to decline. This made people question the future of ebooks. Some people thought that ebooks would replace print books. But this is not true. Digital and print books can coexist in the market. The idea of the disappearing book is a powerful one. It tells us much more about our relationship with technology and change.

In the past, there have been many times when new technologies have been predicted to kill existing media. For example, when television was invented, people thought that radio would die. But radio survived. And the same is true for books. E-readers have not replaced print books. They have just made them more popular.

The idea of the disappearing book is a story that we use to make sense of change. It is a story about our fears and our hopes for the future. It is also a story about our relationship with technology.<eos>"

Howard became a palaeontologist because he was interested in dinosaurs. He wanted to become a palaeontologist since he was young. He studied delicate creatures revealed on the surface of grey rocks. He finished his doctoral thesis and got a job as a lecturer. He was grateful for his job, even though he was not the obvious candidate. He often found himself contrasting the orderly nature of his professional life with the anarchy of private concerns. One day, his briefcase was stolen. He was fuming and returned to the college. He made an explanatory phone call and postponed the lecture. He reported the theft to the appropriate authorities and then went for a restorative coffee. He joined a colleague who was entertaining a visiting curator from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. And thus it was that Howard learned of the recently acquired collection of fossils.<eos>"

Charles Spence is a Professor of Experimental Psychology at Oxford University in the UK. He has studied how the senses interact to form our perception of flavour. Through his studies, he has influenced what we eat and drink. He has also studied how the person who orders first in a restaurant enjoys their food most and how much we consume when eating with others.

Spence's lab is simple and low-tech. There are soundproof booths and stacks of ancient-looking audio-visual equipment. He can afford to work more creatively with cooks because much of his work is funded by a major food multinational.

Spence has helped famous brands reduce salt and sugar in their products. He has also found that higher-pitched music enhances sweetness and lower-pitched and brassy sounds make food taste bitter.

At home, Spence has had dinner parties with unique experiences, such as playing with remote-controlled light bulbs and eating rabbit with the fur wrapped around the cutlery.<eos>"

Our brains are very busy these days. We have a lot of information to deal with, including facts, rumors, and things that are not true. We also do more things than ever before. Thirty years ago, people used to make our airline reservations and help us find what we needed in shops. Now we do most things ourselves. We have smartphones that help us do many things at once. But there’s a problem with multitasking. It makes us less efficient. It also increases the production of stress hormones and makes it harder to focus. If you try to do too much at once, you will not be able to do any of it well. It is like trying to juggle too many balls. You will not be able to keep any of them in the air. To make matters worse, multitasking requires decision-making. It takes a lot of energy to make decisions, and it can lead to making bad decisions.<eos>"

In a zoo in Sweden, there is a chimpanzee named Santino who breaks up concrete into pieces at night. Was he being spiteful? In caves in the US, female bats help unrelated fruit bat mothers if they can’t find the right birthing position. Are they being caring? Fifty years ago, people thought that animals didn’t have consciousness or feelings. But recently that has changed. Thanks to research into the behaviour of bats, chimps, and other animals, we now know that animals have emotions. It is a change that has started a debate about whether animals can be said to have consciousness. This debate is very difficult to solve. It is a philosophical one. Given that even defining consciousness is near impossible, can we ever hope to know what it is like to be a bat?

The observations made in this text are not disputed, but the interpretation of them is. Some people believe that we should stop eating meat, while others believe that we should at the very least re-evaluate our view of animal cognition. There is no consensus on what the best course of action is.<eos>"

Critical thinking is a way of understanding what we read or listen to in a deeper way. It involves thinking about the information and forming your own opinion. There is a belief that argument is a way of finding the truth. Although technology can help us store and process information, it can also make it more difficult to think critically.

There are some concerns that technology is changing the way we approach complex problems and making it more difficult to really think. For example, the amount of poor yet charismatic thinking, the fads of intellectual fashion, opinion, and mere assertion, has increased. Also, the wealth of communications and information can easily overwhelm our reasoning abilities.

However, there are also some benefits to using technology for critical thinking. For example, reading on the internet can help you to analyze information and develop your vocabulary. Playing video games can also help you to build smarter children with better reasoning skills.

It's important to understand the subtleties of how technology affects thinking and analysis. We need to take a closer look at technology and see how it can be used to improve our critical thinking skills.<eos>"

When Matthew Crawford is not writing or thinking about how we should live, he works as a motorcycle mechanic. He wrote two books about the benefits of manual trades and how to cope with modernity.

Crawford says that our attention is being pulled away by many things, such as advertisements and video games. It is becoming more and more difficult to think or remember conversations we’ve had. And because everyone is trying to protect themselves from being interrupted, we close ourselves off and no longer want to do simple things like chat to strangers.

Crawford has some solutions for this problem. First, we need to regulate noise and distraction in public space. More importantly, though, he advocates skilled practices as a way of engaging with the world in a more satisfying way.

For example, if you like to cook, you can practice your skills and enjoy the satisfaction of creating a delicious meal. If you like to play hockey, you can practice your skills and enjoy the thrill of the game. If you like to ride motorcycles, you can practice your skills and enjoy the freedom of the road.<eos>"

""What do you do for a living?"" is a common question. It's a question that we often answer in a few words. But if you're a philosopher, it's a little harder. Philosophers have established themselves as people who judge the activities of others and celebrate intellectual life. They also believe that a life lived in contemplation is the most virtuous of all. However, philosophers are not different from the masses. They have the same problems and concerns as everyone else.

But there is one thing that philosophers do have that others don't. They have the ability to reflect upon the world and make sense of it. This ability is essential for living a good life. It allows us to control our lives and make our own decisions.

Philosophy can also help us to look at the practices and behaviours that define our lives. It can help us to see what is right and wrong. It can also help us to understand ourselves better.

So, if you're interested in learning more about philosophy, there are a few things you can do. You can read some books, or you can talk to a philosopher. You can also try to reflect upon your own experiences and see what you can learn from them.<eos>"

Foodies, gourmands, chefs and others who love food might expect that thinking critically about what and how we eat can contribute to culinary pleasure. However, historically, philosophical discussions of food have been mostly about other topics. When philosophers have talked about eating, it has actually been a metaphor for something else, such as the acquisition of knowledge. Alternatively, we may find philosophical conversations that superficially appear to be about food. But further examination reveals that these arguments explore deeper, but only loosely connected, points.

Food is inherently social and cultural. It is shared with those in our communities and provides us with dining companions and infrastructure. We interact with food more frequently and in more fundamental ways than any other commodity. It is also a topic of philosophical enquiry.

There are undoubtedly many ethical issues that attach to food. We can ask what we should eat and our answers will often reveal our ethical beliefs. And philosophers will always ask why the answers are what they are.

Cooking in restaurants and in the home differs. Home cooks have a special duty to their guests, while those who cook for a living have obligations to their employer and the food itself.

Food and dining can play a role in bridging cultural gaps. We can come to appreciate others by learning to enjoy their food and forge personal bonds with people from other cultures by coming together to eat.<eos>"

Rob Daviau is a designer from the US who creates legacy board games. These games are different from traditional board games because they have a permanent impact on the game. For example, in one game, you might have to rip up cards or deface the board. The games play out over a fixed number of sessions and long-held grudges become woven into the fabric of the game.

Daviau was asked to collaborate on a legacy version of Pandemic, a popular co-operative board game. His next project was a board game called SeaFall. Legacy board game designers must consider all possible player choices to ensure the narrative doesn’t fall apart. To do this, designers recruit testers so they can observe how board games will unfold.

Legacy board games were never expected to go mainstream, but most players love the concept. They see it as one of the biggest advances in game design for several years. The legacy format draws on video games and the demand for episodic entertainment fuelled by popular TV series.<eos>"

Once upon a time, there was an octopus named Inky who lived in New Zealand. One night, Inky escaped from his tank and went to the ocean. It was a story that was shared online. People enjoyed the story because it was funny and because it showed that animals are smart.

There is a word called anthropomorphism that describes the act of treating animals like humans. Dr. Frans de Waal is a scientist who studies primates. He says that anthropomorphism is not true. He says that animals have many of the same abilities as humans, such as the ability to think about the past and the future, to demonstrate empathy, and to be self-aware.

In the past, people thought that animals were not very smart. But there is evidence that animals are actually quite smart. For example, octopuses can open jars, recognize faces, and use coconut shells as portable armor. Squirrels can remember where they have hidden their nuts. And chimpanzees can use tools to make fire.

Dr. de Waal believes that we are emerging from a dark period and learning to think of animal cognition as being on the same spectrum, though not necessarily at the same point, as that of humans. He also believes that the best way to test animal intelligence is to design tests that are specific to each species.<eos>"

The problem is that many people don't understand the impact that robotics will have on their jobs. Some people think that robots will take all of their jobs away, but this is not true. Robots can do some things that humans can do, but they can't do everything.

There are also a lot of new jobs being created in the robotics industry. These jobs require high-skilled workers, such as technicians and programmers. However, there are also a lot of jobs that will be lost due to automation.

It is important to learn about robotics and prepare for the future. We need to invest in education and training programs to help people learn the skills they need to be successful in the robotic workforce.<eos>"

The mountaineer George Mallory said that he wanted to climb Mount Everest because there was a desire to understand why people would participate in such a dangerous activity. Climbing can give people a feeling of freedom, but it can also be very confining. There is an apparent paradox in many forms of climbing. However, climbing can also help cultivate important virtues such as courage, humility and respect for the environment.

When asked why people climb, US rock climber Joe Fitschen argues that climbing is in our genes. It is inherent in our basic makeup to take on challenges and test limits. Climbing also helps develop important virtues such as courage, humility and respect for the environment.<eos>"

My grandfather's garden was a beautiful place. It was on the bank of a river and sloped gently down towards the water. You couldn't reach the river but you could hear the sound of the water and the birds that sang in the trees above. I imagined that all gardens were like this – a place of escape, peace and solitude.

My father was a quiet and withdrawn person. He had a lot of phrases that he liked to use, one of them being 'It's immaterial to me'. He was probably disappointed that he hadn't made more of his life. He left school without qualifications and became apprenticed to a plumber. It wasn't something he was passionate about.

I always wanted to like the piano but it did its best to intimidate me. The only thing I did like about it were the two brass candlesticks that jutted out from the front. I'd walk along the river bank looking for a suitable spot where I could take off the painful sandals and leave them with my picnic while I ventured out, tentatively, peering through the water for any fish that I could scoop up with the net and take home.

One day my father announced that there was a vacancy for an apprentice gardener in the Parks Department. I thought you might be interested. I like to feel that somewhere deep down inside him, although he hated gardening himself, he'd watched me doing it for long enough and noticed the keenness and the passion for all things that grew and flowered and fruited that hadn't disappeared.<eos>"

Susie has always been open about what she does. When she reproduces an old masterpiece, she will make it look as authentic as possible. However, she will put her own signature on the back of the canvas.

When younger painters approach Susie for advice, she stresses the importance of learning to draw and to represent things accurately. She also emphasises how much she’s studied to be able to do what she does.<eos>"

Ellen MacArthur loved the sea. It was her great obsession from childhood. She had a special connection with the boats that took her round the world. They worked as one. When she was on land, life felt trivial. She wanted to be back on the ocean again, testing herself against the forces of nature.

After she came second in a big race, she took you down into her boat. She talked about the careful planning that had gone into provisioning. She said that preparation was everything. She showed you her food, her stove, and her medical supplies. Her housekeeping was as impressive as her sailing.

The boat was her world and she looked after it because her life depended on it. Now, she sees the world as a boat. It is a small, beautiful, and fragile thing whose supplies are running out.

She has been talking to people about the environment. She says that we have to design a way of not using things up. She also started a charity to give young people the vision to rethink and redesign a sustainable future.<eos>"

Jordan Romero is 13 years old and wants to be the youngest person to climb Mount Everest. If he succeeds, he could become one of the most famous teenagers of his generation. He wants to inspire kids to climb their own mountains or venture outdoors. His team includes his father, Paul, and mother, Karen. They call themselves 'Team Romero.' If Jordan can climb Everest and Vinson Massif in Antarctica, he will become the youngest person to have climbed the Seven Summits. Few people achieve this under the age of thirty. Jordan has already climbed five of the Seven Summits and might actually do it before his teenage years are over.

There are some people who think that taking a young climber up the world’s highest mountain is a bad idea. They say that a young climber might have the necessary physical strength, but they doubt whether a teenager would be emotionally strong enough. They also say that a young person couldn’t have gained enough experience to develop the good judgment and reactions a climber must have in order to take part in such a project safely.

But Jordan’s parents believe that their own experience as climbers will help. They also believe that watching Jordan develop gives them confidence. They talk to him regularly to make sure he hasn’t lost the motivation to do it.<eos>"

When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, it's probably not classical music they're listening to. Most people can name a few pop groups, but not many know who Brahms was. I started doing a music degree, but the people on my course know no more about classical music than anyone else my age. If you don’t know who wrote the music, you are unlikely to own any recordings of their work. Classical music is not very popular among teenagers. There are a few reasons why this is the case. First, the pace and rhythm of classical music are not very appealing to us. Second, classical music is not structurally very simple. Third, the subject matter of classical music is not very relatable to teenagers. Finally, the way we listen to music has changed. Nowadays, you can find any music you want at the click of a mouse, and yet the sound track to our lives is rarely classical.<eos>"

It was not finished and it was strange. There was a river in the picture. It was not a real river, it was a fantasy river. The picture was beautiful, but it was also mysterious. There were no animals or people in the picture. It felt like there was no place for living things in this picture. But Jess was captivated by the picture.

When I woke up this morning, I didn't mean to damage my bedroom carpet. It just seemed like a good idea at the time. I was trying to fit my corner cabinet into a corner. Gran had given me the cabinet when she moved out of her house into a flat. It's really cute and I keep my collection of shells and fossils and interesting stones there.

My bedroom is small and shaped like a wedge of cheese. It has two corners. My bed is in one corner and my wardrobe is in the other. I'd tried fitting Gran’s cabinet into the angle between the roof and the floor, but it was just the tiniest little bit too tall. If I could only slice a couple of centimetres off the bottom of it... That was when it came to me. If I couldn’t slice anything off Gran’s cabinet, how about cutting a hole in the carpet? It just seemed like the obvious solution.<eos>"

The novel 'The Borrowers' is about a family of tiny people who live hidden in the walls and floors of a house. They borrow things from the normal-sized people in order to survive. When I was asked to direct a TV adaptation of the novel, I knew it was going to be hard to live up to people’s expectations. The author had told me she wanted the series to be from the Borrowers' perspective, not a human one, which made filming much more complex. The most crucial thing was getting the scale right. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans, so we had to be much further away from the camera than on a normal shoot. We also had to film from low angles to get the Borrowers' perspective. One big challenge was finding a way to get the shadows right. We developed a unique technique for this. The costumes were also a big challenge. They were made out of heavy canvas material so that they stuck out in the way that dolls’ clothes do. Unfortunately, the weather was really hot during filming. We had to work hard and fast. But it all came together in the end, and I think the series was pretty successful in conveying the magic of the books.<eos>"

My mom pulled up at the corner of my new school, Palm Grove High School. She looked around nervously, but there were no journalists there. I was excited to see how long it would take before the craziness began. It always does. The fake smiles, the wannabe friends, the people who want free tickets to one of my dad’s concerts. I told her, ""Everything’s going to be fine."" She kissed her fingertip and touched my cheek right before I got out of the car. Then she was off, leaving me alone with this whole new school and situation.

I walked into the school’s main office and asked for my schedule. The secretary was not very friendly. She made a face and leaned her ear closer to me. I gave her my name and she typed it on the keyboard. She seemed confused. I guess she didn’t know my last name. I was late for my first class, but I was able to get a seat in the last row.

In the United States, teenage girls are expected to be Student Council president and have part-time jobs, volunteer, and excel in all of these fields. Being an American teenager today is not easy. There is a lot of pressure on teenagers, including homework, tests, extracurricular activities, jobs, chores, and responsibilities at home.

Teenagers have a lot of challenges, but they also have a lot of opportunities. They can take their work on the go with them and do their homework wherever they happen to be. They can also use their cell phones to connect with friends and family.

However, teenagers also have a lot of stress. They often have to wake up early and go to school late, and they often have to do their homework late into the night. This can lead to sleep deprivation, which can have a negative impact on their health and well-being.

Despite the challenges, teenagers are still proving to be resilient and capable. They are taking the world by storm and making a positive impact on the world.<eos>"

The teenage members of the Earth to Sky Calculus Club live in Bishop, a mountain town in the US, surrounded by wilderness. They have launched over fifty balloons to the edge of space. It's a long-running science project that includes astronomy and adventure. I joined them one weekend to release a high-altitude balloon. They secured a soft insulated lunch box to the bottom of the balloon and put a camera, an instrument to measure altitude, and a thermometer inside. Two GPS trackers were mounted on the outside of the lunch box to help them find it later. They inflated the balloon and finally, it was time for lift-off. Some of the students ran and tracked the balloon's path with powerful flashlights. There was quiet and a sense of collective wonder. Then the balloon disappeared into the night. After the launch, some students stayed to watch the shooting stars. They lay on blankets on the mountainside and gazed at the clear sky. The lunch box landed in a canyon, high on a flat rock, in the middle of a cascading waterfall. It was a bit of a disappointment, but it was also a perfect opportunity to argue over the effects of atmospheric waves.<eos>"

Chloe Morgan loves science, especially Palaeontology. She started to be interested in the subject when she was fifteen. It happened by chance when her younger brother was going through the dinosaur phase. Chloe lent him a hand with a science project and she found out about some recent discoveries in the field. She knew that this was something she wanted to commit herself to.

Paleontology is not a common career choice for young people, but Chloe was determined to make her dream come true. She met her first professional palaeontologist, Matt Cornelius, and he was very patient and willing to listen to her questions.

Dinosaurs continue to fascinate us because they speak to the innate explorer in all of us. They are also a reminder that there is still more out there to be discovered.

Walking with Dinosaurs was a great opportunity for Chloe to influence the way dinosaurs are portrayed on screen. She was able to help the makers of the programme to ensure that the dinosaurs shown were accurate and realistic.<eos>"

When you travel by car with your family, even when you're young, you know that you're not 'there yet.' It's not 'there' anymore once you get there. So if you really think there's a chance that you're 'there' yet, you should be asking 'Are we there yet? '

There are a lot of things you can do on a long car trip. You can watch DVDs, listen to music, or play puzzles. You can also act as co-pilot and help your parents keep the car running smoothly.

But sometimes things go wrong. Your brother or sister might put their foot on your side of the seat or hurl their whole body over into your space. If this happens, there could be a fight. The driver and co-pilot will try to separate you and your sibling and tell them to stay in their own seat.

After that, the scenery changes and you might feel a draught blowing across your arm. But don't worry, the car isn't going that fast and the window isn't even open. So where's the draught coming from? Your vengeful sibling is probably blowing on you.

If you're feeling angry, you might start yelling at your sibling or acting out. But your parents will probably be there to help you calm down. And once you're calm, you can enjoy the rest of your trip.<eos>"

John and Zuzi Morgan have opened a café in Oxford, UK, where people can enjoy coffee, cake, and play board games. They hope that people will enjoy the experience so much that they will want to repeat it. Zuzi explains why they decided to turn their love of tabletop games into a full-time business: 'There's so much technology. Everybody's busy on their mobile phones and other gadgets. We wanted to bring people back together in a way that’s not just staring at screens. It’s a natural thing in people. We're supposed to be together and communicating with each other.'

The games that are played in John and Zuzi's café are called 'Eurogames'. They are known for their gentle themes, such as farming and landscape-building. The first Eurogame was created by a German designer, Klaus Teuber. Players establish settlements on an island and trade resources with the other players. The games that follow this type of game are called 'co-operative' games. In these games, every player wins or loses as a team member. Pandemic, a Eurogame in which players must collaborate to solve global problems, was created by a North American, Matt Leacock. He was inspired by a Eurogame called Lord of the Rings.

The growth of the video games industry has also contributed to the success of these modern, ingeniously designed board games. Video games and board games have learned a lot from each other. There are more people who are open to the idea of playing games than ever before. Tabletop gaming has become more than entertainment. It’s a way to bring people together and share experiences.<eos>"

Have you ever wondered what it’s like to perform in a circus? Sophia Grayson is from Circus Experience, a centre that teaches young people circus skills. She says her course is popular because it includes many skills, such as juggling, throwing and catching things, trapeze, and business planning. On the year-long course, students gradually increase the amount of risk they take in each class and parents come along to certain classes to watch progress. Sophia explains that to be successful in the circus, you must keep practising and be fit. You also need to have imagination and never stop improving your skills. Being fit is very important for circus artists, like athletes, who train daily to keep strong. Training is very important, but the best performers are those who want success, have imagination and never stop improving skills. People often think that working in the circus is dangerous or that you might only work for a short time each year. But, actually, the real issue is looking ahead because you can only be on the road while you’re young and then you really need to consider other options.<eos>"

My city has a modern cinema that shows all the latest films I want to see, and lots of films for kids at the weekends. It’s close to where I live, but a year ago, I realized something was missing – the experience of discussing a film in detail with a group of people after watching it with them. So, together with two friends, I started a film club. We decided to have our own place to show the films, instead of hiring a cinema. We choose a different location in the city each month. Sometimes, the place is free, and sometimes we have to pay a small fee. We’re happy to make enough to cover our costs – we’re not trying to make a profit. Each time we show a film, everything is a bit easier for us. We also know how many tickets we’ve sold because everything’s online. There’s still always plenty to do, but when people of all ages come up to say what a great experience they’ve had, it’s wonderful. We’ve started a blog, too, because we know that most people now go online for information about films, rather than read reviews in local papers. We’ve also tried putting up a few posters in cafés. Nothing’s as successful as word of mouth, though – people recommending us to their friends.<eos>"

There are different levels, from beginner to advanced, run by adult volunteers called ‘leaders’. When you complete each level, you get a certificate.

I was born in Denver, USA. I started snowboarding when I was eight years old. My dad took me to a resort in the mountains, about two hours from Denver. The hill was very steep, so my dad had to do a lot of persuading to get me on a board. I was young, so I hadn’t even thought of asking my dad if I could start snowboarding, but he was already into it and wanted me to love it too. I managed just fine. After this experience, I started competing aged ten. I enjoy taking part in competitions and winning too. I have a lot of fun training and studying during the summer. It’s the best way of dealing with not being able to do what I love so much. I have to think carefully about my future. Snowboarding is such a huge part of my life now, but I also feel it’s important to have something else I can do, just in case I don’t succeed as a professional snowboarder or if I get injured.<eos>"

When I was fifteen, I wanted everything my friends had. I didn't plan ahead, like I had no idea what I wanted to do when I left school. One day, my best friend got a new phone and I thought I should have one too. My parents said I could only have it if I paid for it myself, so I decided to work part-time and save as much as I could. I owe my parents a lot for making me do that – it taught me a really valuable lesson. I worked every Saturday in a café, but I didn’t really enjoy it. My parents suggested starting my own little business instead. I asked my mum if I could have a go at making necklaces. I’d never imagined I’d find it so easy, as it had seemed so complicated when I’d watched Mum doing it. I sold my first items of jewellery to my friends and family. They told me they were delighted with them, but I just thought they were saying that to please me. So although I was grateful they’d bought them, I still needed convincing that they looked good enough to be popular with the public. There was only one way to find out, so I rented a market stall with my mum. There are always lots of tourists where I live, and they bought lots of my things to give to family and friends when they got back home. Soon we were receiving calls from all over the country from people looking to buy more. We thought we were a big company, employing loads of people to produce my designs, when in fact we were just two people on a market stall. That was when I knew it could work, and it was time to take the next step – creating a website. Since then, I’ve made thousands of pounds through my business, mostly online.<eos>"

When Janine Stuart was young, she wrote a novel called Being Amelia which became popular. The book is based on Janine’s life. In one interview, Janine said, ‘Because of my family’s moving around a lot, I’ve become good at making new friends. I understand what it’s like to be the only new student in a class, and that helped me to write about how the main character, Amelia, gets on in a new school.

Janine started her novel one summer, when she was feeling bored at home. Her mom had always dreamed of becoming a published author herself, and her teachers had always encouraged her to write, so it seemed like a natural way for Janine to pass the time. The year before, she’d entered a short story competition on a young writers’ website and won first prize. That’s why, when Janine finished Being Amelia and sent it to a publishing company, the people who worked there were excited to read it. They loved it, and a year later, Janine’s novel was on sale in bookshops.

One review of Being Amelia mentions how, despite the book having pictures of happy teenagers on the cover, the people in the story actually face some difficult challenges. This is what really allows readers to believe in them. The reviewer says that although Janine is still very young, and Being Amelia isn’t a particularly long novel, she’s clearly shown that she’s a better writer than several other best-selling authors.<eos>"

My name is Tom. I am fifteen years old. Three years ago, my family and I moved to a castle on a small island. My dad was invited to be the manager of the castle. He works for an organisation that looks after historical buildings. It was a long time before the rest of us agreed Dad should take the job. But once we moved, we quickly got used to island life. The castle isn’t very beautiful, but our apartment is comfortable. The island feels very sociable in the summer, and there are often parties on the beach. During the winter, there aren’t as many teenagers as I had hoped. But the adults all support each other, and help with repairs on the island. The biggest change for me was travelling by boat every day. I was looking forward to going on stormy days, when there are huge waves, but the ferries don’t run then. And I’ve discovered that if I miss the bus to the harbour after school, I also miss the last ferry home, which is worrying. So when schoolmates come home to stay with me, I’m always telling them to hurry up!<eos>"

I live in a house surrounded by beautiful countryside in Scotland. I love nature and wild animals, and I started a new hobby called birdwatching six years ago. I went to some mountains in northern Scotland with my family, where we saw lots of birds. I spent hours watching them with my parents, who showed me how to tell the difference between species and how to find the best places to see them. It was amazing, and I joined a local young birdwatchers’ club. My goal is to see 200 different bird species, and I’ve almost achieved that. I’ve been to many places to see birds, including Egypt and South America. I also think that birdwatching clubs should try to get more young people interested in this hobby. Everyone needs to connect with nature, whatever their age, and it doesn’t have to cost much money.<eos>"

I started playing football when I was 7. I would rush home from school to play with other boys and girls. I loved it, and I was good at it. But my family knew I often became keen on new hobbies and then dropped them, so they thought the same thing would happen with football. But it didn’t. I was already dreaming of playing football professionally when I was older. And the opportunity came sooner than I’d hoped. I played in local tournaments, and one of the referees noticed that I was a promising player, so he asked the manager of a professional women’s club to watch me play. After that, she asked me to join her club. I was surprised at first, but the manager was impressed, and I started regular training with a big club as a young 13-year-old. I improved enormously. But people still weren’t sure I’d ever be a star player, which made me feel a bit upset. But my coach encouraged me to just be myself, and believe in myself. I played in one of the club’s championship matches, and I won the game. Since then, I’ve scored lots more winning goals. And next month, my coach and I are running a football tournament in my area. The aim is to get teenagers interested in football, and to have a chance to chat to other players in my club.<eos>"

One of the most interesting things happening in higher education in the UK and around the world is that students are being encouraged to do research earlier in their studies. This means that research is not just for famous scholars or scientists. It can also be done by everyone.

There are different ways to do research. You can do it by reading books, articles, and websites. You can also do it by talking to people and asking questions. If you are a student, you can make a contribution to knowledge by making your own research. You can do this by asking questions, finding answers, and sharing your findings with others.

Critical thinking is an important part of research. You need to be able to think about the information you are given and evaluate its validity. You also need to be able to test out the information and see if it is true. If you are not able to think critically about the information you are given, you may not be able to learn very much from your research.<eos>"

Cities have always been centers of intellectual life. They have been places where people gather to discuss ideas and share their thoughts. However, city life is not always easy. It can be exhausting and overwhelming. Scientists have begun to study how the city affects the brain, and the results are not always positive. They have found that cities can actually dull our thinking, sometimes dramatically so. One of the main reasons for this is the lack of nature in cities. Studies have shown that people who can see trees from their windows recover more quickly from illness. Even small glimpses of nature can improve brain performance. This is because nature provides a break from the urban grind. It also helps us to focus better and concentrate. In addition to the lack of nature, cities also have a lot of other challenges, such as traffic, noise, and pollution. These challenges can be very tiring for the brain. They can make it difficult to concentrate and focus. However, there are ways to mitigate the psychological damage of the metropolis. One way is to create vibrant urban parks. Another way is to find ways to reduce traffic and noise pollution. By taking these steps, we can make cities more livable and more conducive to creativity and innovation.<eos>"

The mind is a complex thing. It is like a stick that is used by a blind person. The stick is a part of the blind person's body. It helps the blind person to see. The mind is also a part of the human body. It helps us to think and learn.

There is a lot of evidence to show that things and neurons participate in human cognitive life. For example, stone objects, body ornaments, engravings, clay tokens and writing systems play an active role in human evolution and the making of the human mind.

The mind is more than just the brain. It is also the things that we use to think and learn. We can use things to make our minds stronger. We can also use things to make our minds more creative.

My new theory, called Material Engagement Theory (MET), explores the different ways in which things become cognitive extensions or are incorporated by the human body. It also investigates how those ways might have changed since earliest prehistory.<eos>"

Photography has changed the course of civilization and the way we know the world. It has been especially true in the United States, where photography became part of US culture at every level. Historians say that photography is arguably the country’s greatest single contribution to the visual arts. In no other art form has US work loomed so large.

Photography has been appealing because it is a mechanical process that matches a growing enthusiasm for technology. It also brings the wonders and sights of the world into the front room with an immediacy that is breathtaking. The camera is also a tool for creating and sustaining an impression of self and family, and for representing everyday realities.

If we want to understand a photograph historically, then we need to pay special attention to its purpose and function within a given cultural matrix. We also need to consider the placement and framing of the photograph.<eos>"

In 1890, William James, an American philosopher and physician, defined psychology as the 'science of mental life.' This definition is still a good starting point for understanding psychology today. We all have a mental life, so we have some idea about what this means. However, even though the concept can be studied in rats and monkeys as well as humans, it remains a somewhat elusive one.

Psychology is about the mind or brain, but psychologists do not understand nearly enough about its workings to be able to comprehend the part that it plays in the experience and expression of our hopes, fears, and wishes, or in our behaviour during experiences as varied as giving birth or watching a football match.

The endeavour of psychology is much like that involved in solving a crossword puzzle. It involves evaluating and interpreting available clues. The clues themselves have to be derived from careful observation, based on accurate measurement, analysed with all possible scientific rigour, and interpreted using logical and reasoned arguments which can be subjected to public scrutiny.

Psychology has the same goals as any other science: to describe, understand, predict, and learn how to control or modify the process that it studies. Once these goals have been achieved, it can help us to understand the nature of our experience and come to conclusions that can be applied directly to people’s lives.<eos>"

In a storehouse in a business park in Michigan, USA, there is a museum of failed products. The museum has a collection of products that were not successful. The proprietor of the museum, Carol Sherry, sees each product as embodying its own sad story. The museum is a viable, profit-making business. It is a testament to the fact that most products fail.

The museum was started by a man named Robert McMath. McMath intended to accumulate a reference library of consumer products. He started collecting samples of new products in the 1960s. Over time, McMath's collection grew to consist overwhelmingly of unsuccessful products.

The culture of optimism in today's society may be responsible for the goods lining the museum's shelves. People often focus on the positive aspects of a situation and ignore the negative ones. This obsession with optimism can be seen in the self-help field. People who spend time thinking about how well things could go often end up achieving less.

Psychologist Carol Dweck has studied the effects of failure on people. She has found that people who believe that ability is innate find failure to be especially horrifying. People who believe that ability evolves through challenge and hard work find failure to be an opportunity to learn and grow.<eos>"

Everyone knows that sports teams have an advantage when they play at home. But does anyone know why? Most of us probably think we do; after all, it seems obvious. But professional sport is changing faster than at any time in its history and much of what we used to take for granted is now open to question.

There are two main reasons why home advantage exists. First, the home team has the advantage of playing in front of their own crowd. This can give them a boost of confidence and make them more likely to win. Second, the home team has the advantage of being able to control the playing conditions. This can also give them an edge in the game.

However, there are some changes that have recently happened that have made home advantage less effective. For example, travel has become much easier and the top grounds increasingly resemble one another. This has made it harder for teams to gain an advantage by playing at home.

Despite these changes, home advantage still exists. There are a number of factors that can contribute to home advantage, including the team's confidence, the playing conditions, and the team's ability to control the game.<eos>"

The more I practice, the luckier I get, said Gary Player some time ago. This quote is famous and is used by many athletes and their coaches. It is easy to see why this quote is popular. There are two main problems with the quote. First, the source of the quote is not clear. Second, the meaning of the quote is not clear. Player did not mean lucky, he was actually speaking ironically. He meant that the more you practice, the better you get. Up to a point. Where that point is, is at the heart of the nature-nurture debate. The debate is about whether talent is born or acquired. But it is not a fair debate. It is like a basketball game between giants and dwarves. Nurture has been victorious. The theory that practice matters more than innate talent is true. But it is not always true. There are some cases where genes really matter. And there are also some cases where the environment really matters.<eos>"

A recent report found that many children living in wealthy countries feel unhappy and lonely. The reason for this is that these children have been spending too much time indoors and not enough time outside. They have lost contact with the natural world and have become dependent on technology.

The report also found that many children would be happier if they could go outside more. Many adults talk nostalgically about the freedom of their own youth, but they rarely stop to reflect that they are the ones who have imposed that protective regime on their own children.

The book also discusses the issue of child-focused consumerism and the fear of danger that makes parents want to keep kids at home. It also talks about the importance of allowing children to have their own autonomy and to take risks.<eos>"

I am a researcher who has a lot of school and I am good at solving problems. But my schooling has not helped me much with the problems I face in life. Most problems in life cannot be solved with a formula or memorized answers. They require the judgement, wisdom and creative ability that come from life experiences.

Play is important for children's development. All mammals play when they are young and those that have the most to learn play the most. Children, who have the most to learn, play far more than any other young primates when they are allowed to do so.

Play is the natural means by which adults and mammals have always educated themselves. It is also important for children to learn social skills, fairness and morality.

School has become more onerous and adults have replaced play with adult-directed sports and interventions. Our children don’t need more school. They need more play. If we care about our children and future generations, we must reverse the horrid trend that has been occurring over the past half century. We must give childhood back to children.<eos>"

If you want to contact someone on LinkedIn, you should first explain clearly who you are and what you want. If you're offering to do some research for the person or help them in another way, this will increase your chances of getting a positive response. You should also keep the tone humble and avoid sending impersonal, blanket emails.

Newspapers are not doing well. Their circulation has fallen by a third to half since 2000. Many people no longer read newspapers as their main source of news. Some people predict that newspapers will be extinct in the next 15 years. However, old media have a habit of surviving. They have survived many changes over time. For example, radio has flourished in the TV age, and cinema has held its own against videos and DVDs. Newspapers were once new media, but they became the dominant medium for news in the mid-19th century. Now, we have new ways to get news. We can read news online, on our phones, or on our computers. We can also get news from social media. All this is a world away from the straitjacket of newspaper publication. Yet few if any providers seem alive to the new medium’s capacity for spreading understanding and enlightenment.<eos>"

If humans were truly at home under the light of the moon and stars, we would go in darkness happily. Instead, we are creatures who are adapted to living in the sun’s light. We have engineered the night to receive us by filling it with light. This kind of control has some negative effects called light pollution.

Light pollution is mostly caused by bad lighting design. It washes out the darkness of night and alters light levels and light rhythms to which many forms of life have adapted. It affects migration, reproduction, feeding, and other aspects of life.

We have lit up the night as if it were an unoccupied country. It is as essential to maintaining our biological welfare as light itself. Denying darkness is futile. It causes various physical ailments and messes with our regular oscillation of waking and sleep.

Living in a glare of our own making, we have cut ourselves off from our evolutionary and cultural heritage. We have forgotten the scale of our being, which is best measured against the dimensions of a deep night with the Milky Way arching overhead.<eos>"

The founder said that his employees can take as much leave as they want, as long as they feel comfortable that their work can be completed on time. However, there are some concerns about this policy. First, it is difficult to be sure that all of the work can be completed on time. Second, there could be pressure from colleagues and office gossip about who was off when, and for how long. Third, if employees feel that their working hours are not being monitored, they may become self-disciplining and work too much. Finally, employment law exists for a reason and workers are entitled to a minimum amount of statutory paid annual leave.<eos>"

Journal-based peer review is a process that checks scientific research papers to make sure they are accurate and well-written. It is often seen as the best way to ensure the quality of research. However, there are some problems with journal-based peer review. For example, it can delay the publication of a paper by up to a year. Also, it can be difficult for reviewers to decide whether a paper is good enough for a journal. Preprints are a new way to share scientific research papers that have not yet been peer-reviewed. They bring academics back to what research publication is all about: the rapid dissemination of new results. Preprints also make it easier for people to critique and discuss papers. They could also become an effective outlet for negative results.<eos>"

When I ask my students about poems, they often give me answers that are like ""a painting in words."" Their answers rarely satisfy me or them. One day I asked a group to choose an object and write one paragraph describing it empirically, as a scientist might, and another in the first person, from the point of view of the item itself. The exercise led to much amusement and useful discussion.

A poem is a thing made. Poets sometimes compare poems to wild animals or machines. But such comparisons fall apart upon closer analysis. The most productive thing about trying to define a poem through comparison lies not in the comparison itself but in the debate. A poem is a product of writing and rewriting just like an article, story, or novel. It never really becomes what they usually are – a thing created in order to become a commodity.<eos>"

Sleeping is one of my favorite travel experiences. I don't talk about it very much because I feel a little guilty. When friends share details of their well-planned trips, I smile and don't say much. What would they think if they knew that my own travel itineraries include naps and lazy mornings? Better sleep is one of travel's happy side effects. When I visited Mexico's Yucatán coast, I was surprised by how many hours I spent sleeping. There were lots of noisy birds, but it didn't matter. Surrounded by strange smells and sounds, I could plunge into a sleep that was more profound and dream-filled than I imagined possible. Sleep is something else too: it's an experience that changes rhythm, sometimes dramatically, from place to place. People obsess about jet lag, but I suspect that the difficulties I experience recovering from long journeys have more to do with local and cultural adjustment than time zones. When I finally fall into the local sleep pattern, I feel I have truly arrived.<eos>"

In 2004, Pen Hadow became the first person to trek to the North Pole alone and without being resupplied on the way. He swam through cold waters, fought frostbite and polar bears. He also made it to the South Pole the same year. Now he is back in the Arctic preparing for an expedition he says is even more ambitious.

Pen is a strong and determined person. He has to be to do what he is doing. This time, however, there is far more at stake. He will set out on a three-month, 1,000 kilometer trek to the North Pole, taking detailed measurements of the thickness and density of the ice. Nobody has ever done this before, and the results will be of vital importance to the scientific community.

Pen is married to Mary, a horsewoman, who says he has a ‘spine of steel’ and who shares his love of the outdoors. They live in the country with their two children. Pen is worried about being away from his family this time. He knows it will be difficult to talk to them while he is away.

Pen believes his mission reconnects exploration with the search for knowledge that drove previous generations into the unknown. He says, ""Making it to the North Pole was ultimately a personal ambition, and of limited value to anyone beyond the polar adventuring community. This time, scientists will profit from the data, and we’re creating a platform in which to engage as many people as possible in what’s happening in the Arctic Ocean.""<eos>"

I had the chance to do more writing and TV work, and to speak to businesses and schools. But there wasn’t anything on the horizon to get my competitive teeth into. I knew that I wanted to stay in shape, so that I would be in a position to fight for an Olympic place if that dream reignited within me. So I entered marathons and triathlons.

I spoke to some of my rowing colleagues about whether they fancied the race; I didn’t receive any enthusiastic responses. I knew that if I entered the race, even though it is billed primarily as an adventure, I would want to win. I got in contact with Ben. We spoke about the remaining costs of the race and the boat and equipment. We felt we stood a better chance than most, but it would still take work to secure it. Of course, I also had to take into account the loss of earnings that would result from being away from home. But I decided to do the race.

In these books, the journey was often physical, with passports and suitcases and itineraries. The latest book in the series is called In Search of Total Perfection. It is about meeting extraordinary artisans and learning about their ideas of perfection. Perfection is subjective. Even the simple task of choosing which dishes to include in the series turned out to be a challenge. But I knew that I could do something to please everyone. After a lot of work, we finally had a list of dishes that everyone could enjoy. This reinforced my opinion that each of us has our own idea of what constitutes perfection.<eos>"

We were driving to Marrakech when the van broke down. John got out and opened the hood. He stood there for a long time looking at the engine. He was thinking about what to do. I was worried about him. The field was big. There was nothing much in it. Just grass and flowers. We sat on the side of the road and waited for Mum and John to stop laughing. We watched John go away. Mum was tired. She fell asleep in the sun. We stayed at the café all day. We drank tea. It was very sweet. We stayed at the café all day. John was squinting into the engine. It was getting dark. We went to bed. We were sitting in the truck watching our van being towed. I was worried about how we would get home. I thought it might be easier if we could take a boat straight to London. Then I must have fallen asleep.<eos>"

Lucy was talking to two other pianists at a welcome party in the hotel ballroom. They were older than her and good enough English speakers. They talked about the pieces they were playing, where else they’d travelled recently, and where they were going next.

Lucy had not wanted to go to the festival, but she had made it. Her dad bought her a white-gold necklace with an L pendant to congratulate her. Her little brother Gus was excited about the festival. Grace Chang, her teacher, took Lucy out for a special dinner to strategize a repertoire.

In the elevator to their suite after the party, her grandfather turned to her. ‘You did well in there, Lucy. I’m proud of you. This is an important festival, and there’s a buzz about you. They all know who you are.’<eos>"

Your dad says it's not good to spend too much time online. He thinks you should get out into the real world. But research shows that most teenagers who use social media have a lot of friends, a good sense of identity and belonging, and are developing the skills they need to be citizens of a digital age.

There are a few things that social networking can do for you. It can help you develop your self-identity, connect with others who have similar interests, and help you be creative. If you're not outgoing, computer-mediated communication can be more comfortable than face-to-face. If you're a quiet person with a specialized interest, social networking can help you connect with others who share your interests.

Social networking is also becoming a creative force. Teenagers are making videos, podcasting and blogging about the things that interest us. Photo-sharing sites are transforming creativity. Keen photographers can network with each other, learn skills, swap images and deepen their own interest.<eos>"

My family went on a vacation this summer. We drove to the west of the US and Canada. We traveled through nine states and one province. My dad planned the trip and he said that not many people do this anymore. We packed a lot of things into the car, including suitcases, coolers, and clothes. We also had a lot of adventures on the road. We stopped at a town in Oklahoma and learned about cattle. We climbed mountains and visited a national park. We also saw a lot of wind farms. Our trip was a lot of fun and I have a lot of pictures to show.<eos>"

Rose Frost was sixteen years old and was going to live with her grandmother, Daisy. Her family was separating for two years. Her father had an assignment overseas, and her mother would be joining him, but Rose and her sister Amy were staying in England. Amy was finishing her final school courses and would be living under the guardianship of the college Head. It was her last year at school, so it would have been unfair on Amy to move.

Rose was excited about living with her grandmother. There would be lots of new things to do, such as dinner invitations, coffee mornings, and shopping trips. Her grandmother was not the typical frail old lady figure, and she seemed to attend more social events than the Queen of England herself.

Rose was sensible and very mature for her age. She knew about healthy eating, about keeping fit, and getting enough sleep. But this time Rose had insisted on one thing: she wanted her independence. She wanted to play music loud if she wanted, and to invite friends over or go out without having to ask permission every time.

Rose was starting a new school and was feeling excited about it. She knew that this was the last time she would be starting school, and she was ready to begin her final two years at school.<eos>"

Our instructor, Gareth, told us that speed is our friend, not our enemy. We looked down the ski slope and saw David, who had some experience, skiing off down the slope towards the jump. He hit the ramp and flew upwards, arms flailing in the air. Something was wrong and we held our breath. He hit the ground and flipped head-first into the snow. Gareth said that speed is an unpredictable beast. I didn’t think I was cut out for this freestyle stuff, but my parents decided to have a winter holiday at a training centre for freestyle skiing in the US. We practised our moves indoors and headed outside to try them for real. There were more setbacks before I finally landed properly. But I was walking on air, with the sheer pride of having achieved such an elusive goal.<eos>"

Imagine you're riding a rollercoaster in an amusement park. You come to a stop and take a deep breath. Then, the rollercoaster starts to move quickly and turns sharply. Your stomach feels like it's in the air. You feel scared and excited at the same time.

Amusement parks are a big industry. To make the rides, there are teams of engineers and designers. They have to create the perfect balance of pleasure and fear. They also have to introduce enough novelty to keep visitors wanting more.

The teams behind rollercoasters must piece together a strong narrative, be it a space adventure or a high-paced chase in the jungle. They have to use their creativity and experience to create a seamless experience.

However, as technology has transformed industry after industry, rollercoaster designers will also have to embrace the latest advances, such as virtual reality. But, according to experts, the physical coaster experience will remain king for many years to come.<eos>"

At 25, Miranda Ellington has achieved a lot as a choreographer. She creates works for many theatres and dance companies. She also dances from time to time. It's a lot of work to be a choreographer. It's like being in a teaching role and working with young students. They are open to new ideas and willing to try new things.

When Miranda starts working with a new group, she concentrates on the dance steps and the music dictates what she does. Sometimes, it can be frustrating if the dancers don't respond well to the music. But Miranda has to find solutions. She doesn't go back to the drawing board and select a new piece.

Miranda doesn't like to be attached to one institution. She has to be prepared to adapt the way she works each time she goes somewhere new. And that does mean that she avoids becoming too set in her ways.

The conversation turns to the recent documentary on professional ballet dancers and choreographers. The documentary is accurate and shows the hard work and dedication involved in ballet. Miranda thinks that a great dance production is when everything comes together. It's when the music, costumes, lighting, and dancers all work well together.<eos>"

I have a friend who asked me why I travel when I can see everything on television. I agreed that you can see amazing things on TV, but why sit at home on your sofa when there’s so much to experience out there. I guess that conversation gave me the idea for my crazy four-day trip, and a film that aimed to get people to turn off their television sets.

I had a mate who was getting rid of his old sofa. I fixed the sofa and connected it to some cables and seatbelts. I put my luggage on the seats and slept on the sofa each night. Several friends joined me on the trip, helping to pull the sofa along and encouraging me to keep going.

This was the longest distance I have ever walked. It was also on main roads, which meant I could stop at a roadside café and relax on the sofa with a cappuccino. I got used to telling people, ""No, I’m not doing it for charity, I’m not training for a marathon"". When someone at work asks me about my weekend, I’d rather explain how I dragged a sofa 100 miles across southern England than discuss the latest show on TV.<eos>"

When I read about swimming trips in the sea around some small Greek islands, I was excited. I'd never tried group trips before. My brother was busy, so I decided to join a group holiday. The man at the port was curious when I asked for a single ticket. I explained that I wouldn't be alone for long. I'd be joining ten others to swim around the tiny islands. We did a short swim to split us into speed groups, then it was time for our first proper swim. I was nervous. I'd trained in my local pool and done some river swimming, but never long distances in the open sea. Soon, the waves got bigger and I was at the back of the slow group. I watched faster swimmers moving ahead like dolphins. I wanted to complete this first distance, though, and was delighted when I finally managed it on my own. The following days followed a routine. I jumped in and swam to a comfortable speed. I stopped to admire the scenery. As the swims grew greater in distance, I was able to swim faster and enjoy the pleasure of completing them.<eos>"

I like my job as a flight attendant. I have been to many places, including the US and Australia. I work with great people, and I have a lot of time off. Life is always exciting, which makes it a good job for young people.

When I was a child, I went to a boarding school away from my family. I always flew unaccompanied when term began and ended. I felt lonely, so I would ask the flight attendants to let me help give out meals to passengers. Sometimes, they would let me.

I decided to become a flight attendant because I wanted to escape from my banking job and do something that was more exciting. There was a lot of young people at the interview, and many were accepted. We were all highly qualified like me, and we were changing careers.

Before the interview, I practised what to say. I mentioned my strengths and previous work experience, and I got the job. I would recommend this kind of work to anyone, as there are so many things that make it worthwhile.

When I’m not working, I don’t have to take work home. And if I do get difficult passengers, which is rare, I always know the flight will soon be over and I’ll probably never see them again.<eos>"

At the summer camp where I work, I like seeing the children succeed at things they never thought they could do. Most of the children know how to swim and play table-tennis, but rock climbing is new for them. Some children feel nervous, but after some encouragement they try and they all get to the top. This makes them feel great. We also get children who miss home at the beginning of the week. It's the older children who feel like that the most. We don't let them use their mobile phones all the time. We tell them they can phone home after lunch and after dinner. Most children are fine in a couple of days and at the end of their week's stay, they all come up to us and thank us because they have had a great time.<eos>"
