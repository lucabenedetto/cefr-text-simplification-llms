Some time ago, there was a website that talked about the risks of public check-ins. It said that if you post something online, it can be seen by a lot of people. This made people think about the downsides of sharing their lives online. The website also talked about the benefits of sharing online, such as wealth and fame.
In the early days of the web, there were people who started posting their lives online. One of these people was Justin Hall. He started a blog and people from all over the world started reading it. Hall's blog was popular because he was very open and honest about his life. However, one day Hall's blog was taken down because someone sent the address of his blog to his boss. This made Hall feel bad, but it also made him realize that the web can be a dangerous place.
Heather Armstrong is another person who has experienced the risks of sharing online. She had a blog and one day an anonymous person sent the address of her blog to her boss. This resulted in her being fired from her job. Armstrong was upset, but she also learned from her experience. She realized that the web can be a dangerous place and that we should be careful about what we post online."

A long time ago, some scientists started a campaign to warn people about a movie called What the Bleep Do We Know. The movie showed that there is a lot about the universe that we don't understand. Some people felt that the movie was dangerous and issued warnings about it. The movie was very popular, but I couldn't see what all the fuss was about at first. However, when the movie moved on to describe some of the new discoveries, I began to see what the fuss was really about. One of the discoveries was that water molecules can be affected by thoughts. I had heard rumours about this before, but the movie gave me some evidence to support it. The evidence was not very convincing, but it was enough to make me believe that the discovery was real. The movie also talked about other discoveries, such as the expansion of the universe and the nature of reality. These discoveries were even more astounding than the discovery of water molecules being affected by thoughts. Despite what some people might believe, science shows no signs of reaching completion. We appear to be further away from omniscience than ever."

Writing novels is like planting a forest, while writing short stories is more like planting a garden. The two processes complement each other, creating a complete landscape. Writing novels takes a long time and requires a lot of commitment, while writing short stories is quicker and easier to complete. You can create a story out of the smallest things and experiment with different ideas. Short stories are like guideposts to your heart, and they can make you happy as a writer."

Science is a powerful force that has greatly impacted human life. It has improved our lives and presented challenges. It has also inspired artists and thinkers. Science has its beauty and its dangers. It has been used to heal diseases and to understand the universe. However, science is not perfect. It is constantly changing and evolving. Scientists come in many colors, and their work is often characterized by conflict. The history of science is filled with examples of scientific change. Sometimes, scientific theories are overthrown and replaced by new ones. This book presents science as a series of ideas that changed the course of human thought. Science has its practical benefits, but its primary concern is not to explain non-stick frying pans. It is to explore the unknown and to understand the universe. Science has become part of the human race’s way of conceiving of and manipulating its future."

From around 2015, major publishers started to report that sales of ebooks had plateaued or even fallen in some cases. This has raised concerns about the long-term potential of ebooks in the publishing industry. Some people believe that the ebooks hype may have driven unwise investment, with companies losing confidence in the power of the word on the page. Despite the evidence, the question of whether ebooks will 'kill' the print book still continues to surface.
The idea of one medium 'killing' another has often followed the unveiling of new technologies. Even before the advent of digital technologies, critics have predicted the demise of existing media. For example, when television was invented, many people thought that radio would die. But radio ended up surviving by finding new uses.
The emergence of new technology often causes us to adjust our bond with something that has become an integral part of our day-to-day life. As a result, as technology moves on, we find ourselves longing for what we used to know, but no longer have. This is why entire industries develop around retro products and older technologies."

Every day, I wake up early, brush my teeth, and make coffee. I write about how some of the greatest minds of the past have approached their work. I want to provide a new perspective on their personalities and careers. I also write about my own struggles with creativity and productivity.
I have a lot of concerns about creative work. How do you do meaningful creative work while also earning a living? Is it better to devote yourself wholly to a project or to set aside a small portion of each day? And when there doesn’t seem to be enough time for all you hope to accomplish, must you give things up or can you learn to condense activities, to do more in less time, to ‘work smarter, not harder’, as my dad is always telling me?
I have tried to provide examples of how a variety of brilliant and successful people have confronted similar challenges. I wanted to show how grand creative visions translate to small daily increments; how one’s working habits influence the work itself, and vice versa.
This book is about people’s routines. It’s about the circumstances of creative activity, not the product; it deals with manufacturing rather than meaning. But it’s also, inevitably, personal. I have documented all of my sources in the Notes section, which I hope will also serve as a guide to further reading."

Howard became a palaeontologist because he was inspired by a rise in interest rates when he was young. He found out that he wanted to become a palaeontologist when he was at university. He studied delicate creatures revealed on the surface of grey rocks. He got a job as a palaeontologist at a college in London. He often found himself contrasting the orderly nature of his professional life with the anarchy of private concerns.
One day, Howard's briefcase was stolen. He was fuming and returned to the college. He made an explanatory phone call and postponed the lecture. He reported the theft to the appropriate authorities and then went for a restorative coffee. He joined a colleague who was entertaining a visiting curator from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. And thus it was that Howard learned of the recently acquired collection of fossils, the study of which would provide him with his greatest challenge and ensure his professional future."

Charles Spence is a Professor of Experimental Psychology at Oxford University in the UK. He has studied how the senses interact to form our perception of flavour. Through his studies, he has influenced what we eat and drink. He has also studied how the environment affects taste.
Spence has written a book called The Perfect Meal, which is packed with insights that are fascinating to anyone in possession of an appetite. It includes information about how much we eat when eating with others and how music and sound can affect taste.
Spence's lab is un-space-age. It has soundproof booths and stacks of ancient-looking audio-visual equipment. He can afford to work more creatively with cooks because he keeps his overheads low.
Spence is currently helping famous brands through reductions in salt and sugar. He points out that it is in their interests to help loyal customers stay alive for longer.
What, one wonders, are dinner parties like in the Spence household? They're all extensions of the lab to Spence."

Our brains are very busy these days. We have a lot of information to deal with, including facts, rumors, and things that are not true. We also do more things ourselves now than we used to. For example, we make our own reservations and find things in shops. We do a lot of different things at once, but it turns out that this is not multitasking. Multitasking is a powerful and dangerous illusion. It actually makes us less efficient. It also increases the production of stress hormones and makes it harder to focus. If you are trying to focus on a task while there is an unread email in your inbox, your effective IQ can be reduced by almost 10 points. Multitasking also requires decision-making, which is also very hard on our brains. We rapidly spiral into a depleted state in which we can end up making truly bad decisions about something important."

In a zoo in Sweden, a chimpanzee named Santino would sometimes break up concrete into pieces and throw them at visitors. Was he being spiteful? In caves in the US, female bats help unrelated fruit bat mothers if they can’t find the right birthing position. Are they being caring? Fifty years ago, people thought that animals didn’t have consciousness, feelings or moral systems. But recently that has partially changed. Thanks to research into the behaviour of bats, chimps, and other animals, emotions of animals have gone from being a taboo area of investigation to being tentatively explored. The new research has started a debate about whether animals can be said to have consciousness and conscience. If animals do have consciousness, what does it mean for the production and consumption of meat? The observations may not be disputed, but the interpretation of them is. Some people believe that we should stop eating meat, while others believe that we should at least re-evaluate our view of animal cognition. The debate is complex and there is no easy answer."

Critical thinking is a way of understanding what we read or listen to in a deeper way. It involves interacting with the text and thinking about the meaning of the words and ideas. There is a belief that argument is a way of finding the truth. Although technology can help us store and process information, it can also make it more difficult to think critically.
Reading enhances thinking and engages the imagination in a way that visual media such as video games and television do not. It develops imagination, induction, reflection, and critical thinking, as well as vocabulary. However, visual media can also improve some types of information processing.
Many people – particularly those who are younger – wind up underachieving and not making the most of their capabilities because of the way society views technology. It’s time to take a closer look at technology and understand the subtleties of how it affects thinking and analysis."

When Matthew Crawford is not writing or thinking about how we ought to live, he works as a motorcycle mechanic. He wrote two books about the benefits of manual trades and philosophy. One of his books is a quiet masterpiece about the benefits of the manual trades. The other book is a philosophical treatise on how to cope with modernity.
Crawford says that our attention is being pulled in many directions. We are being prevented from deciding what we want to be at the forefront of our mind. It is becoming more and more difficult to think or spend time remembering conversations we’ve had. And because everyone is trying to protect themselves from the irritation of constantly being interrupted, we close ourselves off and no longer want to do simple things like chat to strangers.
Crawford's proposed solution has two parts. First, we need regulation of noise and distraction in public space. More importantly, though, Crawford advocates skilled practices as a way of engaging with the world in a more satisfying way."

What do you do for a living? It's a common question that we use to define ourselves. As a philosopher, it's a little harder to deal with. One reason is that describing yourself as a philosopher sounds rather pretentious. Another reason is that philosophy has become increasingly removed from lived experiences. However, philosophy can also help people look a little more closely at the practices and behaviours that define their lives.

Foodies, gourmands, chefs and others who love food might expect that reflecting on what and how we eat can contribute to culinary pleasure. However, philosophical discussions of food have often been about other topics, such as the acquisition of knowledge or the pursuit of pleasure. Food is inherently social and cultural. It derives from historical contexts and is shared with those in our communities. It also brings people together and provides infrastructure for growing and distributing food. Ethical issues related to food include what we should eat and the extent to which cooking in restaurants and in the home differ. Cooking in the home is often more intimate and inclusive, while cooking for a living involves different obligations and restrictions. Food and dining can play a role in bridging cultural gaps. We can come to appreciate others by learning to enjoy their food and forge personal bonds with people from other cultures by coming together to eat."

Rob Daviau is a US-based game designer who creates legacy board games. These games are different from traditional board games because they have a permanent impact on the game. For example, in one game, players might have to rip up cards, deface the board, or open packets containing new rules. The games play out over a fixed number of sessions and long-held grudges become woven into the fabric of the game.
Legacy board games were not expected to go mainstream, but most players love the concept. They see it as one of the biggest advances in game design for several years. The appeal of an unfolding adventure trumped any concerns about longevity.
The legacy format draws on video games and the demand for episodic entertainment fuelled by popular TV series. Daviau feels a sense of ownership, but he is keen to see where others take the idea."

Once upon a time, there was an octopus named Inky who lived in New Zealand. One night, Inky managed to escape from his tank and swim across the floor to a drain that led to the ocean. It was a story that was shared online and was popular. One of the reasons why people enjoyed the story was because it was about anthropomorphism, which is like treating animals like humans. Dr. Frans de Waal is a scientist who studies primates and he believes that anthropomorphism is not accurate. He says that animals have many of the same abilities as humans, such as the ability to think about the past and the future, to demonstrate empathy, and to be self-aware. De Waal also points out that humans have a lot of negative habits, such as destroying animal habitats and polluting the environment. But he believes that we are starting to learn to appreciate animal intelligence and that we can all learn from animals."

Once upon a time, there was a technology called robotics that has the potential to change the world. Robots have already been used in the automotive and manufacturing industries for many years. Experts say that in the next few years, robots will be used in many other industries. This technology will definitely impact lower-skilled people, but it also presents an opportunity for companies to grow and create new jobs.
In order to prepare for the future, we need to invest in education and training programs. We also need to develop new regulatory frameworks to ensure our safety and privacy. With millions of jobs at risk and a worldwide employment crisis looming, it is only logical that we should turn to education to understand and prepare for the robotic workforce of tomorrow."

Because it's there, the mountaineer George Mallory is said to have said when asked why he wanted to climb Mount Everest. People have a desire to understand why anyone would participate in such a seemingly meaningless and life-threatening pursuit. Climbing can be a very confining and restricting activity, yet it can also give a feeling of freedom. There is an apparent paradox in many forms of climbing. Climbing can help cultivate important virtues such as courage, humility and respect for the environment. One further belief worth exploring is that climbers who do not rely on other people or technology to help them, have to be totally committed to their goal in order to succeed.

My grandparents' garden was a beautiful place. It was on the bank of a river and sloped gently down towards the water. You couldn’t reach the river but you could hear the sound of the water and the birds that sang in the trees above. I imagined that all gardens were like this – a place of escape, peace and solitude.
My father was a quiet and withdrawn person. He had a lot of phrases that he liked to use, one of them being 'It’s immaterial to me'. He was probably disappointed that he hadn’t made more of his life. He left school without qualifications and became apprenticed to a plumber. It was not something he was passionate about.
I always wanted to like the piano but it did its best to intimidate me. The only thing I did like about it were the two brass candlesticks that jutted out from the front. I would often spend time imagining myself playing the piano, but I never had the opportunity to learn.
I wanted out of school as soon as possible. One day my father announced, 'They’ve got a vacancy for an apprentice gardener in the Parks Department. I thought you might be interested.' In one brief moment Dad had gone against his better judgement. He might still have preferred it if I became a carpenter. But I like to feel that somewhere deep down inside him was a feeling that things might just turn out for the best. If I stuck at it."

The game design industry was once a niche hobby, but it has become a serious industry. It is not easy to get into, but it is expanding. To get into the industry, you need to make games. You can do it on your own, but it is pretty tricky. A good postgraduate course in games can help, plus provide a year or two of top-level support and guidance. If you are interested in games, you should have a healthy appetite for all areas of the arts and contemporary culture. And finally, connections can help.
The game design industry is growing rapidly. It is becoming more pervasive and accessible to a wider audience. Families frequently get involved on interactive consoles. Smart phones introduce a wealth of new games through apps, as well as social media. There is plenty of room for expansion in the games industry."

Since I was a child, I have always wanted to play football. My dad encouraged me to play, and I'm grateful that he didn't push me too hard. I had a friend who was also passionate about football, but he stopped playing and hasn't been involved in the sport since. I'm glad that I didn't have that happen to me. I have worked hard to improve my skills, and I know that with practice, anyone can achieve great things.
I also used to play other sports at school, but football was my favorite. I want to make sure that my son has the same opportunities that I had, so I'm trying to read him books even though he's far too young to sit still for long enough. I hope that he doesn't take after me in that way.
I have a lot of money, but I don't have all the answers. After I've stopped playing, I think I'll have a year off or perhaps even longer, doing the things I haven't been able to do all these years. I want to go skiing the day after I stop playing, but I can't do that now because if I were to break a leg on the ski slopes and couldn't play football again, I wouldn't be insured."

When John Maloof bought a box of old photo negatives at an estate auction, he discovered the mystery of Vivian Maier. Maier was a street photographer with a keen eye for capturing compelling images. Maloof has amassed an archive of Maier’s life and work, which includes her cameras, film, prints, negatives, movies, and audiotapes.
Maier was born in 1926 and spent much of her childhood in France. She returned to New York in 1951 and came to Chicago to work as a nanny. Maier was a private person but had a strong passion for photography. She always had a camera with her and dressed in oversized coats, broad-brimmed hats, and stout shoes.
Maier’s work is the purest form of art. None of it was done for any commercial reason. Her images lean toward women, children, the old, the poor, and the abstract. Maloof often wonders if he’ll ever work his way through all the negatives. Inspired by Maier’s architectural shots, Maloof actually went out on the street and began to take his own pictures."

When a novel is described as ambitious, it often suggests that it might not be successful. However, this is not the case with Eleanor Catton’s book, The Luminaries. The book is set during the 1860s in New Zealand. A series of crimes have been committed, and a council of 12 men has convened to solve them. The plot is complex and exciting. Catton said she set out to write a murder mystery, not a historical novel, but found the past offered more opportunities for complications and misunderstandings for her characters to deal with. The book is long, but Catton said she wanted to give each of the 20 main characters ‘a decent show’. Despite the experimental structure of The Luminaries, the book remains an exciting murder mystery with an absorbing plot."

As a boy, Jonny Kinkead loved to play the guitar. He learned to play his brother’s guitar when he was eleven and wanted to learn the bass guitar when he was sixteen. He studied guitars and figured out how different shapes and types of wood affected the sound. He also learned how to build his own instruments.
Jonny’s bass guitar turned out well, but he didn’t think of it as a career. He was also into painting and sculpture. He chose to study architecture at university but dropped out because he was too individualistic. He then realized that guitar-building is actually a type of sculpture and decided to make guitars for a living.
For the first ten years, Jonny supplemented his income by cleaning windows part-time. As he developed a reputation as one of the best guitar-makers around, he was able to charge a little more. But even now, almost forty years later, he describes what he does as ‘still scratching a living’.
Jonny believes developing a career is more straightforward for today’s new guitar-makers in the UK. He thinks new instrument-makers should do the courses on offer and learn from their mistakes."

Any conversation about English conversation often begins with the weather. It is a traditional way to start a conversation in English. The writer Dr. Johnson said that ""When two Englishmen meet, their first talk is of the weather."" This observation is still accurate today. However, most people who write about the English ""obsession"" with the weather make a mistake. They assume that our conversations about the weather are actually about the weather. This is not true. Our conversations about the weather are not really about the weather at all. They are a form of ""grooming talk.""
There are certain fixed contexts in which weather-speak is used. It can be used as a simple greeting, as an ice-breaker leading to conversation on other matters, or as a ""default"" or ""filler"" topic when conversation on other matters dries up."

The silence on Centre Court at the Wimbledon tennis championships is very peaceful. You can bounce the ball, toss it up to serve, and hit it. The trimmed grass, the rich history, the ancient stadium, the players dressed in white, and the respectful crowds all combine to create a feeling of enclosure and comfort. The quiet of the Centre Court is good for my game. It helps me to focus on the point I’m playing and to shut everything else out.
The silence is broken by a sudden noise when a point is done. There is applause, cheers, and people shouting your name. You hear them, but as if from a long way away. You don’t register that there are thousands of people watching you. You are so focused that you have no sense at all that there are millions watching you as you play Roger Federer in the 2008 Wimbledon final.
I had always dreamed of playing at Wimbledon. I had played and lost against Federer in the final the year before, and the year before that. The defeat in 2006 had not been so hard. I went out onto the court that time just pleased and grateful that I had made it that far. But my defeat in 2007 left me utterly destroyed. I knew I could have done better, that it was not my ability or the quality of my game that had failed me, but my head. I wept after that loss. I cried incessantly for half an hour in the dressing room. Losing always hurts, but it hurts much more when you have a chance and throw it away."

A young Englishwoman named Jane Goodall arrived in Africa in early 1957. She spent most of her life in Africa and became known for her work as a scientist, activist, and environmentalist.
In 1963, Jane Goodall's fame increased when the National Geographical Society produced articles and documentaries about her chimpanzee research. Her writing for a popular audience, including award-winning children’s books and the bestseller In the Shadow of Man, has also helped to reinforce her fame.
Jane Goodall's most significant contribution to science is her research on chimpanzees. She discovered that chimpanzees eat meat, use tools, and have similar emotions and social systems to humans. Her book, The Chimpanzees of Gombe, is the single most authoritative work on chimpanzee research.
Goodall's work has had a profound impact on the way humans think about themselves. She has helped to change the way we study animals and has also helped us to understand ourselves better."

Her voices are recognisable to people who have seen children’s TV and cartoons, and to people who have seen computerised employee programmes about health and safety. Shirley talks about what it takes to do voiceovers. She says that there is more to it than just being able to do funny voices. You have to bring the script to life for an audience who can’t see you. You also need to be able to create the right sounds from the back of your throat. Shirley has learned to create the right sounds and to avoid always sounding like the same child, she collects new voices as she watches children’s TV.

Twenty years ago, I was moving house and had a lot of things to get rid of. I decided to throw away an electric guitar that my dad had bought me for my 16th birthday. I felt sad about throwing it away, but I took it to the rubbish dump and was about to put it on a pile of rubbish. Suddenly, a young man came up to me and asked if I was going to throw it away. I said yes and he asked if he could have it. I gave it to him and felt sad that I had thrown it away.
A few months later, I received an email from someone I didn't know. It was from a dealer and restorer of guitars called Keith Rushton. He said he had my guitar and offered to sell it back to me. I was so happy to get my guitar back and I started playing it again.
I had forgotten all about my dad's habit of putting name-and-address stickers on everything I had, including my guitar. My dad had been very keen for me to learn the classical guitar, but I couldn't make much progress. So I switched to the electric guitar, playing undemanding stuff. Now that I'm learning it again, I guess I'll have to form a band."

It seems that people who have the hardest time sleeping are the ones who most appreciate how important sleep is. Dreams are important too. They help us find new patterns and create combinations that break through our usual habits of thinking.
When you wake up in the morning, you may have forgotten your dreams, but they can still have a positive impact on your day. If you write or create art, you may find that you are able to write or create more easily after a dream. Even if you don't write or create art, you can still benefit from dreaming.

It was twenty years ago that Susie Ray left London for a small coastal town in south-west England. She has a studio with a beautiful sea view and hangs photographs of her two daughters on the walls. Susie is a copyist artist who can reproduce the richness of an early-20th-century impressionist masterpiece as easily as the brilliance of a 16th-century Caravaggio portrait.
The problem is that Susie is in great demand. She has painted the works of numerous great artists, including Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh. Her reproductions are so faithful that art experts mistake them for the originals.
Susie has always been open about what she does. When she reproduces an old masterpiece, she will make it look as authentic as possible. However, she will put her own signature on the back of the canvas.
When younger painters approach Susie for advice, she stresses the importance of learning to draw and to represent things accurately. She also emphasises how much she’s studied to be able to do what she does."

When she was on land, life felt trivial. She often wanted to be back on the ocean, testing herself against the forces of nature. After she came second in a big race, she took you down into her boat and showed you how she prepared for the race. She talked about the careful planning that had gone into provisioning and housekeeping. The boat was her world and she looked after it because her life depended on it. Now, she sees the world as a boat: a small, beautiful, damageable thing whose supplies are running out. She has been working to save the planet.

Jordan Romero is 13 years old and wants to be the youngest person to climb Mount Everest. If he succeeds, he could become one of the most famous teenagers of his generation. Young people are spending more time on computers and games consoles, so Jordan hopes to inspire kids to climb their own mountains. He also wants to inspire kids to venture outdoors. Jordan’s team for the climb includes his father, Paul, and mother, Karen. They call themselves 'Team Romero.' If Jordan can climb Everest and Vinson Massif in Antarctica, he will become the youngest person to have climbed the Seven Summits. Few people achieve this under the age of thirty. Jordan has already climbed five of the Seven Summits and might actually do it before his teenage years are over.
There are some concerns about Jordan’s climb. Many people think that it is not a good idea to take a young child up such a dangerous mountain. They worry about the emotional strength and experience of a teenager. However, Jordan’s parents believe that their own experience as climbers will help them to guide their son safely. They also believe that watching Jordan develop will give them confidence.
Jordan is motivated by his goal of becoming the youngest person to climb Mount Everest. He is also motivated by the fact that every adventure is blogged about and every climb turns into a record-setting challenge. However, Jordan also knows that achievement too often replaces enjoyment during such challenges. If he wants to inspire others, he has to play the media game and offer something spectacular."

When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, it's probably not classical music they're listening to. Most people our age can name a lot of pop groups, but few of us know who Brahms was. I started doing a music degree, but the people on my course know no more about classical music than anyone else. If you don’t know who wrote the music, you are unlikely to own any recordings of their work. Classical music just doesn’t hold much attraction for most people, and that is particularly true of teenagers. There are a few reasons why teenagers don’t like classical music. First, the pace and rhythm of classical music are not ideal for us. We like to talk fast, play fast, and think fast. Second, classical music is structurally complex and requires time and concentration to appreciate. Third, the subject matter of classical music is not as appealing to us as pop music. Finally, the way we listen to music has changed. Nowadays, we can find any music we want at the click of a mouse, and the sound track to our lives is rarely classical."

I met Cody Simpson before. He is a 15-year-old Australian singer who has released a number of successful songs. He started singing when he was seven years old. One day, he posted videos of himself singing on the internet. These videos changed everything. He began getting lots of comments from fans asking for more videos. So, Cody started recording more videos at home. The responses to his videos were overwhelming. He was very talented at swimming, but he decided to focus on his music career. He moved to the US to pursue his dream. He is successful now, but he knows that his fame will not last forever.

I woke up early and looked at the river. The ice was shining in the sunlight. I helped my grandfather to protect the buildings from flooding. I worked with many people in the town to lift the sandbags. It was a lot of work, but I was able to do it. My grandfather didn’t notice me much. I saw a boy on the river bank. He was trying to balance on an ice shelf. I was worried about him. I put on my wetsuit and jacket and went to the river. I found a lucky chain that my grandfather gave me. It is a special chain. I kept it close to me. I went to the kitchen and ate breakfast. My mom smiled at me. She said that I was up early for a Saturday. I went downstairs and stepped outside.

Mum caught Jess by the arm and asked her to come with her to the study. There was a painting on the table. It was one of Grandpa’s, but it was unlike anything he had done before. The picture was strange and beautiful. There was a river in the picture. It was not a real river, but it was a fantasy river. The riverbank was green. There were no animals or people in the picture. It felt right that way. There seemed no place for living things in this remote vision. Yet, Jess was captivated. She thought of the coming of autumn after a long, rich summer. Mum spoke again. The painting had a name. It was called 'River Boy.' The words seemed to carry a strange resonance. Jess knew what Grandpa’s response would have been. He would have said that painting is hard enough work as it is without having to explain every picture to everyone. And he would have said that artists should not have to explain their pictures to every Tom, Dick, and Harry who came along."

When I woke up this morning, I didn't mean to damage the carpet. It just seemed like a good idea at the time, as things so often do. I was trying to find a way of fitting my corner cabinet into a corner. Gran had given me the cabinet when she moved out of her house into a flat. It's really cute! I keep my collection of shells and fossils and interesting stones there.
The problem was, the cabinet was too tall. If I could only slice a couple of centimetres off the bottom of it... That was when it came to me. If I couldn't slice anything off Gran’s cabinet, how about cutting a hole in the carpet? It just seemed like the obvious solution. What Dad calls lateral thinking. I reckoned he would be quite pleased with me. He is always telling us to ‘think outside the box’. And that was exactly what I was doing!"

The novel 'The Borrowers' is about a family of tiny people who live hidden in the walls and floors of a house. They secretly borrow things from the normal-sized people in order to survive. When the author asked me to direct a TV adaptation of the novel, I knew it was going to be hard to live up to people’s expectations. The most important thing was getting the scale right. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans, so I had to make sure that the actors looked small. I also had to get the costumes right. The costumes were made out of heavy canvas material so that they stuck out in the way that dolls’ clothes do. Unfortunately, the weather was really hot during filming. But it all came together in the end, and I think the series was pretty successful in conveying the magic of the books."

Mom pulled to a stop at the corner of my new school, Palm Grove High School. She looked around nervously, looking for journalists that weren’t there. I told her everything was going to be fine. She kissed her fingertip and touched my cheek right before I got out of the car. Then she was off, leaving me alone with this whole new school and situation to deal with.
I walk in the school’s main office and get my schedule. English Literature, first period. Cool, I can deal with that. But I’m late. English is in Room 214, second floor. I studied the map the night before, as I didn’t want to look like a complete buffoon searching for my classes.
When I get to the door, I hear the teacher already taking roll. I slip in undetected and slide into the last desk in the second row. The girl next to me smiles. She scans over my very normal and, might I add, very clever outfit – jeans and a T-shirt. Ha! Nobody will ever suspect me now!
The teacher pauses in the roll taking. ‘Desert... McGraw?’ she says hesitantly. ‘Here.’ The teacher then smiles and introduces herself as Ms. Smigla. She talks a lot and eventually hands us our course outlines. After we review them and she tells us all about books we’re required to read this year, she actually gives us time to socialize!

In the United States, teenage girls are expected to be Student Council presidents and have part-time jobs, volunteer, and excel in all of these fields. Being an American teenager today is challenging. Teenagers have a lot of homework, tests, and extra-curricular activities, jobs, chores, and responsibilities at home. They also have to maintain a social life. Despite these stresses, teenagers still face negative stereotypes. Some people believe that teenagers are lazy, disrespectful, and rebellious. However, this is not always the case. Many teenagers are hardworking and dedicated to their studies and their communities.
Teenagers today have a lot of technology at their disposal. They can take their work on the go and do their homework wherever they are. They can also use technology to connect with friends and family. This has made it easier for teenagers to stay connected and organized. However, it has also created new challenges. Teenagers today have to be available 24/7, which can lead to sleep deprivation and other problems.
Despite the challenges, teenagers today are still making a positive impact on the world. They are taking the initiative to volunteer, start businesses, and make their communities better. They are also using their technology to connect with others and learn new things. In 20 years, it is likely that the stereotype of teenagers will have changed, but one thing is for sure, teenagers will continue to prove that they are capable of great things."

The teenage members of the Earth to Sky Calculus Club live in Bishop, a mountain town in the US, surrounded by wilderness. They have launched over fifty balloons to the edge of space. It's a long-running science project that includes astronomy experiments and backcountry adventures. I joined them one weekend in late spring. They were releasing a high-altitude balloon, hoping to record shooting stars.
As it got dark, the teenagers secured a soft insulated lunch box to the bottom of the balloon. Inside was a camera, an instrument to measure altitude, and a thermometer. Two GPS trackers were mounted on the outside of the lunch box to help the group find it later. They used a gas tank to inflate the balloon and watched it ascend.
After the launch, most of the students went home, but a few stayed to watch the shooting stars. They lay on blankets on the mountainside and gazed at a sky so clear, it was hard to believe you're just four hours from Los Angeles.
It took them 11 hours to find the lunch box. It was in a canyon, high on a flat rock, in the middle of a cascading waterfall. The camera hadn't recorded any shooting stars. Sure, it's a bit of a disappointment, but it's also a perfect opportunity to argue over the effects of atmospheric waves, and how they might work above mountain ridges."

Chloe Morgan is a palaeontologist who has a passion for her work. She started her journey into Palaeontology when she was fifteen, inspired by her younger brother's interest. She felt that the subject was not common for young people at that time. Despite her initial nervousness, she met a friendly palaeontologist named Matt Cornelius who showed her patience and willingness to listen.
Chloe's job is varied and includes digging up dinosaur bones, analysing fossils, and writing scientific publications. She also takes the time to communicate her findings to the public, particularly young people. She believes that it is important to clear up misconceptions about science and to inspire others to appreciate the natural world.
Walking with Dinosaurs, a recent TV documentary, was a great opportunity for Chloe to influence the way dinosaurs are portrayed on screen. She was able to provide advice on the accuracy of the dinosaurs depicted in the programme. The documentary was successful in attracting audiences of all ages because of its accurate portrayal of dinosaurs and its ability to spark interest in the subject.
Why does Chloe feel dinosaurs continue to fascinate us? She believes that dinosaurs speak to our innate explorer instincts and that they remind us that there is still more to be discovered in the world."

One of the most interesting developments in further and higher education in the UK has been the move to encourage novice students to become involved with research as early as possible. Research is not an exclusive activity for established scholars or scientists. It can also be seen as a natural and fundamental way to build knowledge and skills.
Research approaches and skills will be useful not only in your studies but also in employment. They are ways of thinking about the world and ways of going about your own work. As a student, you make a contribution to knowledge. You do not just digest and repeat it, you make it. Making knowledge is based on asking questions, rather than taking things for granted.
Most students have always been a researcher of sorts. You will have been carrying out some elements of research for projects and answered questions at school or in the workplace since your first few days there. You will also have been developing research and enquiry approaches and skills when exploring where to go on holiday, how to grow seeds successfully, how to fix things around the house, how to train your dog, how to find the right kind of music system, and how to buy the right kind of items for your needs online.
Critical thinking is particularly important in research. We need to be able not just to repeat what we’ve read and take everything in as if it was proven fact, but to engage with it, think about it, test it out, identify whether what we’re being told is presented in such a way as to trick us into agreement, or whether it is logical, reasoned and backed by evidence."

Cities have always been centers of intellectual activity. They have been places where people gather to discuss ideas and share their thoughts. However, city life is not always easy. It can be exhausting and overwhelming. Scientists have found that cities actually dull our thinking, sometimes dramatically so. One of the main reasons for this is the lack of nature in cities. Studies have shown that people who can see trees from their windows recover more quickly from illness. Even small glimpses of nature improve brain performance.
In recent years, it has become clear that living in cities has a number of negative effects on our mental and physical health. These effects include fatigue, stress, and depression. However, there is also evidence that living in cities can have some positive effects on our creativity and innovation.
The key to mitigating the psychological damage of the metropolis while maintaining its unique benefits is to find ways to integrate nature into city life. This can be done through a variety of methods, such as creating more parks and green spaces, and making it easier for people to access nature."

The mind is a complex and mysterious phenomenon. It is often thought to reside within the brain. However, there is evidence to suggest that the mind extends beyond the skull. Stone objects, body ornaments, engravings, clay tokens, and writing systems have played an active role in human evolution and the making of the human mind. They are cognitive extensions of the human body.
The mind and the brain are often equated. Most of what we know about the human mind has been uncovered through isolating people from the material culture they are usually surrounded by in order to study them. This approach often goes unnoticed that much of our thinking takes place outside our heads.
The human mind is an unfinished project. It is constantly evolving and changing. It is important to keep in mind that whatever form the mind might take, its primary function is to help us understand and interact with the environment.
This approach sees the human mind as an unfinished project, in a permanent state of on-going evolution. It is important to keep in mind that, whatever actual form the 'stick' might have taken in the history of our species – from the earliest Palaeolithic stone tools to the internet – its primary function was that of a pathway instead of a boundary."

Photography has significantly changed the course of civilization and the way we perceive the world. It has been especially impactful in the United States, where photography became an integral part of American culture at all levels. Historians believe that photography is arguably the country’s greatest single contribution to the visual arts. It has moved to the centre of US intellectual and aesthetic discourse.
There are several reasons why photography was so appealing to the Americans. Firstly, it was a mechanical process that matched the growing enthusiasm for technology. Secondly, the camera was the perfect tool for representing oneself and creating a public image in a country where individuality was highly valued. Thirdly, photography was a way of documenting family memories and creating a shared history. Finally, the photograph’s inherent realism was aesthetically pleasing.
Photography has also been used by artists in a variety of ways. For example, Andy Warhol used photographs in his paintings and multiples. Artists have incorporated photographs into their work to express themselves creatively and to document events. Photography has become an indispensable accessory to painting and has integrated seamlessly with our notions of representation."

In 1890, William James, an American philosopher and physician, defined psychology as the 'science of mental life.' This definition is still a good starting point for understanding psychology today. We all have a mental life and therefore have some idea about what this means. However, even though the concept can be studied in rats and monkeys as well as humans, it remains a somewhat elusive one.
Psychology is about the mind or brain, but psychologists do not understand nearly enough about its workings to be able to comprehend the part that it plays in the experience and expression of our hopes, fears, and wishes, or in our behaviour during experiences as varied as giving birth or watching a football match.
The endeavour of psychology is much like that involved in solving a crossword puzzle. It involves evaluating and interpreting available clues. Complex interactions are the norm rather than the exception in psychology, and understanding them depends on the development of sophisticated techniques and theories.
Psychology has the same goals as any other science: to describe, understand, predict, and learn how to control or modify the process that it studies. Once these goals have been achieved, it can help us to understand the nature of our experience and come to conclusions that can be applied directly to people’s lives."

Everyone knows that sports teams have an advantage when they play at home. But does anyone know why? Most of us probably think we do; after all, it seems obvious. But professional sport is changing faster than at any time in its history and much of what we used to take for granted is now open to question.
There are two main reasons why home advantage exists. First, the home team has the advantage of playing in front of their own crowd, which can give them a boost of energy and confidence. Second, the home team has the benefit of being able to make adjustments to the game plan based on the crowd's reaction.
However, there are some changes that have recently occurred that have made home advantage less effective. For example, travel has become more convenient and the top grounds increasingly resemble one another in their soulless efficiency. As a result, the impact of playing at home has declined in all major sports.
Despite these changes, there is still some evidence to suggest that home advantage still exists. For example, researchers found that the players’ testosterone levels were higher before home matches than they were before training sessions or away matches. This sense of territoriality may be connected to some primitive urge to defend home turf against interlopers."

The more I practice, the luckier I get, said Gary Player. This quote is famous and is valued by athletes and coaches worldwide. However, there are some arguments about the source of the quote and its meaning. Player didn't literally mean lucky, he was speaking ironically. His real message was: 'The more I practice, the better I get.' Up to a point.
The debate about whether talent is born or acquired is at the heart of the nature-nurture debate. However, it would be wrong to describe it as a debate; that would imply balance. Instead, the discussion has seemed as uneven as a basketball game between giants and dwarves: nurture has been victorious.
There are some flaws in much of the work looking into what makes excellent people excellent. It tends to focus on excellent people and not on the factors that make them excellent.

A recent report found that many children living in wealthy countries feel lonely and unhappy. The reason for this is that these children have been spending too much time indoors, watching TV or playing on computers, and have lost contact with the natural world. This has led to a decline in their overall well-being.
A follow-up study found that the majority of children would be happier if they could go outside more. Many adults also talk nostalgically about the freedom of their own youth, when they spent more time playing outside. However, they rarely stop to reflect that they are the ones who have imposed that protective regime on their own children.

I am a research bio-psychologist with a PhD. I have done a lot of school and I am a good problem-solver. However, my schooling has not helped me much with the problems I face in life. Most problems in life cannot be solved with a formula or memorized answers. They require the judgement, wisdom and creative ability that come from life experiences.
Play is the natural means by which adults and mammals have always educated themselves. It is also important for children's development. All mammals, including humans, play when they are young. Children who have the most to learn play the most.
Play is a voluntary activity. It means that players are always free to quit. If you can't quit, it's not play. The power to quit is what makes play the most democratic of all activities.
School has become more onerous and adults have replaced play with adult-directed sports and interventions. Our children don’t need more school. They need more play. If we care about our children and future generations, we must reverse the horrid trend that has been occurring over the past half century. We must give childhood back to children."

In many countries, there are a lot of young people in their twenties who use social media to find work. There are two popular social networking sites that are often used for job hunting: Twitter and LinkedIn. These sites offer the chance for direct contact with potential employers. However, with greater access comes a greater chance to make mistakes. For example, a young jobseeker in the US contacted a senior marketing executive via LinkedIn. The marketing executive was not impressed by the young jobseeker's message and sent a rude rejection note. This incident has made people think more carefully about how they use social media in a professional capacity.
There are a few things you should do when you are using social media for job hunting. First, you should explain clearly who you are and what you have to offer. Second, you should refrain from sending impersonal, blanket emails. Third, you should keep the tone humble if you want to avoid leaving a sour taste in the recipient's mouth."

Newspapers have been struggling in recent years. Their circulation has fallen significantly, and they are no longer the main source of news for most people in the US. Some people predict that newspapers will soon be extinct, but history has shown that old media have a habit of surviving. Newspapers were once new media, and they have survived many challenges.
Today, there are many ways to get news online. You can read articles, watch videos, and listen to podcasts. You can also follow your friends on social media to get the latest news. Newspapers have some advantages over online news sources, such as their ability to provide in-depth reporting and analysis. However, online news sources also have some advantages over newspapers, such as their ability to provide more timely and personalized news.
Overall, the future of newspapers is uncertain. It is possible that they will continue to decline in popularity, or it is possible that they will adapt to the changing landscape of news consumption. However, one thing is for sure: newspapers have played an important role in history, and they continue to have a valuable place in the modern world."

If humans were truly at home under the light of the moon and stars, we would go in darkness happily. Instead, we are diurnal creatures, with eyes adapted to living in the sun’s light. We have engineered the night to receive us by filling it with light. This kind of control is no different from the feat of damming a river. Light pollution is largely the result of bad lighting design. It washes out the darkness of night, altering light levels and light rhythms to which many forms of life, including ourselves, have adapted.
Light pollution has a negative impact on many aspects of life. It affects migration, reproduction, feeding, and our biological well-being. Denying darkness is futile. It is as essential to maintaining our biological welfare as light itself. The regular oscillation of waking and sleep in our lives is nothing less than a biological expression of the regular oscillation of light on Earth. So fundamental are these rhythms to our being that messing with them is akin to altering our center of gravity.
Living in a glare of our own making, we have cut ourselves off from our evolutionary and cultural heritage – the light of the stars and the rhythms of day and night. In a very real sense, light pollution causes us to lose sight of our true place in the universe, to forget the scale of our being, which is best measured against the dimensions of a deep night with the Milky Way arching overhead."

A company recently announced that it will no longer track its employees’ paid holiday time. The founder of the company was inspired by an internet company that has implemented a similar policy. The company has 50,000 employees and provides a variety of services. The founder stated that employees can take as much leave as they want, as long as they feel comfortable that their absence will not damage the business. However, there are concerns about the practicality of this policy. For example, it could lead to increased guilt and stress for employees, which could in turn lead to a decrease in productivity. Additionally, it could lead to pressure from colleagues and office gossip, and could make it difficult for employees to take their rightful leave. Overall, the author remains doubtful as to whether being able to take as much holiday as you want is the true intention or the probable outcome of this policy."

Journal-based peer review is a process that ensures the quality of scientific research papers. It is often praised for preventing the publication of flawed or nonsensical papers. However, the process can also be time-consuming, sometimes delaying the publication of a paper by a year. Despite its drawbacks, journal-based peer review remains essential for ensuring the trustworthiness of published literature.
Preprints, which are drafts of papers that are posted online without having been peer reviewed, are a growing trend in scientific publishing. They bring academics back to the core of research publication, which is the rapid dissemination of new results. Preprints also enable informal scientific discussions and provide a platform for negative results.
The widespread adoption of preprints could have a significant impact on scientific publishing. It could help to reduce the time it takes for papers to be published, make it easier for researchers to share their work, and increase the visibility of negative results. By harnessing the web's culture of openness and accessibility, preprints have the potential to improve the overall quality of scientific research."

When I ask my students about poems, they often give me answers like ""a painting in words."" Their answers rarely satisfy me or them. One day I asked a group to choose an object and write one paragraph describing it empirically, as a scientist might, and another in the first person, from the point of view of the item itself. The exercise led to much amusement and useful discussion.
A poem is a thing made. Poets sometimes compare poems to wild animals or machines. But such comparisons fall apart upon closer analysis. The most productive thing about trying to define a poem through comparison lies not in the comparison itself but in the debate. A poem is a product of writing and rewriting just like an article, story, or novel. It never really becomes what they usually are – a thing created in order to become a commodity.
A poem is a thing that can surprise, if only for a moment. It is a home for deep feelings, stunning images, tender reflections and/or biting wit. It can also be a source of inspiration and creativity."

Sleeping is one of my favorite travel experiences. I love to sleep when I travel, even though I sometimes feel a little guilty about it. When I travel, I often have long naps and lazy mornings. I also find that sleep is more intense when I am on the road. It's like an extension of my travels, not a pause or respite from them. When I travel, I open myself up to new sights, sounds, smells, and ways of being. New and unfamiliar stuff pours into me – cultures, music, landscapes, even ways of moving through space. It is when sleeping that I wade through this overwhelming river of stimuli. No wonder, then, that sleep becomes so much more intense when I am on the road.

It was her thirtieth birthday today and they were having a family get-together. Mia was looking forward to seeing Jen and her family. She was also looking forward to meeting the friend Jen was bringing with her.

Lawrence Okoye is a young athlete who moved from London to Atlanta in the United States. He has a long journey from his Olympic final in the discus to the brink of another transformation. Despite never having played American football before, Lawrence appears likely to be picked for one of the major USA teams.
In Atlanta, Lawrence is still working out the exact responsibilities of his unfamiliar position. He is excited about the opportunity to play in the NFL, but he also knows that it will be a challenge.
Lawrence has a lot of talent and he is determined to make his dream come true. He is not nervous about the competition or the pressure of playing in such a big league. He is confident that he can do well.
After his Olympic disappointment, there was speculation that Lawrence had allowed a momentous occasion to diminish him. However, Lawrence refuses to comment on this. He is focused on his goal and he is not letting anything stand in his way."

I was flying east all night and woke up to see that it was already daylight. The landscape below was empty and I could see no sign of human life. The view was beautiful and rolled away in an otherworldly blend of mountains, streams and forests to an endless horizon. I shook my head and smiled at my neighbour who woke up and smiled at me. He was a salesman from Moscow who was flying to the outer limits of civilisation in order to sell safety clothing to the local mining industries. His English was not very good, but I managed to explain to him that I was flying to the far-eastern Siberian city of Magadan. He was concerned about me riding alone and pointed out that there was no road from Magadan. I explained that I had reason to believe that there was a road, though not many people used it these days. We talked for a while and I gave him a note to my friend Al. He agreed to join me on the trip and we started planning the details.
This was six years later that I was going to join Al in Siberia. I was working as a geography teacher and I was still far from having full control of my classes, but I was happy with the job. It was frequently challenging, rarely boring, often fulfilling and, of course there were great long holidays in which to chase adventures. I had been using these holidays to go to meet Al and he had been setting himself greater and greater challenges. This round-the-world-by-bike trip was certainly his greatest so far. He thought that the ride would break him, but he did it. He was having an extraordinary adventure and I envied him in many ways. He was proving wrong the sceptics who had told him he could not do it. He was doing something that scared him nearly every day and it made him feel alive."

In the Red Bull Air Race, twelve pilots race through a series of pylons between 15 and 25 meters high. They negotiate sharp turns, barrel rolls and loops at speeds of up to 370 km per hour. I was invited to find out what it feels like to take part. I had to sign two forms before the flight. The first confirmed that I was in good health, the second that I would empty all my pockets. I also learned that I would have to try to stay orientated throughout the flight. I was told to relax and enjoy the view. Half an hour before the flight, I had a safety briefing in which I was told not to touch anything. By the time we were taxiing down the runway, I was ready to fly. I ignored all instructions received and would not relax and enjoy the flight. This is the cruel paradox of high-speed acrobatic flying. In order to survive it without passing out, you have to keep calm and focused. You have to tense up at the right time and you have to relax at the right time. Panicking is a bad idea. The flight was over in 10 minutes. It had been 'soft' compared to what the pilots endure when they race.

Doug Allan is a wildlife cameraman who films wild animals in cold places. If you have ever been amazed by footage of polar bears in a nature documentary, it's probably been filmed by him. Allan trained as a marine biologist and commercial diver. Diving was his first passion, where he learned about survival in cold places. His big break came when a TV crew turned up in Antarctica, where Allan was working, to film a wildlife documentary.
Allan says that wildlife filming is full of great successes, but also failures and embarrassments. Once, he was in the Orkneys to film kittiwakes. Unfortunately, he could not identify which birds they were.
Now Allan would like to make his own film about climate change in the Arctic, talking to the people who live there and experience the impact of it first hand. He says he would be able to make an extraordinary documentary."

In 2004, Pen Hadow became the first person to trek to the North Pole alone and without being resupplied on the way. He faced extreme cold waters, frostbite, and polar bears. He also made it to the South Pole the same year. Now he is back in the Arctic preparing for an expedition he says is even more ambitious.
Pen is a skilled explorer who has a lot of physical endurance. He was trained for this type of adventure by his nanny who was also a polar explorer. Pen is married to Mary, a horsewoman, who says he has a 'spine of steel'. They live in the country with their two children.
Pen is going to the North Pole to collect data about the ice. Scientists will use this data to learn more about global warming. Pen believes his mission reconnects exploration with the search for knowledge that drove previous generations into the unknown.

I had a break from my training. I was going to do something else. Being a successful Olympian is a great thing. I had the chance to do more writing and TV work, and to speak to businesses and schools. But there wasn’t anything on the horizon to get my competitive teeth into. I knew that I wished to stay in shape, so that I would be in a position to fight for an Olympic place if that dream reignited within me. So I entered marathons and triathlons. That should have been enough, but there was still the TV presenter Ben Fogle’s nagging invitation at the back of my mind. I spoke to some of my rowing colleagues about whether they fancied the race; I didn’t receive any enthusiastic responses. I knew that if I entered the race, even though it is billed primarily as an adventure, I would want to win. Would doing it with Ben give me the best chance of winning it? No. There was part of me that thought the chance to be an underdog with no pressure was appealing. I got in contact with Ben. We spoke about the remaining costs of the race. We felt we stood a better chance than most, but it would still take work to secure it. Of course, I also had to take into account the loss of earnings that would result from being away from home. I had to weigh up the pros and cons of doing the race. I decided to do it. I learned a lot while planning this adventure, but one of the biggest lessons was to be thankful for the easy life of a full-time athlete.

Last year, I went to the Arctic Circle in Finland to work with huskies. I was restless and dreamed of Arctic landscapes. I found a small company run by Anna and Pasi. They agreed to take me on as a husky dog handler for the winter season. From December to February, there is plenty of business taking tourists out on sled rides. The work is very physical and the hours are long. I started packing straight away.
When I arrived at the farm, I was handed a pair of boots and turned out into the cold. I followed the sound of barking and joined the team of huskies. I was able to learn the basics of dog-sledding quickly, but everything else seemed to be very complicated. The work was difficult, but I was triumphant. I emailed my friends and told them I could chop with an axe, hammer a nail, and use a circular saw in the snow."

On that day, Radcliffe sprinted past the finish line. Her time would have qualified her to compete in the men's marathon at the world championships in Paris. Journalists asked her about the benefits of emu oil, a product that Olympic gold medallist, Cathy Freeman, had recommended. Radcliffe insists that her achievement never really sank in. She felt that it was what she was going to do that day and so it just sort of flowed over her. During the race, her husband and coach, Gary Lough, was in a car with her support team, listening to the radio coverage. With 800m left to run, Radcliffe began to calculate. She finished the race in under 2 hours 16 minutes. Many people were surprised by her performance. After the race, everyone wanted to know how an athlete who ran with such an awkward style had beaten the grace and skill of the East African runners.

When I first started my cookery programme, I was not sure how it would be received. There had been a lot of talk about the food revolution in Britain, and I was certain that we had produced a series of programmes that made a genuinely innovative contribution to that. I watched the first programme and was pleased to see that it was well-received. The success of the show paved the way for other fascinating projects, including a book based on my experiences at the restaurant I own. In each project, there is a sense of being on a journey. I wrote several books in a series called 'Perfection', each one accompanying its own TV programme of the same name. In these books, the journey was often a very physical one, with passports and suitcases and itineraries. The latest book in the series is called 'In Search of Total Perfection'. It is a book about the pursuit of perfection in food and cooking. Perfection is subjective. Even the seemingly simple task of choosing which dishes to include in the series turned out to be a nightmare. Despite the book’s title, I knew from the outset that I wouldn’t be claiming the recipes were in any way ‘definitive’. But I reckoned that, by using my technical skill and scientific knowledge, I could pin down some of the things that made these dishes work."

We were driving to Marrakech when the van broke down and crashed into a field. John got out and opened the hood of the car. He stood there for a long time looking at the engine. He said, ""Actually, I haven’t a clue what I’m doing."" Mum and I started to laugh. The field was big and there was nothing much in it. There was grass and flowers. Bea was worried, ""We can’t stay here forever."" I agreed. We got back into the van and waited for Mum and John to stop laughing. We sat on the side of the road and watched John walk away. Mum stretched out on the grass. She asked me to tell her a story. I told her about the birds I heard the day before we left London. The story was long and I was tired, but I told it anyway. We stayed at the café all day. John was sad because he thought the hotel might be expensive. But Mum reassured him that they would have tea. We sat down in the shade of the terrace and drank tea. It was very sweet. We stayed at the café all day. When it began to grow dark, Mum made an open-air bed for us in the hotel garden. It was nice to go to sleep on the ground. We followed John into the tiled café. It was set back from the road and not far from where our van was parked. We sat down in the shade of the terrace and drank tea. We stayed at the café all day.

Lucy was talking to two other pianists at the Prague Classical Music Festival. They were older than her and good enough English speakers. They talked about the pieces they were playing, where else they’d travelled recently, and where they were going next.
Lucy had not wanted to go to the festival, but she had made it. Her dad bought her a white-gold necklace with an L pendant to congratulate her. Her little brother Gus got all caught up in imagining himself at the same festival one day.
Her teacher took her out for a special dinner to strategize a repertoire. The thing was, Lucy hadn’t even applied. Her mom had filled out the form and sent in the CD.
In the elevator to their suite after they’d left the party, her grandfather turned to her. ‘You did well in there, Lucy. I’m proud of you. This is an important festival, and there’s a buzz about you. They all know who you are.’"

It's not good to spend too much time online. You need to get out into the real world, said Dad. He's difficult to argue with, so I decided to find out what people who have studied the subject say – and it's quite interesting. Generally, research shows that most teenagers who use social media have a wide circle of real-life friends, a good sense of identity and belonging, and are developing the essential technical skills we need to be citizens of a digital age.
Social networking has become an integral part of modern childhood. Teenagers don’t consume media like adults do – they inhabit it. It performs a similar function to hanging around at the youth club, as today’s parents used to do when they were younger. It can help teenagers develop a sense of identity, deal with teenage issues and get on with their peers.
Embracing social media can help if you’re not outgoing or have a specialized interest. It can also help you if you’re a quiet person and want to connect with others who share your interests. If you're one of only three people in your school who’s into a particular type of music, traditionally you would have felt quite isolated. But if you discover a social networking group of like-minded people, there’s suddenly a necessary critical mass and you can still be popular, just in a different context."

When most people think of a family vacation, I guess a road trip through the western states in the US and a Canadian province doesn’t come to mind. However, my parents clearly weren’t looking to put their feet up as they organized our summer vacation this year. My dad seemed to have taken it upon himself to plan the ultimate family bonding trip. We packed a lot of stuff into the car, including suitcases, coolers, and clothing. We set off on our journey, which was called 'The Family Great American Road Trip'. As we drove west, we had many adventures. We stopped at a town in Oklahoma under the darkest star-filled skies. We learned the rule of the road: cattle get the right-of-way. We also visited Pagosa Springs, Colorado, and learned that what are marked as Jeep roads are best left to Jeep drivers. We drove on to Yellowstone National Park and watched the setting sun cast its shadows over bear habitats close to the roads. We had a close encounter with a bear and made some unforgettable memories. After watching a rainstorm blow through, we made our free-fall back south again. I knew that for me, the things I’d remember would be the unplanned, the spontaneous."

Rose Frost was sixteen years old and was going to live with her grandmother, Daisy. Her family was separating for two years. Her father had an assignment overseas, and her mother would be joining him, but Rose and her sister Amy were staying in England. Amy was completing her final school courses and would be living under the guardianship of the college Head. It was her last year at school, so it would have been unfair on Amy to move. To Amy’s delight, she had been given the best room at the college, with its own kitchen and study area. The free access to the Internet and phone had also not gone unnoticed. Rose was moving to her grandmother’s house. It was only vague holiday memories that Rose recalled of her grandmother, and she had never known her grandfather. Her parents had not been enthused by the idea of her living with her grandma, but Daisy had insisted that it was no trouble. Rose was sensible and very mature for her age. She knew about healthy eating, about keeping fit, and getting enough sleep. But this time Rose had insisted on one thing: she wanted her independence. Living with Daisy would be fulfilling all her needs, but Rose wanted to play music loud if she wanted, and to invite friends over or go out without having to ask permission every time. Daisy had understood. They had all agreed that from now on, it would be about trust.

Our instructor, Gareth, taught us that speed is our friend, not our enemy. We looked down the ski slope and saw David, a skilled freestyle skier, push forward. He flew upwards, arms flailing in the air. We held our breath as he landed head-first into the snow. Gareth informed us that speed is an unpredictable beast. I had never tried freestyle skiing before, but I decided to give it a go. I practised my moves indoors and headed outside to try them for real. There were some setbacks, but I finally landed properly. I felt like I was walking on air.

Imagine you're riding a rollercoaster in an amusement park. You come to a stop and inhale sharply before the carriage starts moving slowly upwards. A pause. Then there is a sharp drop and your stomach is suspended in the air. You hurtle quickly forwards, sharply left, and upside down. You let out a roar of fear that comes from the pit of your gut.
Amusement parks are a huge industry that delivers thrills and escape from reality. To create the perfect ride, there are teams of highly inventive engineers and designers. The skill of rollercoaster design is in compiling the pieces and creating a strong narrative.
In the end, gut instincts, years of experience, and trial-and-error are what work for rollercoaster designers. New technology can add a veneer, but the physical coaster experience will remain king for many years to come."

At 25, Miranda Ellington has achieved a lot as a choreographer. She creates works for many theatres and dance companies. She also dances from time to time. It's surprising to her that she can fit both activities into her busy schedule.
As a choreographer, Miranda is in a teaching role. She enjoys working with young students. She finds it easier to work with students than with professionals because they're open to trying new ideas. They're hungry for success, but they don't yet have a clear sense of their strengths and weaknesses.
When Miranda starts working with a new group, she concentrates on the dance steps and the music dictates what she does. If dancers aren’t responding well to a particular composer’s music, that can be frustrating, but she still has to find solutions.
Miranda doesn’t believe in attaching herself to one institution. She has to be prepared to adapt the way she works each time she goes somewhere new.
The conversation turns to the recent documentary on professional ballet dancers and choreographers. Miranda says that the documentary gives a realistic portrayal of life inside a dance company.
Miranda has done a wide range of work. She doesn’t like to be labeled or restricted to one area of expertise. She wants to widen her horizons."
