Some time ago, there was a website that talked about the risks of public check-ins. It said that if you post something online, it can be seen by a lot of people. This made people think about the downsides of sharing things online. The website also talked about the benefits of sharing things online, such as wealth and fame.
There are a lot of people who share things online. Some people use the web to share their personal photos and stories. Others use the web to share their thoughts and opinions. Some people even use the web to sell their products or services.
If you share things online, you should be aware of the risks. If you post something online, it can be seen by a lot of people. You should also be aware of the potential consequences of sharing things online. If you make a mistake, it could have a negative impact on your life."

A long time ago, some scientists started a campaign to warn people about a movie called What the Bleep Do We Know. The movie showed that there is a lot about the universe that we don't understand. Some people felt that the movie was dangerous and issued warnings about it. The movie was very popular, but I couldn't see what all the fuss was about at first. When the movie moved on to describe some of the discoveries, I started to see what the fuss was really about. One of the discoveries was that water molecules can be affected by thoughts. I had heard rumours about this before, but the movie gave me some evidence to support it. The evidence was not very convincing, but it was still enough to make me believe that the discovery was real."

I find writing novels a challenge, and writing short stories a joy. Writing novels is like planting a forest, and writing short stories is more like planting a garden. The two processes complement each other, creating a complete landscape that I treasure.
Writing short stories is a necessary change of pace and a way to experiment. It takes me about a week to get a short story into some kind of decent shape. You can create a story out of the smallest things, and you don’t have to worry about failing.
My short stories are like soft shadows I have set out in the world, faint footprints I have left behind. They are like guideposts to my heart, and it makes me happy as a writer to be able to share these intimate feelings with my readers."

Science is a powerful force that has improved our lives and threatened our existence. It has made it easier for us to understand the world around us and has also led to many new inventions. Science has also been used to treat diseases and to improve our quality of life. However, science also has its challenges. It is difficult to understand and to explain the universe. Scientists often disagree with each other about the best way to explain things. But science is still a valuable tool that can help us to learn about ourselves and the world around us."

From around 2015, sales of ebooks had started to decline. This made people question the future of ebooks in the publishing industry. Some people thought that the decline of ebooks would lead to the disappearance of print books. However, there is no evidence to support this. Ebooks and print books can coexist in the market. The idea of the disappearing book is a powerful narrative that tells us much more about our relationship with technology and change. It is a story that evokes both hope and fear. It is also a story that helps us to make sense of change.

Every day, I wake up early, brush my teeth, and make coffee. I write about how some of the greatest minds of the past have approached their work. I want to provide a new way to see people. I also write about my own struggles with creativity and productivity. I have a lot of concerns about how to do meaningful creative work while also earning a living. I have tried to provide examples of how a variety of brilliant and successful people have confronted similar challenges. I wanted to show how grand creative visions translate to small daily increments. I also wanted to show how one’s working habits influence the work itself, and vice versa.
I have a lot of different sources that I used to write this book. I have documented all of my sources in the Notes section."

Howard became a palaeontologist because he was inspired by a rise in interest rates when he was young. He found out that he wanted to become a palaeontologist when he was at university. He studied delicate creatures revealed on the surface of grey rocks. He got a job as a palaeontologist at a college in London. He was surprised by the favouritism shown to him. But he was grateful that he had the job and could support himself. He often contrasted the orderly nature of his professional life with the anarchy of private concerns. He was frustrated by the theft of his notes, but he was able to overcome the problem and continue his work.

Charles Spence is a professor of experimental psychology at Oxford University in the UK. He has studied how the senses interact to form our perception of flavour. Through his studies, he has influenced what we eat and drink. He has also studied how the environment affects taste.
Spence has written a book called The Perfect Meal, which is packed with insights that are fascinating to anyone in possession of an appetite. It includes information about how much we eat when eating with others and how music can affect taste.
Spence's lab is simple and un-space-age. It has soundproof booths and stacks of ancient-looking audio-visual equipment. He can afford to work more creatively with cooks because he keeps his overheads low.
Spence is currently helping famous brands reduce salt and sugar. He points out that it is in their interests to help loyal customers stay alive for longer.
What, one wonders, are dinner parties like in the Spence household? They're all extensions of the lab to Spence."

Our brains are very busy these days. We have a lot of information to deal with, including facts, rumors, and things that are not true. We also do more things ourselves now than we used to. For example, we make our own reservations and find things in shops. We do a lot of different things at once, but it's not multitasking. It's more like spinning plates. We switch from one task to another very quickly, and it takes a lot of energy. Multitasking also makes us less efficient. It increases the production of stress hormones and can cause mental fog. It also makes it harder to focus on a task. If you do your homework and watch TV at the same time, the information from your schoolwork goes to the wrong part of your brain. It also requires a lot of decision-making. We make a lot of small decisions all the time, and it can be very tiring. We can end up making truly bad decisions about something important."

In a zoo in Sweden, a chimpanzee named Santino broke up concrete into pieces and threw them at visitors. Was he being spiteful? In caves in the US, female bats help unrelated fruit bat mothers if they can’t find the right birthing position. Are they being caring? Fifty years ago, people thought that animals had behaviours that produced measurable outcomes, and science recorded those outcomes. But recently that has partially changed. Thanks to research into the behaviour of bats, chimps, and other animals, emotions of animals have gone from being a taboo area of investigation to being tentatively explored. The new research has started a debate about whether animals can be said to have consciousness and conscience. If animals do have consciousness, what does it mean for the production and consumption of beef? The observations may not be disputed, but the interpretation of them is. Some people believe that we should stop eating meat, while others believe that we should at least re-evaluate our view of animal cognition. The debate is complex and there is no easy answer."

Critical thinking is a way of understanding what we read or listen to in a deeper way. It involves interacting with the text and thinking about the meaning of the words. There is a belief that argument is a way of finding the truth. Technology can help us store and process information, but it can also make it more difficult to think critically.
Reading enhances thinking and engages the imagination in a way that visual media such as video games and television do not. It develops imagination, induction, reflection, and critical thinking, as well as vocabulary. However, visual media can also improve some types of information processing.
Many people – particularly those who are younger – wind up underachieving and not making the most of their capabilities because they are not exposed to enough reading or thinking critically. It’s important to take a closer look at technology and understand the subtleties of how it affects thinking and analysis."

When Matthew Crawford is not writing or thinking about how we ought to live, he works as a motorcycle mechanic. He wrote two books about the benefits of manual trades and philosophy. One of his books is about how to cope with modernity. He was inspired to write it when he was shopping and noticed that advertisements popped up on the credit card machine. He says that this is becoming increasingly difficult to avoid.
Crawford is concerned about the impact of technology on our ability to think and communicate. He says that technology has created the perfect vehicles for our self-obsession. It is becoming more and more difficult to think or spend time remembering conversations we’ve had. And because everyone is trying to protect themselves from the irritation of constantly being interrupted, we close ourselves off and no longer want to do simple things like chat to strangers.
Crawford's proposed solution has two parts. First, we need regulation of noise and distraction in public space. More importantly, though, Crawford advocates skilled practices as a way of engaging with the world in a more satisfying way."

What do you do for a living? It's a common question that we use to define ourselves. When you're a philosopher, it's a little harder to deal with. It's because describing yourself as a philosopher sounds rather pretentious. However, philosophers are no different from the masses. They have established themselves as people who judge the activities of others and celebrate intellectual life.
Philosophy can help people look a little more closely at the practices and behaviours that define their lives. Sometimes this might reveal something we already know; at other times we might discover that our beliefs are hard to justify. Either way, merely by examining these ideas, we’ll be doing something for the benefit of everyone."

Foodies, gourmands, chefs and others who love food might expect that thinking critically about what and how we eat can contribute to culinary pleasure. However, philosophical discussions of food have mostly been about other topics, such as the acquisition of knowledge or the pursuit of pleasure. Food is inherently social and cultural. It is shared with those in our communities and provides us with dining companions and infrastructure. Ethical issues related to food include what we should eat and the extent to which cooking in restaurants and in the home differ. Cooking in the home is often more intimate and inclusive, while cooking for a living has different obligations. Food and dining can also play a role in bridging cultural gaps. We can come to appreciate others by learning to enjoy their food and forge personal bonds with people from other cultures by coming together to eat."

Rob Daviau is a US designer who creates legacy board games. These games are different from traditional board games because they have a permanent impact on the game. For example, in one game, players might have to rip up cards or deface the board. The games play out over a fixed number of sessions and long-held grudges become woven into the fabric of the game.
Daviau was asked to collaborate on a legacy version of Pandemic, a popular co-operative board game title. His next project was a board game called SeaFall. Legacy board game designers must consider all possible player choices to ensure the narrative doesn’t fall apart. To do this, designers recruit testers so they can observe how board games will unfold.
The legacy format draws on video games and the demand for episodic entertainment fuelled by popular TV series. While Daviau feels a sense of ownership, he is keen to see where others take the idea. But he also seeks to play down its significance."

Once upon a time, there was an octopus named Inky who lived in a tank at the New Zealand National Aquarium. One night, Inky managed to escape from his tank and swim across the floor to a drain that led to the Pacific Ocean. It was a story that was shared online and was popular among children.
One of the things that makes the story interesting is that it involves anthropomorphism, which means treating animals like humans. Anthropomorphism is often thought to be unscientific, but Dr. Frans de Waal believes that it is not. He says that animals have many of the same abilities as humans, such as the ability to consider the past and the future, to demonstrate empathy and self-awareness, and to anticipate the motives of others.
Dr. de Waal also points out that the way we think about animals has changed over time. In the past, animals were often seen as being either simple machines or robots. But now, we are beginning to understand that animals are much smarter than we thought."

Once upon a time, there was a technology called robotics that has the potential to change the world. Robots have already been used in factories and cars for many years, but now they are starting to be used in many other places too. Experts say that this technology will have a big impact on the world, and that many people will need to learn new skills to keep up.
There are a lot of different types of robots. Some robots can build things, while others can clean or help people. Some robots can even interact with humans. As technology continues to develop, new types of robots will be created.
It is important to understand the impact that robotics will have on the world. We need to prepare for the changes that this technology will bring. We also need to make sure that we have the skills we need to compete in the future."

Because it's there, the mountaineer George Mallory is said to have said why he wanted to climb Mount Everest. There is a common sentiment that the general public has about climbing. Many climbers love climbing because of the feeling of freedom it produces. At the same time, climbing can be a very confining, restricting activity. There is an apparent paradox in many forms of climbing. But one can also argue that the limited options available give the climber’s life a simplicity that is itself a form of freedom.
When presented with the question 'Why climb?' the US rock climber, Joe Fitschen takes the debate in a different direction. He argues that a better question would be 'Why do people climb?' Climbing is in our genes; it is inherent in our basic makeup to take on challenges and test limits.
Climbing also has practical value. It may help develop the traits and virtues that allow one to flourish and live well in our non-climbing world."

My grandparents' garden was a beautiful place. It was on the bank of a river and sloped gently down towards the water. You couldn’t reach the river but you could hear the sound of the water and the birds that sang in the trees above. I imagined that all gardens were like this – a place of escape, peace and solitude.
My father was a quiet and withdrawn person. He had a lot of phrases that he liked to use, one of them being 'It’s immaterial to me'. He was probably disappointed that he hadn’t made more of his life. He left school without qualifications and became apprenticed to a plumber. It was not something he was passionate about.
I always wanted to like the piano but it did its best to intimidate me. The only thing I did like about it were the two brass candlesticks that jutted out from the front. I would imagine playing the piano and being in another world.
I wanted out of school as soon as possible. One day my father announced, 'They’ve got a vacancy for an apprentice gardener in the Parks Department. I thought you might be interested.' In one brief moment Dad had gone against his better judgement. He might still have preferred it if I became a carpenter. But I like to feel that somewhere deep down inside him was a feeling that things might just turn out for the best. If I stuck at it."

The game design industry is a competitive one, but it is also expanding. It is not easy to get into, but there are ways to do it. If you are passionate about games and have the skills and creativity to back it up, you can definitely make your dream of working in the game design industry a reality.
There are a few things you need to do to get started. First, you need to make games. You can do this on your own, but it is much easier with the help of a postgraduate course or a mentor. Once you have made some games, you need to start networking with people in the industry. This can be done through online forums, social media, or attending industry events.
If you are able to combine your passion for games with your skills and creativity, you can definitely make a career in the game design industry."

Since I was a child, I have always wanted to play football. My dad encouraged me to play, and I'm grateful that he didn't push me too hard. I had a friend who was also passionate about football, but he stopped playing and hasn't been involved in the sport since. I'm glad that I didn't have that happen to me. I have worked hard to improve my skills, and I know that with practice, anyone can achieve great things.
I also used to play other sports at school, but football was my favorite. I want to make sure that my son has the same opportunities that I had, so I'm trying to read him books even though he's far too young to sit still for long enough. I hope that he doesn't take after me in that way.
I have a lot of money, but I don't have all the answers. After I stop playing, I think I'll have a year off or perhaps even longer, doing the things I haven't been able to do all these years. I want to go skiing the day after I stop playing, but I can't do that now because if I were to break a leg on the ski slopes and couldn't play football again, I wouldn't be insured."

Reef Point was seldom patronised by the casual day tripper. There was a lot of people at the beach now. My father was working on a script. I went to the beach to read a book and take my dog, Rusty, for a swim. Rusty was a dog. We had a dog when we first moved to Reef Point, but he decided to remedy this. Sometimes, he would dig up things that were not his. I had to return these things to their owners. Rusty liked to swim too. He always insisted on accompanying me, although I could swim much faster and farther than he could. We had been swimming that day. The sun was setting and it was getting cooler.

When John Maloof bought a box of old photo negatives at an estate auction, he found a mystery. He was looking for images to use in a book about the history of the Portage Park neighbourhood in Chicago. Instead, he found 30,000 images by Vivian Maier, a street photographer with a keen eye for capturing compelling images. Since then, Maloof has amassed an archive of Maier’s life and work. He has a lot of her cameras, film, prints, and negatives. He also has many movies and audiotapes. Maloof is working with his friend Anthony Rydzon to share Maier’s story. They are trying to find out more about her life and work. They have contacted several local families and employees of the shop where she had film developed. Maier was born in 1926 and spent much of her childhood in France. She returned to New York in 1951 and came to Chicago in 1956 to work as a nanny. Maier was a private person but she had a strong interest in photography. She always had a camera with her and took pictures of people, children, and the poor. Maloof is inspired by Maier’s work and has started taking his own pictures.

When a novel is described as ambitious, it usually means that it is not successful. However, this is not the case with Eleanor Catton’s book, The Luminaries. The book is set during the 1860s in New Zealand. A series of crimes have been committed, and a council of 12 men has convened to solve them. The plot is complex and exciting. Catton said she set out to write a murder mystery, not a historical novel, but found the past offered more opportunities for complications and misunderstandings for her characters to deal with. The book is long, but it is worth reading. It is fun and engaging, and it will keep you on the edge of your seat."

Any conversation about English conversation often begins with the weather. It is a traditional way to start a conversation in English. The writer points out that this observation is as accurate now as it was over two hundred years ago. However, most commentators either stop or try to come up with a convincing explanation for the English ‘obsession’ with the weather. They fail because they start with the mistaken premise that our conversations about the weather are actually conversations about the weather. Most commentators try to figure out what it is about the English weather that is so fascinating. The writer argues that our conversations about the weather are not really about the weather at all. They are a form of ‘grooming talk’ that helps English people overcome their natural reserve and actually talk to each other."

The silence on Centre Court at the Wimbledon tennis championships is very quiet. You can bounce the ball and hit it, and you hear the echo of your own shot. The grass is soft and the stadium is ancient. The players are dressed in white and the crowds are respectful. The quiet of the Centre Court is good for your game. It helps you to focus on the point you’re playing and to shut everything else out.
When a point is done, there is a lot of noise. People cheer and applaud. You hear them, but as if from a long way away. You don’t register that there are thousands of people watching you. You are so focused that you have no sense at all that there are millions watching you as you play Roger Federer in the 2008 Wimbledon final.
You had always dreamed of playing at Wimbledon. You had played and lost, both times against Federer – in the final there the year before, and the year before that. The defeat in 2006 had not been so hard. You went out onto the court that time just pleased and grateful that, having just turned twenty, you’d made it that far. But your defeat in 2007 left you utterly destroyed. You knew you could have done better, that it was not your ability or the quality of your game that had failed you, but your head. You wept after that loss. You cried incessantly for half an hour in the dressing room.
There was nothing your coach could do to ease your grief. Yet he turned out, in the end, to be right. Another chance had come your way. You were confident you’d learnt the lesson from that defeat twelve months earlier; that whatever else gave way this time, your head would not."

It seems that people who have the hardest time sleeping are the ones who most appreciate how important sleep is. Dreams are important too.

When you wake up in the morning, you may have forgotten your dreams, but they can still have a positive impact on your day. If you write or create art, you may find that you are able to write or create more easily after a dream. Even if you don't write or create art, you can still benefit from dreaming.

It was twenty years ago that Susie Ray left London for a small coastal town in south-west England. She has a studio with a beautiful sea view. There are a lot of empty frames hanging on the walls, between photographs of her two daughters. Susie is a copyist artist who can reproduce the richness of an early-20th-century impressionist masterpiece as easily as the brilliance of a 16th-century Caravaggio portrait.
The problem is that Susie is very popular. She has painted the works of numerous great artists, including Renoir, Monet and Van Gogh. Her reproductions are so faithful that art experts mistake them for the originals.
Susie has always been open about what she does. When she reproduces an old masterpiece, she will make it look as authentic as possible. However, she will put her own signature on the back of the canvas.
When younger painters approach Susie for advice, she stresses the importance of learning to draw and to represent things accurately. She also emphasises how much she’s studied to be able to do what she does."

When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, it's probably not classical music they're listening to. Most people our age can name a lot of pop groups, but few of us know who Brahms was. I started doing a music degree, but the people on my course know no more about classical music than anyone else. If you don’t know who wrote the music, you are unlikely to own any recordings of their work. Classical music is not very popular among teenagers. There are a few reasons why this is the case. First, the pace and rhythm of classical music are not very appealing to us. Second, classical music is not structurally very simple. Third, the subject matter of classical music is not very relatable to teenagers. Finally, the way we listen to music has changed. Nowadays, we can find any music we want at the click of a mouse. The sound track to our lives is rarely classical."

Bonnie Wyndham got out of her mother’s car and looked at Almonside School. It was a funny school, with lots of buildings and trees. There was a riding centre where the horses were kept. Bonnie treated horses with respect. She rode a horse named Maverick. It was a big and beautiful horse. They went for a walk around the paddock. The rhythm was exhilarating.

I met Cody Simpson before. He is a 15-year-old Australian who has already released a number of successful songs. He started writing songs when he was seven years old. One day, he posted videos of himself singing on the internet. These videos changed everything. He began getting lots of comments from fans asking for more videos. So, Cody started recording more videos at home. The responses to his videos were overwhelming. He was very talented at swimming and had a lot of coaches helping him. But then, record labels came calling and he had to make a tough choice. He decided to move to the US and pursue his dream of becoming a singer. It was a difficult decision, but he knew it was the right one. Now, Cody is playing in front of thousands of fans and travelling the world. He is grateful for his family and friends who have always been there to support him.

I woke up early and looked at the river. The ice was shining in the sunlight. I helped my grandfather to protect the buildings from flooding. I worked with many people in the town to lift the sandbags. It was a lot of work, but I was able to do it. My grandfather didn’t notice me much. I saw a boy on the river bank. He was trying to balance on an ice shelf. I was worried about him. I put on my wetsuit and jacket and went to the river. I found my lucky chain and put it on. My grandfather is important to me, but I try to ignore his temper. I have my own trophies and I am working hard to achieve my goals. I am proud of my determination and I know that I can do anything I set my mind to."

Mum caught Jess by the arm and asked her to come with her to the study. There was a painting on the table. It was one of Grandpa’s, but it was unlike anything he had done before. The picture was strange and beautiful. There was a river in the picture. It was not a real river, but it was a fantasy river. The riverbank was green. There were no animals or people in the picture. It felt right that way. There seemed no place for living things in this remote vision. Yet, Jess was captivated. She thought of the coming of autumn after a long, rich summer. Mum spoke again. The picture had a name. It was called 'River Boy'. The words seemed to carry a strange resonance. Jess knew what Grandpa’s response would have been. He would have said that painting is hard work and that artists don’t need to explain their pictures to everyone. And he would have said that if artists had to explain their pictures to every Tom, Dick, and Harry who came along, they’d never get any work done."

When I woke up this morning, I didn't mean to cut a hole in my bedroom carpet. It could have happened, but it didn't. I was trying to find a way of fitting my corner cabinet into a corner. Gran had given me the cabinet when she moved out of her house into a flat. It's really cute and I keep my collection of shells and fossils there.
The problem was, the cabinet was too tall. If I could only slice a couple of centimetres off the bottom of it... That was when it came to me. I had an idea. If I couldn't slice anything off Gran’s cabinet, how about cutting a hole in the carpet? It just seemed like the obvious solution. What Dad calls lateral thinking. I reckoned he would be quite pleased with me. He is always telling us to 'think outside the box'. And that was exactly what I was doing!"

The novel 'The Borrowers' is about a family of tiny people who live hidden in the walls and floors of a house. They borrow things from the normal-sized people in order to survive. When the author asked me to direct a TV adaptation of the novel, I knew it was going to be hard to live up to people’s expectations. The most important thing was getting the scale right. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans, so I had to make sure that the actors looked small. I also had to get the costumes right. The costumes were made out of heavy canvas material so that they stuck out in the way that dolls’ clothes do. Unfortunately, the weather was really hot during filming. But it all came together in the end, and I think the series was pretty successful in conveying the magic of the books."

Mom pulled to a stop at the corner of my new school, Palm Grove High School. She looked around nervously, looking for journalists that weren’t there. I was excited to see how long it would take before the craziness began. Because it always does. The fake smiles, the wannabe friends, the people who want free tickets to one of my dad’s concerts. I told her, “Everything’s going to be fine.” She kissed her fingertip and touched my cheek right before I got out of the car. Then she was off, leaving me alone with this whole new school and situation to deal with.
I walked into the school’s main office and asked for my schedule. The secretary was not very friendly. She made a face and leaned her ear closer to me. I gave her my name and she typed it on the keyboard. She seemed confused. I guess she didn’t know me. I got my schedule and it was cool. English Literature, first period. I was late, though. English is in Room 214, second floor. I studied the map the night before, as I didn’t want to look like a complete buffoon searching for my classes. When I got to the door, I heard the teacher already taking roll. I slipped in undetected and slid into the last desk in the second row. The girl next to me smiled. She was friendly. I smiled back at her.
The teacher introduced herself as Ms. Smigla. She talked a lot and eventually handed us our course outlines. After we reviewed them and she told us all about books we’re required to read this year, she actually gave us time to socialize. All teachers should realize the importance of this. I made a new friend, her name is Becca. We talked for a while and she seemed to like me. I guess she thought I was cool."

In the United States, teenage girls are expected to be Student Council presidents and have part-time jobs. Teenage boys and girls have a lot of responsibilities, including homework, tests, extracurricular activities, jobs, chores, and family obligations. They also have to deal with a lot of stress, including trying to maintain a social life.
Teenagers today have a lot of homework and tests, and they also have to deal with extra-curricular activities, jobs, and chores. They have to be reachable at all times, which can lead to what appears to be a cell phone addiction. With the introduction of smart phones, tablets, and social media, students can now take their work on the go and do their homework wherever they happen to be.
Teenagers have a lot of responsibilities and they have to deal with a lot of stress. Many teenagers start their days around 6 a.m. or 7 a.m. and often end after midnight. This schedule is crammed with school, after-school activities, family obligations, and homework. And then, he or she must get up and do it all again the next day, with fewer than the recommended nine hours of sleep a night."

The teenage members of the Earth to Sky Calculus Club live in Bishop, a mountain town in the US, surrounded by wilderness. They have launched over fifty balloons to the edge of space. It's a long-running science project and a backcountry adventure. The teenagers get involved because it's part astronomy experiment and part adventure. I joined them one weekend in late spring. They were releasing a high-altitude balloon and hoping to record shooting stars.
A few things happen when the balloon goes up. First, it grows to the size of a small car. Then, it pops in a dramatic explosion. Finally, a parachute helps the equipment inside the lunch box land safely back on Earth.
Getting the lunch box back is not straightforward. It often lands somewhere in the middle of nowhere. To find it, the recovery team has to drive south of the Sierra and then back up the western side of the mountain range. It can take a long time to find the lunch box. But it's also a perfect opportunity to argue over the effects of atmospheric waves and share stories of adventure."

Chloe Morgan is a palaeontologist. She started to be interested in Palaeontology when she was fifteen. She was inspired by her younger brother's interest in dinosaurs and by an article she read about recent discoveries in the field.
Chloe's job is varied. She spends a lot of time digging up dinosaur bones, analysing fossils, and writing for scientific publications. She also likes to communicate scientific findings to the public, especially young people.
Dinosaurs continue to fascinate us because they speak to the innate explorer in all of us. They are also a reminder that there is still more out there to be discovered.

When you travel by car with your family, even when you're young, you know that you're not 'there yet.' Once you get there, it's not 'there' anymore, it's 'here.' If you really think there's a chance that you're 'there yet,' you should be asking 'Are we there yet? ' And mums and dads often get asked that question over and over on long car trips.
If you're travelling by car, you can have a lot of fun. You can watch DVDs, listen to music, or play puzzles. You can also act as co-pilot and help your parents adjust the radio station and temperature.
But sometimes, things can go wrong. For example, your brother or sister might put their foot on your side of the seat. If that happens, you might get angry and fight. And the driver and co-pilot might have to help you separate from your sibling.
Over the years, your parents have developed strategies for dealing with kids on the back seat. For example, they might say, ""Yup. We're there. Get out of the car."" But if you're still on the highway, going fast, they might say, ""Oh, well, then maybe we're not there yet.""
So once and for all, please note: if mum and dad are still near enough to answer your question, then the answer is: no. You're not there yet."

John and Zuzi Morgan have a café in Oxford, UK, where people can enjoy coffee, cake, and play board games. They decided to turn their love of tabletop games into a full-time business because there is so much technology and people are busy on their mobile phones and gadgets. The games played in their café are called Eurogames. They are known for their gentle themes and easy rules.
One of the most successful Eurogames is Pandemic. It was created by Matt Leacock, a North American designer. Pandemic is a cooperative game where players must work together to solve global problems. It is a popular game because it is easy to learn and fun to play.
The growth of the video games industry has also helped to the success of Eurogames. Video games have become more popular than ever before, and this has led to a rise in the popularity of tabletop games. As a result, more people are open to playing games than ever before."

One Saturday morning, Tony met with the author in a BMX park. The local boys all knew exactly who he was. Many older people came to pay their respects to him. Tony is not always seen as a hero. Some people claim he's reckless and takes unnecessary risks.
However, Tony is far from casual about the risks he runs. He says, 'The individuals making these accusations may be genuinely concerned but they aren't well-informed. The rest of us can be divided into those that can’t overcome fear and others that can. I’m in the group that feels the fear but finds a way past it.'"

Television presenter Helen Skelton has completed many dangerous challenges for charity, including a desert marathon run and a journey down the Amazon river in a small boat. For her latest challenge, Helen walked on a high wire, a long thin piece of metal, 66 meters above the ground. There was no safety net, only a belt around her waist attached to another wire above. To help her keep her balance and not to fall, she carried a long stick, weighing eight kilograms. Helen took lessons from an expert high-wire walker. Although she already had a few circus skills, she quickly discovered that high-wire walking was completely different. The training was a shock, said Helen. 'I didn’t realise how strong I’d need to be. Every day started at 8 am with a run up a steep hill; then came an hour of exercises, with another hour of them after my day practising on the wire. I also had to learn how to fall onto the wire so that if I slipped I could carry on. Every time I fell on the wire it hurt badly. But it was essential to keep a positive attitude: if I was nervous and started shaking, so would the wire.

I work at a university in the US. My team and I are learning more about water birds, particularly one called the American black duck. We have started using a new piece of equipment called a night-vision scope, which allows us to see the ducks in the dark. We are worried about black ducks mainly because their numbers have fallen hugely. We don’t know whether there’s enough food on the east coast for these animals. We have lots of information about their daytime activities, but nothing about what they do at night, because we simply haven’t had the equipment. But this new ‘scope’ will produce really clear pictures, even on moonless nights, so we’ll be able to find out more and make better decisions about looking after the area where they live based on what we learn. It is very hard work. There are four of us, each working six hours daily. We have studied ducks in different locations, and I have had to take a boat to some sites and make notes on every duck I see. The weather hasn’t helped – some nights are mild, but more often it’s wet. Oh, and it’s so quiet I’ve needed lots of coffee to stop me falling asleep! We’ve only missed one working day so far, because the snow was too deep even for our special snow vehicles. Still I like the challenge of it, especially compared to what the summer will bring – hours in a laboratory, where we’ll look at our results together. It’ll be hard to be stuck inside – but it’s essential to do this. And I wouldn’t change it for anything!"

I work as a chocolate taster. I taste chocolate every day. I make sure that customers get perfect bars of high-quality chocolate. Every week I receive samples of chocolate from the factory. I have to check them for taste, texture and smell. I also have to taste the raw materials we usually use. I spend days choosing the most suitable ones to go into the chocolate. I have a kitchen where I can test and taste products I make. I keep my colleagues happy by giving them samples. I love my job, although I think it still comes second to the chocolate itself.

When Vicky Harmiston was a child, her parents gave her and her brother Jamie the freedom to decide what they did in their spare time. Vicky chose to do lots of different sports. She was a good swimmer, and the coach at the swimming club she went to thought she might be good enough to become a champion. But the club was a long way from her home so it was difficult for her to fit in the training around her schoolwork. When they were teenagers, Jamie, who loved cycling, bought himself a special track racing bike and started taking part in competitions. Vicky thought it looked very exciting and decided to try it for herself. She says that was the best decision she ever made. Soon she was cycling every day and doing really well. The track was near her school, which meant it was no problem for her to attend training sessions after school every day. Vicky went on to have a successful career in track cycling and won several competitions. Then, when she was 28, she retired from competitive cycling. Vicky told me: ‘For years I’d loved winning competitions but I began to get a bit tired of the whole thing – and when the excitement stops, there’s no point. Luckily, I went on to have a new career.’ Vicky got a job with a charity called CycleZone. ‘We work with young people who have never enjoyed sport,’ she says. ‘The first thing we do is teach them to ride a bike. We want them to learn to believe in themselves and their own abilities. CycleZone does a great job, and it gets young people together so they’re part of a wider group.’"

Singer-songwriter Ana Ronson grew up in Ireland. There was always music in her house. Her grandfather played the guitar and taught Ana and her brother to play. The first time Ana sang in front of an audience was at school. She was so nervous that her teacher had to lead her off the stage. The teacher suggested that joining the school theatre club might make her more confident. After attending the club for a while, she sang with 50 other students at an end-of-term concert. A year later, her brother asked her to write a song for them, and she wrote her first ever song, Falling Stars. Writing it took just three days and she enjoyed it so much that she enrolled on a songwriting course run by a professional songwriter. Despite being the youngest student, she already knew more about music than many of the others. But the teacher didn’t listen to anything she said, and she wrote Something to Say about how annoyed this made her feel. She posted this song online, and it became a huge success."

I had dreamt of visiting the area ever since I saw it on TV as a child. So I asked Harry if I could go too – until he finally agreed. There were storms in the area, but luckily the weather was calm. We joined the group and set off in small boats. We saw dolphins and birds. There were also islands in the distance, but the fog made it hard to see. We stopped for hours to explore the rock pools on the beaches. They were full of amazing coloured fish. We never forgot lunch or dinner, which we all made together over camp fires. When it was time to leave, I was sad. But I knew if I stayed, I’d miss family and friends. I was also looking forward to telling everyone at home about our adventures."

My dad was a professional basketball player in Germany. He played a lot when I was a kid. I went to watch many of his games. It made me love telling my friends about my dad. I also used to read books instead of watching the games. In secondary school, my sports teacher asked me if I would like to join the basketball team. I was tall and I thought I would need to develop my skills before I took part in a real match, but my teacher had more confidence in me than I did. It took me a while to agree, but a few weeks later, I found myself playing against a team from another school. My parents came to watch, but it made me more nervous. But it was OK in the end. I practised every day and did really well. I joined an adult team before I moved abroad to a special sports academy in the USA when I was fifteen. The coach there trains Olympic basketball players. It was fantastic to work with him. However, I can’t say I enjoyed my first experience of living far from my parents. At home, I’d never been able to spend much time with my friends due to all the training, so that wasn’t such a change for me. I got used to my new life in the end, though, and my English improved quickly too! I turned professional at the age of eighteen, three years after arriving in the USA. I was taller than most players in the professional league, but I was much too light for my height, so I had to get that right first. I joined the team and have never regretted it."

Seven years ago, I was studying tourism in college. I needed to find a part-time job because my course was expensive. I decided to become a weekend tour guide in my city, Chicago. I took visitors around the city and I enjoyed giving those tours. I learned a lot about Chicago and it felt like a new experience every time. After finishing my studies, I decided to go into tour guiding full-time. To get a licence, I had to learn a lot of things. I had to know a lot about Chicago, including its history and architecture. I also had to be able to answer hundreds of questions about the city. After several months, I gained my tour guide qualification and started working as an independent tour guide. Being a tour guide is not just about knowing facts. You also need to be able to be entertaining and tell interesting stories. You need to be able to react to changing situations and make sure visitors are happy. I need to make sure that visitors are happy with my tours, otherwise they could post a negative review online.

My city has a modern cinema that shows all the latest films I want to see, and lots of films for kids at the weekends. It’s close to where I live, but a year ago, I realised something was missing – the experience of discussing a film in detail with a group of people after watching it with them. So, together with two friends, I started a film club. We decided to meet in different places in the city each month. Last month, we hired an old factory to show a film that was set in Antarctica. It was freezing cold, and this created the perfect atmosphere for the film, which was brilliant! We’re happy to make enough to cover our costs – we’re not trying to make a profit. Each time we show a film, everything is a bit easier for us. We also know how many tickets we’ve sold because everything’s online. There’s still always plenty to do, but when people of all ages come up at the end to say what a great experience they’ve had, it’s wonderful. We’ve started a blog, too, because we know that most people now go online for information about films, rather than read reviews in local papers. And the audience love the special activities we put on with each film – last month it was a movie quiz, which everybody enjoyed."

The hill was very steep, so my dad had to do a lot of persuading to get me on a board. I was so young, I hadn’t even thought of asking him if I could start snowboarding, but he was already into it and wanted me to love it too. And in the end, I managed just fine. After this experience, I started to love the sport and improve my ability. I started competing aged ten. I enjoy taking part in competitions and winning too.

One day, my best friend got a new phone and I thought I should have one too. My parents said I could only have it if I paid for it myself, so I decided to work part-time and save as much as I could.

My parents suggested starting my own little business instead. I asked my mum if I could have a go at making necklaces, and I found it was easy to make. I sold my first items of jewellery to my friends and family. They told me they were delighted with them, but I still needed convincing that they looked good enough to be popular with the public. There was only one way to find out, so I rented a market stall with my mum. Lots of people bought my things, and soon we were receiving calls from all over the country. It’s been such a lot of fun so far."

When Janine Stuart was young, she wrote a novel called Being Amelia which became a bestseller. Being Amelia is based on Janine’s life. In one interview, Janine said, ‘Because of my family’s moving around a lot, I’ve become good at making new friends. I understand what it’s like to be the only new student in a class, and that helped me to write about how the main character, Amelia, gets on in a new school.
Janine started her novel one summer, when she was feeling bored at home. Her mother had always dreamt of becoming a published author herself, and her teachers had always encouraged her to write, so it seemed like a natural way for Janine to pass the time. The year before, she’d entered a short story competition on a young writers’ website and won first prize. That’s why, when Janine finished Being Amelia and sent it to a publishing company, the people who worked there were immediately keen to read it. They loved it, and a year later, Janine’s novel was on sale in bookshops."

My name is Tom. I am fifteen years old. Three years ago, my family and I moved to a castle on a small island. My dad works for an organisation that looks after historical buildings. He was happy to take the job, but it was a while before the rest of us agreed. We were worried about the weather and there was no school. But we soon got used to island life. The castle is not very beautiful, but our apartment is comfortable. The island feels very sociable in the summer, and there are often parties on the beach. In the winter, we only see the other families who live on the island. There aren’t as many teenagers among them as I had hoped. But the adults all support each other, and help with repairs on the island. The biggest change for me was travelling by boat every day. I was looking forward to going on stormy days, but the ferries don’t run then. And I’ve discovered that if I miss the bus to the harbour after school, I also miss the last ferry home. So when schoolmates come home to stay with me, I’m always telling them to hurry up!"

And the opportunity came sooner than I’d hoped. I played in local tournaments, and one of the referees noticed that I was a promising player. He asked the manager of a professional women’s club to watch me play. After that, she asked me to join her club. I started regular training with a big club as a young 13-year-old. I improved enormously. But people still weren’t sure I’d ever be a star player, which made me feel a bit upset. But my coach encouraged me to just be myself, and believe in myself. I played in one of the club’s championship matches, much earlier than I’d expected. I scored the winning goal. And I’ve been lucky since then."

One of the most interesting things about studying further and higher education in the UK is that students are encouraged to become involved with research as early as possible. Research is not just for famous scholars or scientists. It can also be seen as a natural way to build knowledge and skills.
There are different ways to do research. You can do it in a big way, like the highly trained few who do groundbreaking research. Or you can do it in a smaller way, like asking questions about your own interests.
No matter how you do it, research is a way of thinking about the world and going about your own work. It is also a way of making knowledge. When you research, you are making new knowledge. You don't just digest and repeat what you read, you make it.
To be a good researcher, you need to be able to think critically. This means that you need to be able to engage with the research of others, think about it, test it out, and identify whether what you're being told is logical and backed by evidence."

Cities have always been centers of intellectual activity. They have been places where people gather to discuss ideas and share their thoughts. However, city life is not always easy. It can be exhausting and overwhelming. Scientists have found that cities actually dull our thinking, sometimes dramatically so. One of the main reasons for this is the lack of nature in cities. Studies have shown that people who can see trees from their windows recover more quickly from illness. Even small glimpses of nature improve brain performance.
In recent years, it has become clear that living in cities has a number of negative effects on our mental and physical health. These effects include fatigue, stress, and depression. However, there is also evidence that living in cities can have some positive effects on our health, such as increased creativity and innovation.
The key to mitigating the psychological damage of the metropolis while maintaining its unique benefits is to find ways to integrate nature into city life. This can be done through a variety of methods, such as creating more parks and green spaces, and making it easier for people to access nature."

The mind is a complex thing. It is often thought to be located inside people's heads. But there is evidence to suggest that the mind is more than just the brain. Things and neurons also play a role in human cognitive life.
From the viewpoint of archaeology, it is clear that stone objects, body ornaments, engravings, clay tokens and writing systems play an active role in human evolution and the making of the human mind.
The mind and the brain became equated when people were isolated from their material culture in order to study them. But this often goes unnoticed that much of our thinking takes place outside our heads.
The human mind is an unfinished project that is constantly evolving. It is important to keep in mind that whatever form the 'stick' might have taken in the history of our species, its primary function was that of a pathway instead of a boundary.
Through the 'stick', the human species feels, discovers, and makes sense of the environment, but also enacts the way forward. That is why a stick used by a monkey to retrieve food is of a different kind. For humans, 'sticks' are used to satisfy our desire to know."

Photography has changed the course of civilization and the way we know the world. It has been especially true in the United States, where photography quickly became part of US culture. Photography is arguably the country’s greatest single contribution to the visual arts. It has moved to the centre of US intellectual and aesthetic discourse.
Why was photography so appealing? Firstly, it was a mechanical process that matched a growing enthusiasm for technology. Secondly, it was the instrument of choice when opting for a tool which would best represent the self. Thirdly, it was an instrument for creating and sustaining an impression of self and family. Finally, the photograph’s inherent realism was in harmony aesthetically with a tendency towards realism.
If we want to understand a photograph historically, then we need to pay special attention to its purpose and function within a given cultural matrix. We also need to consider the placement and framing of the image. If the camera’s importance to the artist was kept secret for a long time, it is now, for the contemporary artist, anything but a secret."

In 1890, William James, an American philosopher and physician, defined psychology as the 'science of mental life.' This definition is still a good starting point for understanding psychology today. We all have a mental life and therefore have some idea about what this means. However, even though the concept can be studied in rats and monkeys as well as humans, it remains a somewhat elusive one.
Psychology is about the mind or brain, but psychologists do not understand nearly enough about its workings to be able to comprehend the part that it plays in the experience and expression of our hopes, fears, and wishes, or in our behaviour during experiences as varied as giving birth or watching a football match.
The endeavour of psychology is much like that involved in solving a crossword puzzle. It involves evaluating and interpreting available clues. Complex interactions are the norm rather than the exception in psychology, and understanding them depends on the development of sophisticated techniques and theories.
Psychology has the same goals as any other science: to describe, understand, predict, and learn how to control or modify the process that it studies. Once these goals have been achieved, it can help us to understand the nature of our experience and come to conclusions that can be applied directly to people’s lives."

In a storehouse in a business park in Michigan, USA, there is a museum of failed products. The museum has a collection of products that were withdrawn from sale because nobody wanted to buy them. The proprietor of the museum, Carol Sherry, sees each product as embodying its own sad story. The museum is a viable, profit-making business. It was started by a man named Robert McMath who intended to accumulate a reference library of consumer products. But McMath had a problem: most products fail. By collecting new products indiscriminately, he had ensured that his hoard would come to consist overwhelmingly of unsuccessful ones.
The museum is a testament to the power of optimism. It is also a reminder that failure is a natural part of life. If you are willing to learn from your failures, you can achieve great things."

Everyone knows that sports teams have an advantage when they play at home. But does anyone know why? Most of us probably think we do; after all, it seems obvious. But professional sport is changing faster than at any time in its history and much of what we used to take for granted is now open to question.
There are two main reasons why home advantage exists. First, the home team has the advantage of playing in front of their own crowd, which can give them a boost of energy and confidence. Second, the home team has the benefit of being able to control the playing conditions, such as the temperature and the lighting.
However, there are some changes that have recently occurred that have made home advantage less effective. For example, travel has become more convenient and the top grounds increasingly resemble one another in their soulless efficiency. As a result, the impact of home advantage has declined in all major sports, but not by as much as one might expect.
One possible explanation for why home advantage varies depending on the sport is that it is primarily a team phenomenon. In team sports, such as basketball and football, winning ultimately hangs on all concerned being team players, which builds confidence in their ability to find each other on the court."

The more I practice, the luckier I get, said Gary Player. This quote is famous and is valued by athletes and coaches. It is easy to see why. The quote's source is disputed and its meaning is enigmatic. However, the main message is clear: the more I practice, the better I get. Up to a point. Where that point is, is at the heart of the nature-nurture debate. The debate has been uneven, with nurture winning out. The theory that expertise in any field can be attained with 10,000 hours’ practice is true, but it is often not the case. There are other factors that can influence success, such as genes, environment, and opportunity. The complexity of the topic is emphasized."

A recent report found that many children living in wealthy countries feel lonely and unhappy. The reason for this is that these children have been spending too much time indoors, watching TV or playing on computers, and have lost contact with the natural world. This is a problem because it is making children feel sad and unhealthy.
A follow-up study found that most of the children would be happier if they could go outside more. Many adults also talk nostalgically about the freedom of their own youth, when they spent long summer days playing outside. However, they rarely stop to reflect that they are the ones who have imposed that protective regime on their own children.
There are some good arguments in the book about the relationship between the fear of danger and child-focused consumerism. However, the author's arguments go too far and she does not provide enough evidence to support them."

I am a research bio-psychologist with a PhD. I have done a lot of school and I am a good problem-solver. But most problems in life cannot be solved with a formula or memorised answers. They require the judgement, wisdom and creative ability that come from life experiences.
Play is the natural means by which adults and mammals have always educated themselves. It is also important for children's development. All mammals, including humans, play when they are young. Children, who have the most to learn, play far more than any other young primates when they are allowed to do so.
Play is voluntary, which means that players are always free to quit. If you can't quit, it's not play. School has become more onerous and adult-directed sports have replaced impromptu games. Our children don’t need more school. They need more play.

In many countries, there are a lot of young people in their twenties who use social media to find work. There are two popular social networking sites that are often used for job hunting: Twitter and LinkedIn. These sites offer the chance for direct contact with potential employers. However, with greater access comes a greater chance to make mistakes. For example, a young jobseeker in the US contacted a senior marketing executive via LinkedIn. The marketing executive was not impressed by the young jobseeker's message and sent a rude rejection note. This incident has made people think more carefully about how they use social media in a professional capacity.
There are a few things you should do when you are using social media for job hunting. First, you should explain clearly who you are and what you have to offer. Second, you should refrain from sending impersonal, blanket emails. Third, you should keep the tone humble if you want to avoid leaving a sour taste in the recipient's mouth."

Newspapers have been struggling in recent years. Their circulation has fallen and they are no longer the main source of news for most people in the US. Some people predict that newspapers will soon be extinct, but history shows that old media have a habit of surviving. Newspapers were once new media, and they became the dominant medium for news in the mid-19th century. However, the internet has changed the way we consume news. Now, we can get news from all over the world quickly and easily. We can also personalize the news to our own interests. All this is a world away from the straitjacket of newspaper publication. Yet few if any providers seem alive to the new medium’s capacity for spreading understanding and enlightenment."

If humans were truly at home under the light of the moon and stars, we would go in darkness happily. Instead, we are diurnal creatures, with eyes adapted to living in the sun’s light. We have engineered the night to receive us by filling it with light. This kind of control is no different from the feat of damming a river. Light pollution is largely the result of bad lighting design. It washes out the darkness of night, altering light levels and light rhythms to which many forms of life, including ourselves, have adapted.
Light pollution has a negative impact on many aspects of life. It affects migration, reproduction, feeding, and our biological well-being. Denying darkness is futile. It is as essential to maintaining our biological welfare as light itself. The regular oscillation of waking and sleep in our lives is nothing less than a biological expression of the regular oscillation of light on Earth. So fundamental are these rhythms to our being that messing with them is akin to altering our center of gravity.
Living in a glare of our own making, we have cut ourselves off from our evolutionary and cultural heritage – the light of the stars and the rhythms of day and night. In a very real sense, light pollution causes us to lose sight of our true place in the universe, to forget the scale of our being, which is best measured against the dimensions of a deep night with the Milky Way arching overhead."

Journal-based peer review is a process that ensures the quality of scientific research papers. It is often praised for preventing the publication of flawed or nonsensical papers. However, the process can also be time-consuming, sometimes delaying the publication of a paper by a year. Preprints, which are drafts of papers that are posted online without having been peer reviewed, are a growing trend that is changing the way scientific papers are published. Preprints bring academics back to the core of research publication, which is the rapid dissemination of new results. They also make it easier for papers to be read, critiqued, and built upon. Preprints have the potential to improve the scientific publishing process and make it more equitable.

When I ask my students about poems, they often give me answers like ""a painting in words."" Their answers rarely satisfy me or them. One day I asked a group to choose an object and write one paragraph describing it empirically, as a scientist might, and another in the first person, from the point of view of the item itself. The exercise led to much amusement and useful discussion.
A poem is a thing made. Poets sometimes compare poems to wild animals or machines. But such comparisons fall apart upon closer analysis. The most productive thing about trying to define a poem through comparison lies not in the comparison itself but in the debate. A poem is a product of writing and rewriting just like an article, story, or novel. It never really becomes what they usually are – a thing created in order to become a commodity.
A poem is a thing that can surprise, if only for a moment. It is a thing that can make us feel deep feelings, stunning images, tender reflections and/or biting wit. It is a thing that can help us experiment with our well-trodden patterns of thought and reroute these patterns by making us see commonplace things in a new light."

When I go to new places, I often find that I sleep better than I do at home. This is because I am surrounded by new sights, sounds, smells, and ways of being. When I sleep on the road, I feel like I am immersed in the culture of the place I am visiting. I also remember more vividly the experiences I have when I am sleeping.

I had a break from my training. I was going to do something else. Being a successful athlete is a special thing. I had the chance to do more writing and TV work, and to speak to businesses and schools. But there wasn’t anything on the horizon to get my competitive teeth into. I knew that I wished to stay in shape, so that I would be in a position to fight for an Olympic place if that dream reignited within me. So I entered marathons and triathlons. That should have been enough, but there was still the TV presenter Ben Fogle’s nagging invitation at the back of my mind. I spoke to some of my rowing colleagues about whether they fancied the race; I didn’t receive any enthusiastic responses. I knew that if I entered the race, even though it is billed primarily as an adventure, I would want to win. Would doing it with Ben give me the best chance of winning it? No. There was part of me that thought the chance to be an underdog with no pressure was appealing. I got in contact with Ben. We spoke about the remaining costs of the race. We felt we stood a better chance than most, but it would still take work to secure it. Of course, I also had to take into account the loss of earnings that would result from being away from home. I had to weigh up the pros and cons of doing the race. I decided to do it.

It's not good to spend too much time online. You need to get out into the real world, said Dad. He's difficult to argue with, so I decided to find out what people who have studied the subject say – and it's quite interesting. Generally, research shows that most teenagers who use social media have a wide circle of real-life friends, a good sense of identity and belonging, and are developing the essential technical skills we need to be citizens of a digital age.
Social networking has become an integral part of modern childhood. Teenagers don’t consume media like adults do – they inhabit it. It performs a similar function to hanging around at the youth club, as today’s parents used to do when they were younger. It can help teenagers develop a sense of identity, deal with teenage issues and get on with their peers.
Embracing social media can help if you’re not outgoing or have a specialized interest. It can also help you if you’re a quiet person and want to connect with others who share your interests. If you're one of only three people in your school who’s into a particular type of music, traditionally you would have felt quite isolated. But if you discover a social networking group of like-minded people, there’s suddenly a necessary critical mass and you can still be popular, just in a different context."

However, as technology has transformed industry after industry, rollercoaster designers will also have to embrace the latest advances, such as virtual reality. But, according to experts, the physical coaster experience will remain king for many years to come."

At 25, Miranda Ellington has achieved a lot as a choreographer. She creates works for many theatres and dance companies. She also dances from time to time. It's hard to understand why she fits both activities into her busy schedule.
As a choreographer, Miranda is in a teaching role. She enjoys working with young students. They are receptive to exploring new ideas and are hungry for success. However, they don't yet have a clear sense of their strengths and weaknesses.
When Miranda starts working with a new group, she concentrates on the dance steps and the music dictates what she does. If dancers aren't responding well to a particular composer's music, that can be frustrating, but she still has to find solutions.
Miranda doesn't believe in attaching herself to one institution. She has to be prepared to adapt the way she works each time she goes somewhere new.
The conversation turns to the recent documentary on professional ballet dancers and choreographers. The documentary gives viewers an accurate portrayal of life inside a dance company.
Miranda has done such a range of work that it's hard to categorize her. She sees herself as someone who wants to widen her horizons."

A friend asked me why I travel when I can see everything on television. I agreed that you can see amazing things on TV, but why sit at home on your sofa when there’s so much out there to experience. I guess that conversation gave me the idea for my crazy four-day trip, and a film that aimed to get people to turn off their television sets. I had a mate getting rid of his old sofa, so I fixed it up and connected it to some old seatbelts. I put my luggage on the seats and slept on the sofa each night. Several friends joined me on the way, helping to pull the sofa along and encouraging me to keep going. I’ve been on several expeditions on foot in recent years, but this was something completely new. Not only was it the longest distance I have ever walked, but it was also on main roads, which meant I could stop at a roadside café and relax on the sofa with a cappuccino instead of having the wind blowing away my sandwiches while I sit on a rock.

When I read about swimming trips in the sea around some small Greek islands, I was excited. I'd never tried group trips before. My brother was busy, so I decided a group holiday might suit me. The man at the Greek port was curious when I asked for a single ticket. I explained I wouldn't be alone for long; I’d be joining ten others to swim around the tiny islands. We did a short swim to split us into speed groups, then it was time for our first proper swim. I was nervous. I’d trained in my local pool and done some river swimming, but never long distances in the open sea. Soon, the waves got bigger and I was at the back of the slow group. I watched faster swimmers moving ahead like dolphins. I wanted to complete this first distance, though, and was delighted when I finally managed it on my own.

I like my job as a flight attendant. I have been to many places, including the US and Australia. I work with great people, and I have a lot of time off. Life is always exciting, which makes it a great job for a young person like me.
When I was a child, I often flew unaccompanied to boarding school. I felt lonely, so I would ask the flight attendants to let me help give out meals to passengers. Sometimes, they would let me. I remembered that later, when I was working in a bank and was feeling unhappy. I decided to look for a new job and there was a lot of young people at the interview. Many were like me, changing careers. I practised what to say and I got the job.
I would recommend this kind of work to anyone. There are so many things that make it worthwhile, but the free flights I get aren’t top of the list. Most airline staff are incredibly hard-working, and there’s a saying – ‘no-one’s finished till everyone’s finished.’ It’s like a big family – even though we don’t see each other all the time, we’re still close. When I’m not working, I don’t have to take work home. And if I do get difficult passengers, which is rare, I always know the flight will soon be over and I’ll probably never see them again."

At the summer camp, I like seeing the children succeed at things they never thought they could do. Most of the children know how to swim and play table-tennis, but rock climbing is new for most of them. Some children feel nervous, but after some encouragement, they try and they all get to the top. This makes them feel great. We also get children who miss home at the beginning of the week. It's the ten- to thirteen-year-olds who feel like that the most. We don't let them use their mobile phones all the time. We tell them they can phone home after lunch and after dinner. Most children are fine in a couple of days and at the end of their week's stay, they all come up to us and thank us because they have had a great time."

Rock the Planet, a musical show, opened in London last year. It was a big success. The show has been very popular with everyone. There are a lot of young actors in the show. They are very busy. They have normal school lessons each day at the theatre. They also have to learn to play their instruments and perform in front of a lot of people. The show is on in London for another year. It is well worth seeing."
