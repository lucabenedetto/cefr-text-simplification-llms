Some time ago, there was a website that talked about the risks of public check-ins. It said that if you post something online, it can be seen by a lot of people. This made people think about the downsides of sharing their lives online. The website also talked about the benefits of sharing online, such as wealth and fame.
There are a lot of people who share their lives online. Some people use social media to share photos and stories. Others use blogs to write about their thoughts and experiences. One person who shared his life online was Justin Hall. He started a blog in 1996 and wrote about his life. He also shared photos and videos. One day, Hall's blog was taken down because someone sent the address of his blog to his boss. This made Hall feel bad, but it also made him realize that sharing your life online can have negative consequences.
Another person who shared her life online was Heather Armstrong. She started a blog called Dooce and wrote about her job at a software company. One day, an anonymous colleague sent the address of Armstrong's blog to every vice president at her company. This made Armstrong lose her job. This showed that sharing your life online can have negative consequences.
However, Armstrong's story also has a happy ending. She was upset by the experience, but she stopped blogging for several months afterwards. She ended up getting married and restarting her blog with a focus on her new family. Today, she is a star in the burgeoning ranks of 'mommy bloggers' and her writing supports her household."

A long time ago, some scientists started a campaign to warn people about a movie called What the Bleep Do We Know. The movie showed that there is a lot about the universe that we don't understand. Some people felt that the movie was dangerous and issued warnings about it. The movie was very popular, but I couldn't see what all the fuss was about at first. However, when the movie moved on to describe some of the new discoveries, I started to see what the fuss was really about. One of the discoveries was that water molecules can be affected by thoughts. I had heard rumours about this before, but the movie gave me some evidence to support it. The evidence was not very convincing, but it was enough to make me believe that the discovery was real. The movie also talked about other discoveries, such as the expansion of the universe and the nature of reality. These discoveries were even more astounding than the discovery of water molecules being affected by thoughts. Despite what some people might believe, science shows no signs of reaching completion. We appear to be further away from omniscience than ever."

Writing novels is like planting a forest, while writing short stories is more like planting a garden. The two processes complement each other, creating a complete landscape. Writing novels takes a long time and requires a lot of commitment, while writing short stories is quicker and easier to complete. You can create a story out of the smallest things and experiment with different ideas. Short stories are like guideposts to your heart, and they can make you happy as a writer."

Science is a powerful force that has greatly impacted human life. It has improved our lives and presented challenges. It has also inspired artists and thinkers. Science has its beauty and its dangers. It has been used to heal diseases and to understand the universe. However, science is not perfect. It has its limitations and its flaws. Scientists are always working to improve their theories and methods. The history of science is filled with examples of scientists who have made significant contributions to the field. Science has also been used to control nature. We have the ability to manipulate the future through science. Therefore, it is important to be aware of the power and potential dangers of science."

From around 2015, major publishers started to report that sales of ebooks had flattened out or even fallen in some cases. This has raised concerns about the long-term potential of ebooks in the publishing industry. Some people believe that the ebooks hype may have driven unwise investment, with companies losing too much confidence in ‘the power of the word on the page’. Despite the evidence suggesting that digital and print can coexist in the market, the question of whether the ebook will ‘kill’ the print book still continues to surface.
The idea of one medium ‘killing’ another has often followed the unveiling of new technologies. Even before the advent of digital technologies, critics have predicted the demise of existing media. For example, when television was invented, many people claimed that radio would die. But radio ended up surviving by finding new uses. The same has happened with other technologies, such as movies, radio, and the phonograph.
The spread of the printing press in 15th-century Europe, the shift from silent to sound movie in the 1920s, and the shift from analog to digital photography have all stimulated nostalgia for older technologies. Not surprisingly, e-readers have stimulated a new appreciation for the material quality of ‘old’ books.
This should provide some reassurance to those who still worry about the disappearance of print books. However, the idea of the disappearing medium will continue to provide an appealing narrative about both the transformative power of technology and our aversion to change."

Every day, I wake up early, brush my teeth, and make coffee. I write about how some of the greatest minds of the past have approached their work. I want to provide a new way to see people and their routines. I also want to share my own struggles with creativity and productivity.
I have a lot of concerns about creative work and earning a living. How do you do meaningful creative work while also earning a living? Is it better to devote yourself wholly to a project or to set aside a small portion of each day? And when there doesn’t seem to be enough time for all you hope to accomplish, must you give things up or can you learn to condense activities, to do more in less time, to ‘work smarter, not harder’, as my dad is always telling me?
I have tried to provide examples of how a variety of brilliant and successful people have confronted similar challenges. I wanted to show how grand creative visions translate to small daily increments; how one’s working habits influence the work itself, and vice versa.
This book is about people’s routines. It’s about the circumstances of creative activity, not the product; it deals with manufacturing rather than meaning. But it’s also, inevitably, personal. I have documented all of my sources in the Notes section, which I hope will also serve as a guide to further reading."

Howard became a palaeontologist because he was inspired by a rise in interest rates when he was young. He found out that he wanted to become a palaeontologist when he was at university. He studied delicate creatures revealed on the surface of grey rocks. He got a job as a palaeontologist at a college in London. He often found himself contrasting the orderly nature of his professional life with the anarchy of private concerns.
One day, Howard's briefcase was stolen. He was fuming and returned to the college. He made an explanatory phone call and postponed the lecture. He reported the theft to the appropriate authorities and then went for a restorative coffee. He joined a colleague who was entertaining a visiting curator from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. And thus it was that Howard learned of the recently acquired collection of fossils, the study of which would provide him with his greatest challenge and ensure his professional future."

Charles Spence is a Professor of Experimental Psychology at Oxford University in the UK. He has studied how the senses interact to form our perception of flavour. Through his studies, he has influenced what we eat and drink. He has also studied how the environment affects taste.
Spence has written a book called The Perfect Meal, which is packed with insights that are fascinating to anyone in possession of an appetite. It includes information about how much we eat when eating with others and how music can affect taste.
Spence's lab is un-space-age. It has soundproof booths and stacks of ancient-looking audio-visual equipment. He can afford to work more creatively with cooks because he keeps his overheads low.
Spence is currently helping famous brands through reductions in salt and sugar. He points out that it is in their interests to help loyal customers stay alive for longer.
What, one wonders, are dinner parties like in the Spence household? They're all extensions of the lab to Spence."

Our brains are very busy these days. We have a lot of information to deal with, including facts, rumors, and things that are not true. We also do more things ourselves now than we used to. For example, we make our own reservations and find things in shops. We do a lot of different things at once, but it turns out that this is not multitasking. Multitasking is a powerful and dangerous illusion. It actually makes us less efficient. It also increases the production of stress hormones and makes it harder to focus. If you are trying to focus on a task while there is an unread email in your inbox, your effective IQ can be reduced by almost 10 points. Multitasking also requires decision-making, which is also very hard on our brains. We rapidly spiral into a depleted state in which we can end up making truly bad decisions about something important."

In a zoo in Sweden, a chimpanzee named Santino would sometimes break up concrete into pieces and throw them at visitors. Was he being spiteful? In caves in the US, female bats help unrelated fruit bat mothers if they can’t find the right birthing position. Are they being caring? Fifty years ago, people thought that animals didn’t have consciousness or feelings. But recently that has partially changed. Thanks to research into the behaviour of bats, chimps, and other animals, emotions of animals have gone from being a taboo area of investigation to being tentatively explored. The new research has started a debate about whether animals can be said to have consciousness. This debate stimulates a second, much less abstract, one: not of consciousness, but conscience – a person’s moral sense of right and wrong that guides their behaviour. If, as this research seems to imply, cows enjoy problem-solving, what does it mean for the production and consumption of beef? The observations may not be disputed, but the interpretation of them is. There are different views on what the new research means for the production and consumption of beef. Some people believe that we should stop eating meat altogether, while others believe that we should at the very least re-evaluate our view of animal cognition. The debate about animal consciousness is a complex one and there is no easy answer."

Critical thinking is a way of understanding what we read or listen to in a deeper way. It involves interacting with the text and thinking about the meaning of the words and ideas. There is a belief that argument is a way of finding the truth. Although technology can help us store and process information, it can also make it more difficult to think critically.
Reading enhances thinking and engages the imagination in a way that visual media such as video games and television do not. It develops imagination, induction, reflection, and critical thinking, as well as vocabulary. However, visual media can also improve some types of information processing.
Many people – particularly those who are younger – wind up underachieving and not making the most of their capabilities because of the way society views technology. It’s time to take a closer look at technology and understand the subtleties of how it affects thinking and analysis."

When Matthew Crawford is not writing or thinking about how we ought to live, he works as a motorcycle mechanic. He wrote two books about the benefits of manual trades and philosophy. One of his books is a quiet masterpiece about the benefits of the manual trades. The other book is a philosophical treatise on how to cope with modernity.
Crawford says that our attention is being pulled in many directions. We are being prevented from deciding what we want to be at the forefront of our mind. It is becoming more and more difficult to think or spend time remembering conversations we’ve had. And because everyone is trying to protect themselves from the irritation of constantly being interrupted, we close ourselves off and no longer want to do simple things like chat to strangers.
Crawford's proposed solution has two parts. First, we need regulation of noise and distraction in public space. More importantly, though, Crawford advocates skilled practices as a way of engaging with the world in a more satisfying way."

What do you do for a living? It's a common question that we use to define ourselves. When you're a philosopher, it's a little harder to deal with. It's because describing yourself as a philosopher sounds rather pretentious. However, philosophers are no different from the masses. They have established themselves as people who judge the activities of others and celebrate intellectual life.
Philosophy can help people look a little more closely at the practices and behaviours that define their lives. Sometimes this might reveal something we already know; at other times we might discover that our beliefs are hard to justify. Either way, merely by examining these ideas, we’ll be doing something for the benefit of everyone."

Foodies, gourmands, chefs and others who love food might expect that thinking critically about what and how we eat can contribute to culinary pleasure. However, philosophical discussions of food have often been about other topics, such as the acquisition of knowledge or the pursuit of pleasure. Food is inherently social and cultural. It is shared with those in our communities and provides us with dining companions and infrastructure. Ethical issues related to food include what we should eat and the extent to which cooking in restaurants and in the home differ. Cooking in the home is often more intimate and inclusive, while cooking for a living has different obligations. Food and dining can also play a role in bridging cultural gaps. We can come to appreciate others by learning to enjoy their food and forge personal bonds with people from other cultures by coming together to eat."

Rob Daviau is a US-based game designer who creates legacy board games. These games are different from traditional board games because they have a permanent impact on the game. For example, in one game, players might have to rip up cards, deface the board, or open packets containing new rules. The games play out over a fixed number of sessions and long-held grudges become woven into the fabric of the game.
Legacy board games were not expected to go mainstream, but most players love the concept. They see it as one of the biggest advances in game design for several years. The appeal of an unfolding adventure trumped any concerns about longevity.
The legacy format draws on video games and the demand for episodic entertainment fuelled by popular TV series. Daviau feels a sense of ownership, but he is keen to see where others take the idea."

Once upon a time, there was an octopus named Inky who lived in a tank at the New Zealand National Aquarium. One night, Inky managed to escape from his tank and swim across the floor to a drain that led to the Pacific Ocean. It was a story that was shared online and was popular among children.
One of the reasons why people find stories like Inky's so interesting is because they involve anthropomorphism, which means treating animals like humans. Anthropomorphism is often thought to be unscientific, but Dr. Frans de Waal believes that it is not. He argues that animals have many of the same abilities as humans, such as the ability to consider the past and the future, to demonstrate empathy and self-awareness, and to anticipate the motives of others.
De Waal also points out that humans have a lot of negative habits, such as tearing down animal habitats, polluting land and water, and developing methods of rearing livestock that ignore the welfare of the animals. However, he believes that we are emerging from this dark period and learning to think of animal cognition as being on the same spectrum, though not necessarily at the same point, as that of humans."

Once upon a time, there was a technology called robotics that has the potential to change the world. Robots have already been used in the automotive and manufacturing industries for many years. Experts say that in the next few years, robots will be used in many other industries. This technology will definitely impact lower-skilled people, but it also presents an opportunity for companies to grow and create new jobs.
In order to prepare for the future, we need to invest in education and training programs. We also need to develop new regulatory frameworks to ensure our safety and privacy. With millions of jobs at risk and a worldwide employment crisis looming, it is only logical that we should turn to education to understand and prepare for the robotic workforce of tomorrow."

Because it's there, the mountaineer George Mallory is said to have said when asked why he wanted to climb Mount Everest. People have a desire to understand why anyone would participate in such a seemingly meaningless and life-threatening pursuit. Climbing can be a very confining and restricting activity, yet it can also give a feeling of freedom. There is an apparent paradox in many forms of climbing. Climbing can help cultivate important virtues such as courage, humility and respect for the environment. One further belief worth exploring is that climbers who do not rely on other people or technology to help them, have to be totally committed to their goal in order to succeed.

My grandparents' garden was a beautiful place. It was on the bank of a river and sloped gently down towards the water. You couldn’t reach the river but you could hear the sound of the water and the birds that sang in the trees above. I imagined that all gardens were like this – a place of escape, peace and solitude.
My father was a quiet and withdrawn person. He had a lot of phrases that he liked to use, one of them being 'It’s immaterial to me'. He was probably disappointed that he hadn’t made more of his life. He left school without qualifications and became apprenticed to a plumber. It was not something he was passionate about.
I always wanted to like the piano but it did its best to intimidate me. The only thing I did like about it were the two brass candlesticks that jutted out from the front. I would often spend time imagining myself playing the piano, but I never had the opportunity to learn.
I wanted out of school as soon as possible. One day my father announced, 'They’ve got a vacancy for an apprentice gardener in the Parks Department. I thought you might be interested.' In one brief moment Dad had gone against his better judgement. He might still have preferred it if I became a carpenter. But I like to feel that somewhere deep down inside him was a feeling that things might just turn out for the best. If I stuck at it."

Since I was a child, I have always wanted to play football. My dad encouraged me to play, and I'm grateful that he didn't push me too hard. I had a friend who was also passionate about football, but he stopped playing and hasn't been involved in the sport since. I'm glad that I didn't have that happen to me. I have worked hard to improve my skills, and I know that with practice, anyone can achieve great things.
I also used to play other sports at school, but football was my favorite. I want to make sure that my son has the same opportunities that I had, so I'm trying to read him books even though he's far too young to sit still for long enough. I hope that he doesn't take after me in that way.
I have a lot of money, but I don't have all the answers. After I stop playing, I think I'll have a year off or perhaps even longer, doing the things I haven't been able to do all these years. I want to go skiing the day after I stop playing, but I can't do that now because if I were to break a leg on the ski slopes and couldn't play football again, I wouldn't be insured."

It was because of Sam Carter that we were living at Reef Point. Sam was my father’s agent in Los Angeles. He offered to find somewhere cheap for us to live. The beach had been deserted since the warm weather had been blanketed by sea fogs. Reef Point was seldom patronised by the casual day tripper. There were a lot of people at the beach now. My father was hard at work trying to write a script to a deadline. I moved out onto the beach, taking a book to read, and Rusty for company. Rusty was my dog. We had a lot of fun playing together. Sometimes though, there were things that he had obviously not dug up – a new sneaker, a bright beach-towel. We had been swimming that day. The sun was setting and it was getting cooler. We sat watching the surfers. They had been at it all day, but it seemed they would never tire. One surfer in particular caught my eye.

When John Maloof bought a box of old photo negatives at an estate auction, he discovered the mystery of Vivian Maier. Maier was a street photographer with a keen eye for capturing compelling images. Maloof has amassed an archive of Maier’s life and work, which includes her cameras, film, prints, negatives, movies, and audiotapes.
Maier was born in 1926 and spent much of her childhood in France. She returned to New York in 1951 and came to Chicago to work as a nanny. Maier was a private person but had a strong passion for photography. She always had a camera with her and dressed in oversized coats, broad-brimmed hats, and stout shoes.
Maier’s work is the purest form of art. None of it was done for any commercial reason. Her images lean toward women, children, the old, the poor, and the abstract. Maloof often wonders if he’ll ever work his way through all the negatives. Inspired by Maier’s architectural shots, Maloof actually went out on the street and began to take his own pictures."

When a novel is described as ambitious, it often means that it is not successful. However, this is not the case with Eleanor Catton’s book, The Luminaries. The book is set during the 1860s in New Zealand. A series of crimes have been committed, and a council of 12 men has convened to solve them. The plot is complex and exciting. Catton said she set out to write a murder mystery, not a historical novel, but found the past offered more opportunities for complications and misunderstandings for her characters to deal with. The book is long, but it is worth reading. It is a fun and engaging read that will keep you on the edge of your seat."

Any conversation about English conversation often begins with the weather. It is a traditional way to start a conversation in English. The writer Dr. Johnson said that ""When two Englishmen meet, their first talk is of the weather."" This observation is still accurate today. However, most people who write about the English ""obsession"" with the weather make a mistake. They assume that our conversations about the weather are actually about the weather. This is not true. Our conversations about the weather are not really about the weather at all. They are a form of ""grooming talk.""
There are certain fixed contexts in which weather-speak is used. It can be used as a simple greeting, as an ice-breaker leading to conversation on other matters, or as a ""default"" or ""filler"" topic when conversation on other matters dries up."

The silence on Centre Court at the Wimbledon tennis championships is very quiet. You can bounce the ball, toss it up to serve, and hit it. The trimmed grass, the rich history, the ancient stadium, the players dressed in white, and the respectful crowds all combine to enclose and cushion you from the outside world. The quiet of the Centre Court is good for your game. It helps you to focus and concentrate on the point you’re playing.
The silence is broken by a shock of noise when a point’s done. There is applause, cheers, and people shouting your name. You hear them, but as if from some place far off. You don’t register that there are fifteen thousand people hunched around the arena, tracking every move your opponent and you make. You are so focused you have no sense at all that there are millions watching you around the world as you play Roger Federer in the 2008 Wimbledon final – the biggest match of your life."

A young Englishwoman named Jane Goodall arrived in Africa in early 1957. She spent most of her life in Africa and became known for her work as a scientist, activist, and environmentalist.
In 1963, Jane Goodall's fame grew when a series of articles and documentaries were made about her chimpanzee research. Her writing for a popular audience, including award-winning children’s books and the bestseller In the Shadow of Man, has also increased her fame.
Jane Goodall's work has had a significant impact on the way we study animals and ourselves. She opened the door to our understanding of the social and emotional lives of chimpanzees. Her long-term study of wild apes along the shores of Lake Tanganyika in Gombe State, Nigeria, has been praised as one of the Western world's great scientific achievements.
Even as a child, there were hints that Jane Goodall would become a biologist. One day, she crawled inside a henhouse to find out how hens lay eggs. This event is often seen as the beginning of her career as a biologist."

During a conversation, Shirley Ford speaks to me in different voices, including the voices of a cheeky 8-year-old boy, his tired mother, and a very fast-talking alien. Her voices are recognisable to people who have seen children’s TV and cartoons, and to people who have seen computerised employee programmes about health and safety.
Shirley talks about what it takes to do voiceovers. She says that there is more to it than just being able to do funny voices. You also have to bring the script to life for an audience who can’t see you.
After school, Shirley enrolled on a drama course and had some occasional work singing jingles for TV adverts. One day, she was suggested to try out for the part of a rabbit in the soundtrack for a cartoon. She ended up getting a major part and realised she could do voices and that voiceover work might be the way to go.
The competition for work is fierce, and a good showreel is essential. Shirley recommends attending ‘specialist workshops’ and believes a passion for human sound is fundamental."

People often ask me how I became a cartoonist. It's a dream job that many people have. But most people eventually give up on their dreams and consider more realistic professions. To become a cartoonist, you don't need a university degree or much money. You just need your brain, your hand and something that makes a mark. If you feel that doing anything else would be impossible, then cartooning might be the right job for you. But it's a tough job and not everyone can do it. You need to be creative and business-savvy. If you're not comfortable selling your work, you probably shouldn't become a cartoonist."

Twenty years ago, I was moving house and had a lot of things to get rid of. I decided to throw away an electric guitar that my dad had bought me for my 16th birthday. I felt sad about throwing it away, but I took it to the rubbish dump and was about to put it on a pile of rubbish. Suddenly, a young man came up to me and asked if I was going to throw it away. I said yes and he asked if he could have it. I gave it to him and felt sad that I had thrown it away.
A few months later, I received an email from someone I didn't know. It was from a dealer and restorer of guitars called Keith Rushton. He said he had my guitar and offered to sell it back to me. I was so happy to get my guitar back and I started playing it again.
I had forgotten all about my dad's habit of putting name-and-address stickers on everything I had, including my guitar. My dad had been very keen for me to learn the classical guitar, but I couldn't make much progress. So I switched to the electric guitar, playing undemanding stuff. Now that I'm learning it again, I guess I'll have to form a band."

There has been a lot of talk about sleep lately. Sleep is very important for our mental, physical, and social well-being. It seems that people who have the hardest time sleeping are the ones who most appreciate how important sleep is. Dreams are important too. They help us find new patterns and create combinations that break through our usual habits of thinking.
When you wake up in the morning, you may have forgotten your dreams, but they can still have a positive impact on your day. If you write or create art, you may find that you are able to write or create more easily after a dream. Even if you don't write or create art, you can still benefit from dreaming. Dreams can help you to think creatively and flexibly, which can be helpful in many aspects of life."

It was twenty years ago that Susie Ray left London for a small coastal town in south-west England. She is a copyist artist who can reproduce the richness of an early-20th-century impressionist masterpiece as easily as the brilliance of a 16th-century Caravaggio portrait.
Susie has been in great demand for her copies of famous paintings. She has painted the works of numerous great artists, including Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh. Her reproductions are so faithful that art experts mistake them for the originals.
However, Susie has never been tempted to pass off her copies as the real thing. She believes that doing it badly would be letting the artist down. She also knows that making fakes tends to end up in trouble.
Susie has always been open about what she does. She will make it look as authentic as possible, but she will put her own signature on the back of the canvas.

During Ellen MacArthur's racing days, she loved the sea more than anything else. She had a special connection with her boats. They worked together like one. When she was on land, she felt that life was trivial. She often wanted to be back on the ocean, testing herself against the forces of nature. After she came second in a big race, she took you down into her boat to show you how she prepared for the race. She talked about the careful planning that had gone into provisioning and housekeeping. The boat was her world and she looked after it because her life depended on it. Now, she sees the world as a boat. It is a small, beautiful, and fragile thing whose supplies are running out. She has been working to save the planet. She believes that we have to design a way of not using things up. She also started a charity to give young people the vision to rethink and redesign a sustainable future."

Jordan Romero is 13 years old and wants to be the youngest person to climb Mount Everest. If he succeeds, he could become one of the most famous teenagers of his generation. Young people are spending more time on computers and games consoles, so Jordan hopes to inspire kids to climb their own mountains. He also wants to inspire kids to venture outdoors. Jordan’s team for the climb includes his father, Paul, and mother, Karen. They call themselves 'Team Romero.' If Jordan can climb Everest and Vinson Massif in Antarctica, he will become the youngest person to have climbed the Seven Summits. Few people achieve this under the age of thirty. Jordan has already climbed five of the Seven Summits and might actually do it before his teenage years are over.
There are some concerns about Jordan’s climb. Many people think that it is not a good idea to take a young child up such a dangerous mountain. They worry about the emotional strength and experience of a teenager. However, Jordan’s parents believe that their own experience as climbers will help them to guide their son safely. They also believe that watching Jordan develop will give them confidence.
Jordan is motivated by his goal of becoming the youngest person to climb Mount Everest. He is also motivated by the fact that every adventure is blogged about and every climb turns into a record-setting challenge. However, Jordan also knows that achievement too often replaces enjoyment during such challenges. If he wants to inspire others, he has to play the media game and offer something spectacular."

When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, it's probably not classical music they're listening to. Most people our age can name a lot of pop groups, but few of us know who Brahms was. I started doing a music degree, but the people on my course know no more about classical music than anyone else. If you don’t know who wrote the music, you are unlikely to own any recordings of their work. Classical music just doesn’t hold much attraction for most people, and that is particularly true of teenagers. There are a few reasons why teenagers don’t like classical music. First, the pace and rhythm of classical music are too slow for us. Second, classical music is too long and difficult to pay attention to. Third, the subject matter of classical music is not as appealing as pop music. Finally, the way we listen to music has changed. Nowadays, you can find any music you want at the click of a mouse, and yet the sound track to our lives is rarely classical."

I met Cody Simpson before. He is a 15-year-old Australian singer. He has already released a number of successful songs. How did a laid-back surfer guy end up on a stage in front of thousands and thousands of fans?
Cody started playing the guitar and writing songs when he was young. He was also a very talented swimmer. He was training hard with some of the best coaches and putting his focus into perfecting his sport. But then record labels came calling, and he had a tough choice to make. He had to choose between staying in Australia and continuing swimming, or taking a huge risk and moving with his entire family to the US.
Cody decided to take the plunge and move to the US. He gave up one dream in the hope of making another one come true. Although his family keep out of the spotlight and aren’t directly involved in his career, they are there in the background. Success, in whatever career you choose, comes from a willingness to say ‘yes’ to your big break, even when it’s a little scary to do so."

I woke up early and looked at the river. The ice was shining in the sunlight. I helped my grandfather to protect the buildings from flooding. I worked with many people in the town to lift the sandbags. It was a lot of work, but I was able to do it. My grandfather didn’t notice me much. I saw a boy on the river bank. He was trying to balance on an ice shelf. I was worried about him. I put on my wetsuit and jacket and went to the river. I found a lucky chain that my grandfather gave me. It is a special chain. I kept it close to me. I went to the kitchen and ate breakfast. My mom smiled at me. She said that I was up early for a Saturday. I went downstairs and stepped outside. I hurried towards the boathouse."

Mum caught Jess by the arm and asked her to come with her to the study. There was a painting on the table. It was one of Grandpa’s, but it was unlike anything he had done before. The picture was strange and beautiful. There was a river in the picture. It was not a real river, but it was a fantasy river. The riverbank was green. There were no animals or people in the picture. It felt right that way. There seemed no place for living things in this remote vision. Yet, Jess was captivated. She thought of the coming of autumn after a long, rich summer. Mum spoke again. The picture had a name. It was called 'River Boy.' The words seemed to carry a strange resonance. Jess knew what Grandpa’s response would have been. He would have said that painting is hard enough work as it is without having to explain every picture to everyone. And he would have said that artists should not have to explain their pictures to every Tom, Dick, and Harry who came along."

When I woke up this morning, I didn't mean to damage the carpet. It just seemed like a good idea at the time, as things so often do. I was trying to find a way of fitting my corner cabinet into a corner. Gran had given me the cabinet when she moved out of her house into a flat. It's really cute! I keep my collection of shells and fossils and interesting stones there.
The problem was, the cabinet was too tall. If I could only slice a couple of centimetres off the bottom of it... That was when it came to me. If I couldn't slice anything off Gran’s cabinet, how about cutting a hole in the carpet? It just seemed like the obvious solution. What Dad calls lateral thinking. I reckoned he would be quite pleased with me. He is always telling us to ‘think outside the box’. And that was exactly what I was doing!"

The novel 'The Borrowers' is about a family of tiny people who live hidden in the walls and floors of a house. They secretly borrow things from the normal-sized people in order to survive. When the author asked me to direct a TV adaptation of the novel, I knew it was going to be hard to live up to people’s expectations. The most important thing was getting the scale right. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans, so I had to make sure that the actors looked small. I also had to get the costumes right. The costumes were made out of heavy canvas material so that they stuck out in the way that dolls’ clothes do. Unfortunately, the weather was really hot during filming. But it all came together in the end, and I think the series was pretty successful in conveying the magic of the books."

Mom pulled to a stop at the corner of my new school, Palm Grove High School. She looked around nervously, looking for journalists that weren’t there. I told her everything was going to be fine. She kissed her fingertip and touched my cheek right before I got out of the car. Then she was off, leaving me alone with this whole new school and situation to deal with.
I walk in the school’s main office and get my schedule. English Literature, first period. Cool, I can deal with that. But I’m late. English is in Room 214, second floor. I studied the map the night before, as I didn’t want to look like a complete buffoon searching for my classes.
When I get to the door, I hear the teacher already taking roll. I slip in undetected and slide into the last desk in the second row. The girl next to me smiles. She scans over my very normal and, might I add, very clever outfit – jeans and a T-shirt. Ha! Nobody will ever suspect me now!
The teacher pauses in the roll taking. ‘Desert... McGraw?’ she says hesitantly. ‘Here.’ The teacher then smiles and introduces herself as Ms. Smigla. She talks a lot and eventually hands us our course outlines. After we review them and she tells us all about books we’re required to read this year, she actually gives us time to socialize! All teachers should realize the importance of this."

In the United States, teenage girls are expected to be Student Council presidents and have part-time jobs. Teenage boys and girls have a lot of responsibilities, including homework, tests, extracurricular activities, jobs, chores, and family obligations. They also have to deal with the pressure of trying to maintain a social life.
Teenagers today have a lot of stress. They have piles of homework, tests, and extra-curricular activities, jobs, chores, and responsibilities at home. They also have to try to maintain some sort of social life. Despite these stresses, teenagers still have to deal with negative stereotypes about them.
One teenager, Kristen Loose, says that people often make assumptions about teenagers. They think that all teenagers are lazy, disrespectful, and rebellious. However, Loose believes that this is not true. She says that teenagers today have a lot of responsibilities and that they are not lazy.
Another teenager, Lindamarie Olsen, says that she gets about 18 hours of leisure time a week. However, she does not spend most of her time on social media or television. Instead, she focuses much of her energy on volunteer work.
In 20 years, it is likely that the stereotype of teenagers will have changed. However, one thing is for sure, teenagers will continue to prove that they are capable of great things."

The teenage members of the Earth to Sky Calculus Club live in Bishop, a mountain town in the US, surrounded by wilderness. They have launched over fifty balloons to the edge of space. It's a long-running science project and a backcountry adventure. The teenagers get involved because it's part astronomy experiment and part adventure. I joined them one weekend in late spring. They were releasing a high-altitude balloon, hoping to record shooting stars.
A few things happen when the balloon goes up. First, it grows to the size of a small car. Then, it pops in a dramatic explosion. Finally, a parachute helps the equipment inside the lunch box land safely back on Earth.
Getting the lunch box back is not straightforward. It often lands somewhere in the middle of nowhere. To find it, the recovery team has to drive south of the Sierra and then back up the western side of the mountain range. It can take a long time to find the lunch box. But it's also a perfect opportunity to argue over the effects of atmospheric waves and share stories of adventure."

Chloe Morgan is a palaeontologist. She started her interest in the field when she was fifteen. She was inspired by her younger brother's interest in dinosaurs and by an article she read about recent discoveries. She felt that Palaeontology was a unique and rewarding career choice.
One day, Chloe met her first professional palaeontologist, Matt Cornelius. He was famous and approachable. She was nervous at first, but she felt more at ease when he showed her patience and willingness to listen.
Dinosaurs continue to fascinate us because they speak to our innate explorer instincts. They are also a reminder that there is still more out there to be discovered.
Chloe is passionate about sharing her knowledge and enthusiasm for Palaeontology with others. She likes to reach out to young people and explain the complexities of science. She believes that everyone has the potential to learn about science and that it is important to inspire young people to be curious and to explore new possibilities."

When you travel by car with your family, even when you're young, you know that you're not 'there yet.' Once you get there, it's not 'there' anymore, it's 'here.' If you really think there's a chance that you're 'there yet,' you should be asking 'Are we there yet? ' And parents often get tired of hearing that question over and over.
There are a lot of things you can do when you're travelling by car. You can watch DVDs, listen to music, or play puzzles. You can also act as co-pilot and help your parents adjust the radio station and temperature.
Sometimes, things can get out of control and a fight can break out. But your parents will usually be there to help you and keep you safe. And once you're finally 'there,' you'll see the grown-ups tumble out of the car and go as far away as they can from the kids."

John and Zuzi Morgan have a café in Oxford, UK, where people can enjoy coffee, cake, and play board games. They decided to turn their love of tabletop games into a full-time business because there is so much technology and people are busy on their mobile phones and gadgets. The games played in their café are called Eurogames. They are known for their gentle themes and easy rules.
One of the most successful Eurogames is Pandemic. It was created by Matt Leacock, a North American designer. Pandemic is a cooperative game where players must work together to solve global problems. It is a popular game because it is easy to learn and fun to play.
The growth of the video games industry has also helped to the success of Eurogames. Video games have become more popular than ever before, and this has led to a rise in the popularity of tabletop games. As a result, more people are open to playing games than ever before.
In John and Zuzi's café, tabletop gaming has become more than entertainment. It has become a way for people to share their love of games and interact with each other. This trend is set to continue in the future."

Television presenter Helen Skelton has completed various dangerous challenges for charity, including a desert marathon run and a journey down the Amazon river in a tiny boat. For her latest challenge, Helen walked on a high wire, a long thin piece of metal, 66 meters above the ground. There was no safety net, only a belt around her waist attached to another wire above. To help her keep her balance and not to fall, she carried a long stick, weighing eight kilograms. Helen took lessons from an expert high-wire walker. Although she already had a few circus skills, she quickly discovered that high-wire walking was completely different. The training was a shock, said Helen. 'I didn’t realise how strong I’d need to be. Every day started at 8 am with a run up a steep hill; then came an hour of exercises, with another hour of them after my day practising on the wire. I also had to learn how to fall onto the wire so that if I slipped I could carry on. Every time I fell on the wire it hurt badly. But it was essential to keep a positive attitude: if I was nervous and started shaking, so would the wire.

I work at a university in the US. My team and I are learning more about water birds, particularly one called the American black duck. We have started using a new piece of equipment called a night-vision scope, which allows us to see the ducks in the dark. We are worried about black ducks mainly because their numbers have fallen hugely. We don’t know whether there’s enough food on the east coast for these animals. We have lots of information about their daytime activities, but nothing about what they do at night, because we simply haven’t had the equipment. But this new ‘scope’ will produce really clear pictures, even on moonless nights, so we’ll be able to find out more and make better decisions about looking after the area where they live based on what we learn. It is very hard work. There are four of us, each working six hours daily. We have studied ducks in different locations, and I have had to take a boat to some sites and make notes on every duck I see. The weather hasn’t helped – some nights are mild, but more often it’s wet. Oh, and it’s so quiet I’ve needed lots of coffee to stop me falling asleep! We’ve only missed one working day so far, because the snow was too deep even for our special snow vehicles. Still I like the challenge of it, especially compared to what the summer will bring – hours in a laboratory, where we’ll look at our results together. It’ll be hard to be stuck inside – but it’s essential to do this. And I wouldn’t change it for anything!"

I work as a chocolate taster. My job is to make sure that customers get perfect bars of high-quality chocolate from the company I work for. Every week I receive samples of chocolate from the factory and I have to taste them to see if they are perfect. I also have to taste the raw materials that are used to make chocolate. I spend days choosing the most suitable ones to go into the chocolate. I have a kitchen where I can test and taste products I make. It’s wonderful to have a private space I can go off to during the day. No two days are the same in this job. Sometimes I am at the factory and others I’m out of the country buying raw materials. But that kind of variety, and lack of routine, is something I love about the job.

Sophia Grayson is from Circus Experience, a centre teaching young people circus skills. She says her course is popular because it includes many skills, such as juggling, throwing and catching things, trapeze, and business planning. On the year-long course, students gradually increase the amount of risk they take in each class and parents come along to certain classes to watch progress.
To be successful in the circus, performers need to avoid doing the same thing all the time and keep performances fresh and full of action. Training is very important for circus artists, like athletes, and the best performers are those who want success, have imagination and never stop improving skills.
The course also covers business planning. Many previous students set up businesses all over the world, and are happy to share their experiences. However, Sophia warns, it’s not a profession for making money."

Mariam loves her job because she gets to sing different types of music. Sometimes she sings classical, jazz, hiphop or rock. Or she might sing a funny little tune for a radio station or an advertisement. Sometimes she is surprised by the requests she gets from producers. Once she was asked to sing like a fish underwater! But she never argues, she just gets on with the job.
To be successful in her job, Mariam needs to have excellent musical abilities and the ability to learn quickly. There is often no printed music to refer to. Sometimes there are a lot of people singing different tunes and an orchestra as well. Mariam was terrified when she first recorded the background music to a film.

Starting out with basic fashion knowledge, Julie Deane has created a successful business with her 'satchels' - a traditional bag used by schoolchildren. These satchels are sold in world-famous shops and are popular among celebrities. Before choosing satchels, Julie made a list of different businesses and decided on her own idea. She found not everyone agreed with her, but she was convinced. She involved family from the start and worked with her mother to design the satchels. Although Julie didn’t know much about fashion blogs, they’ve been important to her success. At first, she sold about one satchel a week.

She was a good swimmer, and the coach at the swimming club she went to thought she might be good enough to become a champion. But the club was a long way from her home so it was difficult for her to fit in the training around her schoolwork. When they were teenagers, Jamie, who loved cycling, bought himself a special track racing bike and started taking part in competitions. Vicky thought it looked very exciting and decided to try it for herself. She says that was the best decision she ever made. Soon she was cycling every day and doing really well. The track was near her school, which meant it was no problem for her to attend training sessions after school every day.

Vicky told me: ‘For years I’d loved winning competitions but I began to get a bit tired of the whole thing – and when the excitement stops, there’s no point. Luckily, I went on to have a new career.’ Vicky got a job with a charity called CycleZone. ‘We work with young people who have never enjoyed sport,’ she says. ‘The first thing we do is teach them to ride a bike.

Last year, I went on a trip to the west coast of Canada. It was my brother Harry’s idea. He’s a journalist, like me, and he wanted to write articles about the trip. I had dreamt of visiting the area ever since I saw it on TV as a child. So I asked Harry if I could go too – until he finally agreed. We joined the group and set off in small boats. The guide had mentioned that very few people lived along that coast. The only other living creatures we saw on that first morning were dolphins and birds. We stopped for hours to explore the rock pools on the beaches along the coast. They were full of amazing coloured fish. It was great to be able to stop caring about how quickly or slowly the day was passing. We never forgot lunch or dinner, though, which we all made together over camp fires. When I finally fell asleep on the boats each evening, it really felt like stress-free living. When the time came to leave, I was sad. But I knew if I stayed, I’d miss family and friends. I was also looking forward to telling everyone at home about our adventures."

I loved telling my friends how good my dad was, but I used to take a book with me to read instead of watching. Starting secondary school, I was already tall. My sports teacher asked if I’d be interested in training with the basketball team. I enjoyed the session, but I thought I’d need to develop my skills before I took part in a real match. It took me a while to agree, but a few weeks later, I found myself playing against a team from another school. My parents came to watch, but it made me more nervous. But it was OK in the end. I practised every day and did really well. I joined an adult team before I moved abroad to a special sports academy in the USA when I was fifteen. The coach there trains Olympic basketball players, and it was fantastic to work with him. However, I can’t say I enjoyed my first experience of living far from my parents.

My city has a modern cinema that shows all the latest films I want to see, and lots of films for kids at the weekends. It’s close to where I live, but a year ago, I realised something was missing – the experience of discussing a film in detail with a group of people after watching it with them. So, together with two friends, I started a film club. We decided to keep our costs low, so we don’t hire a cinema. Instead, we choose a different location in the city each month. We’ve been to see how people do things in different places, but it’s always good to get back to our own club again. We’ve started a blog, too, because most people now go online for information about films, rather than read reviews in local papers.

Taking photographs was always my favourite activity as a child. When I was 15, I felt that if I wanted to take my hobby to the next level, I had to do something special. So I decided to start a personal project: I would take one photograph every day for a whole year of my life. I was amazed to discover that there were others who liked the way I saw and photographed things. I was also enjoying photographing a wide range of subjects. Then someone suggested that if my photographs all had a common topic or idea to connect them, my project would be even better – and I agreed. So I began to concentrate more on taking photos of nature scenes, especially of birds and the sky. A lot of them were black and white photographs, which was very different to what many other young photographers were doing – they were all taking colour photos. As a result I sometimes had doubts about my project, and I almost gave up several times. In the end, however, I trusted my own feelings, and became more confident about my photographic style and choices. One day I showed my project to my art teacher at school. She told me about a national photography competition for people my age. So I entered some of my photos, just for fun. I’ll never forget the moment when the judges told me that I had won first prize; I was so happy, as my project meant so much to me. It was the first time I realised that maybe my photography really was good, and that I might actually be able to work as a professional photographer. I now have my own photography studio and I’ve never regretted my career choice."

Last year, I joined the National Youth Challenge (NYC) because I knew they went camping and sailing and taught skills like public speaking. In the NYC, you can do different activities to challenge yourself and you’re always learning something. There are different levels, from beginner to advanced, run by adult volunteers called ‘leaders’. When you complete each level, you get a certificate.
When I first joined, my leader suggested that my first challenge should be helping to organise activities at a local children’s club for two hours a week. I decided to take up the challenge, but only because I wanted my first NYC certificate. Soon, however, I wanted to spend all my free time at the children’s club. It meant a lot more to me than just getting the certificate. And when I finished the challenge, the NYC leader let me keep on volunteering at the club because I’d built up some great relationships with the children. Now I’m there for about four hours a week and I always really look forward to going.

I was born in Denver, USA. I started snowboarding when I was eight years old. My dad took me to a resort in the mountains, about two hours from Denver. The hill was very steep, so my dad had to do a lot of persuading to get me on a board. I was so young, I hadn’t even thought of asking him if I could start snowboarding, but he was already into it and wanted me to love it too. And in the end, I managed just fine. After this experience, I started to love the sport and improve my ability. I started competing aged ten. I enjoy taking part in competitions and winning too. I have to think carefully about my future. Snowboarding is such a huge part of my life now, but I also feel it’s important to have something else I can do, just in case I don’t succeed as a professional snowboarder or if I get injured.

When I was fifteen, I wanted everything my friends had. I didn’t plan ahead, like I had no idea what I wanted to do when I left school. One day, my best friend got a new phone and I thought I should have one too. My parents said I could only have it if I paid for it myself, so I decided to work part-time and save as much as I could. I owe my parents a lot for making me do that – it taught me a really valuable lesson. I worked every Saturday in a café, but I didn’t really enjoy it. My parents suggested starting my own little business instead. I asked my mum if I could have a go at making necklaces, and I found it was easy to learn. I sold my first items of jewellery to my friends and family. They told me they were delighted with them, but I still needed convincing that they looked good enough to be popular with the public. There was only one way to find out, so I rented a market stall with my mum. Lots of people bought my things, and soon we were receiving calls from all over the country. It’s been such a lot of fun so far."

When Janine Stuart was young, she wrote a novel called Being Amelia which became a bestseller. Being Amelia is based on Janine’s life. In one interview, Janine said, ‘Because of my family’s moving around a lot, I’ve become good at making new friends. I understand what it’s like to be the only new student in a class, and that helped me to write about how the main character, Amelia, gets on in a new school.
Janine started her novel one summer, when she was feeling bored at home. Her mother had always dreamt of becoming a published author herself, and her teachers had always encouraged her to write, so it seemed like a natural way for Janine to pass the time. The year before, she’d entered a short story competition on a young writers’ website and won first prize. That’s why, when Janine finished Being Amelia and sent it to a publishing company, the people who worked there were immediately keen to read it. They loved it, and a year later, Janine’s novel was on sale in bookshops."

My name is Tom. I am fifteen years old. Three years ago, my family and I moved to a castle on a small island. My dad was invited to be the castle’s manager. He works for an organisation that looks after historical buildings. We were worried about the move at first, but we soon got used to island life. The castle isn’t very beautiful, but our apartment is comfortable. The island feels very sociable in the summer, and there are often parties on the beach. In the winter, there are not as many people on the island. But the adults all support each other, and help with repairs on the island. The biggest change for me was travelling by boat every day. I have to catch the bus to the harbour after school to get the ferry. Sometimes, the ferries don’t run, and I miss the last ferry home. So I always tell my schoolmates to hurry up when they come to stay with me. But we often get the most fantastic views, for example when the sun goes down over the sea. Some days, though, it’s so foggy that you can’t see a thing, then within hours it’s brilliant sunshine again."

I live in a beautiful house in Scotland. I love nature and wild animals, and I started a new hobby called birdwatching six years ago. I went to the mountains in northern Scotland with my family, where we saw lots of birds. I spent hours watching them with my parents, who showed me how to tell the difference between species and how to find the best places to see them. It was amazing, and I joined a local young birdwatchers’ club. My goal is to see 200 different bird species, and I’ve almost achieved that. I’ve been to Egypt and South America, where I hoped to see my 200th species. I didn’t mind that it didn’t happen, as I’ve learned that you have to be patient with this hobby. I posted a video online about this challenge, and many teenagers enjoyed it. I also think that birdwatching clubs should try to get more young people interested in this hobby. Everyone needs to connect with nature, whatever their age, and it doesn’t have to cost much money."

I started playing football when I was 7. I would rush home from school to play with other boys and girls. I loved it, and I was good at it. But my family thought that I would drop out, like I often did with other hobbies. But it never did. I was already dreaming of playing football professionally when I was older. And the opportunity came sooner than I’d hoped. I played in local tournaments, and one of the referees noticed that I was a promising player. He asked the manager of a professional women’s club to watch me play. After that, she asked me to join her club. I started regular training with a big club as a young 13-year-old. I improved enormously. But people still weren’t sure I’d ever be a star player, which made me feel a bit upset. But my coach encouraged me to just be myself, and believe in myself. I played in one of the club’s championship matches, much earlier than I’d expected. I scored the winning goal. And I’ve been lucky since then."

One of the most interesting developments in further and higher education in the UK has been the move to encourage novice students to become involved with research as early as possible. Research is not an exclusive activity for experts or scholars. It can also be seen as a natural and fundamental way to build knowledge and skills.
Research approaches and skills are useful not only in your studies but also in employment. They are ways of thinking about the world and ways of going about your own work. As a student, you make a contribution to knowledge. You do not just digest and repeat it, you make it. Making knowledge is based on asking questions, rather than taking things for granted.
Most students have always been researchers of sorts. You will have been carrying out some elements of research for projects and answered questions at school or in the workplace since your first few days there. You will also have been developing research and enquiry approaches and skills when exploring where to go on holiday, how to grow seeds successfully, how to fix things around the house, how to train your dog, how to find the right kind of music system, and how to buy the right kind of items for your needs online.
Critical thinking is particularly important in research. We need to be able not just to repeat what we’ve read and take everything in as if it was proven fact, but to engage with it, think about it, test it out, identify whether what we’re being told is presented in such a way as to trick us into agreement, or whether it is logical, reasoned and backed by evidence."

Cities have always been centers of intellectual activity. They have been places where people gather to discuss ideas and share their thoughts. However, city life is not always easy. It can be exhausting and overwhelming. Scientists have found that cities actually dull our thinking, sometimes dramatically so. One of the main reasons for this is the lack of nature in cities. Studies have shown that people who can see trees from their windows recover more quickly from illness. Even small glimpses of nature improve brain performance.
In recent years, it has become clear that living in cities has a number of negative effects on our mental and physical health. These effects include fatigue, stress, and depression. However, there is also evidence that living in cities can have some positive effects on our creativity and innovation.
The key to mitigating the psychological damage of the metropolis while maintaining its unique benefits is to find ways to integrate nature into city life. This can be done through a variety of methods, such as creating more parks and green spaces, and making it easier for people to access nature."

The mind is a complex thing. It is often thought to be located inside the head. However, there is evidence to suggest that the mind is more than just the brain. Things and neurons participate in human cognitive life. Stone objects, body ornaments, engravings, clay tokens and writing systems play an active role in human evolution and the making of the human mind.
The mind and the brain are often equated. Most of what we know about the human mind has been uncovered through isolating people from the material culture they are usually surrounded by in order to study them. This makes good sense if you are a neuroscientist, but it often goes unnoticed that much of our thinking takes place outside our heads.
There is a new theory that explores the different ways in which things become cognitive extensions or are incorporated by the human body. This theory is called Material Engagement Theory (MET). MET aims to explore the different ways in which things become cognitive extensions or are incorporated by the human body. It also investigates how those ways might have changed since earliest prehistory, and what those changes mean for the ways we think."

Photography has significantly changed the course of civilization and the way we perceive the world. It has been especially impactful in the United States, where photography became an integral part of American culture. Historians believe that photography is arguably the country’s greatest single contribution to the visual arts. It has moved to the centre of US intellectual and aesthetic discourse.
There are several reasons why photography was so appealing to the Americans. Firstly, it was a mechanical process that matched the growing enthusiasm for technology. Secondly, the camera was the perfect tool for representing oneself and family. Thirdly, photography was a way of creating and sustaining an impression of self and family. Finally, the photograph’s inherent realism was aesthetically pleasing.
Photography has also been used by artists in a variety of ways. For example, Andy Warhol used photographs in his paintings, silk screens, and multiples. Artists have incorporated photographs into their work to express themselves creatively and to represent their ideas."

In 1890, William James, an American philosopher and physician, defined psychology as the 'science of mental life.' This definition is still a good starting point for understanding psychology today. We all have a mental life and therefore have some idea about what this means. However, even though the concept can be studied in rats and monkeys as well as humans, it remains a somewhat elusive one.
Psychology is about the mind or brain, but psychologists do not understand nearly enough about its workings to be able to comprehend the part that it plays in the experience and expression of our hopes, fears, and wishes, or in our behaviour during experiences as varied as giving birth or watching a football match.
The endeavour of psychology is much like that involved in solving a crossword puzzle. It involves evaluating and interpreting available clues. Complex interactions are the norm rather than the exception in psychology, and understanding them depends on the development of sophisticated techniques and theories.
Psychology has the same goals as any other science: to describe, understand, predict, and learn how to control or modify the process that it studies. Once these goals have been achieved, it can help us to understand the nature of our experience and come to conclusions that can be applied directly to people’s lives."

In a storehouse in a business park in Michigan, USA, there is a museum of failed products. The museum has a collection of products that were withdrawn from sale because nobody wanted to buy them. The proprietor of the museum, Carol Sherry, sees each product as embodying its own sad story. The museum is a viable, profit-making business. It is a testament to the fact that most products fail. The museum was started by a man named Robert McMath who intended to accumulate a reference library of consumer products. But he ended up collecting mostly unsuccessful products. The museum is a reminder that we should not be afraid to fail. It is also a reminder that we should not be afraid to try new things."

Everyone knows that sports teams have an advantage when they play at home. But does anyone know why? Most of us probably think we do; after all, it seems obvious. But professional sport is changing faster than at any time in its history and much of what we used to take for granted is now open to question.
There are two main reasons why home advantage exists. First, the home team has the advantage of playing in front of their own crowd, which can give them a boost of energy and confidence. Second, the home team has the benefit of being able to make adjustments to the game plan based on the crowd's reaction.
However, there are some changes that have recently occurred that have made home advantage less effective. For example, travel has become more convenient and the top grounds increasingly resemble one another in their soulless efficiency. As a result, the impact of playing at home has declined in all major sports.
Despite these changes, there is still some evidence to suggest that home advantage still exists. For example, researchers found that the players’ testosterone levels were higher before home matches than they were before training sessions or away matches. This sense of territoriality may be connected to some primitive urge to defend home turf against interlopers."

The more I practice, the luckier I get, said Gary Player. This quote is famous and is valued by athletes and coaches. However, the meaning of the quote is not clear. Player didn’t literally mean lucky, he was speaking ironically. His real message was: ‘The more I practice, the better I get.’ Up to a point. Where that point is, is at the heart of the nature-nurture debate. The debate is about whether talent is born or acquired. There are different opinions on this topic. Some people believe that talent is born, while others believe that it is acquired through practice. However, there is no consensus on this issue. The most important thing is to practice. If you practice a lot, you will improve your skills."

A recent report found that many children living in wealthy countries feel lonely and unhappy. The reason for this is that these children have been spending too much time indoors, watching TV or playing on computers, and have lost contact with the natural world. This is a problem because it is making children feel sad and unhealthy.
A follow-up study found that most of the children interviewed said that they would be happier if they could go outside more. Many adults also talk nostalgically about the freedom of their own youth, when they spent long summer days playing outside. However, they rarely stop to reflect that they are the ones who have imposed that protective regime on their own children.
There are some good arguments in the book about the relationship between the fear of danger and child-focused consumerism. However, the author's arguments go too far and she does not provide enough evidence to support them. For example, she likens the modern treatment of children to a subtle form of racism. This is a very strong and controversial statement that is not supported by the evidence."

I am a research bio-psychologist with a PhD. I have done a lot of school and I am a good problem-solver. However, my schooling has not helped me much with the problems I face in life. Most problems in life cannot be solved with a formula or memorized answers. They require the judgement, wisdom and creative ability that come from life experiences.
Play is the natural means by which adults and mammals have always educated themselves. It is also important for children's development. All mammals, including humans, play when they are young. Children who have the most to learn play the most.
Play is the most democratic of all activities. It is voluntary, which means that players are always free to quit. If you can't quit, it's not play.
School has become more onerous and adults have replaced play with adult-directed sports and other activities. Our children don’t need more school. They need more play. If we care about our children and future generations, we must reverse the horrid trend that has been occurring over the past half century. We must give childhood back to children."

In many countries, there are a lot of young people in their twenties who use social media to find work. There are two popular social networking sites that are often used for job hunting: Twitter and LinkedIn. These sites offer the chance for direct contact with potential employers. However, with greater access comes a greater chance to make mistakes. For example, a young jobseeker in the US contacted a senior marketing executive via LinkedIn. The marketing executive was not impressed by the young jobseeker's message and sent a rude rejection note. This incident has made people think more carefully about how they use social media in a professional capacity.
There are a few things you should do when you are using social media for job hunting. First, you should explain clearly who you are and what you have to offer. Second, you should refrain from sending impersonal, blanket emails. Third, you should keep the tone humble if you want to avoid leaving a sour taste in the recipient's mouth."

Newspapers have been struggling in recent years. Their circulation has fallen and they are no longer the main source of news for most people in the US. Some people predict that newspapers will soon be extinct, but history shows that old media have a habit of surviving. Newspapers were once new media, and they became the dominant medium for news in the mid-19th century. However, the internet has changed the way we consume news. Now, we can get news from all over the world quickly and easily. We can also personalize the news to our own interests. All this is a world away from the straitjacket of newspaper publication. Yet few if any providers seem alive to the new medium’s capacity for spreading understanding and enlightenment."

If humans were truly at home under the light of the moon and stars, we would go in darkness happily. Instead, we are diurnal creatures, with eyes adapted to living in the sun’s light. We have engineered the night to receive us by filling it with light. This kind of control is no different from the feat of damming a river. Light pollution is largely the result of bad lighting design. It washes out the darkness of night, altering light levels and light rhythms to which many forms of life, including ourselves, have adapted.
Light pollution has a negative impact on many aspects of life. It affects migration, reproduction, feeding, and our biological well-being. Denying darkness is futile. It is as essential to maintaining our biological welfare as light itself. The regular oscillation of waking and sleep in our lives is nothing less than a biological expression of the regular oscillation of light on Earth. So fundamental are these rhythms to our being that messing with them is akin to altering our center of gravity.
Living in a glare of our own making, we have cut ourselves off from our evolutionary and cultural heritage – the light of the stars and the rhythms of day and night. In a very real sense, light pollution causes us to lose sight of our true place in the universe, to forget the scale of our being, which is best measured against the dimensions of a deep night with the Milky Way arching overhead."

A company recently announced that it will no longer track its employees’ paid holiday time. The founder of the company was inspired by an internet company that has implemented a similar policy. The company has 50,000 employees and provides a variety of services. The founder stated that employees can take as much leave as they want, as long as they feel comfortable that their absence will not damage the business. However, there are concerns about the practicality of this policy. For example, it could lead to increased guilt and stress for employees, which could in turn lead to a decrease in productivity. Additionally, it could lead to pressure from colleagues and office gossip, and could make it difficult for employees to take their rightful leave. Overall, the author remains doubtful as to whether being able to take as much holiday as you want is the true intention or the probable outcome of this policy."

Journal-based peer review is a process that ensures the quality of scientific research papers. It is often praised for preventing the publication of flawed or nonsensical papers. However, the process can also be time-consuming, sometimes delaying the publication of a paper by a year. Despite its drawbacks, journal-based peer review remains essential for ensuring the trustworthiness of published literature.
Preprints, which are drafts of papers that are posted online without having been peer reviewed, are a growing trend in scientific publishing. They bring academics back to the core of research publication, which is the rapid dissemination of new results. Preprints also enable informal scientific discussions and provide a platform for negative results.
The widespread adoption of preprints could have a significant impact on scientific publishing. It could help to reduce the time it takes for papers to be published, make it easier for researchers to share their work, and increase the visibility of negative results. By harnessing the web's culture of openness and accessibility, preprints have the potential to improve the overall quality of scientific research."

When I ask my students about poems, they often give me answers like ""a painting in words."" Their answers rarely satisfy me or them. One day I asked a group to choose an object and write one paragraph describing it empirically, as a scientist might, and another in the first person, from the point of view of the item itself. The exercise led to much amusement and useful discussion.
A poem is a thing made. Poets sometimes compare poems to wild animals or machines. But such comparisons fall apart upon closer analysis. The most productive thing about trying to define a poem through comparison lies not in the comparison itself but in the debate. A poem is a product of writing and rewriting just like an article, story, or novel. It never really becomes what they usually are – a thing created in order to become a commodity.
A poem is a thing that can surprise, if only for a moment. It is a home for deep feelings, stunning images, tender reflections and/or biting wit. It can also be a source of inspiration and creativity."

I carried it to the car and showed it to my wife. We didn't try it on because the risk of damaging it was too great. I hid it in our wardrobe and felt anxious.

Sleeping is one of my favorite travel experiences. I love to sleep when I travel, even though I sometimes feel a little guilty about it. When I travel, I often take naps or have lazy mornings. I also find that sleep is more intense when I am on the road. It's like an extension of my travels, not a pause or respite from them. When I travel, I open myself up to new sights, sounds, smells, and ways of being. New and unfamiliar stuff pours into me – cultures, music, landscapes, even ways of moving through space. It is when sleeping that I wade through this overwhelming river of stimuli. No wonder, then, that sleep becomes so much more intense when I am on the road.

The view was beautiful and it rolled away in an otherworldly blend of mountains, streams and forests to an endless horizon. I shook my head and smiled. My neighbour woke up and smiled at me. He said hello and asked me how I was. He was a salesman from Moscow and he was flying to the outer limits of civilisation. His English was not very good, but I managed to explain to him that I was flying to a city in Siberia. He was not convinced. He said that there was no road from Magadan and that I could not ride a bicycle. I explained that I had reason to believe that there was a road, though not many people used it these days. I was going to join my friend Al in Siberia. We had been friends since we were at school. I wrote to him and asked him if he wanted to cycle across the Karakorum Highway between Pakistan and China. He said OK. It was six years later that I was going to join Al in Siberia.

In the Red Bull Air Race, twelve pilots race through a series of pylons between 15 and 25 meters high. They negotiate sharp turns, barrel rolls and loops at speeds of up to 370 km per hour. I was invited to find out what it feels like to take part. I had to sign two forms before the flight. The first confirmed that I was in good health, the second that I would empty all my pockets. I also learned that I would have to try to stay orientated throughout the flight. I was told to relax and enjoy the view. Half an hour before the flight, I had a safety briefing in which I was told not to touch anything. By the time we were taxiing down the runway, I was ready to fly. I ignored all instructions received and would not relax and enjoy the flight. This is the cruel paradox of high-speed acrobatic flying. In order to survive it without passing out, you have to keep calm and focused. You have to tense up at the right time and you have to relax at the right time. Panicking is a bad idea. The flight was over in 10 minutes. It had been 'soft' compared to what the pilots endure when they race.

In 2004, Pen Hadow became the first person to trek to the North Pole alone and without being resupplied on the way. He swam through cold waters, fought frostbite and polar bears. He also made it to the South Pole the same year. Now he is back in the Arctic preparing for an expedition he says is even more ambitious.
Pen is a skilled explorer. He has a lot of physical endurance and is able to withstand extreme cold and harsh conditions. He is also very organized and has a strong attention to detail. He is married to Mary, a horsewoman, who shares his love of the outdoors. They live in the country with their two children.
Pen is going to the North Pole to collect data about the ice. This data will be used to help scientists understand how global warming is affecting the ice. He is also going to create a platform to engage people in what is happening in the Arctic Ocean.
Pen believes his mission reconnects exploration with the search for knowledge that drove previous generations into the unknown. He says, ""Our skills, which are otherwise bizarre and socially redundant, have become hyper-relevant. Suddenly, we’re socially useful again."""

I had the chance to do more writing and TV work, and to speak to businesses and schools. But there wasn’t anything on the horizon to get my competitive teeth into. I knew I wanted to stay in shape, so I entered marathons and triathlons. I also spoke to some of my rowing colleagues about whether they fancied the race.

It was a lot of fun, but it was also very difficult. I had to learn how to drive a snowmobile and how to feed and water the dogs. But I was triumphant. I emailed my friends and told them that I could chop with an axe, hammer a nail, and use a circular saw in the snow."

There had been a lot of talk about the food revolution in Britain, and I was certain that we had produced a series of programmes that made a genuinely innovative contribution to that. I watched the first programme and was pleased to see that it was well-received. The success of the show paved the way for other fascinating projects, including a book based on my experiences at the restaurant I own. In each project, there is a sense of being on a journey.

Bea was worried, ""We can’t stay here forever."" I agreed. We got back into the van and waited for Mum and John to stop laughing. We sat on the side of the road and watched John walk away. Mum stretched out on the grass. She asked me to tell her a story. I told her about the birds I heard the day before we left London. The story was long and I was tired, but I told it anyway. We stayed at the café all day. John was sad because he thought the hotel might be expensive. But Mum reassured him that they would have tea. We sat down in the shade of the terrace and drank tea. It was very sweet. We stayed at the café all day. When it began to grow dark, Mum made an open-air bed for us in the hotel garden. It was nice to go to sleep on the ground. We followed John into the tiled café. It was set back from the road and not far from where our van was parked. We sat down in the shade of the terrace and drank tea. We stayed at the café all day.

Lucy was talking to two other pianists at the Prague Classical Music Festival. They were older than her and good enough English speakers. They talked about the pieces they were playing, where else they’d travelled recently, and where they were going next.
Lucy had not wanted to go to the festival, but she had made it. Her dad bought her a white-gold necklace with an L pendant to congratulate her. Her little brother Gus got all caught up in imagining himself at the same festival one day.
Her teacher took her out for a special dinner to strategize a repertoire. The thing was, Lucy hadn’t even applied. Her mom had filled out the form and sent in the CD.
In the elevator to their suite after they’d left the party, her grandfather turned to her. ‘You did well in there, Lucy. I’m proud of you. This is an important festival, and there’s a buzz about you. They all know who you are.’"

It's not good to spend too much time online. You need to get out into the real world, said Dad. He's difficult to argue with, so I decided to find out what people who have studied the subject say – and it's quite interesting. Generally, research shows that most teenagers who use social media have a wide circle of real-life friends, a good sense of identity and belonging, and are developing the essential technical skills we need to be citizens of a digital age.
Social networking has become an integral part of modern childhood. Teenagers don’t consume media like adults do – they inhabit it. It performs a similar function to hanging around at the youth club, as today’s parents used to do when they were younger. It can help teenagers develop a sense of identity, deal with teenage issues and get on with their peers.
Embracing social media can help if you’re not outgoing or have a specialized interest. It can also help you if you’re a quiet person and want to connect with others who share your interests. If you're one of only three people in your school who’s into a particular type of music, traditionally you would have felt quite isolated. But if you discover a social networking group of like-minded people, there’s suddenly a necessary critical mass and you can still be popular, just in a different context."

When most people think of a family vacation, I guess a road trip through the western states in the US and a Canadian province doesn’t come to mind. However, my parents clearly weren’t looking to put their feet up as they organized our summer vacation this year. My dad seemed to have taken it upon himself to plan the ultimate family bonding trip. We packed a lot of stuff into the car, including suitcases, coolers, and clothing. We set off on our journey, which was called 'The Family Great American Road Trip'. As we drove west, we had many adventures. We stopped at a town in Oklahoma under the darkest star-filled skies. We learned the rule of the road: cattle get the right-of-way. We also visited Pagosa Springs, Colorado, and learned that what are marked as Jeep roads are best left to Jeep drivers. We drove on to Yellowstone National Park and watched the setting sun cast its shadows over bear habitats close to the roads. We had a close encounter with a bear and made some unforgettable memories. After watching a rainstorm blow through, we made our free-fall back south again. I knew that for me, the things I’d remember would be the unplanned, the spontaneous."

Rose Frost was sixteen years old and was going to live with her grandmother, Daisy. Her family was separating for two years. Her father had an assignment overseas, and her mother would be joining him, but Rose and her sister Amy were staying in England. Amy was completing her final school courses and would be living under the guardianship of the college Head. It was her last year at school, so it would have been unfair on Amy to move. To Amy’s delight, she had been given the best room at the college, with its own kitchen and study area. The free access to the Internet and phone had also not gone unnoticed. Rose was moving to her grandmother’s house. It was only vague holiday memories that Rose recalled of her grandmother, and she had never known her grandfather. Her parents had not been enthused by the idea of her living with her grandma, but Daisy had insisted that it was no trouble. Rose was sensible and very mature for her age. She knew about healthy eating, about keeping fit, and getting enough sleep. But this time Rose had insisted on one thing: she wanted her independence. Living with Daisy would be fulfilling all her needs, but Rose wanted to play music loud if she wanted, and to invite friends over or go out without having to ask permission every time.

Charlotte Grainger was inspired to write a novel by her primary school teacher. When she was 13, she started writing a novel and it is remarkably going to be published. She feels that her age shouldn't limit her ability to write. The book is a huge achievement and it is well-written.
Charlotte has always been a keen reader of famous fantasy writers. She was worried that her book wouldn't be good enough, but she was inspired by a book called How Not to Write a Novel. She also acknowledges her good fortune and her support from her parents.
Charlotte believes that aspiring writers need support and a lucky break, but after that, they are on their own. She encourages aspiring writers to keep writing and not to be discouraged by the challenges."

Our instructor, Gareth, told us that speed is our friend, not our enemy. We looked down the ski slope and saw David, who had some experience, skiing off down the slope towards the jump. He hit the ramp fast and flew upwards, arms flailing in the air. Something was wrong and we held our breath. He hit the ground and flipped head-first into the snow. Gareth informed us that speed is an unpredictable beast. I didn’t feel I was cut out for this freestyle stuff. I had enjoyed messing about on previous skiing holidays, but I knew I wasn’t one of those teenagers who spent their time doing freestyle tricks on ramps and half pipes. I decided not to try to join with the skateboarders. My parents decided to have a winter holiday at a training centre for freestyle skiing in the US. We practised our moves indoors and headed outside to try them for real. There were more setbacks before I finally landed properly. But I was delighted to have achieved such an elusive goal.

Imagine you're riding a rollercoaster in an amusement park. You come to a stop and inhale sharply before the carriage starts moving slowly upwards. A pause. Then there is a sharp drop and your stomach is suspended in the air. You hurtle quickly forwards, sharply left, and upside down. You let out a roar of fear that comes from the pit of your gut.
Amusement parks are a huge industry that delivers thrills and escape from reality. To create the perfect ride, there are teams of highly inventive engineers and designers. The skill of rollercoaster design is in compiling the pieces and creating a strong narrative.
However, as technology has transformed industry after industry, rollercoaster designers will also have to embrace the latest advances, such as virtual reality. But, according to experts, the physical coaster experience will remain king for many years to come."

At 25, Miranda Ellington has achieved a lot as a choreographer. She creates works for many theatres and dance companies. She also dances from time to time. It's surprising to her that she can fit both activities into her busy schedule.
As a choreographer, Miranda is in a teaching role. She enjoys working with young students. She finds it easier to work with students than with professionals because they're open to trying new ideas. They're hungry for success, but they don't yet have a clear sense of their strengths and weaknesses.
When Miranda starts working with a new group, she concentrates on the dance steps and the music dictates what she does. If dancers aren’t responding well to a particular composer’s music, that can be frustrating, but she still has to find solutions.
Miranda doesn’t believe in attaching herself to one institution. She has to be prepared to adapt the way she works each time she goes somewhere new.
The conversation turns to the recent documentary on professional ballet dancers and choreographers. Miranda says that the documentary gives a realistic portrayal of life inside a dance company.
Miranda has done a wide range of work. She doesn’t like to be labeled or restricted to one area of expertise. She wants to widen her horizons."

A friend asked me why I travel when I can see everything on television. I agreed that you can see amazing things on TV, but why sit at home on your sofa when there’s so much out there to experience. I guess that conversation gave me the idea for my crazy four-day trip, and a film that aimed to get people to turn off their television sets. I had a mate getting rid of his old sofa, so I fixed it up and connected it to some old seatbelts. I put my luggage on the seats and slept on the sofa each night, including one night on the beach. Several friends joined me on the way, helping to pull the sofa along and encouraging me to keep going. I’ve been on several expeditions on foot in recent years, but this was something completely new. Not only was it the longest distance I have ever walked, but it was also on main roads, which meant I could stop at a roadside café and relax on the sofa with a cappuccino instead of having the wind blowing away my sandwiches while I sit on a rock.

When I read about swimming trips in the sea around some small Greek islands, I was excited. I'd never tried group trips before. My brother was busy, so I decided a group holiday might suit me. The man at the Greek port was curious when I asked for a single ferry ticket. I explained I wouldn't be alone for long; I’d be joining ten others to swim around the tiny islands. We did a short swim to split us into speed groups, then it was time for our first proper swim. I was nervous. I’d trained in my local pool and done some river swimming, but never long distances in the open sea. Soon, the waves got bigger and I was at the back of the slow group. I watched faster swimmers moving ahead like dolphins. I wanted to complete this first distance, though, and was delighted when I finally managed it on my own.

I love my job as a flight attendant. I've been to many places, including the US and Australia. I work with great people, have a lot of time off, and life is always exciting.
When I was a child, I often flew unaccompanied to boarding school. Sometimes I felt lonely, so I would ask the flight attendants to let me help give out meals to passengers. I guess that's what I remembered later, when I needed an escape from my banking job and began looking for a new direction. There was a lot of young people at the interview, and many were accepted. They were often highly qualified like me, and were changing careers.
Before the interview, I practised what to say. I mentioned my strengths and previous work experience, and I got the job. I'd recommend this kind of work to anyone, as there are so many things that make it worthwhile.
When I'm not working, I don't have to take work home. And if I do get difficult passengers, which is rare, I always know the flight will soon be over and I’ll probably never see them again."

At the summer camp where I work, I really enjoy seeing the children succeed at things they never thought they could do. Most of the children know how to swim and play table-tennis, but rock climbing is a new experience for most of them. Some children feel very nervous, but after some encouragement they agree to try and they all get to the top in the end. This makes them feel great. We do get children who miss home at the beginning of the week. It's not the really young ones who feel like that the most – it's actually the ten- to thirteen-year-olds. We don't let them use their mobile phones all the time. We tell them they can phone home after lunch and sometimes after dinner. Most children are fine in a couple of days and at the end of their week's stay, they all come up to us and thank us because they have had a great time."

Rock the Planet, a musical show, opened in London last year. It was voted 'Best Musical' four times in the USA. The show is popular with people of all ages. There are a lot of young actors in the show. They have to be really good musicians. The actors have a lot of school lessons at the theatre. They also play a lot of music. The show is on in London for another year. It is well worth seeing."
