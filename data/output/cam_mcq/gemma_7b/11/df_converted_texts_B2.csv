Some time ago, there was a website that talked about the risks of public check-ins, which are online announcements of your whereabouts. The website said that when you post something online, you are also advertising your out-and-about-ness to everyone. This made people realize that there might be a downside to all the sharing that the web has enabled.

The web has a lot of opportunities to share your life with the world. You can post photos, write stories, and share your thoughts. But you should be aware that the water in the digital world is crowded and treacherous. If you expect your song of yourself to 'make people want to be with you', you'll be disappointed.

In the early days of the web, there was a young man named Justin Hall who started posting things on the internet. He was one of the first bloggers, and he showed that you can use the web to share your life with the world. But he also showed that you should be careful about what you post online.

Today, there are many people who use the web to share their lives. Some people use it to write about their families, others use it to share their hobbies, and still others use it to sell their products. No matter what you use the web for, you should always be aware of the risks.<eos>"

A long time ago, some scientists started a campaign to warn people about a movie called What the Bleep Do We Know. The movie showed that there is a lot about the universe that we don't understand. Some people felt that the movie was dangerous and issued warnings about it. The movie was a must-see for everyone, but it was not very exciting at first. When the movie moved on to describe some of the new discoveries, it became more interesting. One of the discoveries was the ability of water molecules to be affected by thoughts. This discovery was controversial, but many people found it to be compelling. However, scientists were not impressed. They said that the evidence was not good enough. They said that the movie's claims were too far-fetched. Despite this, the movie was still a popular success. It was seen by many people and had a big impact on them.<eos>"

Writing novels is a challenge, while writing short stories is a joy. It is like planting a forest or a garden. The two processes complement each other, creating a complete landscape. Writing novels is like planting a forest, and writing short stories is like planting a garden. The two processes take different parts of the brain and require different time commitment.

Since the beginning of my career, I have alternated between writing novels and short stories. I write novels and short stories in different sequences. I never write short stories while I’m writing a novel, and I never write a novel while I’m working on short stories.

Writing short stories is a necessary change of pace and offers several benefits. It takes less time to finish, and you can create a story out of the smallest things. You don’t have to worry about failing, and you can learn from your mistakes and use that in the next story you write.

My short stories are like soft shadows I have set out in the world, faint footprints I have left behind. They are like guideposts to my heart, and it makes me happy as a writer to be able to share these intimate feelings with my readers.<eos>"

Science is a powerful force that has greatly impacted human society. It has improved our lives and presented challenges. It has also inspired artists and thinkers. Science has its beauty and its dangers. It has its limitations and its fallibility. The history of science is filled with conflict and change. Scientists come in many colors, and their work is often characterized by perpetual conflict. The essence of scientific history has been conflict. Science has also brought us new knowledge and technologies. It has allowed us to control nature and improve our lives. However, science also has the potential to harm the environment. We need to be careful and responsible when using science. Science has become part of the human race’s way of conceiving of and manipulating its future. We need to be aware of the potential dangers of science and take steps to ensure that it is used responsibly.<eos>"

From around 2015, major publishers started to report that sales of ebooks had plateaued or even fallen in some cases. This has raised concerns about the long-term potential of ebooks in the publishing industry. Some people believe that the ebooks hype may have driven unwise investment, with companies losing confidence in the power of the word on the page. Despite the evidence suggesting that digital and print can coexist in the market, the question of whether the ebook will ‘kill’ the print book still continues to surface.

The idea of one medium ‘killing’ another has often followed the unveiling of new technologies. Even before the advent of digital technologies, critics have predicted the demise of existing media. For example, when television was invented, many people claimed that radio would die. But radio ended up surviving by finding new uses. The same has happened with other technologies, such as movies, radio, and the phonograph.

The spread of the printing press in 15th-century Europe, the shift from silent to sound movie in the 1920s, and the shift from analog to digital photography are all examples of how new technologies have impacted our relationship with books. Not surprisingly, e-readers have stimulated a new appreciation for the material quality of ‘old’ books.

This should provide some reassurance to those who still worry about the disappearance of print books. However, the idea of the disappearing medium will continue to provide an appealing narrative about both the transformative power of technology and our aversion to change.<eos>"

Every day, I wake up early, brush my teeth, make coffee, and write about how some of the greatest minds of the past have approached creative work. I write about the mundane details of my subjects’ daily lives to provide a new perspective on their personalities and careers. I also talk about my own struggles with creativity and productivity.

My book is about the circumstances of creative activity, not the product. It deals with manufacturing rather than meaning. But it’s also, inevitably, personal. I have included examples of how a variety of brilliant and successful people have confronted similar challenges. I wanted to show how grand creative visions translate to small daily increments; how one’s working habits influence the work itself, and vice versa.

The book’s title is Daily Rituals. I believe that a solid routine can be a powerful tool for creativity and productivity. It can help you to focus and stay on task. It can also help you to manage your time effectively.<eos>"

Charles Spence is a Professor of Experimental Psychology at Oxford University in the UK. He has studied how the senses interact to form our perception of flavour. Through his studies, he has influenced what we eat and drink. He has also studied how the environment affects taste.

Spence has written a book called The Perfect Meal, which is packed with insights that are fascinating to anyone in possession of an appetite. His book includes information about how the person in a group who orders first in a restaurant enjoys their food most and how much more food we consume when eating with others.

Spence's lab in Oxford is simple. It has soundproof booths and stacks of ancient-looking audio-visual equipment. He can afford to work more creatively with cooks because he keeps his overheads low.

Spence is currently helping famous brands through reductions in salt and sugar. He points out that it is in their interests to help loyal customers stay alive for longer.

What, one wonders, are dinner parties like in the Spence household? They're all extensions of the lab to Spence.<eos>"

Our brains are very busy these days. We have a lot of information to deal with, including facts, rumors, and misinformation. We also do more things ourselves now than we used to. For example, we make our own reservations and find things in shops. We're doing the work of many people while still trying to keep up with our lives. Our smartphones have become an important part of our lives. They help us do many things, such as making reservations, finding information, and communicating with others. However, there's a problem with multitasking. It's not as easy as it seems. When we think we're multitasking, we're actually switching from one task to another very rapidly. This can be very stressful and can also make it harder to focus on the task at hand. Multitasking also makes it harder to learn new information and make decisions. It's important to focus on one task at a time and to avoid distractions.<eos>"

In a zoo in Sweden, a chimpanzee named Santino would sometimes break up concrete into pieces and throw them at visitors. Was he being spiteful? In caves in the US, female bats help unrelated fruit bat mothers if they can’t find the right birthing position. Are they being caring? Fifty years ago, people thought that animals didn’t have consciousness, feelings or moral systems. But recently that has partially changed. Thanks to research into the behaviour of bats, chimps, not to mention rats, dolphins and chickens, emotions of animals have gone from being a taboo area of investigation to being tentatively explored. The new research has started a debate about whether animals can be said to have consciousness. This debate stimulates a second, much less abstract, one: not of consciousness, but conscience – a person’s moral sense of right and wrong that guides their behaviour. If, as this research seems to imply, cows enjoy problem-solving, what does it mean for the production and consumption of beef? The observations may not be disputed, but the interpretation of them is. There are different views on what the new research means for the production and consumption of beef. Some people believe that we should stop eating meat altogether, while others believe that we should at the very least re-evaluate our view of animal cognition. The debate about animal consciousness is a complex one and there is no easy answer.<eos>"

Critical thinking is a way of interacting with what we read or listen to in order to have a deeper understanding. It involves analyzing, evaluating, and judging information based on its relevance, accuracy, and credibility. Technology can complement and enhance human thinking, but it can also make it more difficult to think critically.

There are concerns that the increasing presence of technology is changing the way we approach complex problems and making it more difficult to really think. For example, the overuse of visual media and the decline in reading have contributed to a decline in critical thinking skills. However, there is also evidence that technology can improve some types of information processing and decision-making.

It is important to understand the subtleties of how technology affects thinking and analysis in order to make the most of our capabilities. By taking a closer look at technology and understanding its impact on our cognitive abilities, we can develop strategies to enhance our critical thinking skills and make better decisions.<eos>"

When Matthew Crawford is not writing or thinking about how we ought to live, he works as a motorcycle mechanic. He wrote two books about the benefits of manual trades and philosophy. He was inspired to write his latest book when he noticed that advertisements popped up on the credit card machine while he was shopping. Crawford says that these demands on our attention are becoming increasingly difficult to avoid.

There are a lot of distractions in our daily lives. We are constantly being interrupted and our attention is being pulled in many directions. This is making it difficult to think or remember conversations we’ve had. It also makes it difficult to have simple conversations with strangers.

Crawford's proposed solution has two parts. First, we need regulation of noise and distraction in public space. More importantly, though, Crawford advocates skilled practices as a way of engaging with the world in a more satisfying way.

No representation can replicate the feel of real things. If you engage with the world this way, manufactured experiences are revealed as pale substitutes for the kind of involvement you have with real things.<eos>"

Foodies, gourmands, chefs and others who love food might expect that reflecting on what and how we eat can contribute to culinary pleasure. However, philosophical discussions of food have often been about other topics, such as the acquisition of knowledge or the pursuit of pleasure. Food is inherently social and cultural. It derives from historical contexts and is shared with those in our communities. It also brings people together and provides infrastructure for growing and distributing food. Ethical issues related to food include what we should eat and the extent to which cooking in restaurants and in the home differ. Cooking in the home is often more intimate and inclusive, while cooking for a living involves different obligations and restrictions. Food and dining can play a role in bridging cultural gaps. We can come to appreciate others by learning to enjoy their food and forge personal bonds with people from other cultures by coming together to eat.<eos>"

Rob Daviau is a US-based game designer who specializes in creating legacy board games. Legacy board games are different from traditional board games because they have a permanent impact on the game. Decisions made during gameplay can have a lasting effect on the game, such as ripping up cards, defacing the board, or opening packets containing new rules.

Daviau designed a legacy version of the classic board game Risk called Risk Legacy. In Risk Legacy, decisions made during gameplay have a permanent impact on the game. For example, players might have to rip up cards, deface the board, or open packets containing new rules.

Legacy board games are popular among many gamers. They offer a new level of commitment, intensity, and excitement. Many gamers feel that legacy games are one of the biggest advances in game design in several years.

The legacy format draws on video games and the demand for episodic entertainment fuelled by popular TV series. Daviau feels a sense of ownership, but he is also keen to see where others take the idea.<eos>"

One night, an octopus named Inky escaped from his tank at the National Aquarium in New Zealand. It was a story that was shared online. Part of the fun of the story is that it involves animals behaving like humans. Octopuses are especially intelligent creatures. They have been observed exhibiting many of the key behaviors that were thought to distinguish humans from animals. These behaviors include the ability to consider the past and the future, to demonstrate empathy and self-awareness, and to anticipate the motives of others.

However, there are some differences between human and animal intelligence. Humans have the ability to speak language and use complex tools. Animals do not have these abilities. But animals are still very smart creatures. They have a lot of skills that humans do not have. For example, octopuses can remember where they have hidden their food. Squirrels can climb trees very quickly. And dolphins can navigate using echolocation.

The story of Inky the octopus is a reminder that animals are smart creatures. They are capable of learning and adapting to their environment. They are also capable of exhibiting complex behaviors.<eos>"

Once upon a time, there was a technology called robotics that has the potential to change the world. Robots have already been used in the automotive and manufacturing industries for many years. Experts predict that in the next few years, robots will be used in many other industries. This technology will definitely impact lower-skilled people, but it also presents an opportunity for companies to grow and create new jobs.

The development of new technologies such as motion control, sensor technologies, and artificial intelligence will give rise to a new class of robots that can interact with humans in many ways. These robots will live alongside us in our homes and provide us with new services.

In order to prepare for the robotic workforce of tomorrow, we need to invest in education and training programs. We also need to develop new regulatory frameworks to ensure our safety and privacy. With millions of jobs at risk and a worldwide employment crisis looming, it is only logical that we should turn to education to understand and prepare for the robotic workforce of tomorrow.<eos>"

There are different types of climbing activities, such as playing around on boulders or scaling Himalayan peaks. The style used to tackle any climb depends on the rules of that particular activity. Climbing can be very confining, but it can also be a simple and freeing experience.

When asked why people climb, there are many different answers. Some people climb because it is in their genes, while others climb because it helps cultivate important virtues such as courage, humility and respect for the environment. Climbing can also help develop strength and endurance.<eos>"

My father was a quiet and withdrawn person. He had a few phrases that he liked to use, one of them being 'It’s immaterial to me'. He was probably disappointed that he hadn’t made more of his life.

I always wanted to like the piano but it did its best to intimidate me. The only thing I did like about it were the two brass candlesticks that jutted out from the front. I would often spend time imagining myself playing the piano, but I never had the opportunity.

I wanted out of school as soon as possible. One day my father announced, 'They’ve got a vacancy for an apprentice gardener in the Parks Department. I thought you might be interested.'

Jonny’s bass guitar turned out well, but he didn’t initially think of it as a career. He was also into painting and sculpture. After finishing school, he studied architecture but dropped out because he felt too individualistic. He then realized that guitar-building is a type of sculpture and decided to focus on that.

Ever since then, Jonny has made guitars for a living. He has developed a reputation as one of the best guitar-makers around.

The trimmed grass, the rich history, the ancient stadium, the players dressed in white, and the respectful crowds all combine to create a feeling of enclosure and comfort. The quiet of the Centre Court is good for my game. It helps me to focus on the point I’m playing and to shut everything else out.

The silence is broken by a sudden noise when a point is done: applause, cheers, and people shouting your name. You hear them, but as if from a distant place. You don’t register that there are thousands of people watching you. You are so focused that you have no sense at all that there are millions watching you as you play Roger Federer in the 2008 Wimbledon final.

A young Englishwoman named Jane Goodall arrived in Africa in early 1957. She spent most of her life in Africa and became known for her work as a scientist, activist, and environmentalist.

In 1963, Jane Goodall's fame increased when the National Geographical Society produced articles and documentaries about her chimpanzee research. Her writing for a popular audience, including award-winning children’s books and the bestseller In the Shadow of Man, has also helped to reinforce her fame.

Jane Goodall's most significant contribution to science is her research on chimpanzees. She discovered that chimpanzees eat meat, create and use tools, share with humans a similar set of emotions, and have complex social systems. Her scholarly book, The Chimpanzees of Gombe (1986), is the single most authoritative work on chimpanzee research.

Even as a child, there were hints that Jane Goodall would become a biologist. One day, she crawled inside a henhouse to find out how hens lay eggs. This event is a symbol of her curiosity and determination.<eos>"

Her voices are recognizable to viewers of children’s TV and cartoons, and to people who have seen computerised employee programmes about health and safety.

Shirley talks about what it takes to do voiceovers. She says that lots of actors, some very highly regarded, can do funny voices, but there's more to it than that. You have to bring the script to life for an audience who can’t see you.

After school, Shirley enrolled on a drama course and had some occasional work singing jingles for TV adverts.

If you feel that doing anything else would be impossible, then cartooning might be the right job for you. But it’s a tough job and not everyone can do it. You also need to be able to sell your work and be comfortable with the business side of being a cartoonist.<eos>"

Twenty years ago, I was moving house and having a clear-out. I decided to throw away an electric guitar that my dad had bought me for my 16th birthday. I felt a constant, aching sorrow for what I’d done. Then a few months ago, I received an email that changed my life. Someone had found my guitar and was offering to sell it back to me. I was able to buy it back and play it again. I had a sudden, vivid memory of my birthday, back in 1978, when my parents presented the instrument to me. I felt that special pain of holding down the wires to play a chord. The electric guitar is not really a solo instrument. Now that I’m learning it again, I guess I’ll have to form a band.<eos>"

There has been a lot of talk about sleep lately. Sleep is very important for our mental, physical, and social well-being. It seems that people who have the hardest time sleeping are the ones who most appreciate how important sleep is. Dreams are important too. They help us find new patterns and create combinations that break through our usual habits of thinking.

When you wake up in the morning, you may have forgotten your dreams, but they can still have a positive impact on your day. If you write or create art, you may find that you are able to write or create more easily after a dream. Even if you don't write or create art, you can still benefit from dreaming. Dreams can help you to think creatively and flexibly, which can be helpful in many aspects of life.<eos>"

It was twenty years ago that Susie Ray left London for a small coastal town in south-west England. She is a copyist artist who is able to reproduce the richness of an early-20th-century impressionist masterpiece as easily as the brilliance of a 16th-century Caravaggio portrait.

Susie has been in great demand since her 30 years as a copyist artist. She has painted the works of numerous great artists, including Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh. Her reproductions are so faithful that art experts mistake them for the originals.

However, Susie has never been tempted to pass off a copy as the real thing. She believes that doing it badly would be letting the artist down. She also points out that she isn’t rich and has struggled at times.

When younger painters approach Susie for advice, she stresses the importance of learning to draw and to represent things accurately. She also emphasises how much she’s studied to be able to do what she does.

Susie has occasionally tried her own thing. She once attempted oil paintings of fishing nets, but they ended up just looking like photographs. Perhaps it’s like surviving on bread and water after a lifetime of food cooked by a top chef.<eos>"

During Ellen MacArthur's racing days, she was passionate about the sea. It was her great obsession from childhood. With her boats, she had a unique connection. They worked as one. When she was on land, life felt trivial. After she came second in a solo round-the-world race, she took you on a tour of her boat. She talked about the careful planning that had gone into provisioning and housekeeping. The boat was her world and she looked after it because her life depended on it.

Now, she sees the world as a boat. It is a small, beautiful, and fragile thing whose supplies are running out. Her turning point came on a trip to South Georgia, where she helped with a rare bird survey on albatrosses. She realised that we have to design a way of not using things up. She also launched the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a charity that works through business and education to give young people the vision to rethink and redesign a sustainable future.<eos>"

Jordan Romero is 13 and wants to be the youngest person ever to climb Mount Everest. If he succeeds, he could become one of the most famous teenagers of his generation. Young people are spending more time on computers and games consoles, so Jordan hopes to inspire kids to climb their own mountains. Or, at least, to venture outdoors. Jordan’s team for the climb includes his father, Paul, and mother, Karen. They call themselves 'Team Romero' and climbing Everest is only part of their goal. If Jordan can climb Everest and Vinson Massif in Antarctica, he will become the youngest person to have climbed the Seven Summits. Few people achieve this under the age of thirty. Jordan has already climbed five of them and might actually do it before his teenage years are over.

There are some concerns about Jordan’s climb. Many people think that a young climber might not be emotionally strong enough or have enough experience to develop the good judgment and reactions a climber must have in order to take part in such a project safely. However, Jordan’s parents believe that their own experience as climbers will help them guide their son. They also think that watching Jordan develop gives them confidence.

Jordan’s motivation is also a question. Some people might wonder if this is just an ambitious father taking his own love of adventure to a dangerous extreme. However, Paul insists that this project isn’t about him trying to become famous for his son’s achievements. He says, 'At first, he talked about it as something to do later in life, but when we discussed it, we thought: ‘Why not now?’ We talk to him regularly to make sure he hasn’t lost the motivation to do it.'<eos>"

When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, it's probably not classical music they're listening to. Most people our age can list the names of dozens of pop groups, but few of us know who Brahms was. I have just started doing a music degree, but the people on my course know no more about classical music than anyone else our age. If you don’t know who wrote the music, you are unlikely to own any recordings of their work. The statistics are depressing for a lover of classical music. Apparently only a small percentage of concert tickets sold last year were for classical music events, and the average classical recording sells a mere few hundred copies.

So, why don’t teenagers like classical music? Well, first of all, the pace and rhythm of classical music are not very appealing to us. We like to talk fast, play fast, and think fast. In addition, classical music is often long and difficult to pay attention to. The subject matter of pop music also holds much more appeal than a lengthy piece of classical music with no lyrics. The way we listen to music has also changed. Nowadays, you can find any music you want at the click of a mouse, and yet the sound track to our lives is rarely classical.<eos>"

Bonnie Wyndham got out of her mother’s car and looked at Almonside School. She was going to make her mother sorry she had come. Her mother was getting out of the other door at the time, so she didn’t overhear. Bonnie knew her mother would understand. Almonside was a funny school. There were a lot of buildings hidden away amongst the trees. There was a science block, a gymnasium, and a riding centre.

Bonnie followed her mother along a broad drive that curved between trees. She was tired, but she didn’t seem to mind. A few minutes later her mother was talking to her new headmaster in his study. Suddenly Bonnie jumped up. She decided to leave the building and head for the riding centre. There was a nice old building where the horses were kept. The horses were very well looked after.

Bonnie treated the horses with respect. She looked at each horse and judged it. She felt like a queen, mistress of all she could see. Her nickname at her previous school had been Queen Bee, and she laughed delightedly as she remembered it. She went round and round the paddock. The rhythm was exhilarating. She felt certain that the horse would jump well.<eos>"

Mum caught Jess by the arm and asked her to come with her to the study. There was a painting on the table, which was one of Grandpa’s. It was unlike anything he had done before and clearly nowhere near finished. Mum spoke again and said the painting had a name. There was something in her voice that betrayed her enthusiasm. Jess read the words Grandpa had scrawled on the painting. It was called 'River Boy.' The painting was strange and beautiful. There were no animals, no birds, no people. It felt right that way. There seemed no place for living things in this remote vision. Yet for some reason, Jess was captivated, thinking of the coming of autumn after a long, rich summer.

Mum spoke again and said she had made a mistake. She had asked Grandpa about the painting and he had said that artists don’t have to explain their pictures to everyone. And if artists had to explain their pictures to every Tom, Dick, and Harry who came along, they’d never get any work done.<eos>"

When I woke up this morning, I didn't mean to damage the carpet. It just seemed like a good idea at the time, as things so often do. I was trying to find a way of fitting my corner cabinet into a corner. Gran had given me the cabinet when she moved out of her house into a flat. It's really cute!

But the thing is, it is a corner cabinet. That is why it is shaped like a triangle. It has to stand in a corner. I've only got two corners in my bedroom. The only problem is, the lack of corners! My bed is in one, and my wardrobe in the other.

I'd tried fitting Gran’s cabinet into the angle between the roof and the floor, but it was just the tiniest little bit too tall. If I could only slice a couple of centimetres off the bottom of it... That was when it came to me. If I couldn’t slice anything off Gran’s cabinet, how about cutting a hole in the carpet? It just seemed like the obvious solution. What Dad calls lateral thinking. I reckoned he would be quite pleased with me. He is always telling us to ‘think outside the box’. And that was exactly what I was doing!<eos>"

The novel 'The Borrowers' is about a family of tiny people who live hidden in the walls and floors of a house. They secretly borrow things from the normal-sized people in order to survive. When the author asked me to direct a TV adaptation of the novel, I knew it was going to be hard to live up to people’s expectations. The most crucial thing was getting the scale right. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans, so I had to be 10 times further away from the camera than on a normal shoot. The costumes were also a big challenge. I had them made out of heavy canvas material so that they stuck out in the way that dolls’ clothes do. Unfortunately, the weather was really hot during filming. Most of the action that takes place away from the Borrowers’ home had to be shot with the actors separated from their surroundings. We filmed them in front of a blue screen on an otherwise empty set.

I hear the teacher already taking roll and slip in undetected. The girl next to me smiles and I feel a little nervous.

In today's society, teenage life is filled with challenges and responsibilities. Not only are American teenage girls expected to excel in various fields, but they also have to manage their time effectively and maintain a part-time job, volunteer, and keep up with their studies. Being a teenager in America today is a demanding task that requires constant attention and dedication.

Teenagers have a lot on their plates, including homework, tests, extracurricular activities, jobs, chores, and family obligations. With the introduction of smart phones, tablets, and social media, students can now take their work on the go and complete their homework wherever they are. However, this convenience comes with its own set of challenges, such as the need to be reachable at all times and the temptation to spend too much time on electronic devices.

The schedule of a typical teenager today is packed. They often start their day early and end late, leaving little time for leisure activities. Sleep deprivation is a common problem among teenagers, with many falling asleep in school due to lack of sleep. Despite these challenges, teenagers are still capable of accomplishing great things. Many teenagers, like Lindamarie Olsen, use their free time to volunteer and make a positive impact on their communities.

In conclusion, teenage life today is filled with challenges and responsibilities, but it is also a time of growth and opportunity. With hard work and dedication, teenagers can achieve great things and make the world a better place.<eos>"

The teenage members of the Earth to Sky Calculus Club live in Bishop, a mountain town in the US, surrounded by wilderness. They have launched over fifty balloons to the edge of space. It's a long-running science project that includes astronomy experiments and backcountry adventures. I joined them one weekend in late spring. They were releasing a high-altitude balloon, hoping to record shooting stars.

As it got dark, the teenagers secured a soft insulated lunch box to the bottom of the balloon. Inside was a camera, an instrument to measure altitude, and a thermometer. Two GPS trackers were mounted on the outside of the lunch box to help the group find it later. The balloon inflated and rose into the air. Some of the teenagers ran and tracked its path with powerful flashlights.

When the launch was over, most of the students went home, but a few stayed to watch the shooting stars. They lay on blankets on the mountainside and gazed at a sky so clear, it was hard to believe you're just four hours from Los Angeles.

Getting the lunch box back wasn't straightforward. It had landed in a canyon, high on a flat rock, in the middle of a cascading waterfall. It took them 11 hours to find it. Sure, it's a bit of a disappointment, but it's also a perfect opportunity to argue over the effects of atmospheric waves, and how they might work above mountain ridges.<eos>"

When you're travelling by car with your family, even when you're young, you probably know that you're not 'there yet,' even as you're asking over and over 'Are we there yet?' Once you get there, it's not 'there' anymore, it's 'here'. If you really think there's a chance that you're 'there' yet, you should be asking 'Are we here yet?'.

There are a lot of things to do on long car trips. You can watch endless DVDs, listen to music, or play puzzles. You can also act as co-pilot in the passenger seat, map in hand, and help your parents keep everything running smoothly.

However, things can sometimes go wrong. For example, your sibling might put their foot on your side of the seat or hurl their whole body over into your space. If this happens, you might get angry and start fighting. But your parents will probably be there to help you calm down and make sure that everything is okay.

Over the years, your parents have developed strategies for dealing with kids on long car trips. One of their strategies is to answer the question 'Are we there yet?' with the answer 'No, you're not there yet.' This usually keeps everyone quiet for a while.<eos>"

John and Zuzi Morgan have set up a café in Oxford, UK, where people can enjoy coffee, cake, and board games. They hope that people enjoy the experience so much they want to repeat it. They decided to turn their love of tabletop games into a full-time business because there is so much technology and people are busy on their mobile phones and gadgets.

The kind of games played in John and Zuzi's café are known as Eurogames. They are notable for their relatively gentle themes, such as farming and landscape-building. The first game of this type was The Settlers of Catan, created by a German designer. Players competitively establish settlements on an island and trade resources with the other players.

Pandemic, a Eurogame in which players must collaborate to solve global problems, was created by a North American, Matt Leacock. He was inspired by a Eurogame called Lord of the Rings. Pandemic was a runaway success, and the follow-up version represented another leap forward in game design.

The growth of the video games industry has also contributed to the success of these modern, ingeniously designed board games. As is evident in John and Zuzi's busy and popular café, tabletop gaming has become more than entertainment. In our increasingly online society, games have become something to be shared, directly and physically, in the real world.<eos>"

I work at a university in the US where my team and I are studying water birds, particularly one called the American black duck. We have started using a new piece of equipment called a night-vision scope, which allows us to see the ducks in the dark. We are worried about black ducks mainly because their numbers have fallen hugely and we don’t know whether there’s enough food on the east coast for these animals. We have lots of information about their daytime activities, but nothing about what they do at night, because we simply haven’t had the equipment. But this new ‘scope’ will produce really clear pictures, even on moonless nights, so we’ll be able to find out more and make better decisions about looking after the area where they live based on what we learn. It is very hard work. There are four of us, each working six hours daily. We have studied ducks in different locations, and I’ve had to take a boat to some sites and make notes on every duck I see. The weather hasn’t helped – some nights are mild, but more often it’s wet. Oh, and it’s so quiet I’ve needed lots of coffee to stop me falling asleep! We’ve only missed one working day so far, because the snow was too deep even for our special snow vehicles. Still I like the challenge of it, especially compared to what the summer will bring – hours in a laboratory, where we’ll look at our results together.

Sophia Grayson is from Circus Experience, a centre teaching young people circus skills. She says her course is popular because it includes many skills, such as juggling, throwing and catching things, trapeze, and business planning. On the year-long course, students gradually increase the amount of risk they take in each class and parents come along to certain classes to watch progress.

To be successful in the circus, performers need to avoid doing the same thing all the time and keep performances fresh and full of action. Training is very important for circus artists, like athletes, and the best performers are those who want success, have imagination and never stop improving skills.

The course also covers business planning. Many previous students set up businesses all over the world, and are happy to share their experiences. However, Sophia warns, it’s not a profession for making money.<eos>"

The teacher suggested that joining the school theatre club might make her more confident. After attending the club for a while, she happily sang with 50 other students at an end-of-term concert. A year later, her brother asked her to write a song for them, and so she wrote her first ever song, Falling Stars. Writing it took just three days and she enjoyed it so much that she enrolled on a songwriting course run by a professional songwriter. Despite being the youngest student, she already knew more about music than many of the others. But Ana says the teacher didn’t listen to anything she said, and she wrote Something to Say about how annoyed this made her feel. She posted this song online, and it became a huge success.<eos>"

Last year, I went on a trip to the west coast of Canada. It was my brother Harry’s idea. He’s a journalist, like me, and he wanted to write articles about the trip. I had dreamt of visiting the area ever since I saw it on TV as a child. So I asked Harry if I could go too – until he finally agreed. There were storms in the area we were going to, but luckily the weather was calm. We joined the group, packed our limited supplies into small boats and set off. We stopped for hours to explore the rock pools on the beaches along the coast. They were full of amazing coloured fish. And it was great to be able to stop caring about how quickly or slowly the day was passing. We never forgot lunch or dinner, though, which we all made together over camp fires. When I finally fell asleep on the boats each evening, it really felt like stress-free living. When the time came to leave, I was sad. But I knew if I stayed, I’d miss family and friends. I was also looking forward to telling everyone at home about our adventures.<eos>"

My dad was a professional basketball player in Germany, as his father had been before him. I went to watch many of his games when I was a kid. I loved telling my friends how good my dad was, but I used to take a book with me to read instead of watching. Starting secondary school, I was already tall and my sports teacher asked me if I’d be interested in training with the basketball team. I enjoyed the session, but I thought I’d need to develop my skills before I took part in a real match. It took me a while to agree, but a few weeks later, I found myself playing against a team from another school. My parents came to watch, but it made me more nervous. But it was OK in the end. I practised every day and did really well. I joined an adult team before I moved abroad to a special sports academy in the USA when I was fifteen. The coach there trains Olympic basketball players, and it was fantastic to work with him. However, I can’t say I enjoyed my first experience of living far from my parents. I got used to my new life in the end, though, and my English improved quickly too! I turned professional at the age of eighteen, three years after arriving in the USA. I was taller than most players in the professional league, but I had to get my weight right first. I joined a team and have never regretted it.<eos>"

Seven years ago, I was studying Tourism at college. I needed to find a part-time job because my course was expensive. After considering several options, I decided to become a weekend tour guide in my home city – Chicago. I took visitors around the city and I enjoyed giving those tours. I felt like a new experience every time I gave a tour. After finishing my studies, I decided to go into tour guiding full-time. To get a licence, I had to learn a lot more than I'd learned so far. All Chicago guides have to be able to answer hundreds of questions about the city. After several months, I gained my tour guide qualification and registered as an independent tour guide. Tour guiding is a lot of work, but it is also a lot of fun. You need to be able to be entertaining and tell interesting stories, and above all, you need to be able to react to changing situations. I need to make sure visitors are happy with my tours, otherwise they could post a negative review online. Like most tour guides, I realise that these reviews are really important, as good reviews attract more customers. That’s why making tours fun and stress-free is essential.

My name is Ella and I'm 22. Last year I went to Thailand for two weeks with my sister Josie. We went to help as volunteers at an elephant sanctuary. There were a lot of other volunteers, but we didn’t have much in common with them. We were also nervous because it was the first time we’d done anything like that before. In the end, though, there was no need to worry. We collected the elephants’ food and washed the elephants in the river. The part of the day I most looked forward to was the evening. We led the elephants on foot into the forest area where they spent the night. The meals were delicious, but they didn’t include meat, which neither of us is keen on. After dinner, all the volunteers and staff spent the evenings talking and playing games. Now that we’re back in the UK, Josie doesn’t often talk about Thailand. But if anyone asks her if she enjoyed her time at the sanctuary, she says she loved it.<eos>"

I’m Gina D’Costa and I run a flower shop in the UK. We sell flowers to people who buy them for friends, their homes, or businesses. Sometimes we take part in photo sessions for businesses by providing flowers for their advertising pictures. Once I decorated a castle with flowers for a wedding. It took a lot of work but I was really proud of the job we’d done. My day starts at 4 a.m. when I go to the market to buy fresh flowers. The market is wonderful, with flowers from all over the world. I buy the flowers I need for customer orders and set up vases with them. Then I get on with creating bunches of flowers and working out how much the orders will cost. Customers are often surprised by how expensive flowers are. I sometimes have to ask them to think again about what they’d like. I like thinking about how I can put together the nicest possible flowers for the amount of money someone wants to spend. That’s what you have to do when you’re selling things. I wouldn’t want any other job!<eos>"

My city has a modern cinema that shows all the latest films I want to see, and lots of films for kids at the weekends. It’s close to where I live, but a year ago, I realised something was missing – the experience of discussing a film in detail with a group of people after watching it with them. So, together with two friends, I started a film club. We decided to keep our costs low, so we don’t hire a cinema. Instead, we choose a different location in the city each month. We’ve been to see how people do things in different places, but it’s always good to get back to our own club again. We’ve started a blog, too, because most people now go online for information about films, rather than read reviews in local papers.

Taking photographs was always my favorite activity as a child. When I was 15, I felt that if I wanted to take my hobby to the next level, I had to do something special. So I decided to start a personal project: I would take one photograph every day for a whole year of my life. I was amazed to discover that there were others who liked the way I saw and photographed things. I was also enjoying photographing a wide range of subjects. Then someone suggested that if my photographs all had a common topic or idea to connect them, my project would be even better – and I agreed. So I began to concentrate more on taking photos of nature scenes, especially of birds and the sky. A lot of them were black and white photographs, which was very different to what many other young photographers were doing – they were all taking colour photos. As a result I sometimes had doubts about my project, and I almost gave up several times. In the end, however, I trusted my own feelings, and became more confident about my photographic style and choices. One day I showed my project to my art teacher at school. She told me about a national photography competition for people my age. So I entered some of my photos, just for fun. I’ll never forget the moment when the judges told me that I had won first prize; I was so happy, as my project meant so much to me. It was the first time I realised that maybe my photography really was good, and that I might actually be able to work as a professional photographer. I now have my own photography studio and I’ve never regretted my career choice.<eos>"

Last year, I joined the National Youth Challenge (NYC) because I knew they went camping and sailing and taught skills like public speaking. The NYC offers different activities to challenge yourself and you’re always learning something new. There are different levels, from beginner to advanced, run by adult volunteers called ‘leaders’. When you complete each level, you get a certificate.

When I first joined, my leader suggested that my first challenge should be helping to organise activities at a local children’s club for two hours a week. I decided to take up the challenge and soon, I was spending all my free time at the children’s club. It meant a lot more to me than just getting the certificate. And when I finished the challenge, the NYC leader let me keep on volunteering at the club because I’d built up some great relationships with the children. Now I’m there for about four hours a week and I always really look forward to going.

Because of what I’ve learnt at the children’s club, I’ve decided that when I finish school in three years’ time I want to go to college to become a qualified youth worker – someone who works with children. I’ve improved my own communication skills while at the same time helping others. I’ve got several other NYC certificates now and yes, one of them is for camping.<eos>"

I was born in Denver, USA, and started snowboarding when I was eight years old. My dad took me to a resort in the mountains, about two hours from Denver. The hill was very steep, so my dad had to do a lot of persuading to get me on a board. I was so young, I hadn’t even thought of asking him if I could start snowboarding, but he was already into it and wanted me to love it too. And in the end, I managed just fine. After this experience, I started to love the sport and improve my ability. I started competing aged ten. I enjoy taking part in competitions and winning too. I have to think carefully about my future.

When I was fifteen, I wanted everything my friends had. I didn’t plan ahead, like I had no idea what I wanted to do when I left school. One day, my best friend got a new phone and I thought I should have one too. My parents said I could only have it if I paid for it myself, so I decided to work part-time and save as much as I could. I owe my parents a lot for making me do that – it taught me a really valuable lesson. I worked every Saturday in a café, but I didn’t really enjoy it. My parents suggested starting my own little business instead. I’d seen my mum making necklaces for herself, so I asked if I could have a go at that. I’d never imagined I’d find it so easy, as it had seemed so complicated when I’d watched Mum doing it. I sold my first items of jewellery to my friends and family as soon as I’d finished making them. They told me they were delighted with them, but I just thought they were saying that to please me. So although I was grateful they’d bought them, I still needed convincing that they looked good enough to be popular with the public. There was only one way to find out, so I rented a market stall with my mum. There are always lots of tourists where I live, and they bought lots of my things to give to family and friends when they got back home. Soon we were receiving calls from all over the country from people looking to buy more. They thought we were a big company, employing loads of people to produce my designs, when in fact we were just two people on a market stall! That was when I knew it could work, and it was time to take the next step – creating a website. Since then, I’ve made thousands of pounds through my business, mostly online, although we still have our stall too. It’s been such a lot of fun so far.<eos>"

When Janine Stuart was young, she wrote a novel called Being Amelia which became a bestseller. Being Amelia is based on Janine’s life. In one interview, Janine said, ‘Because of my family’s moves, I’ve become good at making new friends. I understand what it’s like to be the only new student in a class, and that helped me to write about how the main character, Amelia, gets on in a new school. Some of the funniest parts of the book focus on Amelia’s home life, particularly her relationship with her older brother. As I’m my parents’ only child, I had to use my imagination to describe that.

Janine started her novel one summer, when she was feeling bored at home. Her mother had always dreamt of becoming a published author herself, and her teachers had always encouraged her to write, so it seemed like a natural way for Janine to pass the time. The year before, she’d entered a short story competition on a young writers’ website and won first prize. That’s why, when Janine finished Being Amelia and sent it to a publishing company, the people who worked there were immediately keen to read it. They loved it, and a year later, Janine’s novel was on sale in bookshops.

One review of Being Amelia mentions how, despite the book having pictures of happy teenagers on the cover, the people in the story actually face some difficult challenges. This is what really allows readers to believe in them. The reviewer says that although Janine is still very young, and Being Amelia isn’t a particularly long novel, she’s clearly shown that she’s a better writer than several other best-selling authors.<eos>"

My name is Tom. I am fifteen years old. Three years ago, my family and I moved to a castle on a small island. My dad was invited to be the castle’s manager. He works for an organisation that looks after historical buildings. We were worried about the move at first, but we quickly got used to island life. The castle isn’t particularly beautiful, but our apartment is comfortable. The island feels very sociable in summer and there are often parties on the beach. During the winter, we only see the other families who live on the island. The adults all support each other and help with repairs on the island. The biggest change for me was travelling by boat every day, back to my old school. I was looking forward to going on stormy days, but the ferries don’t run then. And I’ve discovered that if I miss the bus to the harbour after school, I also miss the last ferry home, which is worrying. So when schoolmates come home to stay with me, I’m always telling them to hurry up! But we often get the most fantastic views, for example when the sun goes down over the sea. Some days, though, it’s so foggy that you can’t see a thing, then within hours it’s brilliant sunshine again – it still seems amazing when that happens, even after living here all this time. Of course, we do get awful storms, and I wonder sometimes if the castle’s strong enough to avoid getting damaged. But then I remind myself it’s been here for centuries – and it’s still standing!<eos>"

I live in a beautiful house in Scotland, surrounded by countryside. I love nature and wild animals, and I started a new hobby called birdwatching six years ago. I went to the mountains in northern Scotland with my family, where we saw lots of birds. I spent hours watching them with my parents, who showed me how to tell the difference between species and how to find the best places to see them. It was amazing, and I joined a local young birdwatchers’ club. My goal is to see 200 different bird species, and I’ve almost achieved that. I’ve been to Egypt and South America, and I’ve learned that you have to be patient with this hobby. I posted a video online about this challenge, and many teenagers enjoyed it. I also think that birdwatching clubs should try to get more young people interested in this hobby. Everyone needs to connect with nature, whatever their age, and it doesn’t have to cost much money.<eos>"

But my family knew I often became keen on new hobbies and then dropped them, so they thought the same thing would happen with football. But it never did. I was already dreaming of playing football professionally when I was older. And the opportunity came sooner than I’d hoped. I played in local tournaments, and one of the referees noticed that I was a promising player, so he asked the manager of a professional women’s club to watch me play. After that, she asked me to join her club. I started regular training with a big club as a young 13-year-old. I improved enormously. And I’ve scored lots more winning goals since then.<eos>"

One of the most interesting developments in further and higher education in the UK over the last years has been the move to encourage novice students to become involved with research as early as possible. Research is not an exclusive activity for established scholars or scientists. It can also be seen as a natural and fundamental way to build knowledge and skills.

Research approaches and skills will be useful not only in your studies but also in employment. They are ways of thinking about the world and going about your own work. As a student, you make a contribution to knowledge. You do not just digest and repeat it, you make it. Making knowledge is based on asking questions, rather than taking things for granted.

Most students have always been a researcher of sorts. You will have been carrying out some elements of research for projects and answered questions at school or in the workplace since your first few days there. You will also have been developing research and enquiry approaches and skills when exploring where to go on holiday, how to grow seeds successfully, how to fix things around the house, how to train your dog, how to find the right kind of music system, and how to buy the right kind of items for your needs online.

Critical thinking is particularly important in research. We need to be able not just to repeat what we’ve read and take everything in as if it was proven fact, but to engage with it, think about it, test it out, identify whether what we’re being told is presented in such a way as to trick us into agreement, or whether it is logical, reasoned and backed by evidence.<eos>"

Cities have been centers of intellectual life since the 18th century. They provide a place for people to gather and discuss ideas. However, city life is not always easy. It can be exhausting and overwhelming. Scientists have found that cities actually dull our thinking, sometimes dramatically so. One of the main reasons for this is the lack of nature in cities. Studies have shown that people who can see trees from their windows recover more quickly from illness. Natural settings also help improve brain performance. They provide a mental break from the urban grind.

In recent years, it has become clear that living in cities has a number of negative effects on our mental and physical health. These effects include fatigue, stress, and anxiety. However, there is also evidence that living in cities can have some positive effects on our creativity and innovation. The key, then, is to find ways to mitigate the psychological damage of the metropolis while maintaining its unique benefits.<eos>"

The mind is a complex and enigmatic phenomenon that has fascinated humans throughout history. It is commonly believed that thinking takes place inside people's heads, but there is evidence to suggest that the mind extends beyond the skull. From the earliest prehistory to the present, humans have used tools and objects to enhance their cognitive abilities. These tools and objects become cognitive extensions of the human mind, allowing us to think more effectively and creatively.

The study of the mind has traditionally focused on the brain, but it is important to recognize that the mind is more than just a brain. It is a complex system that includes our thoughts, emotions, and experiences. MET, or Material Engagement Theory, explores the different ways in which things become cognitive extensions or are incorporated by the human body. It also investigates how those ways might have changed since earliest prehistory.

MET offers a new way of understanding how different forms of material culture, from stone tools to the latest smartphones, may have provided a powerful mechanism of defining, but also transforming, what we are and how we think. It is important to keep in mind that humans have used mind-changing technology since they first evolved.<eos>"

Photography has significantly changed the course of civilization and our way of knowing the world. It has been especially true in the United States, where photography quickly became part of US culture. Historians say that photography is arguably the country’s greatest single contribution to the visual arts. In no other art form has US work loomed so large.

Photography has been appealing because it is a mechanical process that matches a growing enthusiasm for technology. It also brings the wonders and sights of the world into the front room with an immediacy that is breathtaking. Additionally, photography has been important for creating and sustaining an impression of self and family, and for representing everyday realities.

If we want to understand a photograph historically, then we need to pay special attention to its purpose and function within a given cultural matrix. We also need to consider the placement and framing of the image. If the camera’s importance to the artist was kept secret for a long time, it is now, for the contemporary artist, anything but a secret.<eos>"

In 1890, William James, an American philosopher and physician, defined psychology as the 'science of mental life.' This definition is still a good starting point for understanding psychology today. We all have a mental life and therefore have some idea about what this means. However, even though the concept can be studied in rats and monkeys as well as humans, it remains a somewhat elusive one.

Psychology is about the mind or brain, but psychologists do not understand nearly enough about its workings to be able to comprehend the part that it plays in the experience and expression of our hopes, fears, and wishes, or in our behaviour during experiences as varied as giving birth or watching a football match.

The endeavour of psychology is much like that involved in solving a crossword puzzle. It involves evaluating and interpreting available clues. Complex interactions are the norm rather than the exception in psychology, and understanding them depends on the development of sophisticated techniques and theories.

Psychology has the same goals as any other science: to describe, understand, predict, and learn how to control or modify the process that it studies. Once these goals have been achieved, it can help us to understand the nature of our experience and come to conclusions that can be applied directly to people’s lives.<eos>"

In a storehouse in an unremarkable business park in Michigan, USA, there is a museum of failed products called the Museum of Failed Products. The exhibits in the museum are products that were withdrawn from sale because nobody wanted to buy them. The museum's proprietor, Carol Sherry, sees every product as embodying its own sad story. The museum is a viable, profit-making business. It is a testament to the fact that most products fail. The museum was started by ex-marketing man Robert McMath, who intended to accumulate a reference library of consumer products. However, his collection ended up consisting mostly of unsuccessful products. The museum is a reflection of the culture of optimism that exists today. People often focus on the bright side of things, even when they know that there is a high chance of failure. This obsession with optimism is particularly prevalent in the burgeoning 'self-help' field. It is important to remember that failure is a natural part of life and that it can be used as an opportunity to learn and grow.<eos>"

Everyone knows that sports teams have an advantage when they play at home. But does anyone know why? Most of us probably think we do; after all, it seems obvious. But professional sport is changing faster than at any time in its history and much of what we used to take for granted is now open to question.

There are two main reasons why home advantage exists. First, the home team has the benefit of playing in front of their own crowd, which can give them a boost of energy and confidence. Second, the home team has the advantage of being able to make adjustments to the game plan based on the crowd's reaction.

However, there are some changes that have recently occurred that have made home advantage less effective. For example, travel has become more convenient and the top grounds increasingly resemble one another in their soulless efficiency. As a result, the impact of playing at home has declined in all major sports.

Despite these changes, there is still some evidence to suggest that home advantage still exists. For example, researchers found that the players’ testosterone levels were higher before home matches than they were before training sessions or away matches. This sense of territoriality may be connected to some primitive urge to defend home turf against interlopers.<eos>"

The more I practice, the luckier I get, said Gary Player. This quote is famous and is valued by athletes and coaches worldwide. However, there are some arguments about the source of the quote and its meaning. Player didn't literally mean lucky, he was speaking ironically. His real message was: 'The more I practice, the better I get.' Up to a point. Where that point is, is at the heart of the nature-nurture debate. The debate has seemed as uneven as a basketball game between giants and dwarves: nurture has been victorious. The theory that expertise in any field can be attained with 10,000 hours’ practice is also popular. But it is often not true. There are other factors that can influence success, such as innate talent, environment, and opportunity. Epstein's book explores the complexity of the topic and distinguishes between hardware and software. He also looks at cases where the hardware matters to such an extent that genes really cannot be ignored.<eos>"

A recent report found that a large number of children living in wealthy industrialized countries feel lonely and dissatisfied. The reason for this is that these children have been spending too much time indoors, watching TV or playing on computers, and have lost contact with the natural world. This has led to a decline in their overall well-being.

A follow-up study found that a large number of children would be happier if they could simply go outside more. Many adults talk nostalgically about the freedom of their own youth, when they spent long summer days playing outside. However, they rarely stop to reflect that they are the ones who have imposed that protective regime on their own children.

There are some good arguments in the book about the relationship between the fear of danger and child-focused consumerism. However, the author's tone is sometimes too extreme and she does not provide enough evidence to support her claims.<eos>"

I'm a research bio-psychologist with a PhD. I've done lots of school and I'm a pretty good problem-solver. But that has little to do with the schooling I’ve had. Most problems in life cannot be solved with some complex formula or memorised answers. They require the judgement, wisdom and creative ability that come from life experiences.

Play is the natural means by which adults and mammals have always educated themselves. The most important skills children everywhere must learn in order to live happy, productive, moral lives are skills that cannot be taught in school. Such skills cannot be taught at all. They are learnt and practised by children in play.

Our children don’t need more school. They need more play. If we care about our children and future generations, we must reverse the horrid trend that has been occurring over the past half century. We must give childhood back to children. Children must be allowed to follow their inborn drives to play and explore, so that they can grow into intellectually, socially, emotionally and physically strong adults fit for an unpredictable future.<eos>"

In many countries, there are a lot of young people in their twenties who are using social media to find work. There are two popular social networking sites that are often used for professional networking: Twitter and LinkedIn. These sites offer the chance for direct contact with potential employers. However, with greater access comes a greater chance to make mistakes. For example, a young jobseeker in the US contacted a senior marketing executive via LinkedIn. The marketing executive was not impressed by the young jobseeker's message and sent a rude rejection note. This incident has drawn attention to the fact that social media can be a dangerous tool for jobhunters who don’t know how to use it.

There are a few things that young jobseekers should keep in mind when using social media for professional networking. First, it is important to explain clearly who you are and what you have to offer. Second, you should refrain from sending impersonal, blanket emails. Third, you should keep the tone humble if you want to avoid leaving a sour taste in the recipient’s mouth.<eos>"

Newspapers have been struggling in recent years due to declining circulation and the rise of online news. In the UK, the circulation of most national dailies has fallen by a third to half since 2000. Many people in the US rely on online news sources rather than newspapers. Some experts predict that the last printed newspaper will be buried within 15 years. However, history has shown that old media have a habit of surviving. Even vinyl records have made a comeback. Newspapers were once new media, and they became the dominant medium for news in the mid-19th century thanks to the steam press, the railway, and the telegraph. Today, we have more access to news than ever before, but the way we consume news has changed. We can access information quickly and easily, and we can personalize the news to our own interests. However, there are still challenges with online news, such as misinformation and bias. Despite these challenges, newspapers have the potential to continue to guide us to wisdom and understanding.<eos>"

If humans were truly at home under the light of the moon and stars, we would go in darkness happily. Instead, we are diurnal creatures, with eyes adapted to living in the sun’s light. We have engineered the night to receive us by filling it with light. This kind of control is no different from the feat of damming a river. Light pollution is largely the result of bad lighting design. It washes out the darkness of night, altering light levels and light rhythms to which many forms of life, including ourselves, have adapted.

Light pollution has a number of negative effects on wildlife. It affects migration, reproduction, and feeding. It also causes birds to sing at unnatural hours. Denying darkness is futile. It is as essential to maintaining our biological welfare as light itself.

Living in a glare of our own making, we have cut ourselves off from our evolutionary and cultural heritage – the light of the stars and the rhythms of day and night. In a very real sense, light pollution causes us to lose sight of our true place in the universe.<eos>"

A company recently announced that it would no longer track its employees’ paid holiday time. The founder of the company was inspired by an internet company that has implemented a similar policy. The company has 50,000 employees and provides a variety of services. The founder stated that employees can take as much leave as they want, as long as they feel comfortable that their absence will not damage the business. However, there are concerns about the practicality of this policy. For example, it could lead to increased guilt and stress for employees, which could in turn lead to a decrease in productivity. Additionally, it could lead to pressure from colleagues and office gossip, and could make it difficult for employees to take their rightful leave. Overall, the author remains doubtful as to whether being able to take as much holiday as you want is the true intention or the probable outcome of this policy.<eos>"

Journal-based peer review is a process that ensures the quality of scientific research papers. It is often touted as a way to prevent flawed or nonsensical papers from being published. However, the process can also be time-consuming, sometimes delaying the publication of a paper by a year. Preprints, which are drafts of papers that are posted online without having been peer reviewed, are a growing trend that is changing the way scientific papers are published. Preprints bring academics back to the core of research publication, which is the rapid dissemination of new results. They also make it easier for researchers to critique and build upon each other's work. However, there are also some challenges associated with preprints, such as the potential for bias and the lack of peer review. Despite these challenges, preprints have the potential to improve the scientific publishing process and make it more accessible to a wider audience.<eos>"

When I ask my students about poems, they often give me answers like ""a painting in words."" Their answers rarely satisfy me or them. One day I asked a group to choose an object and write one paragraph describing it empirically, as a scientist might, and another in the first person, from the point of view of the item itself. The exercise led to much amusement and useful discussion.

A poem is a thing made. Poets sometimes compare poems to wild animals or machines. But such comparisons fall apart upon closer analysis. The most productive thing about trying to define a poem through comparison lies not in the comparison itself but in the debate. A poem is a product of writing and rewriting just like an article, story, or novel. It never really becomes what they usually are – a thing created in order to become a commodity.

A poem is a powerful thing. It has the power to hit home like nothing else can, even though, in terms of ink on paper, it does nothing more than the prose around it. A poem is a thing for its own sake. Because of its special status – set apart in a magazine or book – a poem still has the ability to surprise, if only for a moment.<eos>"

I bought a metal detector soon after I was married. It was a lot of money then, but it was worth it. I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first outing. Over the years, I've found many interesting things. But the most important thing I found was a torc. It's a beautiful necklace of gold and silver. It's the most famous object from Iron Age Britain. I carried it to the car and showed it to my wife. We didn't try it on because it was too valuable. I hid it in our wardrobe and felt anxious. Finally, I carried it into the council office and gave it to the local council. The torc is currently in the British Museum in London. The proceeds were split between the owner of the field and myself.

**Questions:**

1. What was the most important thing the author found?
2. What is the meaning of the word ""torc""?

Sleeping is one of my favorite travel experiences. I love to sleep when I travel, even though I sometimes feel a little guilty about it. When I travel, I often find that I sleep more soundly and dream-filled than I do at home. This is because I am surrounded by new sights, sounds, smells, and ways of being. When I sleep on the road, I feel like I am immersed in the culture of the place I am visiting. I also remember more vividly the experiences I have while traveling when I sleep. If you are a traveler who loves to sleep, you should embrace the unique sleep experiences that each place has to offer.<eos>"

I was flying east all night and woke up to see that it was already daylight. The landscape below was empty and I could see no sign of human life. The view was beautiful and rolled away in an otherworldly blend of mountains, streams and forests to an endless horizon. I shook my head and smiled at my neighbour who woke up and smiled at me. He was a salesman from Moscow who was flying to the outer limits of civilisation in order to sell safety clothing to the local mining industries. His English was almost as poor as my Russian, but with the help of a dictionary I managed to explain to him that I was flying to the far-eastern Siberian city of Magadan. He was concerned about me riding alone and pointed out that there was no road from Magadan. I explained that I had reason to believe that there was a road, though not many people used it these days. We talked for a while and he eventually agreed to let me ride with him. I was going to join my old school friend Al in Siberia. We had been planning this trip for a long time and I was excited to see what he had planned. We rode together and it was a great adventure.<eos>"

In the Red Bull Air Race, twelve pilots race through a series of pylons between 15 and 25 meters high. They negotiate sharp turns, barrel rolls and loops at speeds of up to 370 km per hour. I was invited to find out what it feels like to take part. I had to sign two forms before the flight. The first confirmed that I was in good health, the second that I would empty all my pockets. I also learned that I would have to try to stay orientated throughout the flight. The pilot explained to me that I should relax and enjoy the view. I was also asked to promise that when I was flying upside down, I would relax completely. Half an hour before the flight, I had a safety briefing in which I was told not to touch anything. By the time we were taxiing down the runway, I was feeling nervous. I would not relax and enjoy the flight. This is the cruel paradox of high-speed acrobatic flying. In order to survive it without passing out, you have to keep calm and focused. You have to tense up at the right time and you have to relax at the right time. Panicking is a bad idea. The flight was over in 10 minutes. It had been 'soft' compared to what the pilots endure when they race.

Doug Allan is a skilled wildlife cameraman who films wild animals in cold places. If you have ever been amazed by footage of polar bears in a nature documentary, it's probably been filmed by him. Allan was born and trained as a marine biologist and commercial diver. Diving was his first passion, where he learned about survival in cold places. His big break came when a TV crew turned up in Antarctica, where Allan was working, to film a wildlife documentary.

Allan has a lot of experience filming in cold places. He says that the camera and communications technology was very basic when he started 35 years ago. Today, it is much easier to film. You can shoot a lot and look at it immediately. You used to have to think what shots you needed next, and what you had missed. You shot less. Film was very expensive. Today you can have too much material.

Allan says that wildlife filming is full of great successes, but also failures and embarrassments. He has seen a lot of amazing things, but he has also had some setbacks. One time, he was in the Orkneys to film kittiwakes, but he could not identify which birds they were. Another time, he was in Kong Karls Land, where he did not expect an easy assignment. It is a world of polar bears and is strictly off limits to all but the most fearless or foolish.

Now Allan would like to make his own film about climate change in the Arctic, talking to the people who live there and experience the impact of it first hand. He says he would be able to make an extraordinary documentary.<eos>"

I had a break from my training. I was going to do something else. Being a successful Olympian is a great thing. I had the chance to do more writing and TV work, and to speak to businesses and schools. But there wasn’t anything on the horizon to get my competitive teeth into. I knew that I wished to stay in shape, so that I would be in a position to fight for an Olympic place if that dream reignited within me. So I entered marathons and triathlons. That should have been enough, but there was still the TV presenter Ben Fogle’s nagging invitation at the back of my mind. I spoke to some of my rowing colleagues about whether they fancied the race; I didn’t receive any enthusiastic responses. I knew that if I entered the race, even though it is billed primarily as an adventure, I would want to win. Would doing it with Ben give me the best chance of winning it? No. There was part of me that thought the chance to be an underdog with no pressure was appealing. I got in contact with Ben. We spoke about the remaining costs of the race. We felt we stood a better chance than most, but it would still take work to secure it. Of course, I also had to take into account the loss of earnings that would result from being away from home. I had to weigh up the pros and cons of doing the race. I decided to do it. I learned a lot while planning this adventure, but one of the biggest lessons was to be thankful for the easy life of a full-time athlete.

Last year, I went to the Arctic Circle in Finland to work with huskies. I was restless and dreamed of Arctic landscapes. I found a small company run by Anna and Pasi, and they agreed to take me on as a husky dog handler. From December to February, there is plenty of business taking tourists out on sled rides. The work is very physical and the hours are long.

I arrived at the farm and was handed a pair of boots and turned out into the cold. I followed the sound of barking and joined the team of husky guides. I was initiated into the ranks of the husky guides, but I had to learn a lot of new things. The basics of dog-sledding can be picked up very quickly, but everything else seems to be very complicated.

By the end of my first week, my head was spinning with instructions and my muscles ache from dragging heavy sleds. But I was triumphant. I emailed my friends and told them I could chop with an axe, hammer a nail, and use a circular saw in the snow.<eos>"

On that day, Radcliffe sprinted past the finish line, and the press gathered to make sense of her extraordinary run. Her time would actually qualify her to compete in the men's marathon at the world championships in Paris. Journalists quizzed her on the benefits of emu oil, a product that Olympic gold medallist, Cathy Freeman, had recommended.

Radcliffe insists that the achievement never really sank in. Looking back, she can see it must have been a really big deal at that time. She and her support team had said they weren’t going to set a limit on anything. That was their motto: no limits.

During the race, her husband and coach, Gary Lough, was in a car with her support team, listening to the radio coverage. With 800m left to run, Radcliffe began to calculate. She could finish in under 2 hours 16 minutes if she crossed the line in less than three minutes. She had bravely run 41 kilometres at lightning speed, but still managed to sprint the remaining distance in 2 mins 25 secs.

After the race, everyone wanted to know how an athlete who ran with such an awkward style had beaten the grace and skill of the East African runners. Radcliffe did not know it then, but that marathon was her career peak. She would never run as fast again.<eos>"

When I first started my cookery programme, In Search of Perfection, I was unsure of how it would be received. There had been a lot of talk about the food 'revolution' happening in Britain, and I was confident that we had created a series of programmes that made a genuinely innovative contribution to that. However, I was still worried about whether people would appreciate an approach to cooking that involved not just techniques but also history, nostalgia and science. I watched the first programme and was relieved that it was well-received. The success of the show paved the way for other fascinating projects, including a book based on my experiences at the restaurant I own. In each project, there is a sense of being on a journey, whether it's into the past, into the mind, or into cookery techniques. I wrote several books in a series called 'Perfection', each one accompanying its own TV programme of the same name. In these books, the journey was often physical, with passports and suitcases and itineraries. In Search of Total Perfection is the latest in the series, and it takes you on a journey around the world to meet extraordinary artisans. Despite the book's title, I knew from the outset that I wouldn't be claiming the recipes were in any way 'definitive'. But I reckoned that, by using my technical skill and scientific knowledge, I could pin down some of the things that made these dishes work.<eos>"

We were still hours away from Marrakech when the van broke down and veered sharply off the road into a field. John got out and opened up the bonnet. He stood for a long time peering at the engine with his hands in his pockets and a knowing look on his face.

The field stretched as far as I could see. There was nothing much in it, just grass and a lot of flowers. Bea was worried, 'We can’t stay here forever,' she said.

We sat on the side of the road and watched John grow smaller and smaller as he went off in search of someone who knew something about cars. Mum stretched out on the grass. 'Tell us a story,' she said. I told them about how on the day before we left London, I heard two birds talking.

We stayed at the café all day while John squinted dismally into the engine. 'I suppose it’s a miracle it got us this far,' he said when it began to grow dark. Mum dragged blankets out onto the road. She made an open-air bed for us in the hotel garden.

We followed John into the tiled café. It was set back from the road and was not far from where our van was now parked. We sat down in the shade of the terrace. The tea they brought was made from mint leaves and was very sweet.

We stayed at the café all day while John squinted dismally into the engine. At first Bea hadn’t wanted to move, so John had picked her up and put her in the truck himself. Now she sat in the front with the man who was driving. I kept wondering how we’d get home again now that our van had to be dragged everywhere.<eos>"

It's not good to spend too much time online. You need to get out into the real world, said Dad. He's difficult to argue with, so I decided to find out what people who have studied the subject say – and it’s quite interesting. Generally, research shows that most teenagers who use social media have a wide circle of real-life friends, a good sense of identity and belonging, and are developing the essential technical skills we need to be citizens of a digital age.

Social networking has become an integral part of modern childhood. Teenagers don’t consume media like adults do – they inhabit it. It performs a similar function to hanging around at the youth club, as today’s parents used to do when they were younger. It can help teenagers develop a sense of identity, deal with teenage issues and get on with their peers.

Embracing social media can help if you’re not outgoing or have a specialized interest. It can also help you if you’re a quiet person and want to connect with others who share your interests. If you’re one of only three people in your school who’s into a particular type of music, traditionally you would have felt quite isolated. But if you discover a social networking group of like-minded people, there’s suddenly a necessary critical mass and you can still be popular, just in a different context.<eos>"

However, my parents clearly weren’t looking to put their feet up as they organized our summer vacation this year. My dad seemed to have taken it upon himself to plan the ultimate family bonding trip.

We packed our car full of suitcases, coolers, and clothing. We set off on ‘The Family Great American Road Trip’. As we drove west, out through the Oklahoma panhandle, we had a lot of adventures. We stopped for the night near a town in Oklahoma, under the darkest star-filled skies in the nation. We learned the rule of the road: cattle get the right-of-way.

We continued our journey, driving through desert and mountains. We visited Yellowstone National Park and watched the setting sun cast its shadows over bear habitats close to the roads. We also had a close encounter with a bear.

Our trip was over and we were sad to be home, but we had a lot of fun memories. We had taken a lot of photos and I knew that I would never forget this trip.<eos>"

Charlotte Grainger was inspired to write a novel by her primary school teacher. She thought that writing a book would be a challenge and that it was something she could do well. When she was 13, she started writing her novel. It is about to be published. Charlotte is proud of her accomplishment and feels that her age does not limit her ability to write. She acknowledges the limitations of her youth and the importance of self-belief.

The book is a huge achievement. The narrative is assured and action packed. Nothing about it, except the age of its heroine, suggests that it was written by a teenager. Charlotte has always been a keen reader of famous fantasy writers. She finds that some of their books explore deep things about psychology and life. However, she also finds that some of their books discourage her from writing.

Charlotte has a theory about teenagers and the way they are ‘betrayed’ by the fiction that is specifically aimed at them. She believes that there are three types of teenagers depicted in novels. There’s the outsider who becomes acceptable to society, the naïve teenager who knows nothing about the big wide world, and the awkward teenage character who isn’t socially skilled. Repeatedly reading about these character types irritated her. She feels that there aren’t many stories out there about characters who aren’t inadequate in some way.<eos>"

As a choreographer, Miranda is essentially in a teaching role and enjoys working with young students. She finds it easier to work with students than professionals because they are open to taking risks and are hungry for success.

When Miranda starts working with a new group, she concentrates on the dance steps and the music dictates what she does. If dancers aren’t responding well to a particular composer’s music, that can be frustrating, but she still has to find solutions.

Miranda believes that a great dance production is when everything comes together, including the music, costumes, lighting, and dancers. She also believes that aiming high is appreciated by audiences and will allow you to get away with a few wrong artistic decisions or choices.<eos>"

A friend asked me why I travel when I can see everything on television. I agreed that you can see amazing things on TV, but why sit at home on your sofa when there’s so much out there to experience. I guess that conversation gave me the idea for my crazy four-day trip, and a film that aimed to get people to turn off their television sets. I had a mate getting rid of his old sofa, which became the star of the film. I fixed some wheels and cables to it and connected them to old seatbelts over my shoulders. I put my luggage on the seats and slept on the sofa each night, including one night on the beach. Several friends joined me on the way, helping to pull the sofa along and encouraging me to keep going. I’ve been on several expeditions on foot in recent years, but this was something completely new. Not only was it the longest distance I have ever walked, but it was also on main roads, which meant I could stop at a roadside café and relax on the sofa with a cappuccino instead of having the wind blowing away my sandwiches while I sit on a rock. I got used to telling people, “No, I’m not doing it for charity, I’m not training for a marathon”. When someone at work asks me about my weekend, I’d rather explain how I dragged a sofa 100 miles across southern England than discuss the latest show on TV.

I enjoy being a flight attendant. I've been to many places, including the US and Australia. I work with great people, have a lot of time off, and life is always exciting. As a child, I often flew unaccompanied to boarding school. Sometimes I felt lonely, so I would ask the flight attendants to let me help give out meals to passengers. That's what I remembered later, when I needed an escape from my banking job and began looking for a new direction. There was a lot of young people at the interview, and many were accepted. They were often highly qualified like me, and were changing careers. Before the interview, I practised what to say – more than simply that I loved to travel, as everyone else would say the same. Instead, I mentioned my strengths and previous work experience – and I got the job! I'd recommend this kind of work to anyone, as there are so many things that make it worthwhile – but the free flights I get aren’t top of the list. Most airline staff are incredibly hard-working, and there’s a saying – ‘no-one’s finished till everyone’s finished.’ It’s like a big family – even though we don’t see each other all the time, we’re still close. When I’m not working, I don’t have to take work home. And if I do get difficult passengers, which is rare, I always know the flight will soon be over and I’ll probably never see them again!<eos>"

At the summer camp where I work, I really enjoy seeing the children succeed at things they never thought they could do. Most of the children know how to swim and play table-tennis, but rock climbing is a new experience for most of them. Some children feel very nervous, but after some encouragement they agree to try and they all get to the top in the end. This makes them feel great. We do get children who miss home at the beginning of the week. It's not the really young ones who feel like that the most – it's actually the ten- to thirteen-year-olds. We don't let them use their mobile phones all the time. We tell them they can phone home after lunch and when they ask again, usually after dinner, we say it's a bit late to phone now, do it tomorrow. Most children are fine in a couple of days and at the end of their week's stay, they all come up to us and thank us because they have had a great time.<eos>"
