Some time ago, there was a website that talked about the risks of public check-ins, which are online announcements of your whereabouts. The website said that when you post something online, you are also advertising your out-and-about-ness to everyone. This made people realize that there might be a downside to all the sharing that the web has enabled.
The web has a lot of opportunities to share your life with the world. You can post photos, write stories, and share your thoughts. But you should be aware that the water in the digital world is crowded and treacherous. If you expect your song of yourself to 'make people want to be with you', you'll be disappointed.
In the early days of the web, there was a young man named Justin Hall who started posting things on the internet. He was one of the first bloggers, and he showed that you can use the web to share your life with the world. But he also showed that you should be careful about what you post online.
Today, there are many people who use the web to share their lives. Some people use it to write about their families, others use it to share their hobbies, and still others use it to sell their products. No matter what you use the web for, you should always be aware of the risks."

A long time ago, some scientists started a campaign to warn people about a movie called What the Bleep Do We Know. The movie showed that there is a lot about the universe that we don't understand. Some people felt that the movie was dangerous and issued warnings about it. The movie was a must-see for everyone, but it was not very exciting at first. When the movie moved on to describe some of the new discoveries, it became more interesting. One of the discoveries was the ability of water molecules to be affected by thoughts. This discovery was controversial, but many people found it to be compelling. However, scientists were not impressed. They said that the evidence was not good enough. They said that the movie's claims were too far-fetched. Despite this, the movie was still a popular success. It was seen by many people and had a big impact on them."

Writing novels is a challenge, while writing short stories is a joy. It is like planting a forest or a garden. The two processes complement each other, creating a complete landscape. Writing novels is like planting a forest, and writing short stories is like planting a garden. The two processes take different parts of the brain and require different time commitment.
Since the beginning of my career, I have alternated between writing novels and short stories. I write novels and short stories in different sequences. I never write short stories while I’m writing a novel, and I never write a novel while I’m working on short stories.
Writing short stories is a necessary change of pace and offers several benefits. It takes less time to finish, and you can create a story out of the smallest things. You don’t have to worry about failing, and you can learn from your mistakes and use that in the next story you write.
My short stories are like soft shadows I have set out in the world, faint footprints I have left behind. They are like guideposts to my heart, and it makes me happy as a writer to be able to share these intimate feelings with my readers."

Science is a powerful force that has greatly impacted human society. It has improved our lives and presented challenges. It has also inspired artists and thinkers. Science has its beauty and its dangers. It has its limitations and its fallibility. The history of science is filled with conflict and change. Scientists come in many colors, and their work is often characterized by perpetual conflict. The essence of scientific history has been conflict. Science has also brought us new knowledge and technologies. It has allowed us to control nature and improve our lives. However, science also has the potential to harm the environment. We need to be careful and responsible when using science. Science has become part of the human race’s way of conceiving of and manipulating its future. We need to be aware of the potential dangers of science and take steps to ensure that it is used responsibly."

From around 2015, major publishers started to report that sales of ebooks had plateaued or even fallen in some cases. This has raised concerns about the long-term potential of ebooks in the publishing industry. Some people believe that the ebooks hype may have driven unwise investment, with companies losing confidence in the power of the word on the page. Despite the evidence suggesting that digital and print can coexist in the market, the question of whether the ebook will ‘kill’ the print book still continues to surface.
The idea of one medium ‘killing’ another has often followed the unveiling of new technologies. Even before the advent of digital technologies, critics have predicted the demise of existing media. For example, when television was invented, many people claimed that radio would die. But radio ended up surviving by finding new uses. The same has happened with other technologies, such as movies, radio, and the phonograph.
The spread of the printing press in 15th-century Europe, the shift from silent to sound movie in the 1920s, and the shift from analog to digital photography are all examples of how new technologies have impacted our relationship with books. Not surprisingly, e-readers have stimulated a new appreciation for the material quality of ‘old’ books.
This should provide some reassurance to those who still worry about the disappearance of print books. However, the idea of the disappearing medium will continue to provide an appealing narrative about both the transformative power of technology and our aversion to change."

Every day, I wake up early, brush my teeth, make coffee, and write about how some of the greatest minds of the past have approached creative work. I write about the mundane details of my subjects’ daily lives to provide a new perspective on their personalities and careers. I also talk about my own struggles with creativity and productivity.
My book is about the circumstances of creative activity, not the product. It deals with manufacturing rather than meaning. But it’s also, inevitably, personal. I have included examples of how a variety of brilliant and successful people have confronted similar challenges. I wanted to show how grand creative visions translate to small daily increments; how one’s working habits influence the work itself, and vice versa.
The book’s title is Daily Rituals. I believe that a solid routine can be a powerful tool for creativity and productivity. It can help you to focus and stay on task. It can also help you to manage your time effectively."

Howard became a palaeontologist because he was inspired by a rise in interest rates when he was young. He found out that he wanted to become a palaeontologist when he was at university. He studied delicate creatures revealed on the surface of grey rocks. He got a job as a palaeontologist at Tavistock College in London. He was surprised by the evident favouritism from a man he did not know. But he was grateful that he had the job and that he could support himself by doing the sort of work he wanted to do.

Charles Spence is a Professor of Experimental Psychology at Oxford University in the UK. He has studied how the senses interact to form our perception of flavour. Through his studies, he has influenced what we eat and drink. He has also studied how the environment affects taste.
Spence has written a book called The Perfect Meal, which is packed with insights that are fascinating to anyone in possession of an appetite. His book includes information about how the person in a group who orders first in a restaurant enjoys their food most and how much more food we consume when eating with others.
Spence's lab in Oxford is simple. It has soundproof booths and stacks of ancient-looking audio-visual equipment. He can afford to work more creatively with cooks because he keeps his overheads low.
Spence is currently helping famous brands through reductions in salt and sugar. He points out that it is in their interests to help loyal customers stay alive for longer.
What, one wonders, are dinner parties like in the Spence household? They're all extensions of the lab to Spence."

Our brains are very busy these days. We have a lot of information to deal with, including facts, rumors, and misinformation. We also do more things ourselves now than we used to. For example, we make our own reservations and find things in shops. We're doing the work of many people while still trying to keep up with our lives. Our smartphones have become an important part of our lives. They help us do many things, such as making reservations, finding information, and communicating with others. However, there's a problem with multitasking. It's not as easy as it seems. When we think we're multitasking, we're actually switching from one task to another very rapidly. This can be very stressful and can also make it harder to focus on the task at hand. Multitasking also makes it harder to learn new information and make decisions. It's important to focus on one task at a time and to avoid distractions."

In a zoo in Sweden, a chimpanzee named Santino would sometimes break up concrete into pieces and throw them at visitors. Was he being spiteful? In caves in the US, female bats help unrelated fruit bat mothers if they can’t find the right birthing position. Are they being caring? Fifty years ago, people thought that animals didn’t have consciousness, feelings or moral systems. But recently that has partially changed. Thanks to research into the behaviour of bats, chimps, not to mention rats, dolphins and chickens, emotions of animals have gone from being a taboo area of investigation to being tentatively explored. The new research has started a debate about whether animals can be said to have consciousness. This debate stimulates a second, much less abstract, one: not of consciousness, but conscience – a person’s moral sense of right and wrong that guides their behaviour. If, as this research seems to imply, cows enjoy problem-solving, what does it mean for the production and consumption of beef? The observations may not be disputed, but the interpretation of them is. There are different views on what the new research means for the production and consumption of beef. Some people believe that we should stop eating meat altogether, while others believe that we should at the very least re-evaluate our view of animal cognition. The debate about animal consciousness is a complex one and there is no easy answer."

Critical thinking is a way of interacting with what we read or listen to in order to have a deeper understanding. It involves analyzing, evaluating, and judging information based on its relevance, accuracy, and credibility. Technology can complement and enhance human thinking, but it can also make it more difficult to think critically.
There are concerns that the increasing presence of technology is changing the way we approach complex problems and making it more difficult to really think. For example, the overuse of visual media and the decline in reading have contributed to a decline in critical thinking skills. However, there is also evidence that technology can improve some types of information processing and decision-making.
It is important to understand the subtleties of how technology affects thinking and analysis in order to make the most of our capabilities. By taking a closer look at technology and understanding its impact on our cognitive abilities, we can develop strategies to enhance our critical thinking skills and make better decisions."

When Matthew Crawford is not writing or thinking about how we ought to live, he works as a motorcycle mechanic. He wrote two books about the benefits of manual trades and philosophy. He was inspired to write his latest book when he noticed that advertisements popped up on the credit card machine while he was shopping. Crawford says that these demands on our attention are becoming increasingly difficult to avoid.
There are a lot of distractions in our daily lives. We are constantly being interrupted and our attention is being pulled in many directions. This is making it difficult to think or remember conversations we’ve had. It also makes it difficult to have simple conversations with strangers.
Crawford's proposed solution has two parts. First, we need regulation of noise and distraction in public space. More importantly, though, Crawford advocates skilled practices as a way of engaging with the world in a more satisfying way.
No representation can replicate the feel of real things. If you engage with the world this way, manufactured experiences are revealed as pale substitutes for the kind of involvement you have with real things."

What do you do for a living? It's a common question that we use to define ourselves. As a philosopher, it's a little harder to deal with. One reason is that describing yourself as a philosopher sounds rather pretentious. Another reason is that philosophy has become increasingly removed from lived experiences. However, philosophy can also help people look a little more closely at the practices and behaviours that define their lives.

Foodies, gourmands, chefs and others who love food might expect that reflecting on what and how we eat can contribute to culinary pleasure. However, philosophical discussions of food have often been about other topics, such as the acquisition of knowledge or the pursuit of pleasure. Food is inherently social and cultural. It derives from historical contexts and is shared with those in our communities. It also brings people together and provides infrastructure for growing and distributing food. Ethical issues related to food include what we should eat and the extent to which cooking in restaurants and in the home differ. Cooking in the home is often more intimate and inclusive, while cooking for a living involves different obligations and restrictions. Food and dining can play a role in bridging cultural gaps. We can come to appreciate others by learning to enjoy their food and forge personal bonds with people from other cultures by coming together to eat."

Rob Daviau is a US-based game designer who specializes in creating legacy board games. Legacy board games are different from traditional board games because they have a permanent impact on the game. Decisions made during gameplay can have a lasting effect on the game, such as ripping up cards, defacing the board, or opening packets containing new rules.
Daviau designed a legacy version of the classic board game Risk called Risk Legacy. In Risk Legacy, decisions made during gameplay have a permanent impact on the game. For example, players might have to rip up cards, deface the board, or open packets containing new rules.
Legacy board games are popular among many gamers. They offer a new level of commitment, intensity, and excitement. Many gamers feel that legacy games are one of the biggest advances in game design in several years.
The legacy format draws on video games and the demand for episodic entertainment fuelled by popular TV series. Daviau feels a sense of ownership, but he is also keen to see where others take the idea."

One night, an octopus named Inky escaped from his tank at the National Aquarium in New Zealand. It was a story that was shared online. Part of the fun of the story is that it involves animals behaving like humans. Octopuses are especially intelligent creatures. They have been observed exhibiting many of the key behaviors that were thought to distinguish humans from animals. These behaviors include the ability to consider the past and the future, to demonstrate empathy and self-awareness, and to anticipate the motives of others.
However, there are some differences between human and animal intelligence. Humans have the ability to speak language and use complex tools. Animals do not have these abilities. But animals are still very smart creatures. They have a lot of skills that humans do not have. For example, octopuses can remember where they have hidden their food. Squirrels can climb trees very quickly. And dolphins can navigate using echolocation.
The story of Inky the octopus is a reminder that animals are smart creatures. They are capable of learning and adapting to their environment. They are also capable of exhibiting complex behaviors."

Once upon a time, there was a technology called robotics that has the potential to change the world. Robots have already been used in the automotive and manufacturing industries for many years. Experts predict that in the next few years, robots will be used in many other industries. This technology will definitely impact lower-skilled people, but it also presents an opportunity for companies to grow and create new jobs.
The development of new technologies such as motion control, sensor technologies, and artificial intelligence will give rise to a new class of robots that can interact with humans in many ways. These robots will live alongside us in our homes and provide us with new services.
In order to prepare for the robotic workforce of tomorrow, we need to invest in education and training programs. We also need to develop new regulatory frameworks to ensure our safety and privacy. With millions of jobs at risk and a worldwide employment crisis looming, it is only logical that we should turn to education to understand and prepare for the robotic workforce of tomorrow."

Because it's there, the mountaineer George Mallory is said to have replied to a reporter's question about why he wanted to climb Mount Everest. Climbing has a general appeal to the public, and it can inspire people to act on their dreams. It also has a sense of freedom and adventure.
There are different types of climbing activities, such as playing around on boulders or scaling Himalayan peaks. The style used to tackle any climb depends on the rules of that particular activity. Climbing can be very confining, but it can also be a simple and freeing experience.
When asked why people climb, there are many different answers. Some people climb because it is in their genes, while others climb because it helps cultivate important virtues such as courage, humility and respect for the environment. Climbing can also help develop strength and endurance."

One of the most interesting developments in further and higher education in the UK over the last years has been the move to encourage novice students to become involved with research as early as possible. Research is not an exclusive activity for established scholars or scientists. It can also be seen as a natural and fundamental way to build knowledge and skills.
Research approaches and skills will be useful not only in your studies but also in employment. They are ways of thinking about the world and going about your own work. As a student, you make a contribution to knowledge. You do not just digest and repeat it, you make it. Making knowledge is based on asking questions, rather than taking things for granted.
Most students have always been a researcher of sorts. You will have been carrying out some elements of research for projects and answered questions at school or in the workplace since your first few days there. You will also have been developing research and enquiry approaches and skills when exploring where to go on holiday, how to grow seeds successfully, how to fix things around the house, how to train your dog, how to find the right kind of music system, and how to buy the right kind of items for your needs online.
Critical thinking is particularly important in research. We need to be able not just to repeat what we’ve read and take everything in as if it was proven fact, but to engage with it, think about it, test it out, identify whether what we’re being told is presented in such a way as to trick us into agreement, or whether it is logical, reasoned and backed by evidence."

Cities have been centers of intellectual life since the 18th century. They provide a place for people to gather and discuss ideas. However, city life is not always easy. It can be exhausting and overwhelming. Scientists have found that cities actually dull our thinking, sometimes dramatically so. One of the main reasons for this is the lack of nature in cities. Studies have shown that people who can see trees from their windows recover more quickly from illness. Natural settings also help improve brain performance. They provide a mental break from the urban grind.
In recent years, it has become clear that living in cities has a number of negative effects on our mental and physical health. These effects include fatigue, stress, and anxiety. However, there is also evidence that living in cities can have some positive effects on our creativity and innovation. The key, then, is to find ways to mitigate the psychological damage of the metropolis while maintaining its unique benefits."

The mind is a complex and enigmatic phenomenon that has fascinated humans throughout history. It is commonly believed that thinking takes place inside people's heads, but there is evidence to suggest that the mind extends beyond the skull. From the earliest prehistory to the present, humans have used tools and objects to enhance their cognitive abilities. These tools and objects become cognitive extensions of the human mind, allowing us to think more effectively and creatively.
The study of the mind has traditionally focused on the brain, but it is important to recognize that the mind is more than just a brain. It is a complex system that includes our thoughts, emotions, and experiences. MET, or Material Engagement Theory, explores the different ways in which things become cognitive extensions or are incorporated by the human body. It also investigates how those ways might have changed since earliest prehistory.
MET offers a new way of understanding how different forms of material culture, from stone tools to the latest smartphones, may have provided a powerful mechanism of defining, but also transforming, what we are and how we think. It is important to keep in mind that humans have used mind-changing technology since they first evolved."

Photography has significantly changed the course of civilization and our way of knowing the world. It has been especially true in the United States, where photography quickly became part of US culture. Historians say that photography is arguably the country’s greatest single contribution to the visual arts. In no other art form has US work loomed so large.
Photography has been appealing because it is a mechanical process that matches a growing enthusiasm for technology. It also brings the wonders and sights of the world into the front room with an immediacy that is breathtaking. Additionally, photography has been important for creating and sustaining an impression of self and family, and for representing everyday realities.
If we want to understand a photograph historically, then we need to pay special attention to its purpose and function within a given cultural matrix. We also need to consider the placement and framing of the image. If the camera’s importance to the artist was kept secret for a long time, it is now, for the contemporary artist, anything but a secret."

In 1890, William James, an American philosopher and physician, defined psychology as the 'science of mental life.' This definition is still a good starting point for understanding psychology today. We all have a mental life and therefore have some idea about what this means. However, even though the concept can be studied in rats and monkeys as well as humans, it remains a somewhat elusive one.
Psychology is about the mind or brain, but psychologists do not understand nearly enough about its workings to be able to comprehend the part that it plays in the experience and expression of our hopes, fears, and wishes, or in our behaviour during experiences as varied as giving birth or watching a football match.
The endeavour of psychology is much like that involved in solving a crossword puzzle. It involves evaluating and interpreting available clues. Complex interactions are the norm rather than the exception in psychology, and understanding them depends on the development of sophisticated techniques and theories.
Psychology has the same goals as any other science: to describe, understand, predict, and learn how to control or modify the process that it studies. Once these goals have been achieved, it can help us to understand the nature of our experience and come to conclusions that can be applied directly to people’s lives."

In a storehouse in an unremarkable business park in Michigan, USA, there is a museum of failed products called the Museum of Failed Products. The exhibits in the museum are products that were withdrawn from sale because nobody wanted to buy them. The museum's proprietor, Carol Sherry, sees every product as embodying its own sad story. The museum is a viable, profit-making business. It is a testament to the fact that most products fail. The museum was started by ex-marketing man Robert McMath, who intended to accumulate a reference library of consumer products. However, his collection ended up consisting mostly of unsuccessful products. The museum is a reflection of the culture of optimism that exists today. People often focus on the bright side of things, even when they know that there is a high chance of failure. This obsession with optimism is particularly prevalent in the burgeoning 'self-help' field. It is important to remember that failure is a natural part of life and that it can be used as an opportunity to learn and grow."

Everyone knows that sports teams have an advantage when they play at home. But does anyone know why? Most of us probably think we do; after all, it seems obvious. But professional sport is changing faster than at any time in its history and much of what we used to take for granted is now open to question.
There are two main reasons why home advantage exists. First, the home team has the benefit of playing in front of their own crowd, which can give them a boost of energy and confidence. Second, the home team has the advantage of being able to make adjustments to the game plan based on the crowd's reaction.
However, there are some changes that have recently occurred that have made home advantage less effective. For example, travel has become more convenient and the top grounds increasingly resemble one another in their soulless efficiency. As a result, the impact of playing at home has declined in all major sports.
Despite these changes, there is still some evidence to suggest that home advantage still exists. For example, researchers found that the players’ testosterone levels were higher before home matches than they were before training sessions or away matches. This sense of territoriality may be connected to some primitive urge to defend home turf against interlopers."

The more I practice, the luckier I get, said Gary Player. This quote is famous and is valued by athletes and coaches worldwide. However, there are some arguments about the source of the quote and its meaning. Player didn't literally mean lucky, he was speaking ironically. His real message was: 'The more I practice, the better I get.' Up to a point. Where that point is, is at the heart of the nature-nurture debate. The debate has seemed as uneven as a basketball game between giants and dwarves: nurture has been victorious. The theory that expertise in any field can be attained with 10,000 hours’ practice is also popular. But it is often not true. There are other factors that can influence success, such as innate talent, environment, and opportunity. Epstein's book explores the complexity of the topic and distinguishes between hardware and software. He also looks at cases where the hardware matters to such an extent that genes really cannot be ignored."

A recent report found that a large number of children living in wealthy industrialized countries feel lonely and dissatisfied. The reason for this is that these children have been spending too much time indoors, watching TV or playing on computers, and have lost contact with the natural world. This has led to a decline in their overall well-being.
A follow-up study found that a large number of children would be happier if they could simply go outside more. Many adults talk nostalgically about the freedom of their own youth, when they spent long summer days playing outside. However, they rarely stop to reflect that they are the ones who have imposed that protective regime on their own children.
There are some good arguments in the book about the relationship between the fear of danger and child-focused consumerism. However, the author's tone is sometimes too extreme and she does not provide enough evidence to support her claims."

I'm a research bio-psychologist with a PhD. I've done lots of school and I'm a pretty good problem-solver. But that has little to do with the schooling I’ve had. Most problems in life cannot be solved with some complex formula or memorised answers. They require the judgement, wisdom and creative ability that come from life experiences.
Play is the natural means by which adults and mammals have always educated themselves. The most important skills children everywhere must learn in order to live happy, productive, moral lives are skills that cannot be taught in school. Such skills cannot be taught at all. They are learnt and practised by children in play.
Our children don’t need more school. They need more play. If we care about our children and future generations, we must reverse the horrid trend that has been occurring over the past half century. We must give childhood back to children. Children must be allowed to follow their inborn drives to play and explore, so that they can grow into intellectually, socially, emotionally and physically strong adults fit for an unpredictable future."

In many countries, there are a lot of young people in their twenties who are using social media to find work. There are two popular social networking sites that are often used for professional networking: Twitter and LinkedIn. These sites offer the chance for direct contact with potential employers. However, with greater access comes a greater chance to make mistakes. For example, a young jobseeker in the US contacted a senior marketing executive via LinkedIn. The marketing executive was not impressed by the young jobseeker's message and sent a rude rejection note. This incident has drawn attention to the fact that social media can be a dangerous tool for jobhunters who don’t know how to use it.
There are a few things that young jobseekers should keep in mind when using social media for professional networking. First, it is important to explain clearly who you are and what you have to offer. Second, you should refrain from sending impersonal, blanket emails. Third, you should keep the tone humble if you want to avoid leaving a sour taste in the recipient’s mouth."

Newspapers have been struggling in recent years due to declining circulation and the rise of online news. In the UK, the circulation of most national dailies has fallen by a third to half since 2000. Many people in the US rely on online news sources rather than newspapers. Some experts predict that the last printed newspaper will be buried within 15 years. However, history has shown that old media have a habit of surviving. Even vinyl records have made a comeback. Newspapers were once new media, and they became the dominant medium for news in the mid-19th century thanks to the steam press, the railway, and the telegraph. Today, we have more access to news than ever before, but the way we consume news has changed. We can access information quickly and easily, and we can personalize the news to our own interests. However, there are still challenges with online news, such as misinformation and bias. Despite these challenges, newspapers have the potential to continue to guide us to wisdom and understanding."

If humans were truly at home under the light of the moon and stars, we would go in darkness happily. Instead, we are diurnal creatures, with eyes adapted to living in the sun’s light. We have engineered the night to receive us by filling it with light. This kind of control is no different from the feat of damming a river. Light pollution is largely the result of bad lighting design. It washes out the darkness of night, altering light levels and light rhythms to which many forms of life, including ourselves, have adapted.
Light pollution has a number of negative effects on wildlife. It affects migration, reproduction, and feeding. It also causes birds to sing at unnatural hours. Denying darkness is futile. It is as essential to maintaining our biological welfare as light itself.
Living in a glare of our own making, we have cut ourselves off from our evolutionary and cultural heritage – the light of the stars and the rhythms of day and night. In a very real sense, light pollution causes us to lose sight of our true place in the universe."

A company recently announced that it would no longer track its employees’ paid holiday time. The founder of the company was inspired by an internet company that has implemented a similar policy. The company has 50,000 employees and provides a variety of services. The founder stated that employees can take as much leave as they want, as long as they feel comfortable that their absence will not damage the business. However, there are concerns about the practicality of this policy. For example, it could lead to increased guilt and stress for employees, which could in turn lead to a decrease in productivity. Additionally, it could lead to pressure from colleagues and office gossip, and could make it difficult for employees to take their rightful leave. Overall, the author remains doubtful as to whether being able to take as much holiday as you want is the true intention or the probable outcome of this policy."

Journal-based peer review is a process that ensures the quality of scientific research papers. It is often touted as a way to prevent flawed or nonsensical papers from being published. However, the process can also be time-consuming, sometimes delaying the publication of a paper by a year. Preprints, which are drafts of papers that are posted online without having been peer reviewed, are a growing trend that is changing the way scientific papers are published. Preprints bring academics back to the core of research publication, which is the rapid dissemination of new results. They also make it easier for researchers to critique and build upon each other's work. However, there are also some challenges associated with preprints, such as the potential for bias and the lack of peer review. Despite these challenges, preprints have the potential to improve the scientific publishing process and make it more accessible to a wider audience."

When I ask my students about poems, they often give me answers like ""a painting in words."" Their answers rarely satisfy me or them. One day I asked a group to choose an object and write one paragraph describing it empirically, as a scientist might, and another in the first person, from the point of view of the item itself. The exercise led to much amusement and useful discussion.
A poem is a thing made. Poets sometimes compare poems to wild animals or machines. But such comparisons fall apart upon closer analysis. The most productive thing about trying to define a poem through comparison lies not in the comparison itself but in the debate. A poem is a product of writing and rewriting just like an article, story, or novel. It never really becomes what they usually are – a thing created in order to become a commodity.
A poem is a powerful thing. It has the power to hit home like nothing else can, even though, in terms of ink on paper, it does nothing more than the prose around it. A poem is a thing for its own sake. Because of its special status – set apart in a magazine or book – a poem still has the ability to surprise, if only for a moment."
