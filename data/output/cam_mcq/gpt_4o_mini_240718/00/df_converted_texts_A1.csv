1,"A while ago, a website talked about the dangers of telling people where you are online. When you say, ""I am here,"" you are also telling many people, some of whom you may not want to meet. This shows that sharing everything online can have bad sides. 

The internet gives us many chances to share our lives. We can share our stories and photos with many people. But sometimes, we can lose control and feel lost. It can be sad, but we should not give up. There are lessons from people who used the internet a long time ago. 

In January 1994, a 19-year-old student named Justin Hall started sharing his life online. At that time, the internet was mostly for scientists and students. Hall wanted to share his life, so he created a blog. Many people liked to read about his adventures. He wrote about everything, and he did not hold back. 

One day, Hall had to take down his blog because he fell in love. His partner said he could not write about their relationship anymore. Hall felt sad because sharing his life made people not trust him. 

In 2002, a woman named Heather Armstrong had a blog called Dooce. She wrote about her job, but one day, a coworker shared her blog with their bosses. Because of this, she lost her job. People often think they can say anything online without problems, but this is not true. What we do online can affect our real lives.

Armstrong was sad at first, but later she got married and started a new blog about her family. Now, she is very popular and makes money from her writing. She learned that while we can say anything on the internet, we should be careful about what we share."
2,"A while ago, some scientists warned people about a movie called What the Bleep Do We Know? This movie mixes real facts and stories to show that we do not understand a lot about our universe. Some scientists thought the movie was very bad and even dangerous. 

At first, I did not understand why the movie was so important. Some scientists talked about new discoveries that show the universe is very strange. But then the movie talked about how water can change because of thoughts. I heard that a Japanese researcher showed that water can look different based on how people feel. The movie showed nice pictures of ice crystals that looked good when people were happy and bad when people were sad. Many people liked these pictures, but scientists wanted more proof.

The movie's ideas were not strange enough. Scientists have found that water and other things in the universe are connected to a mysterious energy. This energy is making the universe grow. There is real proof from many years of research, not just pretty pictures. 

Scientists have discovered many amazing things. They found that the universe has unknown matter and a force called dark energy. They also learned that our brains take a little time to understand what happens around us. Anthropologists think they know where modern humans started and how they spread around the world. Some scientists believe that life on Earth is connected to the design of the universe.

Science is still growing, and we do not know everything. Many things in nature are still a mystery. Some scientists are trying to create a Theory of Everything to explain all the forces and particles in the universe. But many of us think the universe is simply incredible."
3,"I find writing novels hard, but writing short stories is fun. Writing a novel is like planting a big forest. Writing a short story is like planting a small garden. Both are important to me. 

When I write a novel, I focus only on that. When I finish, I want to write short stories. After I write some short stories, I feel ready to write a novel again. I started writing short stories in 1984. At first, it was difficult, but I enjoyed it. 

One of my first short stories is called ""Breaking Waves."" It is in my first book of short stories, ""Tales from Abroad."" I like writing short stories because they do not take a long time to finish. Usually, I can write a short story in about a week. Writing a novel takes much longer, sometimes a year or two. 

Short stories are nice because I can create them from small ideas, like a word or an image. It feels like playing music, where the story goes where it wants. If a short story does not work out, it is okay. Not every story has to be perfect. Even famous writers have stories that are not great. 

I learn from my mistakes in short stories and use that to help me write novels. Short stories help me try new things. They are like little pieces of my heart that I share with my readers. Writing them makes me happy."
4,"Science is a way to learn about the world. It helps us understand many things, like tiny atoms and big galaxies. Science can make our lives better, but it can also create problems. Scientists study many ideas, and sometimes they disagree with each other. This can lead to new discoveries.

In the past, scientists thought they knew everything about how the world works. But then they found new things, like radioactivity and black holes. These discoveries changed what we know. Science is always changing, and scientists are always learning.

Science is important for everyone. It helps us understand our world and can change our future. We need to pay attention to science because it affects our lives, our health, and the planet we live on. Everyone should try to understand science, so we can make good choices for the future."
5,"From around 2015, big book companies started to say that sales of ebooks were not growing anymore. Some even said sales were going down. This made people wonder if ebooks would be important in the future. One person in publishing said that the excitement about ebooks made companies invest too much money. He said his company lost faith in printed books.

Even though many people think ebooks and printed books can exist together, some still ask if ebooks will replace printed books. This question makes people think and talk a lot. Why do we think this way? Why do we see ebooks and printed books as a fight? The answers to these questions are not just about ebooks. They show how we feel about new things and changes.

In my research, I found that people often think one new thing will replace an old thing. For example, when television was invented, many people thought radio would disappear. But radio found new ways to be used, like in cars and factories. The idea that books might disappear is not new. In 1894, some people thought that the phonograph would replace books with audiobooks.

Many times, people have said that new things like movies, radio, and smartphones would end printed books. Some people worried that this would be bad for culture. Others thought ebooks would be much better. The idea that books might disappear often comes up when new technology appears. This shows our hopes and fears about change.

We feel strong connections to things like books and computers. We even name our cars or get upset when our laptops don’t work. When new technology, like e-readers, comes out, it changes our relationship with things we love. We often miss the old things we used to have. This is why people still want old products. 

For example, when the printing press was made in the 15th century, people wanted to find old manuscripts. When movies changed from silent to sound, people missed silent films. The same thing happened with photography and music. E-readers made people appreciate the feel and smell of printed books more.

This should make people feel better about printed books not disappearing. But the idea that something might go away will always be interesting. It shows how we feel about new technology and our fear of change. We often tell stories about things ending, which are easy to remember. The story of books disappearing shows both our excitement for the future and our fear of losing what we love."

Every weekday morning for a year and a half, I woke up at 5:30. I brushed my teeth, made coffee, and wrote about how great thinkers from the last 400 years worked. I wanted to show how they found time to be creative and productive. I wrote about their daily lives, like when they slept, ate, and worked. I wanted to show that they were like us, with habits and routines.

There is a saying: ""Tell me what you eat, and I will tell you who you are."" I think it is also important to know what time you eat and if you take a nap. This book is about how people work, not just what they create. It is personal because I also think about how to do meaningful work while making money. 

I ask questions like: How can you work on a project and still have time for everything else? Should you focus on one thing or do a little bit each day? When there is not enough time, do you have to give up things like sleep or a clean house? Or can you learn to do more in less time? 

I do not have all the answers, but I share stories of successful people who faced the same problems. I wanted to show how big ideas can come from small daily actions and how routines can help us work better. 

The book is called Daily Rituals, but it is really about people’s routines. Routines can seem boring, but they can help us use our time and energy well. A good routine can help us stay focused and not be affected by our moods. 

The psychologist William James said that good habits can help us think about more interesting things. He was a procrastinator and had trouble keeping a schedule. 

This book started when I was procrastinating one Sunday. I was supposed to write a story for work, but instead, I cleaned my desk and made coffee. I am a morning person and work best in the morning. That day, I looked online for information about other writers’ routines. I thought it would be good to collect these stories, so I started a blog called Daily Routines. 

In this book, I have gathered many stories about people’s routines. I let them speak for themselves with quotes from their letters and diaries. I also used information from other sources. I want to thank all the biographers and researchers who helped me. You can find their names in the Notes section for more reading."
7,"Howard wanted to be a palaeontologist when he was six years old. One day, he found a special fossil called an ammonite on the beach. He studied hard in school and university to learn more about fossils. 

After finishing his studies, Howard wanted a job as a teacher at Tavistock College in London. He was not sure if he would get the job. On the day of his interview, the professor who was supposed to help him had a bad morning and could not come. Another professor, who did not like the first one, was there instead. This professor helped Howard get the job. Howard was surprised but happy to have the job.

Howard liked his work because he could plan and study fossils. But sometimes, things went wrong in his personal life. One day, someone stole his briefcase with important notes for a lecture. He was very upset but went back to the college and called to postpone the lecture. 

While having coffee, he met a visitor from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. He learned about new fossils that needed to be studied. This was a big opportunity for him. Because of the theft, he changed his plans. Instead of going to a conference in Stockholm, he decided to find money to visit the museum in Nairobi."
8,"Charles Spence likes to eat many different foods. He is a professor at Oxford University in the UK. He even has ice cream made from bee larvae at home. It looks strange, but it tastes a little like nuts and flowers. Spence studies how our senses work together to help us taste food. He wants to make people more open to eating bugs and other unusual foods.

Spence's research helps big food companies and restaurants. He looks at many things that can change how we taste food, like who we eat with, how food is served, and even the sounds around us. For example, if you eat with one friend, you eat more food. If you eat with three friends, you eat even more!

His lab is simple, with old equipment and quiet rooms. He works with chefs who do not have a lot of money for research. Some of his work is paid for by big food companies. These companies want to make food healthier by using less salt and sugar. They do this slowly so that people do not notice the change.

Spence also works with famous chefs like Heston Blumenthal. They create fun dishes that play with our senses. For example, they made a dish called ""Sound of the Sea"" that uses sounds to make the food taste better. Spence found that high music makes food taste sweet, while low music can make it taste bitter.

At home, Spence has fun dinner parties. One time, they ate rabbit with the fur on the cutlery. Another time, they used colorful lights and sounds to see how it changed the taste of drinks. For Spence, food is not just about eating; it is about exploring and having fun!"
9,"Our brains are very busy today. We get a lot of information, some of it true and some not. We have to find what is important and what we can ignore. We are also doing more things than before. Thirty years ago, travel agents helped us book flights, and shop workers helped us find what we needed. Now, we do many things by ourselves. We try to do the work of many people while also taking care of our lives, families, jobs, hobbies, and favorite TV shows. Our smartphones help us with this. 

But there is a problem. We think we can do many things at once, but this is not true. A scientist named Earl Miller says our brains are not good at multitasking. When we try to do many things, we switch quickly from one task to another. This is not efficient. Multitasking can make us feel more stressed and confused. 

When we try to focus on one task but have many distractions, it can lower our ability to think clearly. For example, if we do homework while watching TV, we do not remember the information well. It goes to the wrong part of our brain. Without distractions, we can remember better.

Making decisions while multitasking is also hard for our brains. Even small decisions can tire us out. After making many small choices, we might make bad choices about important things. 

Many people, including business leaders and scientists, say that email is a big problem. We get too many emails, and it is hard to keep up with them. One scientist’s son said his dad answers emails for a living, and that is not far from the truth. We feel we must reply to emails, but it is hard to do that and get other things done."
10,"In a zoo in Sweden, a chimpanzee named Santino broke concrete at night. He did this to throw pieces at people during the day. Some people wonder if he was being mean. In the US, female bats help other bats when they need it. Are they being kind? 

Fifty years ago, people did not think much about these questions. They believed animals just acted in certain ways, and scientists only looked at the results. They thought animals did not have feelings or thoughts like humans. But now, this idea is changing. Research on bats, chimps, rats, dolphins, and chickens shows that animals can have feelings. 

This new understanding is in some popular science books. One book is called ""Wild Justice"" by Mark Bekoff. Another is ""Do Fish Feel Pain?"" by Victoria Braithwaite. This has started a big discussion: Do animals have thoughts and feelings like humans? 

There is also a question about conscience, which is a sense of right and wrong. In a study with cows, those that opened a locked gate for food seemed happier than those that had help. If cows enjoy solving problems, what does this mean for eating beef? 

Dr. Jonathan Balcombe, who wrote ""Second Nature,"" believes we should stop eating meat. He thinks this is a big change in how we think about ethics. Aubrey Manning, a professor, thinks we should think more about how animals think. He believes animals have simpler thoughts than humans. Professor Euan MacPhail thinks we should not put human feelings on animals. 

These experts may not agree because the main issue is not just science, but also philosophy. It is hard to define what consciousness is. Can we really know what it is like to be a bat? 

Balcombe did an important study that suggests starlings, a type of bird, can feel sad. In the study, some starlings lived in nice cages, and others lived in small, empty cages. When both groups were given bad food, only the starlings in nice cages ate. Balcombe thinks the starlings in bad cages felt negative about life. 

Balcombe believes that one day, people will look back and see how we treated animals as wrong, just like racism. He says we cannot support animal rights while eating meat. 

Manning agrees with Balcombe. He has written a book about animal behavior. He says we are starting to think more about how animals feel. But this is a complicated topic, and people have strong opinions about it."
