1,"Some time ago, a website talked about the dangers of public check-ins, which are online posts that show where you are. The website warned that when you say, ""Hey, I’m at this place,"" you are also telling many people where you are, including some you might not want to meet. This shows that sharing everything online can have negative effects. 

The internet gives us many chances to share our lives with a large audience, which can seem exciting. However, we often realize too late that sharing too much can be risky. It can feel overwhelming, but there is hope. A long time ago, some early internet users, known as bloggers, explored these risks. They faced many challenges, like losing jobs and friends, before social media became popular. 

One of these early bloggers was Justin Hall. In January 1994, he started sharing his life online when the web was mostly used by students and scientists. He created a personal website filled with stories, photos, and art. In 1996, he began a daily blog, attracting many readers who were interested in his adventurous life. Hall was open about everything, and his blog was both bold and artistic. 

However, one day, visitors found his homepage replaced by a video called Dark Night. Hall shared that he had fallen in love, but when he wrote about it, his partner told him to choose between the blog and the relationship. Hall chose to remove the blog, feeling that sharing his life online made people distrust him. 

In 2002, another blogger named Heather Armstrong wrote a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job, but one day, a coworker shared her blog with their bosses, including some she had made fun of. This led to her losing her job. 

Experts say this is an example of the ""online distribution effect,"" where people feel they can say things online that they wouldn’t say in person. However, our online lives are connected to our real lives, and pretending they are separate can lead to serious mistakes. 

Armstrong’s story had a happy ending. After taking a break from blogging, she got married and started a new blog about her family. Now, she is successful as a ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing supports her family. She learned an important lesson: the internet lets us say anything, but that doesn’t mean we should."
2,"A while ago, some scientists started a campaign to warn people about a low-budget film called *What the Bleep Do We Know?* This film mixes documentary and drama to show that there is a lot we do not understand about our universe. Scientists can sometimes be a bit proud, but even the most confident physicist would not say they know everything about the universe. However, some scientists felt it was important to warn the public about the film, calling it things like “atrocious” and “very dangerous.” This made me curious to see the movie.

At first, I did not understand why there was so much excitement about it. Some scientists made simple statements about how new discoveries show that the universe is stranger than we thought. But when the film talked about some of these discoveries, I began to understand the excitement. One claim was that water molecules can be affected by thoughts. I had heard before that a Japanese researcher showed that the shape of a water molecule could change based on the thoughts of people nearby. However, the movie only showed pictures of ice crystals that looked beautiful when someone was happy and ugly when someone was in a bad mood. Many people find this kind of evidence convincing, but scientists usually respond with skepticism.

I understand their reaction. The idea that water can be influenced by thoughts is amazing and could mean there are new forces in the universe. But before we believe it, we need good proof that this effect is real. Pretty pictures of crystals are not enough. The real issue is that the movie’s claims were not strange enough. For example, water molecules might have properties linked to a mysterious energy that is causing the universe to expand. This idea is supported by many years of research in labs and observatories around the world.

In fact, scientists are making discoveries that show the universe is stranger than we ever thought. Astronomers have found that the universe is made of an unknown type of matter and is pushed by a mysterious force called “dark energy.” Other discoveries are also surprising. Neuroscientists have found that our awareness of events happens about half a second after they actually occur, but we do not notice this delay because our brains edit it out. Anthropologists believe they have found where modern humans first appeared and how they spread across the world. Some theorists even suggest there are connections between life on Earth and the design of the universe.

Despite what some people think, science is not finished. In fact, we seem to know less than we thought. Many natural events may never be fully understood. The ideas of chaos and quantum uncertainty show that there are limits to what we can know. Some of the best theoretical physicists are trying to create a “Theory of Everything” that would explain all the forces and particles in the universe with one equation. Overall, many of us believe that the universe can be described in one word: incredible."
3,"To put it simply, I find writing novels difficult, but writing short stories is a joy. Writing a novel is like planting a forest, while writing a short story is more like planting a garden. Both types of writing help each other, creating a beautiful landscape that I love. The trees provide shade, and the wind makes the leaves rustle, sometimes turning them a bright gold. In the garden, flowers bloom, and their colorful petals attract bees and butterflies, showing us the change of seasons.

Since I started my career as a fiction writer, I have often switched between writing novels and short stories. My routine is this: after finishing a novel, I want to write short stories. Once I complete a group of short stories, I feel ready to focus on a novel again. I never write short stories while working on a novel, and I don’t write a novel while working on short stories. This is because each type of writing uses different parts of my brain, and it takes time to switch from one to the other.

I began my career with two short novels in 1975, and from 1984 to 1985, I started writing short stories. I didn’t know much about writing short stories back then, so it was challenging, but I found it very memorable. I felt my fictional world expand, and readers seemed to enjoy this new side of me as a writer. One of my early stories, “Breaking Waves,” was included in my first collection, Tales from Abroad. This was my beginning as a short-story writer.

One of the best things about writing short stories is that they don’t take long to finish. Usually, it takes me about a week to write a short story (though I can spend a lot of time revising it). This is different from the long time and effort needed to write a novel, which can take a year or two. When I write a novel, it can feel like it goes on forever, and I sometimes wonder if I will finish. So, writing short stories is a nice change for me.

Another great thing about short stories is that you can create them from the smallest ideas – a thought, a word, or an image. It often feels like jazz improvisation, where the story takes me where it wants to go. Plus, with short stories, you don’t have to worry about failing. If an idea doesn’t work out, you can just move on and remind yourself that not every story can be perfect. Even famous writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver didn’t write a masterpiece every time. This gives me comfort. You can learn from your mistakes and use that knowledge in your next story.

When I write novels, I try to learn from both my successes and failures in writing short stories. In this way, short stories are like a testing ground for me as a novelist. It is hard to experiment in the same way within a novel, so without short stories, writing novels would be even more difficult for me. My short stories are like soft shadows I have left in the world, and I remember exactly where I placed each one and how I felt when I did. Short stories are like guideposts to my heart, and it makes me happy as a writer to share these personal feelings with my readers."
4,"At its core, science is closely related to philosophy, but it also helps us solve real problems, like curing diseases. Science has made our lives easier, but it can also create risks. It tries to understand everything from tiny atoms to the vast universe. Science influences many areas, including poetry, politics, and philosophy. Sometimes, its beauty is only seen by those who study it deeply, and its dangers are often misunderstood. People have different opinions about how important science is, and its mistakes are sometimes ignored or exaggerated.

The history of science is full of disagreements. Old ideas are often changed or replaced by new ones. Just like in music, new ideas can be laughed at before they become accepted. Scientists can be jealous or angry, and conflicts are common in scientific history. This book will show how scientific ideas have changed not just science, but also how we think about many things. While science has practical uses, we will focus more on the ideas themselves, appreciating their beauty and being ready to question them. We must remember that human understanding has limits.

Science is always changing. There is always a scientist who is proving another scientist wrong. Most of the time, these changes do not disturb society too much. However, sometimes, big changes challenge our established beliefs. For example, in the 1600s, science described the universe as a giant clock. Now, physics has raised questions about this view, showing that our observations can change what we see and that we do not fully understand our basic ideas.

Some people think that the changing nature of science means it cannot explain the universe. However, changes in science usually help us understand and predict nature better. For instance, Isaac Newton explained more than the ancient Greek thinker Aristotle, and Albert Einstein explained even more than Newton. Science may make mistakes, but it keeps moving forward. 

At the end of the 1800s, many physicists thought there was not much left to discover. Then, new ideas like radioactivity, X-rays, and quantum mechanics changed everything. Biology has also made many discoveries. Today, some people believe we are close to finding a complete theory that explains everything about the universe. 

Science is not just a fun activity. In the last 200 years, we have gone from simply observing nature to controlling it in some ways. Sometimes, we have upset the balance of nature without fully understanding the consequences. It is important for everyone, not just scientists, to understand scientific advances because they will shape the future for our children. Science is now a key part of how we think about and shape our future. The decisions we make based on science can affect everything from government budgets to the health of future generations and the survival of life on Earth."
5,"From around 2015, after many years of growth, big publishers started to say that ebook sales had stopped growing or even decreased in some cases. This raised new doubts about the future of ebooks in the publishing industry. One publishing executive even said that the excitement about ebooks may have led to bad investments, making his company lose faith in the value of printed books. Even though it seems clear that ebooks and printed books can exist together, people still ask if ebooks will replace printed books. Whether people want to predict this or deny it, the idea of books disappearing continues to spark our imagination and create strong discussions. 

Why is this idea so strong? Why do we see the relationship between ebooks and printed books as a fight, even when evidence shows they can coexist? The answers to these questions go beyond ebooks and reveal our mixed feelings of excitement and fear about change and new technology. In my research, I have shown that the idea of one type of media replacing another often happens when new technologies are introduced. For example, when television was invented, many thought radio would disappear. But radio survived by finding new ways to be used, like listening in cars or at work. 

The idea that books might disappear is not new either. In 1894, people thought that the phonograph would replace books with what we now call audiobooks. This pattern has happened many times. Movies, radio, television, hyperlinks, and smartphones have all been said to threaten printed books at different times. Some people believed that the end of books would lead to a decline in culture, while others thought ebooks would create a better future. 

The idea of books disappearing often comes up during times of technological change. This idea reflects our hopes and fears about new technology. We form emotional connections with different types of media as they become important in our lives. Many studies show that we can feel close to objects like books, televisions, and computers, even naming our cars or getting frustrated with our laptops. So, when a new technology, like e-readers, appears, it changes our relationship with something we have grown attached to. As technology advances, we often miss what we used to know. This is why industries develop around older products and technologies. 

For example, when the printing press was introduced in 15th-century Europe, people started to look for original manuscripts. The change from silent to sound movies in the 1920s made people nostalgic for the older style. The same happened when photography changed from analog to digital and from vinyl records to CDs. E-readers have also made people appreciate the physical qualities of printed books, even their smell. This should comfort those who worry about printed books disappearing. 

However, the idea of disappearing media will continue to be an interesting story about how technology changes our lives and our fear of change. One way we deal with change is by using familiar stories, like those of tragedy and endings. The story of the death of the book is easy to remember and share. It reflects both our excitement for the future and our fear of losing parts of our familiar world and ourselves."
6,"Text: 

For a year and a half, I woke up every weekday at 5:30 in the morning. I brushed my teeth, made coffee, and wrote about how some of the greatest thinkers of the last four hundred years managed their time. I wanted to understand how they organized their days to be creative and productive. By writing about their daily lives – when they slept, ate, worked, and worried – I hoped to show a different side of their personalities and careers. 

The French writer Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin once said, “Tell me what you eat, and I shall tell you what you are.” I believe it’s also important to know what time you eat and if you take a nap afterward. This book is not just about the final work of these creative people; it looks at their daily habits. It is also personal because I face similar questions in my life: How can you do meaningful creative work while making a living? Is it better to focus completely on one project or to work a little each day? When there isn’t enough time, do you have to give up things like sleep or a clean house, or can you learn to do more in less time?

I don’t have all the answers to these questions, but I have shared examples of how many successful people have dealt with similar challenges. I wanted to show how big creative ideas can be broken down into small daily actions and how daily habits can affect the work itself. The title of the book is Daily Rituals, but I really focused on people’s routines. Routines can seem boring, but they can also help us use our time, willpower, and optimism better. A good routine can help us stay focused and avoid being influenced by our moods.

The psychologist William James believed that having good habits allows us to focus on more interesting things. Ironically, he struggled with procrastination and could not keep a regular schedule. My own procrastination helped me start this book. One Sunday afternoon, I was at my job at a small architecture magazine, trying to write a story that was due the next day. Instead of working, I found myself cleaning my desk and making coffee. I am a “morning person,” so I can focus well in the morning but not in the afternoon. To feel better about this, I started looking online for information about other writers’ schedules. I found many interesting stories and thought it would be great to collect them. This led to the Daily Routines blog I started that day and now this book.

The blog was simple; I shared descriptions of people’s routines from biographies and articles. For the book, I gathered more detailed and researched information while keeping the variety of voices that made the blog interesting. I let my subjects speak for themselves through quotes from their letters, diaries, and interviews. In some cases, I summarized their routines from other sources. I want to thank the many biographers, journalists, and scholars whose work helped me. I have listed all my sources in the Notes section for those who want to read more."
7,"Howard became a palaeontologist because of a change in interest rates when he was six years old. His father, who was careful with money, said that their planned holiday to Spain was not possible anymore. Instead, they rented a small house on the English coast. One rainy August afternoon, Howard found an ammonite on the beach. He had always wanted to be a palaeontologist, and by the end of university, he knew what kind he wanted to be. He was interested in the very early history of life, not in dinosaurs or the Jurassic period. He studied small, ancient creatures found in grey rocks.

When he finished his doctoral thesis, he wondered if he would get a job. He believed in himself and knew he had good potential, but he also knew that hard work does not always lead to success. When a job opened at Tavistock College in London, he applied, but he did not expect much.

On the day of his interview, the professor who was supposed to lead the panel had a fight with his wife. He left home upset, crashed his car, and ended up in the hospital. The interview happened without him, and a colleague who did not like the professor took his place. This colleague helped Howard get the job, even though Howard did not know him well. At first, Howard was grateful, but later he learned that the situation was not as he thought. He was a little disappointed but was mostly happy to have the job and be able to do the work he loved.

Howard often thought about how organized his work life was compared to his personal life, which could be chaotic. Many people can affect your life, and sometimes a stranger can change everything. This happened to Howard when someone stole his briefcase with his lecture notes at a train station. Angry, he went back to college, called to postpone his lecture, and reported the theft. After that, he went for coffee and met a colleague who was with a visitor from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. 

During this meeting, Howard learned about a new collection of fossils that needed to be studied. This could be his biggest challenge and help his career. Because of the theft, he changed his plans. He decided not to go to a conference in Stockholm or take students on a trip to Scotland. Instead, he would find a way to visit the museum in Nairobi."
8,"Charles Spence is a professor at Oxford University in the UK, and he is not picky about food. He even has ice cream made from bee larvae at home. Although they look like maggots, they taste a bit like nuts and flowers. Spence and his team are trying to make eating bugs more acceptable. He studies how our senses work together to create the flavors we taste. This research affects what we eat and drink, from big food companies to fancy restaurant menus.

Spence's book, The Perfect Meal, co-written with Betina Piqueras-Fiszman, shares interesting facts about food. For example, did you know that the first person to order in a restaurant usually enjoys their meal the most? Also, we eat about 35% more food when we are with one other person, and 75% more when we are with three people.

Spence's lab in Oxford is simple and not very modern. It has soundproof booths and old audio-visual equipment. By keeping costs low, he can work with chefs who cannot pay for research. Much of his work is funded by a large food company. In the past, university research funded by companies was not seen as serious, but now it is important for universities to show their work has an impact.

Spence helps food brands reduce salt and sugar in their products. This is important for keeping customers healthy. Many companies make these changes slowly so that customers do not notice. Spence found that when people know about these changes, they focus more on the taste and often do not like it as much.

Spence met famous chef Heston Blumenthal while working on a project for a food company. At that time, people thought mixing science and food was strange, but Spence believed it was important. Together, they created a dish called ""Sound of the Sea,"" which uses sound to enhance the dining experience. Spence has discovered that different sounds can change how we taste food. For example, high-pitched music can make food taste sweeter, while low sounds can make it taste bitter.

Soon, an airline will match music with the food served to passengers. Last year, a well-known brand released an app that played music while ice cream melted, but they did not match the music to the taste, which is often the case.

At home, Spence has unique dinner parties. Once, they ate rabbit with the fur around the cutlery. Another time, they used remote-controlled lights during dinner. They have even tested different drinks with sounds to see how it affects taste. For Spence, home, sweet shops, food events, and conferences are all part of his research."
9,"Our brains are working harder than ever. We are bombarded with facts, false information, and rumors that we must sort through to find what is important and what we can ignore. At the same time, we are doing more things ourselves. Thirty years ago, travel agents booked our flights and salespeople helped us in stores. Now, we do most of these tasks on our own. We are trying to manage many responsibilities, like our families, jobs, hobbies, and favorite TV shows, all while using our smartphones. These devices help us fill every free moment with activities. 

However, there is a problem. Even though we think we are multitasking—doing many things at once—this is actually a misleading idea. Earl Miller, a neuroscientist at MIT, explains that our brains are not good at multitasking. When we think we are multitasking, we are really just switching quickly between tasks. Each time we switch, it costs us mental energy. So, we are not like expert jugglers; we are more like beginners trying to keep many plates spinning, worried that one will fall.

Even though we believe we are getting a lot done, multitasking makes us less efficient. It can increase stress hormones in our bodies, which can lead to confusion and unclear thinking. Multitasking also makes our brains crave constant stimulation, which can distract us easily. The part of our brain that helps us focus can be easily pulled away by new things, just like shiny objects attract babies.

Having the chance to multitask can hurt our ability to think clearly. Glenn Wilson, a psychology professor, found that trying to focus on a task while seeing an unread email can lower our IQ by almost 10 points. He showed that the mental loss from multitasking is even worse than being tired. Russ Poldrack, a neuroscientist at Stanford, discovered that learning while multitasking can send information to the wrong part of the brain. For example, if students do homework while watching TV, the information may not be stored properly, making it harder to remember later.

Multitasking also involves making decisions, like whether to reply to a text or ignore it. Making decisions is tough on our brains, and small decisions can use as much mental energy as big ones. After making many small choices, we can end up making poor decisions about important matters.

In discussions about information overload, email is often mentioned as a problem. It’s not that email itself is bad, but the huge amount of messages we receive can be overwhelming. When a 10-year-old boy was asked what his father does, he said, “He answers emails.” His father agreed that this is quite true. We feel we must respond to emails, but it often feels impossible to do that and accomplish anything else."
10,"In a zoo in Sweden, a chimpanzee named Santino spent his nights breaking concrete into pieces to throw at visitors during the day. Was he being mean? In caves in the US, female bats help other fruit bat mothers if they can’t find the right position to give birth. Are they being kind? Fifty years ago, people thought these questions were not important. Animals had behaviors, and science studied those behaviors and their results. The idea that animals have thoughts, feelings, and morals was seen as silly. But this has started to change. Research on bats, chimps, rats, dolphins, and chickens has begun to explore animal emotions. This change has reached popular science books, like Mark Bekoff’s ""Wild Justice"" and Victoria Braithwaite’s ""Do Fish Feel Pain?"". This has started a debate that may never be fully answered: do animals have consciousness? This debate leads to another question: do animals have a sense of right and wrong that guides their actions? 

In a recent experiment with cows, those that opened a locked gate to get food showed more happiness by jumping and kicking than those that had the gate opened for them. If cows enjoy solving problems, what does this mean for how we raise and eat beef? While the observations are clear, people disagree on what they mean. Dr. Jonathan Balcombe, who wrote ""Second Nature,"" believes we should stop eating meat. He thinks we are close to a big change in how we think about ethics, similar to the end of slavery. Aubrey Manning, a professor at Edinburgh University, believes we should rethink how we understand animal thinking. He says animals likely have a simpler understanding of the world than humans. Professor Euan MacPhail thinks we should not project human feelings onto animals. These three views may never agree because the main issue is not just scientific or moral, but philosophical. Since it is very hard to define consciousness, can we ever really know what it is like to be a bat, or a bat helping another bat?

Balcombe describes an important experiment he did that suggests starlings, a type of bird, can feel depressed. In a study at Newcastle University, starlings were divided into two groups. One group lived in nice cages with plenty of space and water, while the other group lived in small, empty cages. At first, both groups learned to eat tasty worms from one box and avoid unpleasant worms from another. But when only unpleasant worms were offered, only the starlings in the nice cages would eat. Balcombe concluded that living in a bad cage made the starlings feel negative about life. Balcombe, who has worked with animal rights groups, has a strong opinion. He says, “We look back with disgust at a time of racism. One day, we will feel the same about how we view animals. We can’t support animal rights while eating a cheeseburger.” 

If Balcombe were the only one with this view, it might be easy to ignore him. But Professor Aubrey Manning shares similar ideas. Manning has written a textbook called ""An Introduction to Animal Behaviour."" He says, “What we are seeing is a swing in ideas. In the early 20th century, some people thought animals thought just like us, and then there was a reaction against that. Now we are moving back to the idea that animals have thoughts. But this is a very debated topic, and we should be careful about listening to academics with strong personal opinions.”"
11,"Critical thinking is a way to understand what we read or hear more deeply. Adrian West, a research director at the Edward de Bono Foundation in the U.K., believes that arguing can help us find the truth. While technology helps us store and process information, there are worries that it also makes it harder for us to think deeply about complex problems. West points out that we are often surrounded by poor quality thinking and popular opinions that can confuse us. Even though we have more information than ever, it does not always lead to better knowledge or decisions. 

According to the National Endowment for the Arts, fewer people are reading literature, and this decline is speeding up. Patricia Greenfield, a psychology professor, thinks that focusing more on visual media, like videos and games, may hurt our critical thinking skills. She says that people are multitasking and not concentrating on one thing as much as before. However, we still do not have a clear answer on how technology affects critical thinking. 

Technology has changed how we think, and it can have both positive and negative effects. For example, some computer games can help improve critical thinking, while reading online can enhance our ability to analyze information. Greenfield has studied how learning and technology interact and found that reading helps develop imagination and critical thinking, while visual media like video games and TV do not engage our imagination in the same way. 

However, she also found that visual media can help with some types of information processing. Unfortunately, many visual media do not give us time to think or reflect. This can lead to young people not reaching their full potential. 

How society views technology affects how we think about critical thinking. James Paul Gee, a professor of educational psychology, argues that video games can actually be good for learning. He says that while many believe video games are bad for kids, they can also be a great tool for education. Some games, like Sim City and Civilization, teach important skills like decision-making and analysis in a fun way. These games allow players to explore ideas that they might not be able to in real life. 

In today’s digital world, as reading and math scores go down, it is important to understand how technology affects our thinking and analysis."
12,"When Matthew Crawford is not thinking and writing about how we should live, he works as a motorcycle mechanic. He chose this job after he became unhappy with working in an office and for social policy organizations. His first book was about the good things about manual jobs. His latest book talks about how to deal with modern life. He got the idea for this book when he was shopping and saw advertisements on the credit card machine while he was entering his pin number. Crawford realized that it is becoming harder to avoid things that demand our attention. What we want to think about at any moment is personal, but we often cannot choose this for ourselves because of things we do not notice. It is getting harder to think or remember conversations we’ve had. Because everyone wants to avoid being interrupted, we often stop talking to strangers. Crawford says, “We see the world through things that are made for us, like video games and apps on our phones.” These things reflect our desires and can take over our lives.

Crawford is not the only one who is worried. Many office workers complain about emails all day and then spend their free time checking emails. Studies show that our attention can wander if a phone is just sitting on the table. Many of us have felt bored at dinner, wanting to check our phones. There is no scientific proof yet that our attention spans have changed, but people have worried about this since the telegraph was invented in 1837. It is clear that we are more aware of other things we could be doing. Some people think this problem is caused by technology, but Crawford believes that technology has made it easier for us to focus on ourselves. With so many choices, it is hard to control ourselves, and this affects our social lives. We often prefer to send a text message instead of talking to someone face-to-face. Crawford argues that by only interacting with screens instead of real people, we risk losing important connections in our society.

He gives an example from his gym. There used to be one music player in the middle of the room that everyone could use. People had different music tastes, which sometimes caused tension. Now, people listen to their own music with earbuds. “The gym used to be a social place, but it has lost that feeling,” he says. Real connections with others often happen when there is some conflict, like discussing different music tastes.

Crawford suggests two solutions. First, we need to control noise and distractions in public spaces. More importantly, he believes we should engage in skilled activities to connect with the world in a more satisfying way. He mentions cooks, ice-hockey players, and motorcycle racers as examples of people who deal with real things. No video game can replace the feeling of a hockey puck on ice or the gravel under your tires when you ride fast. These people use their good judgment and manage their surroundings. “When you engage with the world this way, fake experiences seem less important than real ones,” he says. “They lose some of their power.”

This does not mean everyone should become a chef; it is important to find ways to use your judgment. There are many benefits beyond job satisfaction. Constantly fighting distractions can be tiring and make it harder to focus on what is important. On the other hand, paying attention to one thing can help you pay attention to other things too."
13,"Text: 

""What do you do for a living?"" This is a common question in small talk, and we often define ourselves by our jobs. However, if you are a philosopher like me, it can be a bit tricky. Saying you are a philosopher can sound a bit showy. It’s better to say you study or teach philosophy. Many people think that calling yourself a philosopher means you know some special truth, but that’s not true. Philosophers are just like everyone else.

One reason people have this idea about philosophers is that they often judge what others do and celebrate thinking. The Greek philosopher Aristotle believed that a life spent thinking deeply was the best kind of life. While not all modern philosophers agree, philosophy is still seen as connected to deep thinking. Another Greek philosopher, Socrates, said that ""the unexamined life is not worth living."" This means that just going along with what everyone else thinks can make life less satisfying. 

Thinking about our lives helps us make our own choices. However, you don’t need to read many difficult philosophical books or live a life away from society to examine your life. It just means paying more attention to your daily experiences to see if they are meaningful. The examined life is practical and should be shared because it is important for a good life.

Another reason people misunderstand philosophers is that academic philosophy has become more separate from everyday life, especially for those who don’t have formal training. This is not only the philosophers' fault; universities often focus on expensive journals and evaluations, making it hard for philosophers to share their ideas with anyone outside their small group of experts. Because of this, philosophy can seem far away from real life. 

Many philosophers used to challenge this view, but now some accept it. The academic world has created a situation where philosophers are isolated. As philosophy has become more focused on specific debates, it has become harder for those outside the field to understand. In some cases, philosophy has even pulled away from society.

I sometimes call myself an ""ethicist"" because I work in ethics, which is about judging human actions. Recently, I feel this title doesn’t fully describe my work because ethics is often linked to formal rules and laws. There is a new area in philosophy called applied ethics, which looks at whether certain social practices are fair. The job of an ethicist today is to decide if an action is ethical or acceptable. These are important questions that I think about often.

A typical discussion might start by asking if downloading movies illegally is wrong (it is) and then move on to bigger questions about responsibility, our views on art, and how consumerism affects us. Philosophy can help people think more deeply about the actions and behaviors that shape their lives. Sometimes we might find out something we already knew; other times, we may realize our beliefs are hard to defend. Either way, by examining these ideas, we can do something good for everyone."
14,"**Simplified Text:**

People who love food, like foodies and chefs, might think that thinking about what and how we eat can make eating more enjoyable. However, in history, discussions about food have often been less important than other philosophical topics. When philosophers talk about eating, they usually use it as a way to discuss something else, like gaining knowledge. Sometimes, conversations about food seem to be about food, but they often explore deeper ideas that are not directly related.

One interesting philosopher is Epicurus, who believed in seeking pleasure and avoiding pain in many areas of life. His name is now often connected with enjoying food and drink. You can see his name in restaurants, food shops, and recipe websites. These businesses likely hope to attract customers by linking their products to famous philosophers.

Food is also a social and cultural experience. The food we eat comes from history and is shared with our communities. These communities help us find people to eat with and provide the means to grow and distribute food. We interact with food more than with any other product, making it a clear topic for philosophical discussion.

Once food is ready, critics start to talk and write about it. But why do they have such a special role? One philosopher pointed out that tasting food is not a special skill; food critics are just better at describing flavors. This area has not been studied much, as most research on perception has focused on sight. This needs to change.

Another important part of food is its beauty. We often talk about art and music being beautiful, but we don’t usually talk about the taste of food in the same way. Some philosophers believe that, with the growth of modern cooking, food deserves to be discussed as art, like sculpture or poetry. However, food is eaten and gone after we enjoy it, unlike art that we can keep and appreciate over time. This makes it hard to say that food can be considered beautiful in the same way.

There are also many ethical questions about food. We can ask what we should eat: organic, free-range, local, vegetarian, or non-genetically modified foods? Our answers often show our beliefs about ethics. Philosophers will always question why we choose what we do, and discussing these issues is important.

Cooking at home and in restaurants can be very different. Home cooks have a special responsibility to their guests because of their personal relationships. In a home kitchen, everyone shares food and time together. In contrast, professional cooks have duties to their employers and the food itself. Their kitchens are not open to everyone, and their relationships are more like colleagues than friends.

A recent essay called ""Diplomacy of the Dish"" looks at how food and dining can help connect different cultures. This happens in two ways: first, we can learn to appreciate other cultures by enjoying their food; second, we can build friendships with people from other cultures by sharing meals. This practice has a long history in international relations. The essay includes many interesting examples and stories that make this part of food philosophy come alive for readers."
15,"Rob Daviau is a game designer from the US who creates ‘legacy’ board games. He felt that the traditional board games he played as a child were not fun or challenging anymore, so he thought about how board games could change. He wondered if they could have a story and if choices made in one game could affect future games. He took a classic game called Risk and made a new version called Risk Legacy. In this game, decisions made during play have lasting effects. Players might have to tear up cards, mark the board, or open new packets with different rules at important moments. The game is played over several sessions, and players can hold grudges that affect the game. Daviau said, “You could point to the board and say: ‘Right here! You did this!’”

Later, he worked on a legacy version of Pandemic, a popular game where players work together to cure diseases. His next project was a game called SeaFall. While Pandemic Legacy was very successful, SeaFall was seen as a big test for the legacy format because it was the first game that did not follow an earlier version. In SeaFall, players become sailors in the age of sail (16th to mid-19th century) and explore a new world. Designers of legacy games must think about all possible player choices to keep the story interesting. To do this, they use play-testers to see how the games work. Jaime Barriga, a play-tester for SeaFall, said, “It takes a lot of time. Sometimes the first few games are great, but then later games can have problems, and you have to fix everything.”

Legacy board games were not expected to become very popular. When Daviau was creating the idea, he thought it would only appeal to a small group of people. He said, “I thought I would be known as the guy who did this weird project.” However, many players, like Russell Chapman, loved the idea. He believes it is one of the biggest improvements in game design in years. He said, “It’s a new level of commitment, intensity, and excitement.” Another fan, Ben Hogg, said that the fun of a new adventure was more important than worrying about how long the game would last. He mentioned that people don’t usually watch the same movie twice in the cinema; they want a new experience. 

The legacy format is inspired by video games and popular TV shows. While in college, Daviau wanted to be a television writer but later moved into advertising and game design. Still, he loved telling stories. Matt Leacock, the creator of Pandemic, compared making a legacy game to writing a novel. He said, “You need to know how you want it to end and have a good idea of where to start, but you also need more than just an outline.” Daviau feels proud of his work but is curious to see how others will use the idea. He thinks gamers will soon want something new. Colby Dauch, the studio manager for SeaFall, believes the legacy format has changed how people think about board games."
16,"One night not long ago, an octopus named Inky escaped from his tank at New Zealand’s National Aquarium. He crawled across the floor and squeezed into a small drain that led to the Pacific Ocean. This story was exciting and was shared a lot online. People enjoy stories like this because they like to think that animals are similar to us. Octopuses are especially interesting because they are very smart and look very different from humans. They can open jars, recognize faces, use coconut shells for protection, and even play in clever ways.

Some scientists, like Dr. Frans de Waal, study animal intelligence. He believes that instead of thinking animals are not like us, we should recognize their human-like qualities. He has studied many years of research on animal intelligence and found that animals can do many things we thought only humans could do, like remembering the past and the future, showing empathy, and understanding what others want.

In the past, people believed that animals were smart enough to be put on trial for crimes. Even Charles Darwin, who changed how we see our place in the world, said that the difference between human and animal minds is not so big. However, in the twentieth century, many scientists started to see animals as simple machines that only respond to rewards and punishments. This view became popular at the same time that humans were harming animal habitats and not caring for their welfare.

Now, Dr. de Waal thinks we are starting to understand that animal intelligence is more similar to human intelligence. He says that we are learning a lot about animals, especially with the help of the internet. He believes that the best tests for animal intelligence should consider the special skills of each species. For example, squirrels might not do well on human memory tests, but they are great at remembering where they hide their nuts.

In her book, The Soul of an Octopus, naturalist Sy Montgomery suggests that if an octopus tested human intelligence, it might judge us by how well we can change the colors of our skin. If we failed, it might think we are not very smart.

Dr. de Waal is not completely sure that Inky really knew how to escape to the ocean. He points out that while some octopuses have escaped before, it might be too hopeful to think Inky planned his escape. However, he understands that stories like Inky's help people appreciate animal intelligence. He once did an experiment with capuchin monkeys to see if they could feel envy. When some monkeys received cucumbers and others got grapes, the ones with cucumbers became very upset. This study was published in a scientific journal, but a short video of the experiment made people really believe the findings. This shows how our understanding of animal minds is still growing."

Robotics, once just a part of science fiction, is now changing our world in a big way. Robots have been used in car and factory production for many years, but experts believe we are about to see robots used in many more areas. They warn that many countries are not ready for this big change. 

Many people think that robots will take over most jobs in the next 50 years. However, about 80% of people believe their own jobs will still exist in the same way. This shows that we feel safe about our jobs, but we shouldn’t. Every industry will be affected by robots soon. For example, an Australian company called Fastbrick Robotics has created a robot named Hadrian X that can lay 1,000 bricks in one hour. This job would take two human workers a whole day or more.

Another example is a robot called Tally, made by a company in San Francisco. Tally moves around supermarkets to check if products are in stock and correctly priced, instead of cleaning the aisles. 

Supporters of robots say that robots cannot fix or program themselves yet. This means new jobs will be created for skilled workers like technicians and programmers. However, some people worry that we should not forget the importance of human skills at work. They believe society is not ready for the changes that will come when robots take over some jobs.

Dr. Jing Bing Zhang, an expert in robotics, studies how robots will change the workforce. His recent report says that in two years, one-third of robots will be smarter and able to work with other robots and humans safely. In three years, many big companies will have a chief robotics officer, and some governments will create laws about robots. In five years, salaries in the robotics field will rise by at least 60%, but many jobs will still be unfilled because there aren’t enough skilled workers.

Zhang says that automation will affect lower-skilled workers, which is unfortunate. He believes these workers need to retrain themselves instead of waiting for the government to protect their jobs. People cannot expect to do the same job for their whole lives anymore.

New technologies will also create new types of robots for homes, which we have not seen before. These robots will be able to interact with us in more advanced ways, similar to those in science fiction. Zhang believes this is a great chance for companies, but it also brings challenges, like the need for new rules to keep us safe and protect our privacy.

With many jobs at risk and a global employment crisis coming, it is important to focus on education. Developed countries need more graduates in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) to stay competitive in the future."
18,"Text: George Mallory, a famous mountaineer, once answered a reporter's question about why he wanted to climb Mount Everest by saying, ""Because it’s there."" This answer shows a common feeling: many people wonder why someone would take such a dangerous risk. Some might feel inspired by his words to follow their dreams, while others see climbing as just an adventure and a way to have fun.

In 1967, Bolivian writer Tejada-Flores wrote an important essay called ""Games that Climbers Play."" He described seven different climbing activities, from playing on small rocks to climbing high mountains, each with its own rules. He believed that the way climbers approach a climb depends on the rules of the specific activity. Over the years, this idea has become popular in climbing discussions, from magazines to casual talks.

Many climbers love the feeling of freedom that climbing gives them. However, climbing can also feel very limiting. For example, being stuck in a tent during a storm is not what most people think of as freedom. This creates a contradiction in climbing. But some argue that having fewer choices can actually make life simpler and provide a different kind of freedom.

When asked ""Why climb?"", US rock climber Joe Fitschen suggests a different question: ""Why do people climb?"" He believes that climbing is part of human nature. We are born to take on challenges and test our limits, even if it is risky. The joy we find in climbing is more about our biology than just logical thinking.

Another important idea comes from US academic Brian Treanor, who says that climbing can help us develop important qualities like courage, humility, and respect for nature. While not all climbers show these qualities, Treanor believes they are especially important in today’s world, which often avoids risks. Climbing can help us grow and live better lives outside of climbing.

Some climbers believe that those who climb without help from others or technology must be very dedicated to succeed. Expert climbers Ebert and Robinson stirred some debate by saying that climbs done alone or without extra support deserve more recognition than those done with teams or special equipment, like bottled oxygen. This idea raised concerns that it might encourage climbers to take unnecessary risks.

We can also look at climbing from a different perspective. Many climbers talk about being ""in the moment"" or ""going with the flow."" The physical effort, the focus while climbing, and the instinctive problem-solving are all key parts of the experience. Some argue that climbing is similar to techniques in Zen philosophy, which helps people find peace of mind. This gives us another idea to think about when we ask why people are attracted to climbing."
19,"Over the last sixty years, the pianist Alfred Brendel became very important in classical music. He was a serious person who studied and recorded many famous European piano works. He wrote and performed a lot, but he did not teach many students. People who knew him saw a fun side to him, but he rarely showed it during his concerts. His life was a strict routine of studying, traveling, and performing.

About four or five years ago, a young boy named Kit Armstrong came to one of Brendel’s concerts and asked him for lessons. At first, Brendel did not take this request seriously. He had very few students and did not see a reason to start teaching now. He remembered a famous pianist who said, “You don’t hire a mountain guide to teach a child how to walk.” However, he was impressed by Kit, who was about 14 years old. Brendel listened to him play and said, “He played very well and from memory. Then he gave me a CD of a recital where he played so beautifully that I thought, ‘I have to make time for him.’ It was a performance that took you from the first note to the last. It’s rare to find a musician with this kind of understanding and skill.”

As Brendel steps back from the public eye, Kit is starting to become more known. Brendel is careful, worried that Kit might burn out too quickly. Now 19, Kit is always busy, learning new languages, studying math, writing computer code, or playing tennis, all while his mother watches over him. He also composes music. Brendel says, “This is very important. Learning to read music is easier when you try to write your own. I noticed that Kit has an amazing memory and can read music very well. He listens to his own playing and understands what I explain to him. When I tell him something to do in a piece, he can do it everywhere in that piece.”

Brendel becomes serious and says, “I don’t want to raise expectations. I get very upset when newspapers do this. One article called him the future great pianist of the 21st century, which is not good. It can cause problems. Like many talented young players, he can play some things very well, but he still needs time and experience for others. It would be unfair if a critic expected him to be perfect.”

Now at 80 years old, Brendel is more relaxed in his retirement. He explains, “When I was young, I didn’t want to be famous quickly, but I wanted to achieve certain things by the time I was 50. When I turned 50, I felt I had done most of those things, but I still wanted to do more, so I continued. Even though I don’t have the same physical strength now, I still have many ideas in my mind and pieces I’ve never played. I don’t perform now, but I enjoy this new phase of my life.”"
20,"When I was a child, I thought gardens were beautiful places. My grandad’s garden was by a river and sloped down to the water. You couldn’t get to the river, but you could hear the water and the birds in the trees. I believed all gardens were like this – peaceful and quiet. 

Grandad’s garden was simple. He didn’t have a fancy greenhouse like some neighbors. Their greenhouses were made from old window frames, with plastic covering broken glass. At home, my father was often quiet. He had a sense of humor and liked to say funny phrases, like “It’s immaterial to me.” He didn’t have many dreams and left school without qualifications. He became a plumber, which he didn’t love. He wasn’t very ambitious, although he and my mother once thought about moving to Canada, but it didn’t happen. 

My father was good at fixing things around the house. He could build bookshelves and cupboards very well. My parents only moved house once, but my mother loved changing the furniture. Just when you got used to one chair, she would bring in another. The biggest change was when a piano arrived. I wanted to like it, but it made me nervous. I liked the two brass candlesticks on it, but my mother thought they were too fancy, and they disappeared while I was at school. I was never allowed to play the piano; my sister took lessons instead. When I asked my mother why, she said, “You’d never have practiced.”

Of the places to explore – moors, woods, or the river – I always chose the river. I could imagine a different world there. With a fishing net over my shoulder, I would walk along the riverbank in old sandals. I looked for a good spot to take off my sandals and leave them with my picnic while I searched for fish to catch. After trying to keep the fish alive in the backyard, I had to return them to the water.

I wanted to leave school quickly, but it seemed impossible until one day my father said, “There’s a job for an apprentice gardener in the Parks Department. I thought you might like it.” In that moment, he surprised me. He might have preferred if I became a carpenter, but I believe he saw my love for gardening. Even though he didn’t like gardening himself, I think he noticed my passion for plants and flowers."
21,"Lawrence MacEwen is crouching down on his Scottish island, the Isle of Muck. I am doing the same. A strong wind from the Atlantic is trying to blow us off the steep cliff at our feet and into the ocean below. Then, MacEwen’s sheepdog, Tie, comes close, and his owner gently pets him. The loud wind cannot make MacEwen uncomfortable on his island, where he feels at home. 

MacEwen is showing me around his neighborhood. He points to the north and shouts, “That island is Eigg. The one to the west is the Isle of Rum. It gets twice as much rain as we do.” I see dark clouds pouring rain on Rum’s big mountains. “Just beyond Rum is the island of Soay.” 

Suddenly, MacEwen says, “I have sheep to move,” as rain starts to come our way. We walk down the slopes, and he tells me more about the island: Volcanic Muck is three kilometers long and one and a half kilometers wide; its geese eat a lot of grass; and the MacEwen family has lived here for 3000 years. 

While herding the sheep, Tie, the sheepdog, is not doing a good job. “Away to me, Tie. Away to me,” means the dog should go to the right, but he goes straight through the flock, causing confusion. “Tie,” MacEwen says sadly. “That will never do.” The dog looks ashamed. 

The Isle of Muck is mostly run by the MacEwen family. Lawrence and his wife, Jenny, run the farm; their son Colin manages the island cottages; and their daughter Mary runs the island hotel, Port Mor, with her husband, Toby. Mary and Toby enjoy that their two boys can explore the island and sail small boats in the summer. “They go out the door and come back only when they’re hungry.” 

But living on the island has its challenges. For example, electricity is only available sometimes. On my first evening, I wait for the lights to turn on. The next morning, I see Mary preparing breakfast with a flashlight. I also have to deal with no mobile phone service. “You can get a signal on the hill,” Mary tells me. “Most people last a couple of days, then just put their phone away.” So I do the same. 

Everything on Muck feels surprising. Today, the boat brings some groceries and three musicians who come off carrying instruments. Their concert in the island’s tearoom is a big success, and the islanders enjoy the music. 

That night, sitting by a warm fire while it rains outside, Lawrence tells me how he met his wife, Jenny. “Her father saw a small farm on the Isle of Soay in a newspaper and bought it without looking at it. He had never been to Scotland. Jenny was sent to manage it.” Did Jenny know how to run a farm? “She had good typing skills.” 

I go to bed listening to the rain and wake up to more rain. But I eat well, as almost all my food comes from the island. Mary sends me to fisherman Sandy Mathers for fresh fish. I carry it back through the village and give it to Mary at the kitchen door. By 7 pm, our fish is on the table, and it is delicious. 

The next morning, I worry about my ferry ride to the next island. Many ferries had been canceled in the last two months because of rough seas. If my ferry does not come, I would be stuck on Muck for two more days, which I secretly wish for, phone or no phone."

The game design industry used to be mostly for computer scientists and self-taught people. It was often seen as just a hobby for young fans. However, the video game industry is now taken seriously. This might surprise some people, but experts in the field are not surprised. Getting into this industry is not easy. Video game spin-offs that come out quickly after a new movie need many team members and a lot of skill and hard work.

Jim Donelly, a spokesperson for an online games magazine, says, “It is very hard to make progress in big companies or to change the big mainstream games. But the truth is, the industry needs game designers more than ever. They need not just the top-level directors who manage the whole game, but also the lower-level designers who create systems and individual parts of the game.”

So, how can you enter this competitive industry? Many companies prefer candidates with a degree in computer science, but Jim thinks differently. He says, “The only way is to make games. The tools are available. You won’t get a job if you haven’t created something, and you won’t succeed on your own if you are not making things. Game design is more than just a job; it is a way of life. Like any creative work, you must do it to understand it.”

Another expert, John Field, agrees but adds that it is more complicated. He says, “Many people want to work in games, but few meet the industry’s requirements. Even fewer have the creativity, technical skills, vision, and business sense needed to succeed in this changing field.” 

Can you succeed on your own? John says, “Maybe, but it is difficult. A good postgraduate course in games can help and provide support and guidance. Most game designers start as programmers or artists and work their way up. They are interested in all types of entertainment and have a strong interest in the arts and culture. They may have worked for a few years after graduation but have realized that games are their passion. They are not just fans; they are excited about the future of games and understand the growing variety in this field. 

Connections can also help. This is often forgotten, but to succeed in games, like in many other areas, you need to network.” 

The old image of a young boy playing video games has changed. Now, video games attract a wider audience, including families who play together on interactive consoles. Smartphones also offer many new games through apps and social media. John believes there is a lot of room for growth. “Games have become popular for many people. They are also a great way to learn, and I see this area as full of new possibilities and opportunities.”"
23,"Since I was a child, I have always wanted to play football. My dad encouraged me to play, but he never forced me. I am thankful for that. I had a friend whose dad was very strict. He always said, “You can’t do this, you can’t do that.” My friend could have been a good player, but he lost interest and stopped playing football. I am glad that did not happen to me, but I know it could have been different.

When I score a great goal from far away, people often say it is just luck, but it is not. I have practiced taking long shots since I was a kid. You can only score amazing goals by practicing. The best players in the world have a lot of natural talent, but they also practice for many years. Sometimes, I see young players bumping into each other, but I learned the right techniques. When I teach kids, I always tell them to enjoy learning new skills.

At school, I played many sports, like rounders, baseball, athletics, and basketball. I know now that a good education is important, but back then, football was all I thought about. The teachers were doing a good job, but I didn’t notice it at the time. I don’t want my son to be like that. We are already trying to read him books, even though he is too young to sit still for long. I hope that when he kicks the books around, it doesn’t mean he will be like me.

At the start of my professional football career, the manager made sacrifices so that younger players like us could play for the first team. He never made a big deal about it, but we all knew we had to prove ourselves. I scored in the first game of the season, but we lost. A famous TV presenter said, “You can’t win anything with kids.” This made us realize how much we needed to improve. We had some doubts, but we believed in ourselves as a team.

I depend a lot on my close friends and family. Having money can sometimes cause problems. For example, people ask me why I let my mother keep working. I have helped my parents with money. I paid off their house loan and bought them a car last Christmas. My family is strong, and they would not like to feel like they need my money. My mom is a hairdresser and loves her job, even if she doesn’t earn much. I enjoy using my money to help the people around me.

I have a lot of money, but not as much as people think. Money does not solve all my problems. After I stop playing football, I want to take a year off or even longer to do things I have not been able to do. I want to go skiing the day after I stop playing. I can’t do that now because if I break a leg while skiing and can’t play football again, I wouldn’t be insured."
24,"It was because of Sam Carter that we lived at Reef Point. Sam was my father’s agent in Los Angeles. He offered to help us find a cheap place to live because my father was having a hard time writing there. He couldn’t sell anything, and Sam was worried about losing his clients and money.

During the summer, the beach was empty because the sun was often covered by sea fog. Reef Point did not attract many visitors. The road to it was not very nice, and a nicer place called La Carmella was nearby. Most people chose to stay there instead. Only those who had no money or loved surfing would come to Reef Point. But now, with the hot weather, many people were here. After being almost alone for months, we were now surrounded by people and activities.

My father was busy every day trying to write a script with a deadline. He was in a bad mood. I often went to the beach with a book to read and my dog, Rusty. When we first moved to Reef Point, we didn’t have a dog, but Rusty decided to stay with us. I tried to send him away, but he always came back. One morning, I felt sorry for him and gave him some water. My father threw a boot at him, but he didn’t really want to hurt him. Rusty knew this and came closer. I asked my father, “Who does he belong to? He thinks he belongs to us.” My father replied, “You’re wrong, Jane. He thinks we belong to him.”

Rusty loved the beach. He liked to dig things up and bring them to me. Sometimes he found things that didn’t belong to him, like a new sneaker or a bright beach towel, and I had to return them to their owners. He also loved to swim and always wanted to join me, even though I could swim faster and farther. Luckily, he never got discouraged.

That day, we had been swimming. My father had finished his script and went to Los Angeles to deliver it. Rusty and I spent the afternoon together in the sea. As the sun began to set, it got cooler, and we sat watching the surfers. They had been surfing all day and didn’t seem to get tired. They would choose a wave and balance perfectly as they rode it to the shore. One surfer caught my attention. She was very good and made the others look clumsy. When she decided to stop, she rode in on a final wave.

“Hi,” she said. “Why didn’t you join us?” 
“I don’t have a surfboard.” 
“You could get one.” 
“I have no money.” 
“You’re British, right? Are you visiting?” 
“No, I live here.” 
“Is your father American?” 
“No. He came here to write a film script based on a novel he wrote.” 
“No kidding? Have I heard of him? What’s his name?” 
“Rufus Marsh.” 
“You mean, Tall as the Morning?” 
I nodded. “I read that cover to cover.” 

She looked at me with new interest. I thought this was how it always was. People were friendly but only showed interest when I mentioned Tall as the Morning."
25,"Violet Hetherington was confused and worried. She was in a long line at the dock in Southampton, waiting to board the Queen Caroline. The line was outside the building marked ‘Departures’. Her friend Annie had told her, “It’s better to arrive late. If you come too early, you’ll just be waiting around.” Annie was experienced in traveling, but this time her advice was not good. 

After some time, an announcement came over the loudspeakers: there was a problem with the computer system. The mood of the passengers became worse. Some tried to stay calm, while others were unhappy. They had paid a lot of money for this trip, and they wanted it to be special. Violet felt like she had made a mistake by coming on this cruise. 

Then she realized her phone was missing. This was more frustrating than waiting in line. She couldn’t call the taxi company to see if she left her phone in the taxi because all her contacts were in her phone. Her son Harry always told her to be careful about this. 

In the line behind her, there was a friendly couple. Violet asked them, “I think I left my phone behind. Can I borrow yours to make a call?” She called Harry and left a message for him to ask their neighbor, Kristina, to check if her phone was at home. If it wasn’t, she would have trouble finding important numbers in New York. Part of her felt relieved, but she didn’t tell Harry that. He often thought he was wiser than her. Her younger son, Daniel, was more understanding of her mistakes, but he might forget to pass on the message to Kristina.

Finally, the line started to move, and Violet handed over her travel documents to board the ship. When she entered the ship, she felt disappointed. The inside looked like a fancy hotel that was trying too hard. There were shiny fake wood panels, big chandeliers, and bright carpets that looked like those in airports. 

Violet followed the signs to the elevators, which were full of tired passengers. They were all squeezed together, and she wished she didn’t have to see so many reflections in the mirrors. The elevator stopped at each floor, letting people out until she finally reached the twelfth floor. 

When she got to her room, she was happy to see that it had the balcony she had asked for. She had been worried about what to say if it didn’t. Ignoring Annie’s advice to wait for a better deal, she had decided to pay the highest price she could afford to make sure she had a nice view of the sea."
26,"When John Maloof bought a box of old photo negatives at an auction, he did not know he was starting to uncover the mystery of Vivian Maier. Maloof wanted pictures for a book about the Portage Park neighborhood in Chicago, but instead, he found 30,000 images taken by Maier, a talented street photographer. Since then, Maloof has collected many items related to Maier’s life and work. In his home, he keeps her cameras, 2,000 rolls of film, 3,000 prints, and 100,000 negatives, along with many 8mm movies and audiotapes.

One morning, Maloof looked around at all this and felt he was close to something special, which happened by chance. “When I bought all this, I had no idea what it was,” he said. “I could have easily sold it all to someone else.” For a while, Maloof and his friend Anthony Rydzon have been trying to learn more about Maier’s life. They spoke with families who hired her as a nanny and with people from the shop where she developed her film.

Maier was born in 1926 in New York and spent much of her childhood in France. In 1951, she returned to New York and moved to Chicago in 1956 to work as a nanny. Maier was a private person who always carried a camera. She wore big coats, wide-brimmed hats, and sturdy shoes. “On her day off, she would have the camera around her neck and we wouldn’t see her again until late at night,” said Maren Baylaender, whose husband employed Maier to care for his daughter. “She was private but had strong opinions about movies and politics.”

Maier knew a lot about theater and movies. Although she was not very social, she walked the streets with her camera and sometimes interviewed people on audiotape. She seemed to be very dedicated to her “second job” of documenting the world around her. “She was a true artist who followed her dreams,” said Rydzon. “Nothing stopped her.”

Maier’s work is pure art; she did not create it for money. Her photos often show women, children, the elderly, the poor, and abstract scenes. “What is interesting about Vivian is that she has so many amazing pictures,” said photography expert Larry Silverman. He sees influences from other photographers in her work and wonders if she developed her own style or borrowed ideas from others.

Maloof often thinks about whether he will ever go through all the negatives, which he keeps in three tall, fireproof cabinets. The funny thing is that he was not really interested in photography until he found Maier’s work. Inspired by her photos, Maloof started taking his own pictures. “As I learned more about photography and looked at her work again, I realized that the cityscapes were not what mattered to her. It was the people, the street scenes, and the overall composition,” he said. “There was so much more to her work than I thought, and I realized I had something more important than I ever imagined. Now our goal is to share her name and get Vivian Maier into the history books.”"
27,"When a novel is called ambitious, it often means it has not completely succeeded. However, this is not the case with Eleanor Catton’s book, The Luminaries. I interviewed her in the UK when her book was very successful, and she was calm, especially for someone in her twenties. She had just arrived from Germany and was going back to New Zealand the next day. She shared a story about being stopped at passport control and asked to prove she was a writer. She pressed her novel against the glass. The official looked at it and asked, “What’s it about?” This is not an easy question for an author. 

The Luminaries takes place in New Zealand during the 1860s. A series of crimes have happened, and a group of 12 men has come together to solve them. The story becomes very complex. Catton wanted to write a murder mystery, not a historical novel, but she found that the past gave her characters many chances for complications and misunderstandings. The book is over 800 pages long because she wanted to give each of the 20 main characters a good chance to shine.

When I asked her how it feels to be so successful at a young age, she said it feels nice to come from a small country because everyone feels part of her success. She received a lot of support from people back home. However, she finds it annoying when people think her book is not serious. 

Catton explained that she wanted to write the book in the shape of a spiral, where each part is half the length of the one before it. The story speeds up as it goes along. I asked if it matters if readers notice these patterns. She said she wanted to create a book with patterns that readers could see if they cared to look, but that it was not necessary to enjoy the story.

Despite its unique structure, The Luminaries is still an exciting murder mystery with a gripping plot. Surprisingly, Catton did not plan the story in advance. She would write herself into difficult situations and then see how creatively she could get out of them. One of her goals was to make the book enjoyable for readers.

We also talked about her love for TV drama series, which have cliff-hangers, different viewpoints, and dialogue. I asked if she would be interested in writing for TV. She said that could be fun. She spoke with excitement and laughed softly while discussing her work and New Zealand. 

She mentioned that being in a different place changes her imagination. She understands why writers leave New Zealand for busier areas to be around more people. But for now, New Zealand will remain her home. I hope it continues to inspire her for many more novels."
28,"Jonny Kinkead was a boy who loved to make things in his dad’s garage and play the guitar. For the last forty years, he has been building acoustic guitars by hand. He is amazed that two pieces of wood can create beautiful sounds and that different types of wood can change the sound even more.

Jonny learned to play guitar when he was eleven. At sixteen, he wanted to play the bass guitar. Instead of saving money for one, he decided to make it himself. He studied how different shapes and types of wood affect sound and learned how to put them together. Before making the bass guitar, he and his brothers built model boats and planes, so he was already familiar with building things. His father taught them how to use tools, and Jonny had also repaired instruments for his friends.

Although Jonny’s bass guitar turned out well, he didn’t think about making guitars as a career at first. He was also interested in painting and sculpture. After finishing school, he studied architecture at university because he liked design. However, he dropped out halfway through because he felt it wasn’t right for him. He realized that building guitars was like making sculptures, but with sound. He thought it would be a more practical career because people use the guitars he makes.

For the first ten years, Jonny also cleaned windows to earn extra money. He sold his first guitars for just the cost of materials, but as he became known as a good guitar maker, he could charge more. Even after almost forty years, he says he is still just getting by. He can only make about ten guitars a year, which limits his income.

In the beginning, Jonny worked hard to get known. He went to music festivals to let musicians try his guitars and talk about him. He also had to learn how to price his guitars because he didn’t think about money much.

Jonny believes it is easier for new guitar makers today in the UK. When he started, many people thought only American-made acoustic guitars were good. But now, UK-made guitars are recognized for their quality. He thinks new makers should take courses to learn valuable techniques, but he also believes that learning by trying and making mistakes is very important. He advises looking at other instruments to see what works and what doesn’t. If you make the back of a guitar too thin or too thick, it won’t sound good. He believes that being self-taught helps you learn more than just following one way of doing things."
29,"Any talk about English conversation usually starts with the weather. This is a common tradition, and I will mention the famous saying by Dr. Johnson, an 18th-century writer, who said, ""When two Englishmen meet, their first talk is of the weather."" This is still true today, just like it was over two hundred years ago. 

Many people who write about this topic either stop here or try to explain why the English are so interested in the weather, but they often get it wrong. They think that when English people talk about the weather, they really care about it. For example, the American writer Bill Bryson says that English weather is not interesting at all. He points out that in England, there are not many exciting weather events like tornadoes or big storms that happen in other places. 

On the other hand, the English broadcaster Jeremy Paxman disagrees with Bryson. He believes that English weather is interesting because it is always changing. He says that the English talk about the weather not because they have strong feelings about it, but because it is uncertain. In England, you can never be sure what the weather will be like.

From my research, I think both Bryson and Paxman miss the main point. When English people talk about the weather, they are not really talking about the weather itself. Instead, these conversations are a way for English people to connect with each other. For example, when someone says, ""Nice day, isn’t it?"" or ""Ooh, isn’t it cold?"" they are not really asking about the weather. These phrases are just ways to start a conversation or fill a pause.

Talking about the weather is like a form of social bonding, similar to how monkeys groom each other. There are specific situations when people use weather talk. Some writers say that English people talk about the weather all the time, but that is not true. There are three main situations for weather talk: as a greeting, to break the ice before talking about something else, or to fill a silence when the conversation stops. 

Because of this, it seems like English people talk about the weather a lot. A conversation might start with a weather greeting, then move to more weather talk, and return to it when there is a pause. This is why people from other countries, and even some English writers, think that English people are obsessed with the weather."
30,"Alice Leader was standing in front of Hadrian’s Wall in Britain. She was trying to explain to her class of 12- and 13-year-olds how amazing it was that the Romans built something 120 km long and 5 meters high about 1900 years ago. The students were interested in this trip instead of going to popular places like Spain, Greece, or France. However, they wanted to know why the wall was built, and Alice felt she did not have good answers. 

When she could not find a suitable historical novel to help her explain life at the Wall during Roman times, she decided to write one herself. After teaching for 31 years, Alice started her new career as a writer in 2001. She felt that writing was a big change for her. “Teaching is like acting; it’s a performance every day and very tiring. Writing is exciting but not as exhausting. My former teaching colleagues are jealous because I still connect with children through my stories,” she said.

Alice wants her novels to fill a gap in children’s fiction today. “Many books for teenagers talk about negative experiences. They are well written, but they are often dark. Other books are total fantasy, like Harry Potter. My books are different,” she explained. Alice always tried to teach English and History together, like teaching about ancient Greece with the novel Tale of Troy. She loves to see when a child goes from being bored to interested. “I enjoy having bored children because it challenges me to make them interested,” she said.

Alice started writing her first novel because she saw a need for it. She was also inspired by the idea of her two sons leaving home and a suggestion from her head teacher to take a creative writing course. At first, she was surprised. “I had been teaching for 25 years. She said it would be good for me, but I didn’t want to spend my summer on a course I didn’t think I needed,” she said. Before she could join the course, she had to send the teachers her best piece of writing. She only found out about this a few days before the course started. “I quickly wrote a story about a Roman couple and their baby-to-be,” she recalled. After three hours and 30 pages, she sent it in and was accepted.

During the course, other students read her story and gave her great feedback, encouraging her to publish it. With only 8,000 report cards to show her writing skills, she asked her head teacher for a year off to write her first novel. Alice’s husband, Zachary Leader, is a critic and editor, and his help was very important for her writing. “My mother-in-law thinks we are rival authors, but I believe we work well together. He helps with the structure of my writing, while I like to add more scenes. That’s the difference between a fiction writer and an editor,” Alice said."
31,"To raise money for charity, a newspaper and a TV company asked brothers Jonny and Alistair Brownlee, who are champion triathletes, to join a special race. This race would have Jonny in a car and Alistair on a mountain bike, racing against each other in the beautiful and hilly Yorkshire Dales in northern England. They would race to the same finish line. 

“I’m looking forward to it,” Jonny said at the start line. “I’ve never done anything like this before; it’s exciting! The views are beautiful, and it’s very cold, so I can stay warm in the car.” Alistair was also excited, but he was dressed in warm cycling clothes, unlike Jonny, who wore jeans and a sweatshirt. “To be honest,” Alistair said, “I’ve seen Jonny drive before, so I’m not sure he will make it. I might stop for a cup of tea halfway!”

The race began at Semerwater lake in Wensleydale and would finish at Fleet Moss, Yorkshire’s highest road, which is about 350 meters up. This would be easy for the car, but Alistair had to climb a steep hill at the start. They quickly shook hands and started the race. Alistair rode off on his bike, while Jonny got into his car and drove away. The big question was: who would reach the finish line first?

Jonny’s confidence quickly faded. Just 15 seconds into his drive, he faced a big problem: a giant tractor was blocking the road. “Welcome to Yorkshire,” he said to the cameraman in his car. “If Alistair beats me, it’s because of this farmer!” After getting past the tractor, Jonny continued driving. Meanwhile, Alistair was having a hard time with the steep hill. He had to get off his bike and carry it up the hill, while sheep watched him curiously. Finally, he reached the top and was ready to speed down the other side.

In the car, Jonny faced another challenge. The roads in this part of Yorkshire are old and narrow. He had to drive slowly around a tight corner and through a stream on the road. Once he was clear of the last village, he could drive straight to the finish line. Neither brother knew how close they were to each other. 

As Jonny pushed the gas pedal and raced towards Fleet Moss, Alistair was speeding across his last field and back onto the road. He was close to the finish line when he suddenly had to brake. When he looked up, he asked the crowd, “Is he here?” They replied, “No? Really?” Alistair raised his arms in celebration. “Yes!” 

A few minutes later, Jonny arrived in his car and stepped out. “Well done,” he said, feeling disappointed. “I’m gutted.”"
32,"The silence is what you notice when you play on Centre Court at Wimbledon. You bounce the ball quietly on the soft grass, toss it up to serve, and hit it, hearing only the sound of your own shot. The well-kept grass, the history, the old stadium, the players in white, and the respectful crowds all create a calm atmosphere that helps you focus. The quietness of Centre Court is good for my game. What I find hardest in a tennis match is to block out everything except the game and the point I am playing. When a point ends, the silence is broken by applause, cheers, and people shouting your name. I hear them, but it feels distant. I don’t think about the fifteen thousand people watching me closely or the millions watching around the world as I play Roger Federer in the 2008 Wimbledon final – the biggest match of my life.

I had always dreamed of playing at Wimbledon. My uncle Toni, who has been my coach since I was young, taught me that this is the biggest tournament. By the time I was 14, I was sharing my dream with friends that I would play there one day and win. Before 2008, I had played and lost to Federer twice – in the final the year before and the year before that. Losing in 2006 was not too hard. I was just happy to have made it that far at twenty. Federer won easily, but my loss in 2007 was much harder. I knew I could have played better; it was not my skills that failed me, but my mind. I cried for half an hour in the dressing room after that loss. Losing always hurts, but it hurts more when you have a chance and lose it.

Toni, my tough coach, usually does not comfort me, even when I win. But that time, he told me there was no reason to cry and that there would be more chances at Wimbledon. I told him he didn’t understand; I thought that was my last chance to win. I know how short a professional athlete's career is, and I want to make the most of it. Every moment is important, but some moments are more important than others, and I had let a big one slip away in 2007. There was nothing Toni could do to make me feel better. But he was right in the end. Another chance came in 2008, just one year later. I felt confident I had learned from my loss the year before; this time, my mind would stay strong. 

The best sign that I was ready was my belief that I would win. The night before the final, at dinner with family, friends, and team members, we did not talk about the match. I didn’t tell them not to, but they understood that I was already focused on the game in my mind. From that moment until the match started, that space in my head was mine alone."
33,"In early April 1957, a young and hopeful Englishwoman named Jane Goodall arrived in Africa. In her first letter home, she wrote, ""I am living in the Africa I have always longed for."" Jane would spend most of her life in Africa, working as a citizen, journalist, scientist, activist, and environmentalist. 

In 1963, Jane became famous when Britain’s National Geographical Society published articles and made documentaries about her research on chimpanzees. Her fame grew with her own writing, including popular children’s books and the bestselling book ""In the Shadow of Man,"" which has been translated into 47 languages and is still available today. Jane Goodall is one of the most celebrated female scientists of the 20th century, second only to Marie Curie. However, her fame sometimes makes people overlook her real achievements.

Many articles and interviews tell her life story, but they often focus on her adventures and personal life rather than her work. These stories can make her seem like just a girl who loved animals or a woman fighting for her place in a man's world. In reality, Jane Goodall is a pioneer in her field and a leading zoologist. She changed how we understand the social and emotional lives of chimpanzees.

Before Jane's research, people thought wild chimpanzees were very dangerous, and they did not know many important facts about them. For example, no one knew that chimpanzees eat meat or use tools. We also learned that chimpanzees have emotions similar to humans and that their social lives are much like ours. Jane discovered that chimpanzee communities in Africa have their own unique cultures.

Her book, ""The Chimpanzees of Gombe,"" published in 1986, is the most important work on chimpanzee research. Jane's long study of wild chimpanzees in Gombe State, Nigeria, is considered one of the great scientific achievements of the Western world. She changed how we study animals and how we think about ourselves as humans.

Even as a child, Jane showed signs of becoming a biologist. When she was five years old, she once disappeared for a while. Her family and the police searched for her. When she returned, she had straw in her hair and clothes. She explained that she wanted to know how hens lay eggs, so she hid in a henhouse for five hours until she found out. This moment can be seen as the start of her journey as a biologist."
34,"During our first hour-long conversation, Shirley Ford talks to me using the voices of a funny 8-year-old boy, his tired mother, a funny old Scottish woman, and a very fast-talking alien. Her voices are familiar to people who watch children’s TV and cartoons, as well as those who have seen health and safety programs. “I just did a voiceover about back injuries,” she says, “so I had to learn how to say many medical terms quickly.” 

Shirley explains what it takes to do voiceovers. “Many actors, even famous ones, think they can do funny voices, and many probably can,” she says. “But there is more to it. You have to make the script exciting for an audience that cannot see you. You wouldn’t believe how many well-known people want to do voiceover work. Producers invite them to auditions, but often they don’t get the roles because they are used to acting with their whole bodies.”

After school, Shirley joined a drama course, hoping for a regular acting career. During the course, she sometimes sang jingles for TV ads. “One day,” she says, “the man who ran the recording studio suggested I try out for the voice of a rabbit in a cartoon. It seemed silly – I didn’t study drama to play rabbits – but I tried it for fun and, surprisingly, got a big part.” Shirley discovered she could do voices and thought voiceover work might be a good path for her. “Things just happened for me,” she says. “In my second film, I was lucky to play the main character, her brother, and her mother.”

Adult female actors often provide the voices for young boys and girls because their voices are higher than those of male actors. Hiring child performers involves complicated processes and many forms, which production companies prefer to avoid. Shirley has learned to create different sounds and collects new voices by watching children’s TV. 

Cartoons are the best part of her job, which also includes educational videos and vacuum cleaner ads. “Those are tough because you have to sound excited about something you don’t care about, but my experience helps,” she says. “I’ve learned that the trick is to smile while you talk – it makes your voice sound happy. When I work on animation, it feels like a holiday; interacting with other actors is great.”

The competition for voiceover work is strong, and having a good showreel – a recording that shows what you can do – is very important. “It’s worth investing in a strong showreel,” Shirley says. “There are agencies that help voiceover artists create them.” She believes she has reached the top of her profession through hard work as much as talent. “Whether it’s making your showreel and showing it to film and TV companies, advertising agencies, and recording studios, or just practicing your voices, it’s all about setting goals and not giving up.”

For anyone thinking about a career in voiceovers, Shirley suggests attending “specialist workshops – they teach all types of voiceover.” She also thinks a love for human sound is very important. She describes herself as obsessed with voices and often becomes the characters she plays. “If I’ve been in the studio doing a specific American voice, for example, it can take over me, and I’ll speak like that for hours or even days,” she says. “My children have grown up hearing their mom talk in many different voices.”"
35,"People often ask me how I became a cartoonist. This is normal because cartooning is a job many kids dream about, like being a race car driver. However, most people give up these dreams and choose more practical jobs, like being a tax lawyer or making car parts. It seems silly to think you can make a living by drawing simple pictures, but some people do just that.

Not everyone becomes a cartoonist in the same way, but most have wanted to be one for a long time. For me, I had a typical childhood for a cartoonist. I loved comic strips, contributed to school publications, and was known as ""the kid who draws."" I studied graphic design in college and, after graduating, I showed my drawings to different companies. I was lucky to find a newspaper that needed political cartoons about local issues. I created some ideas, and they bought them. Soon, I was making enough money to support myself.

You don’t need much to become a cartoonist. You don’t need a university degree, a lot of money, or even to be a great artist. You just need your brain, your hand, and something to draw with. But if it were that easy, there would be as many cartoonists as there are teachers. The skills needed to be a cartoonist are not too hard to learn, but it is still a tough job. You should only try to be a cartoonist if you feel you cannot do anything else. It is much easier to get a regular job that pays the bills and gives you time for family, home repairs, and hobbies.

The more skills you have, the better chance you have to make a living with your art. I have created political cartoons, comic strips, and comic books. I have also worked as a writer, caricaturist, and designer. I take on all kinds of work because you can learn a lot, even from jobs you don’t really want to do. It helps to be smart, well-read, and curious about the world.

What about the business side of being a cartoonist? In the past, many cartoonists could find regular jobs with different newspapers and magazines. But now, most cartoonists have to be entrepreneurs. This means you not only have to create your work, but you also have to sell it. If you are good at business, you will do better. I have seen cartoonists with average drawing skills but great business skills succeed more than those who are very talented but lack other skills.

It surprises me how often I meet people who have never sold a cartoon but are afraid someone will steal their ideas. Some are so worried that they won’t even let others see their work! To protect your work, you just need to draw a small ‘c’ for ‘copyright,’ put a circle around it, and write your name and the date next to it. But honestly, it is more likely that no one will be interested in your work. If someone does steal a cartoon and it becomes popular online, it is not a disaster – it could actually be a lucky break!"
36,"Twenty years ago, I was moving to a new house and cleaning out my things. I decided to throw away an electric guitar that my dad had given me for my 16th birthday. It was a nice, black guitar made in Japan. I usually hate getting rid of things, so I was surprised that I wanted to throw this guitar away. I took it to the dump and was about to leave it there when a young man came up to me, looking confused. He asked, “You’re not going to throw that away, are you?” I told him I was, and I started to feel regret. He asked if he could have it, and I said “Yes.” After that, I felt sad about my decision for a long time.

A few months ago, I received an email that changed everything. I remembered a story about a man who lost his wedding ring in the ocean and found it years later in a fish he was eating. That’s how I felt when I opened the email from a man named Keith Rushton, who buys and restores guitars. He told me, “I’ve got your electric guitar.” It had been sold many times since I gave it away. Keith found my name and address on a label on the guitar and used it to find me online. He contacted me through the newspaper I work for and offered to sell it back to me. I was so happy I almost cried. I would have given him anything, but his price was very fair.

I had forgotten that my dad always put name labels on my things, including my guitar. My parents wanted me to learn classical guitar because it was popular in the 1970s. I loved the sound of it; it was calming and gentle. But I didn’t make much progress, so I switched to the electric guitar, which was easier to play. At that time, punk music was also popular, and anyone could be a rock star, even if they weren’t great musicians.

When I opened the box that Keith sent me, I remembered my birthday in 1978 when my parents gave me the guitar. Holding it again felt smooth and smaller than I remembered. I sat down to play, but then I wanted to stand up and put the strap over my shoulder because that’s how you play an electric guitar. My fingers remembered where to go. I couldn’t draw the chords, but my hands just knew what to do. My fingers felt the familiar pain of pressing down the strings to play.

The electric guitar is usually played with a band. Now that I’m learning it again, I think I should form a band. My son is learning the saxophone, so maybe we can play together. Or maybe I can find other people my age who have had a similar experience. We could call ourselves “The Regainers!”"
37,"Text: 

There has been a lot of discussion about sleep recently. When I wrote my book called Insomniac, which is about people who cannot sleep, I felt like I was the only one talking about the dangers of not getting enough sleep. Lack of sleep can affect our minds, bodies, and feelings. People who have trouble sleeping understand how important sleep is for our well-being. It is good that sleep is finally getting the attention it deserves. 

But what about dreams? I haven’t heard much about them in the conversation about sleep. We often lose our dreams. When you wake up early because of an alarm, you miss the last hour or two of sleep, which is mostly REM sleep, or ‘Rapid Eye Movement’ sleep. This is the stage of sleep where we have the most vivid and memorable dreams. A good sleeper spends about a quarter of their sleep time in REM. If a person lives to be 90 years old, they will spend about six or seven years in REM sleep. 

When researchers take away REM sleep from people, they find that the next night, those people have more REM sleep to make up for it. This shows that dreams are important. In 1953, researchers found REM sleep, and many agreed with psychologist Sigmund Freud, who said that understanding dreams helps us understand our minds. However, later research showed that it is not that simple. Now, scientists focus more on the physical reasons for dreams rather than the psychological ones. 

Currently, there is not much agreement among dream researchers, according to Robert Stickgold, a sleep scientist at Harvard University. Dreams are important. At a meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Society, P.F. Pagel from the University of Colorado Medical School shared a study. He found that actors, writers, and directors remember and use their dreams better than other people. He believes that the more someone is interested in being creative, the more they use their dreams. 

It makes sense that filmmakers have a strong connection to their dreams because films are very dream-like. But I wondered if only creative people benefit from their dreams. Don’t teachers, software designers, and politicians also need to think creatively? Stickgold says that dreams help us connect ideas in new and surprising ways, using knowledge from the past and present. Dreams can help us find new patterns and create ideas that break our usual ways of thinking. 

For example, Stickgold found that when people are woken from REM sleep and asked to respond to a word, their answers are more original than when they are woken from other sleep stages. They come up with unexpected ideas that make sense in a different way. This is what creativity is. I find that I write better after having intense dreams. Even a difficult dream, or one I can barely remember, seems to help me think better. On those days, my ideas come out quickly, and I can hardly keep up with my typing. 

I don’t know exactly how it works, but it does help. However, creativity is not just for writers or artists. We live in a complicated world, and everyone needs their brains to work well. We need to think creatively and flexibly in our relationships with colleagues, family, and friends. This is why dreaming is important."
38,"Twenty years ago, Susie Ray left London to live in a small coastal town in south-west England. When you enter her studio, you see a beautiful view of the sea and many empty frames on the walls, along with happy photos of her two daughters. Susie is a well-known copyist artist, which means she can create copies of famous paintings from the past. She can copy the rich colors of early 20th-century impressionist art and the detailed work of 16th-century Caravaggio easily. However, she does not keep any of her own work. “As soon as I finish them, they go,” she says.

Susie is very popular and has been a copyist artist for 30 years. She has painted many famous artists' works, including Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh. Her copies are so good that art experts sometimes think they are the real paintings. While the original paintings can sell for millions of pounds, her copies sell for a few hundred to £12,000, depending on how much time she spends on them. Susie does not reveal the names of most of her clients, but they include art galleries and private collectors. Some collectors want to show off their art, and one famous buyer likes to say he owns a ‘Van Gogh’ painting, but it is really a copy by Susie. “Many famous people pass off my copies as originals,” she says. Some collectors keep the original paintings in a bank safe and display Susie’s copies instead.

Susie is honest about her work. When she copies an old masterpiece, she tries to make it look as real as possible because she believes it is important to respect the original artist. However, she puts her signature on the back of the canvas. It is illegal to sell a copy as the real thing, and even though some people make money that way, Susie has never been tempted. She knows that people who make fake art often get into trouble. Although she is not rich and has faced challenges, her situation is better now, and she does not want to risk her good reputation.

Before becoming a copyist, Susie worked as an illustrator for a botanical garden after finishing her art degree. She earned very little money but learned a lot about being accurate in her work. She has no regrets about that time, but she is happy to have found a more rewarding job. When younger artists ask her for advice, she tells them to learn to draw well and to be accurate. She has studied a lot to do what she does now. Susie can draw plants and make perfect copies of 15th-century art, but she focuses on French impressionists like Manet, Cezanne, and Degas.

Susie believes that many people think modern art is easy, but she knows that impressionists painted quickly and freely while also being very careful. This combination is hard to achieve. Some people wonder why Susie does not create her own art. Isn’t art about expressing yourself? Could a Susie Ray original be worth more than a copy? Susie explains that her work comes from years of training, and she makes a good living from it. She has tried to create her own art, like oil paintings of fishing nets, but they looked too much like photographs. Susie is a perfectionist, and she wants her work to be the best it can be."
39,"During her racing days, Ellen MacArthur cared most about the sea and being the fastest on it. Since she was a child, sailing was her big passion. She felt a strong connection with her boats, which took her around the world. When she returned to land, everyday life felt unimportant. People wanted to know about her races, but she just wanted to be back on the ocean, challenging herself against nature, even in dangerous places.

After finishing second in the Vendée Globe, a solo round-the-world race, she showed me her small boat, Kingfisher. She took me into the tiny cabin where she lived and worked for 94 days. She explained how she carefully planned everything, even counting how many rolls of kitchen paper she would need. Preparation was very important to her. She proudly showed me her simple food, a small gas stove, and bags of medical supplies. She took great care of her boat because her life depended on it.

Now, Ellen sees the world like a boat: small, beautiful, and fragile, with limited resources. A turning point for her was a trip to South Georgia, a lonely island in the South Atlantic, where she helped with a bird survey. This experience made her think differently about the world. She noticed many abandoned whaling stations and felt it was a warning about how we take what we want and move on.

When I visited Ellen’s office, she was finishing a busy call. She explained why we need to act now to save the planet. “We can’t make more coal, oil, or gas. They are precious resources. We need to find ways to use less,” she said. At first, her message was negative, but she later realized there was a positive way to look at it. Now, she talks about re-using things, like reusable carpet tiles.

For the past three years, she has been visiting factories and power stations, discussing our dependence on resources that cannot be replaced. “I will never be an expert,” she said, “but I love learning. I couldn’t ignore the current situation. Sailing now feels selfish compared to this work. It’s about finding how I can help the most.”

Ellen also started the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a charity that helps young people think about and create a sustainable future. “I miss the adventure of being at sea,” she said. “It’s part of who I am. When you’re sailing, you feel connected to everything. You focus on survival and don’t feel lonely. My new message is not as simple as saying, ‘I want to be the fastest around the world.’ I may have been fast, but this work is more important than anything I’ve done before.”"
40,"Jordan Romero is 13 years old and wants to be the youngest person to climb Mount Everest. If he succeeds, he could become very famous. He hopes to inspire other kids to go outside and explore, instead of just playing on computers and video games. Jordan's climbing team includes his father, Paul, and his mother, Karen. They call themselves ""Team Romero."" Climbing Everest is just one of their goals. If Jordan climbs Everest and Vinson Massif in Antarctica, he will be the youngest person to climb the Seven Summits, which are the highest mountains on each continent. Very few people do this before they turn thirty. Jordan has already climbed five of these mountains and might finish before he is a teenager.

I spoke to some experienced climbers who have climbed Everest, and they do not think it is a good idea to take a 13-year-old up the mountain. They believe that while Jordan might be strong enough physically, he may not be emotionally ready. They also think he might not have enough experience to make safe decisions while climbing. The Romero family has heard these opinions before. Paul says, ""I know there is criticism, but I cannot focus on it. We have a lot to do. We think about the risks, but we believe our experience will help us. Watching Jordan grow gives me confidence. He is getting stronger and more mature.""

I also wonder why Jordan wants to do this. Is it just his father's dream? Paul says, ""This project is not about me becoming famous through my son. At first, Jordan thought he would do this later in life, but we decided, 'Why not now?' We talk to him often to make sure he still wants to do it."" When I ask Jordan what he enjoys about this challenge, he says, ""I just focus on reaching my goal.""

In the past, not many people cared about being the youngest or fastest to climb a mountain or sail an ocean. Now, every adventure is shared online, and every climb is seen as a chance to break records. This creates a problem for Jordan. Some people think that focusing too much on achievements can take away the fun of the adventure. But if Jordan wants to inspire others, he needs to use social media. This means blogging, taking photos, and giving interviews. He needs to do something amazing, like climbing Everest.

Paul adds, ""If Jordan comes home tomorrow and says he wants to stop climbing and play basketball instead, we will end this project and go to the gym."""
41,"When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, it’s likely they are not listening to classical music. Many people can name many pop groups, but if you ask my friends about Brahms, they usually don’t know who he is. I just started studying music, but my classmates know as little about classical music as most people our age. If you don’t know who created the music, you probably don’t have any of their recordings. This is sad for fans of classical music. Last year, only 3% of concert tickets sold were for classical music, and the average classical album sells only 300 copies. I find this hard to believe. 

So, why is interest in classical music going down? Older people often blame our love for TV and video games, but I don’t think that’s the reason. The truth is that classical music doesn’t attract most people, especially teenagers, who are the ones most likely to buy music and concert tickets. I know some teenagers who go to classical concerts, but they are few. Even though I play in an orchestra, I don’t really love classical music. I enjoy many styles, but my classical music collection is probably close to that 3% figure.

Why don’t teenagers like classical music? First, the pace and rhythm of classical music can be hard for us. We like fast talking, fast playing, and fast thinking. Experts say we can only pay attention for about three minutes, which is too short for most classical pieces but just right for pop songs. Pop music is simple and easy to listen to, while understanding classical music takes time and focus. Also, pop music talks about things that interest teenagers, while classical music often does not.

The way we listen to music has changed too. In the past, families would play music together at home, and playing an instrument was important. Now, you can find any music online, but classical music is rarely part of our daily lives. When was the last time you heard classical music in a store? One of my teachers says that more people are going to classical concerts now. Maybe, but I doubt many of them are teenagers. In my orchestra, we play classical music in many places, but when I look at the audience, I mostly see older people. I don’t know why more middle-aged people like classical concerts, but I do know that if your parents love something, you might want to avoid it.

Some people say schools are to blame for teenagers not liking classical music, but many kids want to play classical music in their school orchestras. They come early to practice and stay late to rehearse. They enjoy classical music when they play it, but it’s not their favorite music otherwise. The two activities have become separate. When we want to relax, we usually listen to pop music."
42,"Bonnie Wyndham got out of her mother’s car and looked at Almonside School. “I’ll make you sorry I’ve come here,” she said with a smile. Her mother was getting out of the other side of the car, so she didn’t hear Bonnie, but Bonnie didn’t mind. Her mother already knew how she felt. 

Mrs. Wyndham looked around. Almonside was a strange school, with buildings hidden among the trees on a hillside. It looked confusing at first. Then she saw signs that said: Science block, gymnasium, riding centre… “Riding centre,” Bonnie said, suddenly interested. “Headmaster’s study,” her mother replied. “This way.” Bonnie followed her mother along a wide path between the trees. “I wish you’d walk beside me instead of following me like a dog,” Mrs. Wyndham said tiredly, but she didn’t expect Bonnie to do it.

A few minutes later, her mother was talking to Bonnie’s new headmaster in his study, while Bonnie waited outside the door. Suddenly, Bonnie stood up. “Why should I just sit here?” she thought. “I’ll be thrown out soon anyway, so why not just go?” She left the building and walked towards the riding centre, following the sign. 

There was a nice old building for the horses and a big indoor riding area. Bonnie looked around, but there was no one there. She approached the horses with respect. They were well taken care of, and she could see that right away. Almost every stall had a horse in it, and she walked along, looking carefully at each one. “I know what you’re doing here,” she said to a small pony, gently touching its nose. 

Then she saw the next horse and stopped. “But aren’t you the best of them all!” she exclaimed. He was brown with a little white. He looked lively, and Bonnie liked that. “I feel like we’ve met before,” she said, stroking his neck. “In my dreams, I was riding you to win a big competition…” The horse’s name was Maverick. Suddenly, she really wanted to ride him. “I wonder where I can find a bridle and a saddle. They can’t be far away.” 

Bonnie was happy to find that the room with the riding equipment was unlocked. She was so focused on putting the saddle on Maverick that she forgot about her mother and the headmaster. When she finally sat on the big horse outside, she felt like a queen. Her old school nickname was Queen Bee, and she laughed as she remembered it. “You’re the best horse I’ve ever ridden, Maverick,” she said. “I really mean it because I know about horses, even if I don’t know much else.” 

She nudged him to walk, then to trot. “If I stay here, I think we could be great friends,” she said. She rode around the paddock, feeling the rhythm of the ride and the breeze on her face. She could tell Maverick trusted her, and she felt sure he would jump well."
43,"I have met Cody Simpson before, and I was impressed by his quiet confidence. The 15-year-old from Australia has already released many successful songs. So how did a relaxed surfer end up performing in front of thousands of fans? Cody says, “I first picked up a guitar when I was six years old and started writing songs when I was seven.” He remembers that he was swimming and surfing every day, which were very important to him at that time. When he was 13 and in high school, he posted a few videos online.

These videos changed everything. He started by sharing a video of himself and a friend singing at a school concert. Fans wanted to see more of his videos on social media. So, Cody recorded more songs at home and shared them. The response was amazing. 

Cody was also a talented swimmer. He trained hard with great coaches and focused on his sport. But then, record labels contacted him, and he had a tough choice: stay in Australia and keep swimming or take a big risk by signing a deal and moving to the US with his family. Cody decided to take the chance. “It was very hard for me, especially at such a young age, to choose a career. Can you imagine being 12 or 13 and trying to decide what you want to do for the rest of your life?” He had to tell his swimming coach and friends that he was moving to America. “It surprised most people. I’m kind of the quiet kid,” he says, remembering their shocked faces. “I’m very modest, and I think it’s important to be that way in this crazy world.”

So, Cody packed his bags and traveled with his family to the other side of the world, giving up one dream to try to make another come true. Even though his family stays out of the spotlight and does not work directly in his career, they support him from behind the scenes. Cody believes it’s important to have good people around you to stay grounded.

Of course, everyone has doubts. “Sometimes when I’m alone, I think, ‘How does my decision affect my little brother and sister?’ My little brother is eight years old, and he travels the world, doing school on the road; he doesn’t have a normal life,” Cody admits. “I worry about how this affects him, but my family always reassures me that they support me in everything I do.”

Success in any career comes from being willing to say ‘yes’ to your big opportunity, even if it feels scary. “Everything happened so fast and unexpectedly,” Cody says. “Now, I am visiting countries I never thought I would see and playing in front of hundreds of thousands of fans. It’s something many people dream of and try to achieve. But I know it won’t last forever.”"
44,"I jumped out of bed, pulled back a corner of the bedroom curtain, and looked down at the river. A new crack in the ice sparkled in the morning sun. I shaded my eyes and looked upstream at the sandbags that were there to stop the buildings from flooding as the ice melted. My back still hurt from lifting the sandbags last week. I had worked long hours with most of the adults in town to help. But my grandfather didn’t seem to notice. 

With one hand on the curtain, I looked at the half-mile stretch of dark water coming from the wood processing factory in Milltown. There were fragile ice shelves on both sides, and solid ice further down the river. As I took off my pajamas and put on my kayaking wetsuit, I saw a boy on the other side of the river. I didn’t know him. He was trying to balance on an ice shelf near the warm water from the factory. I zipped up my wetsuit and grabbed my kayaking jacket. I checked the pocket for my lucky silver chain, which my famous grandfather brought back from South America. Only he, my mom, and I know about it. I also have his diary from that trip, which I keep under my pillow and read before I sleep. I touched the chain again and went to the kitchen.

“Good morning, Rex,” my mom said with a smile as I took a banana from the counter. “You’re up early for a Saturday. I’ll make brunch after your training. Be careful.” 

“Thanks, Mom.” I walked down the hallway and almost bumped into my tall grandfather as he came out of his room. 

“Can’t you watch where you’re going?” he shouted. “Where are you going?” 

“Sorry, Grandpa. I’m going kayaking.” It was obvious because I was wearing my wetsuit. He always saw me in my kayak every morning. I tried to ignore his anger, but it was getting harder. 

“What’s the point of training? You didn’t win the competition,” he said. His words hurt, but I took a deep breath and counted to three. He walked away and slammed the bathroom door. My mom came over with a kind smile. 

“Don’t mind him. He’s…” 

“...not himself right now,” I finished for her. I didn’t say that he had always been like this. But like my mom, I tried to be nice to him. When I was a child, he was my hero. He showed me pictures of himself in National Geographic magazine. Those old photos still hang on his wall, above his dusty medals and trophies. But I don’t go into his room anymore. I have my own trophies to look at, and maybe one day, my own picture in National Geographic. Still, a part of me wants to stay loyal to him, even though he is grumpy.

My mom smiled. “At least he’s coming out of his room more. Have a good training session, Rex. I admire your determination to keep going, even in this cold weather!” 

I smiled back as I peeled my banana. “It’ll be warmer in South America,” I said. “If I find sponsors for my trip.” She laughed and went back to the kitchen. I finished my banana and went downstairs. Stepping into the backyard, I hurried to the boathouse."
45,"Mum grabbed Jess by the arm. ""Come with me,"" she said. Jess followed her into the study. On the table, leaning against the wall, was a painting without a frame. It was clearly one of Grandpa's paintings, but it looked different from his other work and was not finished. ""Do you know anything about this?"" Mum asked. Jess shook her head. ""I’ve never seen it before. I didn’t know he was working on anything.""

Jess looked closely at the painting. There was a river in it, but it was not a river she recognized. It seemed like a fantasy river. The painting was strange and beautiful in a spooky way. The riverbank was very small, with just a hint of green that was easy to miss. The pale water seemed to lead to a hidden sea. There were no animals, birds, or people in the painting, and it felt right that way. It seemed like there was no place for living things in this distant scene. Still, Jess felt drawn to it, thinking about autumn coming after a long summer.

Mum spoke again. ""It has a name."" There was something in her voice that showed her excitement. Jess understood why. Grandpa never named his paintings. He just painted them and let others figure them out. Mum turned the painting over and pointed to the words Grandpa had written. Jess read them aloud: ""River Boy."" The words felt important to her, but she didn’t know why. 

Then Jess noticed something strange. She looked at Mum. ""There is no boy."" 

""Exactly. It’s strange for him to be so specific. But maybe he will add the boy later since he hasn’t finished it yet. I made the mistake of asking him about it.""

""Mum! You should have known better.""

""I know, but I couldn’t help it. It’s such an unusual painting, especially with a name. You can guess what he said.""

Jess didn’t need to guess. She knew Grandpa would have said, ""It’s not the artist’s job to explain a painting. Each painting has its own life and language, like a poem. We either understand it or we don’t. Painting is hard work, and I can’t waste time explaining it to everyone."" 

Mum laughed and said, ""Something like that. Anyway, I was hoping you might know something about this painting since you seem to inspire him.""

""Inspire?"" Jess asked.

""Yes, a muse is someone who inspires an artist."" Jess knew what that meant. Grandpa often said it when she watched him paint, but he usually meant that the muse was not helping him that day or that he needed to be nice to the muse. He never said it was about her. She always thought he meant a goddess, not a real person. It was hard to believe anyone, even a goddess, could influence someone as stubborn as Grandpa. 

""He doesn’t need me to inspire him,"" she said. ""He’s been painting all his life."""
46,"When I woke up this morning, I didn’t plan to cut a hole in my bedroom carpet. I’m not saying it was an accident, but it could have been. For example, if I had tripped over the bed with Dad’s Stanley knife in my hand, the knife might have gone into the carpet and made a big hole. I’m not saying that happened, just that it could have. I didn’t mean to damage the carpet. I didn’t wake up thinking, “Today I will cut a hole in my carpet.” It just seemed like a good idea at the time, which often happens. Later, I wonder why I thought that, but by then it’s too late. This happens to me a lot. I’m a bit unlucky in that way.

What I was really doing was trying to fit my corner cabinet into a corner. Gran gave me the cabinet when she moved to a flat. It’s very cute! It’s small, painted white, with pink and blue flowers around the edge, and it has tiny glass doors. Gran used to keep china ornaments in there, like shepherdesses and old ladies selling balloons. Now, I keep my collection of shells, fossils, and interesting stones in it. Gran knew I loved her corner cabinet, and I was so happy when she gave it to me!

The problem is, it is a corner cabinet, which means it has to stand in a corner. I only have two corners in my bedroom because it is the smallest room in the house, shaped like a wedge of cheese. The big front bedroom is for Mum and Dad, the back one is for my sister Angela, the little one over the garage is for my brother Tom, and the tiny one that is like a broom cupboard is mine. Mum says that when Angela goes to university, Tom can have her room, and I can have his. Then, when Tom goes to university, I can choose any room. But since Angela is only fifteen, I think I will be stuck in my small room for a long time. 

I don’t really mind; I like my little bedroom. It’s cozy, like a nest. I love the sloping roof and the window at floor level. The only problem is the lack of corners! My bed is in one corner, and my wardrobe is in the other. I tried to fit Gran’s cabinet into the space between the roof and the floor, but it was just a little too tall. I thought, if I can’t cut anything off the cabinet, how about cutting a hole in the carpet? It seemed like the obvious solution. Dad calls this “lateral thinking.” I thought he would be happy with me because he always tells us to “think outside the box.” And that is exactly what I was doing!"
47,"The novel ""The Borrowers"" is about a family of tiny people who live secretly in the walls and floors of a house. They ""borrow"" things from normal-sized people to survive. When I was asked to direct a TV version of the book, I knew it would be difficult to meet people's expectations. Fans of the book have strong ideas about how it should be. I used the original drawings from the book a lot because I wanted to avoid complaints from fans. The author wanted the series to show the story from the Borrowers' point of view, not from the humans', which made filming more complicated.

The most important thing was to get the size right. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans, so when we filmed them walking across a room or going on a borrowing mission, we had to be ten times further away than usual. When filming the human world around the Borrowers, the crew had to crawl on the ground and film from no higher than 15 centimeters. They went through many pairs of jeans! We only raised the cameras for aerial shots. 

One big challenge was to make sure the shadows looked right when we combined the tiny Borrowers with the normal-sized background. We created a special technique for this. After the series aired, famous director George Lucas called to ask how we did it. The only permanent set we built was the Borrowers' home under the floor, filled with giant objects to make the actors look small. It was very unusual. I remember asking them to carry giant scissors, and they really got into it. The coins we used were bigger than dinner plates and hard to lift, which made the crew laugh a lot.

In the story, there is a scene where the Borrowers are swept down a drain. To film this, the actors had to go down a tunnel with hoses, and they said it was so scary that they didn’t need to act. I wanted to make sure the costumes were right, which has been a problem in other TV versions. I had the costumes made from heavy canvas so they looked like doll clothes. This made it hard for the main actress to move. She couldn’t sit down during breaks and had to be sewn into her dress every morning. The lead actor's trousers were made from a rug because normal fabric would have looked too smooth. Unfortunately, it was very hot during filming, and I don’t think they appreciated my attention to detail!

Most of the action away from the Borrowers' home was filmed with the actors in front of a blue screen on an empty set. It was hard for them to react to things that weren’t really there. I had to draw pictures of every scene to show how they should look – I made 2,000 drawings by the end. They weren’t perfect, but they worked. We didn’t have enough money to use special effects studios during the day, so I worked nights for three months. We had to work quickly – I once filmed a whole scene before realizing there was no film in the camera. But in the end, everything came together, and I think the series was successful in showing the magic of the books."
48,"Mom stops the car at the corner of my new school, Palm Grove High School. She looks around nervously, expecting to see journalists, but there aren’t any. I know that soon things will get crazy. It always happens. There will be fake smiles, people pretending to be my friends, and questions like, “Can you get me free tickets to one of your dad’s concerts?” I tell her, “Everything’s going to be fine.” She kisses her fingertip and touches my cheek before I get out of the car. Then she drives away, leaving me alone in this new school and new situation. But this is what I wanted. I wanted to leave my old life of traveling and tutors. While the rest of the band is here for recording, we are staying for good. I wanted to come to this school because I want to meet real kids. I think it would be cool to have friends whose parents have normal jobs, like working in an office or cutting grass.

I walk into the school office. “Hi, I need my schedule, please,” I say to the secretary. “Name?” she asks, looking unfriendly. “Desert McGraw.” “Desirée?” she asks, leaning closer. “Desert,” I repeat. She seems confused. “Oh,” she says and types my last name on her computer. That’s good because not many people recognize my last name since my dad uses a stage name. “What grade?” she asks. “Eleventh.” “One second, it’s printing,” she replies. Then she gives me the paper. My first class is English Literature. Great! I like English. But I will be late because it’s in Room 214 on the second floor. I studied the map last night so I wouldn’t look silly trying to find my classes.

When I reach the door, I hear the teacher calling names. “Aurelio Gonzalez.” “Here.” I slip in quietly and sit at the last desk in the second row. The girl next to me smiles. She looks at my normal outfit – jeans and a T-shirt. “Nice shoes,” she whispers. I look down at my fancy shoes with flowers. Oh no, I shouldn’t have worn these. “Thanks,” I say. The teacher pauses and says, “Desert... McGraw?” “Here,” I reply. The teacher smiles and introduces herself as Ms. Smigla. She talks a lot and gives us our course outlines. After explaining the books we will read this year, she lets us talk to each other! All teachers should do this.

“Why did you move here?” my new friend asks. I have a few options for my answer. Should I say I wanted a normal life away from cameras and reporters? Or should I say what my dad thinks? He said, “We need a change, Desert, and this is the perfect place to record the new album. Energy, color, culture... just what our last album needed.” I think he just wants to relax on the beach. Why else would they choose a recording studio so close to the sand? “My dad had to relocate,” I tell her. Yes, it’s easier to lie. “What does he do?” she asks. I know everyone will find out eventually, but I want to pretend to be normal for a while. “He’s an artist,” I say, playing with my backpack zipper. “Cool. I’m Becca, by the way.” And she doesn’t seem to care much. That’s great!"
49,"Not only is the average American teenage girl expected to be the president of the Student Council, but she also needs to have a part-time job, volunteer, and do well in all these areas. This is what it means to be a teenager in America today. Boys and girls cannot just go to school and be average; they need to stand out. Being average is not enough, and not having big goals is seen as being lazy. 

Kristen Loose, a teenager, says, “People, especially adults, forget how much pressure we have today. We have a lot of homework, tests, after-school activities, jobs, chores, and responsibilities at home, all while trying to have a social life.” Even though these stresses are normal for teenagers now, there are still negative stereotypes about them, often shown in the media. These stereotypes include being lazy, disrespectful, rebellious, loud, reckless, and self-centered. While some teenagers may fit these descriptions, many do not think it is fair to label all teenagers this way.

Kristen Loose believes that many people think teenagers spend most of their time watching TV or using their phones. She admits she often has her phone nearby, but she uses it for important things, not just for fun. For teenagers, their phones are tools that help them manage their lives. Today, students are expected to have quick access to information and to be reachable all the time, which can look like an addiction to their phones. With smartphones, tablets, and social media, students can do their homework anywhere. Instead of just listening to music on the way to school, they might be listening to language lessons.

Schoolwork and other activities now need attention all the time, which adds to the stress for already busy teenagers. Many teenagers start their day around 6 a.m. or 7 a.m. and often finish their day after midnight. Their schedules are full of school, after-school activities, family responsibilities, and homework. They have to wake up and do it all again the next day, often getting less than the recommended nine hours of sleep each night. A survey by the US National Sleep Foundation found that only about 20 percent of teenagers get the recommended nine hours of sleep. Additionally, 28 percent of teens said they fall asleep in school about once a week because they are too tired.

Teenager Lindamarie Olsen thinks that after all her activities, she has about 18 hours of free time each week. With 168 hours in a week, 18 hours is not a lot. Olsen does not spend much of her free time on social media or watching TV. Instead, she uses her time for volunteer work. She says, “People think teenagers only care about themselves and their own interests.” However, Olsen enjoys volunteering and believes it is important to help others. “I love serving others and want to make a positive impact in my school and community.”

In 20 years, the stereotype of teenagers may change, but they will continue to challenge these ideas and make a difference in the world. There will always be new generations of students who are making their mark before they even finish school."
50,"The teenage members of the Earth to Sky Calculus Club live in Bishop, a mountain town in the US. This town is mostly surrounded by wild nature, east of the Sierra Nevada mountains. In the last few years, this group has sent over fifty balloons to the edge of space, about 35 km above the Earth. This is a long-term science project that combines astronomy and adventure, which is why many teenagers join. 

I joined them one weekend in late spring. They were getting ready to release a high-altitude balloon to try to record shooting stars. Shooting stars happen when a rock or piece of metal from space enters the Earth's atmosphere and creates a bright light. As it got dark, the teenagers attached a soft insulated lunch box to the bottom of the balloon. Inside the lunch box were a camera, a device to measure height, and a thermometer to check the temperature as the balloon rose. They also put two GPS trackers on the outside of the lunch box to help find it later. 

A gas tank, given by a supporter from another state, was used to fill the balloon, which slowly grew to the size of a small car. An older boy made a seven-hour trip to get the gas tank. “I didn’t really mind,” he said. For kids in this club, this is normal. Finally, it was time for the balloon to go up. “Five, four, three, two, one,” they counted down, and the balloon started to rise. Some of them ran and followed its path with bright flashlights until they could no longer see it in the dark sky. There was a quiet moment filled with wonder as the balloon disappeared into the night.

After the launch, most students went home, but a few stayed to watch the shooting stars. They lay on blankets on the mountainside and looked at the clear sky, which was surprising because it was only four hours from Los Angeles, a busy city with about 4 million people. I saw a boy get into a sleeping bag and quickly fall asleep. “We’re the only ones talking,” said one girl quietly. “I know,” whispered another. Suddenly, a meteor shot across the sky.

As the balloon rose, the air pressure decreased, and the balloon expanded until it was almost the size of a house. Then it popped with a loud noise. A parachute helped the lunch box land safely back on Earth. The students would find it the next day using the GPS trackers. Getting it back was not easy, but that was part of the fun. There is not much land with people around Bishop, so the lunch box usually lands in a remote area. “Recoveries are a big part of the program,” said the group’s leader, noting they have only lost two lunch boxes in 53 launches. “This journey helps us learn more about the landscape in a way we usually wouldn’t.”

This time, the lunch box landed 84 km west of Bishop. To get it, the recovery team had to drive south of the Sierra and then back up the western side of the mountains. They had to decide whether to drive or walk, as it could be dangerous if the lunch box was on a high peak or in a tall tree. “These students know the Eastern Sierra well,” their leader said. “What seems wild to some is just normal for others.” 

In the end, it took them 11 hours to find the lunch box. It was in a canyon, on a flat rock, near a waterfall. The camera did not capture any shooting stars. While this was a bit disappointing, it gave them a chance to discuss atmospheric waves and how they work above mountains. It was also another adventure story to share with anyone who asked."
51,"Chloe Morgan admits that she was not very interested in science, especially Palaeontology, until she was fifteen. It happened by chance. Her younger brother was excited about dinosaurs, which she had not been when she was younger. She helped him with a science project and found an article about new discoveries in Palaeontology that amazed her. She realized she wanted to pursue this field.

Chloe remembers meeting her first professional palaeontologist, Matt Cornelius, who was already famous even though he was young. She was very nervous at first, worried he would think she was just a bothersome kid. However, he was friendly and patient, which made her feel more comfortable.

When I ask Chloe about how palaeontologists are shown in movies and TV shows, she looks thoughtful. She acknowledges that films like Jurassic Park have increased public interest in dinosaurs, but they often misrepresent palaeontologists. She feels that they are usually shown as strange geniuses or awkward people who cannot connect with others. This does not reflect the reality of their work.

Chloe explains that her job is very varied. She spends time digging up dinosaur bones, working in labs to analyze fossils, and writing scientific papers. Although it is not her main job, she also believes it is important to share scientific findings with the public, especially young people. She wants to help them understand science better. Talking about dinosaurs can inspire children to learn more about the natural world and other areas of science.

Chloe worked on the TV documentary Walking with Dinosaurs, which was a chance to influence how dinosaurs are shown on screen. She says the creators of the show knew what they were doing, and she only needed to give advice on a few details, like making sure the dinosaurs were the right size and shape and that they lived at the same time. The show attracted viewers of all ages because it presented dinosaurs in a way that was very different from movies like Jurassic Park.

Chloe believes that dinosaurs continue to fascinate us because they represent adventure and discovery. They remind us that there is still much to learn about our world, and Palaeontology allows us to explore the past."
52,"Text: ""I want to say something important: when you are traveling by car with your family, even if you are six years old, you know that you are not ‘there yet’ when you keep asking, ‘Are we there yet?’ But when you arrive, it is not ‘there’ anymore; it is ‘here’. So if you think you might be ‘there’ already, you should ask, ‘Are we here yet?’ I am sure that no one wants to be ‘there yet’ more than the parents who hear this question over and over on long car trips. 

Think about it. Wouldn’t you like to relax in the back seat, with nothing to do? You can watch DVDs, listen to music, or do puzzles while looking at the beautiful views outside the window. In the front seat, there is a parent with juice boxes and cookies, changing the radio and temperature to keep everything nice. 

But then, sometimes, something happens that makes the trip less fun. For me, it is usually my younger brother, Tim. He might put his foot on my side of the seat. I can’t let him do that, so I put my foot on his side. Soon, he is all over my space, and we start to fight. Our parents have to reach back to separate us while driving. They tell Tim to stay in his own seat and keep his hands to himself. This helps for a while, and we can enjoy the views again.

Later, when I try to read, I feel a breeze on my arm. The window is closed, so where is it coming from? Tim is next to me, breathing on me. He is not touching me, so he thinks he is being clever. This makes me angry. Tim gets yelled at again, and the car swerves. But after a bit, things calm down.

Over the years, Dad has found ways to deal with us in the back seat. When we ask, ‘Are we there yet?’ he often says, ‘Yes, we’re here. Get out of the car.’ But we are still on the highway! Then he says, ‘Oh, maybe we’re not there yet.’ This makes us quiet for a while. 

You can tell when you finally arrive because the adults get out of the car and go far away from the kids. So remember: if your parents are still close enough to answer your question, the answer is: no, you are not there yet."""
53,"John and Zuzi Morgan have opened a café in Oxford, UK, where people can enjoy coffee and cake while playing board games. They hope that customers will love the experience and want to come back. Zuzi explains that they wanted to create a place where people can connect without using their phones or other devices. She believes that people should spend time together and talk to each other.

The games played in their café are called ‘Eurogames’. These games often have gentle themes, like farming or building landscapes. The first Eurogame was The Settlers of Catan, created by a German designer named Klaus Teuber. In this game, players build settlements on an island and trade resources with each other, keeping everyone involved until the end. 

Later, cooperative games were created, where all players work together to win or lose as a team. One popular cooperative game is Pandemic, designed by Matt Leacock from North America. He was inspired by a Eurogame called Lord of the Rings. Leacock remembers playing it with friends and feeling scared but also happy at the end, no matter who won. He wanted to create a game that gave people that same feeling.

Leacock has loved board games since he was a child, but he often felt disappointed when they didn’t meet his expectations. With help from his uncle, he started redesigning games to make them better. Pandemic became very successful, and its follow-up game included a lot of storytelling, similar to video games, where players develop characters and the story changes.

Interestingly, the rise of video games has helped the popularity of modern board games. Many people now play games on their smartphones, making them more open to playing board games too. Ben Hogg, who works for a game company, says that everyone has at least one game they enjoy on their phone.

For a while, video games allowed people to interact in person at arcades or while playing together at home. But as multiplayer games moved online, players became more distant from each other. This made some people want to play games with others who were physically present again. 

In John and Zuzi's busy café, it is clear that tabletop gaming is more than just fun. In our online world, games have become a way to connect with others in real life, and this trend is likely to continue."
54,"Jamie Scott has written and produced some of the biggest hits in the UK in recent years. His story shows that hard work and determination are very important in the music industry, even if your career starts with many failures. He says his mother was a great singer and helped him learn to play the guitar. The only radio station he listened to at home was for older people, which influenced his music taste as he grew up. He was 12 years old when he first heard a modern song. Around the same time, he had to choose between playing tennis, which he played at a national level, and music. He spent his lunchtimes in the school music room learning songs on the piano. He said, “I was doing well in tennis, but it was not what I wanted to do for my whole life. It was just too much hard work.”

At 17, he left school to become a performer. He formed a duo with a friend who was a good guitarist but did not want to make a career in music. Jamie told his parents that he wanted to pursue music, explaining that he had been writing lyrics during economics lessons and practicing the piano every day. His dad gave him 18 months to succeed in music; if he didn’t, he would have to find a job. After some close calls with record labels, he got signed to a music publisher at 19 because of one song. However, the record labels wanted him to be a solo artist, so he had to part ways with his friend.

Eventually, he found success behind the scenes instead of on stage. After a tough time with a record label in the UK, he asked to leave and joined another label to release a new album. However, he did not become famous right away. He said, “I feel like I’ve been in the wrong place at the wrong time for most of my artist career, but as a writer, I’ve been in the right place at the right time.” Writing for other artists is where he really found success. He believes he is one of the main writers in the UK that labels turn to for new artists. He sometimes has to explain to these artists that wanting to write popular songs is not a bad thing. He asks them, “Don’t you want 10 million people streaming your music next month?” He wants to help them create songs that are both amazing and likely to sell well.

It is refreshing to hear someone like Jamie speak openly about wanting to write big hit songs. He is not arrogant; he simply knows that he wants to write number one songs and that he has a talent for it. Instead of trying to please others, he focuses on his work. He says, “When I go into the studio with someone, we need to aim for the best music of next year. It’s not just about what’s cool. We want to write classic modern pop songs.”"
55,"Tony Connor is a new kind of celebrity. He is very popular online, but many people, like me, may not know him because we don’t watch videos of people doing bike tricks. He is a ""street trials cyclist."" This means he jumps from hard places like roofs or walls to land safely in other difficult spots. People film these stunts and share them online.

I met Tony one Saturday morning at a BMX park. The local kids all know him, and some older people come to tell him he is ""an absolute legend."" After watching him perform, I agree with them. At first, I was unsure about him, but I was impressed by his bravery and creativity. Before each jump, he explains what he plans to do, and sometimes I can’t believe he will succeed. When I compliment him, he seems a bit uninterested and sad. Even though he is famous online, Tony says he does not like being a celebrity. He finds it hard to connect with fans. He prefers to focus on doing his stunts rather than talking about them.

Tony thinks it is funny that he is famous because of social media and the small cameras that help create videos. He says, ""This technology helps people like me earn money."" He feels that many people are always filming themselves or looking at screens, and he does not always agree with that. However, he is not unhappy. He makes a good living from his videos, which would have just been a hobby for someone in the past.

From my experience interviewing top athletes, I have learned that two important things help a child become a great competitor: energy and the ability to handle disappointment. These qualities can be more important than talent. They help a person keep going even when they fail. In risky sports, it is very important to have mental strength. Even in the park, Tony fell a few times on what he thought were easy challenges. He just got back up and kept trying until he succeeded.

Not everyone sees Tony as a hero. Some people think he is reckless and takes too many risks. He responds, ""People who say this may care, but they don’t understand. They probably have never tried riding a trials bike and don’t know much about the sport. They don’t see that I get advice from experts to stay safe."" In reality, Tony is careful about the risks he takes. He says, ""Everyone is different. Some people are not scared, and they shouldn’t do these sports. It’s smart to know the dangers. I can feel fear but find a way to overcome it. I’m not addicted to risk; I spend a lot of time planning and preparing. Sometimes I ride around to get ready before trying a new stunt. I know I must stay calm before I jump. If I fully commit, I will be fine."""
56,"Television presenter Helen Skelton has done many dangerous challenges for charity. These include running a marathon in the desert and traveling down the Amazon river in a small boat. For her latest challenge, Helen walked on a high wire, which is a long thin piece of metal, 66 meters above the ground, between two towers of an empty power station. There was no safety net, just a belt around her waist connected to another wire above her. To help her balance and avoid falling, she used a long stick that weighed eight kilograms. 

Helen took lessons from an expert high-wire walker. Even though she had some circus skills, she found out that high-wire walking was very different. “The training was a shock,” Helen said. “I didn’t know I needed to be so strong. Every day started at 8 am with a run up a steep hill, followed by an hour of exercises, and then another hour practicing on the wire. I also had to learn how to fall onto the wire so I could keep going if I slipped. Every time I fell, it hurt a lot. But I had to stay positive: if I got nervous and started shaking, the wire would shake too!”

On the day of the challenge, it was windy. Helen stayed calm by taking deep breaths as she moved step by step along the wire. The 150-meter walk took her 15 minutes. “That was the scariest thing I’ve done,” she said afterwards. “I’m glad it’s over!” However, this experience has not stopped Helen from planning her next charity project: to reach the South Pole by ski, kite, and bike."
57,"In 2006, Jeff Somers started a trip around the world on a penny farthing, which is an old-fashioned bicycle with one big wheel and one small wheel. He had already written a book about his travels in Canada using a 50-year-old car. Jeff loved motor sports and worked building racing car engines. To save money, he rode an old bicycle to work and also used it to go on holiday to Amsterdam. He said, ""That trip opened my eyes. I decided to see the world by bike."" 

Jeff did not want a regular touring bike, so he decided to build one himself. He thought the most interesting bike would be a penny farthing, so he visited a museum to learn how they were made. After two attempts in 2001 and 2003, when he had to stop because of a knee injury, he finally began his journey in 2006. He traveled for three years, visiting 23 countries on four continents. The best part of his trip was reaching Tibet and seeing Mount Everest. 

Even though he met other cyclists who could ride up mountains, he never regretted using his penny farthing. People were always amazed by it as he traveled further from home. His worst experience was when he had to drink dirty water from a stream, which made him very sick. He spent ten days in a hostel without medicine and had no money for a hospital or to go home. 

Despite these challenges, Jeff now says, ""If I could afford it, I would start traveling again tomorrow on my penny farthing."""
58,"I work at a university in the US with my team to learn more about water birds, especially the American black duck. We have just started using a new tool called a ‘night-vision scope’. This tool helps us see the ducks in the dark! We are concerned about black ducks because their numbers have dropped a lot, and we are not sure if there is enough food for them on the east coast. 

We know a lot about what they do during the day, but we don’t know what they do at night because we didn’t have the right equipment. The new scope will give us clear pictures, even when there is no moon, so we can learn more and make better choices to protect their habitat. 

It is hard work. There are four of us, and we each work six hours a day. We have studied ducks in different places, and I have had to take a boat to some locations and write down every duck I see. The weather has been difficult – some nights are warm, but most of the time it is wet. It is very quiet, so I have needed a lot of coffee to stay awake! We have only missed one workday because the snow was too deep for our special vehicles. 

I enjoy the challenge, especially when I think about the summer. In summer, we will spend hours in a laboratory looking at our results together. It will be hard to be inside, but it is important to do this work. I wouldn’t change it for anything!"
59,"Whenever I tell people what I do for a living, they can hardly believe my job exists. But I’m not joking! I spend my days at work eating chocolate! Tasting chocolate is very important to make sure that customers get perfect bars of high-quality chocolate from my company. Every week, I receive samples, which are small amounts of chocolate, from our factory. I have to check them for taste, texture, and smell. I also taste the raw materials we usually use, like nuts and fruit. I spend time choosing the best ones to put into the chocolate. 

Next to my office, I have a kitchen where I can test and taste the products I make. I also share samples with my colleagues! My kitchen is full of machines and ingredients to work with. It’s great to have a private space to go to during the day. No two days are the same in this job. Sometimes I am in our food lab, and other times I travel to other countries to buy our raw materials. This can be hard because I have a young family. But I love the variety in my job, even more than the chocolate itself!

People often ask me if I get bored of chocolate. I’ve worked with it for a long time, and I’ve never felt tired of eating it. In fact, I often go home and eat more chocolate in the evening!"
60,"Have you ever thought about what it is like to perform in a circus? Sophia Grayson works at Circus Experience, a place that teaches young people circus skills. She says her course is popular because it teaches many skills. Students learn to juggle, throw and catch things like balls or even fire, and they also learn trapeze, which is flying through the air in front of an amazed audience. 

The course lasts for a year, and students slowly take more risks in each class. Parents can come to some classes to see how their children are doing. Sophia explains, “To have a career in the circus, performers need to do different things. It is important to keep performances exciting and full of action. If you want to be successful in the circus, you must keep practicing. Another great part of this job is making friends with other performers and learning from them. Staying fit is also very important. Circus artists, like athletes, train every day to stay strong. Training is very important, but the best performers are those who want to succeed, have creativity, and always work on improving their skills.”

Some people think that circus performers often get hurt or that they only work for a short time each year. But the real challenge is thinking about the future. You can only travel and perform while you are young, and then you need to think about other options. The course also teaches business planning. Many former students have started their own businesses around the world and are happy to share their experiences. However, Sophia warns that this is not a job for making a lot of money! “The work usually does not provide a regular salary. It is also very competitive, but it is a lot of fun!”"
61,"You may not know her name or face, but you have probably heard her many times. Mariam Hobson is a professional backing singer. This means she sings in the background to support the main singer. Many people think backing singers are not good enough to be lead singers, but that is not true. They often have to be even better! People like Mariam are the real stars of the music industry.

Mariam says, ""What I love about my job is that when I go into the recording studio, I never know what I will be asked to sing. It could be classical, jazz, hip-hop, or rock. Sometimes, it might be a funny song for a radio station or an advertisement. I am often surprised by what the producers ask me to do. Once, I was asked to sing like a fish underwater! But I never argue; I just do my job!""

""To do my work well, I need excellent musical skills and the ability to learn quickly. There is often no written music to follow. I will never forget my first time recording background music for a film. It was very complicated because there were eight of us, each singing a different part, along with an orchestra. I was very scared because if I made a mistake, we would have to record everything again, and nobody likes that. Recording sessions are already long.""

""One of my favorite jobs is recording for songwriters. Less experienced writers sometimes do not know which musical range is best for a female voice. By listening to me sing their song, they can learn how to make it better."""
62,"Julie Deane started with only basic knowledge of fashion, but she built a successful business selling ‘satchels,’ which are traditional bags used by schoolchildren. These satchels are now sold in famous shops and are popular with many celebrities. Before deciding to sell satchels, Julie made a list of different business ideas, like cake decorating and party planning. She thought carefully about her options instead of just going with her first idea. 

When she chose to sell satchels, not everyone agreed with her. Julie said, “Many people said there was no demand for them, but I was sure it would work.” She involved her family from the beginning, working with her mother, who had never had a job but was good at business. The design of the satchels was inspired by children’s storybooks. 

Julie didn’t know much about fashion blogs, but they became important for her success. At first, she sold about one satchel a week. To create interest, she sent satchels to fashion writers and hoped they would write about them in their blogs. They did, and interest in her satchels grew, as did the speed at which her company made them. Now, Julie enjoys waiting to see which celebrity will be seen with a satchel!

While other companies spend money on online ads, Julie uses the internet community for ideas to create new and exciting styles. There was a difficult time when another company copied her satchel design and sold similar products. Because of this, she now makes sure she trusts her production team as much as her own staff. Visitors to her office often say it has a positive atmosphere, and people enjoy working there. There is now a new factory, and while the buildings are important, it is the team that makes it a special place."
63,"When Vicky Harmiston was a child, her parents let her and her brother Jamie choose how to spend their free time. Vicky liked to do many different sports. She was a good swimmer, and her coach thought she could become a champion. However, the swimming club was far from her home, so it was hard for her to balance training with schoolwork.

As teenagers, Jamie, who loved cycling, bought a special racing bike and started competing. Vicky thought this looked exciting and decided to try cycling too. She says it was the best decision she ever made. Soon, she was cycling every day and doing very well. The track was close to her school, so it was easy for her to go to training after school.

Vicky had a successful career in track cycling and won many competitions. When she was 28, she retired from competitive cycling. Vicky said, “For years, I loved winning, but I started to feel tired of it. When the excitement goes away, there’s no point in continuing. Luckily, I found a new job.”

Vicky got a job with a charity called CycleZone. She said, “We work with young people who have never enjoyed sports. The first thing we do is teach them to ride a bike. We want them to believe in themselves and their abilities. CycleZone does a great job and helps young people feel part of a group.”

The charity uses famous people to promote their work. Vicky said, “Some people think having a celebrity support a charity is not always good. They believe celebrities do it for their own benefit, which can hide the real work of the charity. But if famous singers and actors can help, I think they should.”"
64,"Singer-songwriter Ana Ronson grew up in Ireland. Her parents were not musicians, but there was always music in their home. Her grandfather played the guitar and taught Ana and her brother how to play. The first time Ana sang in front of people was at school. She was very nervous, and her teacher had to help her off the stage. The teacher suggested that Ana join the school theatre club to help her feel more confident. After some time in the club, she happily sang with 50 other students at a concert at the end of the term.

A year later, her brother, who was in a band, asked her to write a song for them. Ana wrote her first song, called Falling Stars, in just three days. She enjoyed it so much that she signed up for a songwriting course with a professional songwriter. Even though she was the youngest student, she knew more about music than many others. However, Ana felt that the teacher did not listen to her ideas, so she wrote a song called Something to Say about how this made her feel. She shared this song online, and it became very popular. She was happy when people commented that they loved it and found new meanings in the lyrics.

Joss Alton, who owns a recording company called Isotope Music, flew from the other side of Ireland to ask Ana to join his company. At first, she was unsure because she did not know much about Isotope and did not want anyone telling her what to sing. But Joss convinced her that this would not happen. Soon after, she performed at a concert in Dublin organized by Isotope. All the tickets sold out quickly, and it was a wonderful evening.

Ana says she is not very interested in writing songs about happy times; she prefers to write about difficult times because she has more to say. One of her favorite songs is Decision, which is about why her brother stopped singing for a while and how sad it made him. While she hopes her fans will enjoy her songs, her goal is to write about personal experiences that are important to her."
65,"Last year, I went on a wonderful trip. I traveled by boat on a guided group tour along the west coast of Canada. It was my brother Harry’s idea. He is a journalist, like me, and he wanted to write articles about the trip. He loves boats, but I do not share that interest. However, I had always wanted to visit this area since I saw it on TV as a child. I knew it was where our great-grandparents lived before moving to Europe. So, I kept asking Harry if I could join him until he finally said yes!

A few days before we left, there were storms in the area we were going to. But luckily, the weather was supposed to be good when we arrived. I was busy with work and didn’t have much time to prepare, but Harry promised he would take care of everything, so I stopped worrying.

When we arrived in Canada, we joined the group, packed our supplies into small boats, and set off. The guide told us that very few people live along that coast now. On our first morning, the only living creatures we saw were dolphins and birds. We could see islands in the distance, but the morning fog made it hard to see far. I focused on the beautiful patterns our boat made in the water.

We often stopped for hours to explore the rock pools on the beaches. They were full of colorful fish, many of which I didn’t know. It was nice to forget about time and just enjoy the day. We always remembered to have lunch and dinner, which we cooked together over campfires. At night, we slept on the boats. Even though the beds were hard, it felt very relaxing!

When it was time to leave, I felt sad. How could I go back to normal life? But I knew I would miss my family and friends if I stayed. I was also excited to tell everyone at home about our adventures!"
66,"My dad was a professional basketball player in Germany, just like his father before him. When I was a kid, I went to watch many of his games. You might think that watching so many matches would make me love basketball, but it did the opposite. I liked telling my friends how good my dad was, especially when he won, but I usually took a book to read instead of watching the games.

When I started secondary school, I was still two years away from being a teenager, but I was already two meters tall. Because of my height, my sports teacher asked if I wanted to train with the basketball team. I enjoyed the practice, but I thought I needed to get better before playing in a real game. However, the teacher believed in me more than I believed in myself. After some time, I agreed to play, and a few weeks later, I found myself in a game against another school. My parents watching made me more nervous, but it turned out fine!

For the next four years, I practiced every day and did really well. I even joined an adult team before I moved to a special sports academy in the USA when I was fifteen. The coach there trained Olympic basketball players, and it was amazing to work with him. However, I didn’t enjoy living far from my parents at first. At home, I hadn’t spent much time with my friends because of all the training, so that part wasn’t too different for me. In the end, I got used to my new life, and my English improved quickly too!

I became a professional player at eighteen, three years after arriving in the USA. I had been taller than most players in the professional league since I was fifteen, but I needed to gain weight to match my height. My coach knew a team that would take me while I was still in college, so I joined them and have never regretted it."
67,"Seven years ago, I was studying Tourism at college, but I needed a part-time job because my course was expensive. After thinking about different options, I decided to train as a weekend tour guide in my home city, Chicago, USA. I took visitors around the city, and I was surprised by how much I enjoyed giving tours. I saw the city I had lived in my whole life from the tourists' perspective, and it felt new every time!

After I finished my studies, I chose to become a full-time tour guide. I thought it would be easy, but when I looked into it, I found out that I needed to know a lot more to get a license as a full-time tour guide. All Chicago guides must answer many questions about the city, including its architecture, history, and public transport rules. After several months of hard but interesting work, I got my tour guide qualification and registered as an independent tour guide.

Being a tour guide is not just about knowing facts or keeping track of the group. You also need other skills. You should be entertaining and tell interesting stories. Most importantly, you must be able to handle unexpected situations, like if a place you planned to visit is closed or if the route changes. Tourists do not want to hear about problems; they just want to enjoy a well-organized tour.

I need to make sure visitors are happy with my tours, or they might leave a bad review online. Like most tour guides, I know that good reviews are very important because they attract more customers. That’s why it’s essential to make tours fun and stress-free. I put a lot of enthusiasm and energy into my job, which helps me get good reviews, and many visitors recommend my tours to others coming to Chicago."
68,"My name is Ella, and I am 22 years old. Last year, I went to Thailand for two weeks with my sister, Josie. She is five years younger than me, but we get along well. We went to help at an elephant sanctuary, which is a place where people take care of sick and rescued elephants. At first, I was not sure if we would get along with the other volunteers because they were all older than us. We were also nervous because it was our first time doing something like this. In the end, we had nothing to worry about.

One of our main jobs at the sanctuary was to collect food for the elephants. Elephants eat a lot of grass and banana plants, so this took most of the day. Josie found it very hard work, but I thought it was worth it to see the elephants enjoy their food. We also helped wash the elephants in the river with big brushes and soap. I had a lot of fun, even though I got wetter than the elephants!

The part of the day I looked forward to the most was the evening. By the light of the moon, we led the elephants into the forest where they spent the night. All the volunteers stayed in the same house. Josie and I shared a bedroom, which was small, but we chose to do this because Josie didn’t want to be alone. It was hot and humid, especially at night, but we expected that. The meals were delicious and did not include meat, which we both do not like.

After dinner, all the volunteers and staff spent the evenings talking and playing games. Now that we are back in the UK, Josie does not often talk about Thailand. But if someone asks her if she enjoyed her time at the sanctuary, she says she loved it. However, I think she might be a little upset with herself for not enjoying it fully because she missed her friends. But when she thinks back, she can see how lucky she was to go there. Maybe she will go back one day – I know I will!"
69,"I’m Gina D’Costa, and I own a flower shop in the UK. We sell flowers not just to people for their homes or friends, but to many different customers. Hotels and offices often buy flowers for their reception areas, and sometimes we provide flowers for businesses to use in their advertising photos. Once, I even decorated a castle with flowers for a wedding. It was a lot of work, but I was very proud of what we did.

My day starts at 4 a.m. when I go to the market to buy fresh flowers. Most people are still asleep at that time, and my friends think I’m a bit crazy, but I love what I do. It can be cold and dark, but I don’t let that bother me. The flower market is amazing, with flowers from all over the world. The sights and smells make it hard to choose. If I were picking for myself, I would choose only pink flowers because it’s my favorite color. But I have to remember that what I like may not be what other people want. Not all flowers are available all year, so I can’t always find what customers want.

I don’t enjoy arguing about prices with the flower sellers, but it’s part of the job. Flowers can be expensive, so I try to get the best price. Back at the shop, we look at customer orders and prepare vases with the flowers I bought. Then we create flower bunches and calculate the costs. Customers are often surprised by the prices, and I sometimes have to ask them to think again about what they want. Some people might think this is too much trouble, but I enjoy finding the best flowers for the money someone wants to spend. That’s what you have to do when you sell things, and I wouldn’t want any other job!"
70,"My city has a modern cinema that shows all the latest films and many kids' movies on weekends. It is close to my home, but a year ago, I felt something was missing. I wanted to talk about films in detail with others after watching them. So, I started a film club with two friends! 

We decided not to rent a cinema. Instead, we choose a different place in the city each month. For example, we used an old factory to show a film set in Antarctica. It was very cold, which made it perfect for the film, and it was amazing! Some places we use are free because the owners sell snacks during the film, so we can keep our prices low. We are happy to cover our costs and not make a profit.

Each time we show a film, it gets easier, especially now that we have our own equipment. We can see how many tickets we sell online, so we don’t worry about empty seats anymore! There is still a lot to do, but it feels great when people of all ages tell us they had a wonderful time.

Our website has helped us a lot, and we are now in touch with other film clubs around the country. We have visited them to see how they do things, but it is always nice to return to our own club! We also started a blog because we know many people look online for film information instead of reading local papers. We have put up some posters in cafés, but the best way to get new members is when people tell their friends about us. 

The audience loves the special activities we organize with each film. Last month, we had a movie quiz that everyone enjoyed!"
71,"Taking photographs was always my favorite activity when I was a child. When I turned 15, I wanted to make my hobby more special. So, I decided to start a personal project: I would take one photograph every day for a whole year. Many other young photographers had done this before, but I thought it was a great idea, so I began.

After a few weeks, I decided to share my photos on a website for young photographers. I wanted to create a photo diary and show my work to others. I was surprised to find that many people liked my photos and the way I saw things. I enjoyed taking pictures of many different subjects. Then, someone suggested that if my photos had a common theme, my project would be even better. I agreed and started focusing on nature, especially birds and the sky.

Most of my photos were black and white, which was different from what many other young photographers were doing, as they were taking color photos. Because of this, I sometimes doubted my project and almost gave up. But in the end, I trusted my feelings and became more confident in my style and choices.

One day, I showed my project to my art teacher. She told me about a national photography competition for people my age. I entered some of my photos just for fun. I will never forget the moment when the judges told me I had won first prize. I was so happy because my project meant a lot to me. It was the first time I realized that my photography might be good, and I could work as a professional photographer. Now, I have my own photography studio, and I have never regretted my choice of career."
72,"I joined the National Youth Challenge (NYC) last year because I wanted to try new things like camping, sailing, and public speaking. In the NYC, you can do different activities that help you learn and challenge yourself. There are levels from beginner to advanced, and adult volunteers called ‘leaders’ run the programs. When you finish each level, you receive a certificate.

When I first joined, my leader suggested that I help organize activities at a local children’s club for two hours a week. I was unsure about this because I had joined that same club when I was eight, and I found it hard to make friends. I was shy, and the other kids already had their own friends, so I stopped going after a few weeks. However, I decided to take the challenge because I wanted my first NYC certificate. 

Soon, I started to enjoy spending my free time at the children’s club. It became more important to me than just getting the certificate. After I finished the challenge, the NYC leader let me keep volunteering at the club because I had made good friendships with the children. Now, I go there for about four hours a week, and I always look forward to it.

Because of what I learned at the children’s club, I have decided that when I finish school in three years, I want to go to college to become a qualified youth worker, which means working with children. I had never thought about this job before I started at the club. This has been my favorite part of the NYC, and I have improved my communication skills while helping others. I now have several NYC certificates, and one of them is for camping!"
73,"I was born in Denver, USA, and I started snowboarding when I was eight years old. My dad took me to a mountain resort, which is about two hours from Denver. The hill looked very steep, so my dad had to convince me to try snowboarding. I was too young to ask him if I could start, but he loved snowboarding and wanted me to enjoy it too. He made it look easy, and in the end, I did well. After that, I quickly fell in love with the sport and got better at it. I began competing when I was ten years old. Some people enter many competitions and get bored, but my love for competing and winning has grown as I got older. This helps me to work harder.

I like not having a strict plan, and sometimes this works out well. For example, I became the first female to get a perfect score of 100 at a local competition. I wasn’t sure I could do the jumps that got me this score until I actually tried. This achievement made me trust my abilities more. In the summer, I focus on training and studying when there is no snow. I train every day, but it’s nice not to follow a strict diet like I do in winter. I also spend a lot of time with my friends, which helps me deal with not being able to snowboard.

I have to think about my future. Snowboarding is a big part of my life now, but I know it’s important to have another plan in case I don’t become a professional snowboarder or if I get injured. I am thinking about becoming a doctor if I can find time to go to college. I can’t imagine getting tired of snowboarding, but I know I can’t do it forever."
74,"When I was fifteen, I wanted everything my friends had, and I never thought about the future. For example, I didn’t know what I wanted to do after school. One day, my best friend got a new phone for her birthday, and I wanted one too. My parents said I could only have it if I paid for it myself, so I decided to work part-time and save money. I am thankful to my parents for making me do that because it taught me an important lesson.

I worked every Saturday in a café, but I didn’t really like it. My parents suggested I start my own small business instead. I had seen my mum making necklaces, so I asked if I could try it too. I thought it would be hard, but it was easier than I expected. My friends thought it sounded boring, but I was excited about it. My mum showed me that I could make something nice at home with simple tools and materials.

I sold my first pieces of jewellery to my friends and family. They said they loved them, but I thought they were just being nice. Even though I was happy they bought them, I still needed to know if other people would like them too. So, I rented a market stall with my mum. There are many tourists where I live, and they bought a lot of my jewellery to take home. Soon, we started getting calls from all over the country from people wanting to buy more. They thought we were a big company with many workers, but it was just me and my mum at the market!

That was when I realized my business could be successful, and I decided to create a website. Since then, I have made a lot of money from my business, mostly online, but we still have our market stall. It has been a lot of fun!"
75,"When Janine Stuart was just 13 years old, she wrote a novel called Being Amelia, which became very popular. The book is partly about Janine’s own life. In an interview, Janine said, “Because my father’s job made us move around a lot, I learned how to make new friends. I know what it’s like to be the new student in a class, and that helped me write about Amelia, the main character, who starts at a new school. Some funny parts of the book are about Amelia’s home life, especially her relationship with her older brother. Since I am an only child, I had to use my imagination to describe that.” 

Janine started writing her novel one summer when she was bored at home. Her mother always wanted to be a published author, and her teachers encouraged her to write, so it felt natural for Janine to write a book. The year before, she won a short story competition on a website for young writers. This is why, when Janine finished Being Amelia and sent it to a publishing company, they were excited to read it. They loved the book, and a year later, it was in bookstores.

One review of Being Amelia says that even though the cover shows happy teenagers, the characters face real challenges, which makes them believable. The reviewer notes that even though Janine is young and her book is not very long, she is a better writer than many other bestselling authors. Janine is still getting used to being a famous writer. She said, “At first, I hid when people recognized me in the street, but now it’s fine. I want to give advice to other young writers, but they need to find what works for them. For me, I just need to spend time with my friends, and then I will have something interesting to write about!”"
76,"I’m Tom, and I’m fifteen years old. Three years ago, my family and I moved into a castle on a small island! It all started when my father was asked to be the manager of the castle. He works for a group that takes care of historical buildings and keeps them open for visitors. He was happy because he thought this was a great opportunity, but it took some time for the rest of us to agree that he should take the job. We were worried about what life on the island would be like. We knew the castle might not be as comfortable as our warm home across the water, and there was no school there.

After we moved, we quickly got used to living on the island. The castle isn’t very beautiful, but our apartment in it is nice. In the summer, the island is lively because many visitors come, and there are often beach parties. In winter, we only see the other families who live on the island, and there aren’t many teenagers like me. The adults help each other with repairs on the island, which can be hard work.

The biggest change for me was taking a boat every day to my old school. I was excited to go on stormy days when there are big waves, but the ferries don’t run then! I also found out that if I miss the bus to the harbor after school, I miss the last ferry home, which is stressful. So when my friends come to visit, I always tell them to hurry! But we often see amazing views, especially when the sun sets over the sea. Some days, it’s so foggy that you can’t see anything, but then it can be bright and sunny again in just a few hours. It still feels incredible when that happens, even after living here for a while. 

Of course, we do have bad storms, and I sometimes wonder if the castle is strong enough to stay safe. But then I remember it has been here for hundreds of years – and it’s still standing!"
77,"I live in a house in the beautiful countryside of Scotland. I have always loved nature and wild animals. Six years ago, I started a new hobby: birdwatching! I went to the mountains in northern Scotland with my family, where we saw many birds in their natural homes. I spent hours watching them with my parents, who taught me how to tell different bird species apart and where to find the best places to see them. It was amazing! After we came back home, I joined a local birdwatchers’ club for young people. My goal is to see 200 different bird species, and I am almost there. On family holidays abroad, I have seen birds from other countries too. We always look for places with birdwatching activities so I can add new birds to my list! 

I have been to Egypt, and last summer we went to South America, where I thought I would see my 200th species. I was not too disappointed when it didn’t happen because I learned that you need to be patient with this hobby. I made a video online about this challenge, and many teenagers liked it and said it looked interesting. When my teachers saw it, they asked me to give a presentation about birdwatching at school. I felt nervous just before I walked onto the stage. I knew what to say and had some notes, but the whole school and my friends were watching me! I only relaxed when it was over, and the teachers said I did well and they enjoyed it. I might even do another presentation next year!

I am lucky to live in the countryside. I understand why many teenagers in cities might not think about becoming birdwatchers, but there are many birds to see, especially in places with lots of green areas. I also think birdwatching clubs should try to get more young people interested in this hobby. Everyone should connect with nature, no matter their age, and it doesn’t have to cost a lot of money."
78,"I started playing football when I was 7 years old. I would hurry home from school to play with other kids. I loved it, and after some time, I became a good player. My family knew I often got excited about new hobbies and then stopped them, so they thought I would do the same with football. But I didn’t. I even dreamed of playing football professionally when I grew up. 

The chance came sooner than I expected. I played in local tournaments, and one referee saw that I was a talented player. He asked the manager of a professional women’s club to watch me play. After that, she invited me to join her club. I was surprised because I didn’t know young girls could join women’s clubs. But the manager liked my skills, and I started training regularly with a big club when I was just 13 years old. I improved a lot after that. 

Even so, some people were not sure I would become a star player, which made me a little sad. But my coach told me to be myself and believe in myself. He even let me play in one of the club’s championship matches earlier than I thought I would! I ran harder than ever because I didn’t want to let my teammates down. Luckily, I scored the winning goal! Even with a big crowd, I could hear my coach cheering for me, and after the match, my team carried me around the field. It was amazing! 

Since then, I have scored many more winning goals! Next month, my coach and I are organizing a football tournament in my area. The goal is to get teenagers interested in football and to let them meet other players from my club. It will show them what it is like to be in a professional environment and encourage them to think they could play for a top team if they work hard. My advice to them will be the same as my coach gave me – there will be good times, but also some bad times. I have been lucky and had very few bad times!"
79,"One interesting change in education in the UK and around the world in recent years is that schools and universities want new students to start doing research as soon as they begin their studies. This shows that research is not just for famous scholars or scientists, but is a natural way to build knowledge and skills. Research skills are important not only for studying but also for jobs, as they help us think about the world and how to do our work.

As a student, you contribute to knowledge. You do not just learn and repeat what others say; you create new ideas. Making knowledge involves asking questions instead of just accepting things. You might wonder: Why? How? When? What does this mean? What if things were different? These questions are at the heart of research.

Research can be seen in two ways. On one side, there is complex and groundbreaking research done by highly trained experts. On the other side, there is everyday research that involves asking thoughtful questions and making practical suggestions. Most students have done some form of research before. You have likely asked questions and looked for answers in school or at work since you started studying. You have also developed research skills when planning a holiday, growing plants, fixing things at home, training your dog, or shopping online.

In college and higher education, you are expected to ask questions, explore information critically, and create your own ideas. Some students may find this difficult because, in some cultures, knowledge is seen as fixed, and students are expected to listen to teachers and texts without questioning them. However, in many places like the UK, US, Europe, and Australia, it is important to question established knowledge and those who claim to be experts.

This process of questioning and creating knowledge can feel challenging. Critical thinking is very important in research. The research done by others can help us as students and in our future jobs, but we need to think about it carefully. We should not just accept everything we read as true. Instead, we should engage with the information, test it, and check if it makes sense and is supported by evidence. We must be careful not to rely blindly on facts and information given to us by others."
80,"Cities have always been important places for ideas and creativity. In the past, people met in coffee houses in London to talk about science and politics. In modern Paris, artist Pablo Picasso discussed art in cafés. However, living in a city can be difficult. The same cafés that encouraged discussions also helped spread diseases like cholera, and Picasso eventually moved to the countryside. 

Today, cities are full of creativity, but they can also feel overwhelming. Scientists are studying how city life affects our brains, and their findings are surprising. While we have known that city life can be tiring, new research shows that living in a city can actually make it harder for us to think clearly. One big reason for this is the lack of nature in cities. Studies show that hospital patients heal faster when they can see trees from their windows. Even small views of nature can help our brains relax and improve our thinking.

For the first time in history, more people live in cities than in rural areas. Instead of having open spaces, we are packed into busy cities with many strangers. This crowded environment can affect our mental and physical health and change how we think. When we walk down a busy street, our brains have to pay attention to many things: people, traffic, and confusing street layouts. These small tasks can tire us out because cities have so many distractions that we must constantly focus on what to ignore. 

The brain is like a powerful computer, but paying attention uses a lot of its energy. In nature, we don’t have to think as hard. This idea is called attention restoration theory, created by psychologist Stephen Kaplan. He believed that being in nature helps our brains recover. Natural places have things that catch our attention without causing stress, unlike loud noises like police sirens. This allows our minds to relax and recharge.

Long before scientists studied this, philosophers and landscape designers warned about the negative effects of city life and looked for ways to bring nature into cities. Parks, like Central Park in New York, give people a break from city life. A well-designed park can help our brains feel better in just a few minutes. While people have tried many ways to improve brain function, like energy drinks or changing office designs, nothing is as effective as simply walking in nature.

Despite the mental challenges of city life, cities continue to grow. Research shows that the same crowded features that can make it hard to focus also lead to more creativity. The close social interactions in cities help spark new ideas. Just like the crowded streets of 18th-century London led to new thoughts, the busy environment of modern cities can also encourage innovation. 

The challenge is to find ways to reduce the stress of city living while keeping its benefits. As the saying goes, there will always be times when people feel tired of nature and want to be in the city."
81,"**Where Should We Look for the Mind?**

This question might seem strange: we usually think that thinking happens inside our heads. Today, we have advanced machines that can show us brain activity. However, I believe we should not limit the study of the mind to just the brain or the body. There is a lot of evidence from history that shows objects, as well as our brains, are important for how we think. 

For example, tools, jewelry, carvings, and writing have all played a role in human development and how we think. So, what is outside our heads might also be part of our minds. It is easy to connect the mind with the brain because most research has focused on people without considering the objects around them. This makes sense for scientists who study the brain, but it often ignores how much of our thinking involves the world around us.

I do not want to say that the brain is not important, but I want to show that the mind is more than just the brain. We should explore the idea that human intelligence goes beyond our bodies and includes culture and objects. This is where my new idea, called Material Engagement Theory (MET), comes in. 

MET looks at how objects can help us think. For example, when we make numbers from clay or use a stone to create a tool, these actions show how objects can extend our thinking. MET also studies how these interactions have changed over time and what that means for our thinking. 

Consider a blind person using a stick. Where does this person’s self begin? The connection between the blind person and the stick shows how our minds and the things we use are connected. The stick helps the blind person feel and understand their surroundings, and the brain treats the stick as part of the body. 

This example reminds us that human intelligence can change and adapt by using new tools. I see the human mind as always changing and developing. No matter what form our tools have taken throughout history, their main purpose is to help us explore and understand the world. 

For humans, tools are not just for survival; they help us learn and satisfy our curiosity. This special ability to engage with objects is why humans create things more than any other species, and these creations shape our minds. I call this idea metaplasticity, which means our minds can change and grow as we interact with the world around us.

I want to emphasize the importance of objects in understanding the mind. MET provides a new way to see how different tools, from ancient stone tools to modern smartphones, have helped define and change who we are and how we think. While the idea of technology changing our minds may sound futuristic, humans have been using tools to change their thinking since the beginning of our existence."
82,"Text: ""Few inventions have changed our lives as much as photography. This is especially true in the United States, where photography quickly became part of everyday life. It was used in many areas, including science, industry, and art, and it also created new forms of entertainment. Historians believe that photography is one of the greatest contributions of the US to the visual arts. This is a big statement, but it shows how important photography has become in American culture. To understand its impact, we need to look at its beginnings in the mid-19th century.

Why was photography so popular? First, photography was a mechanical process, which matched the growing interest in technology. People were excited about new inventions like steam power and railroads, which made communication and travel easier. Photography brought images of the world into people's homes in a way that was amazing. 

Second, the camera became a popular tool for people to show their identity. It allowed individuals to create images of themselves and their families, helping to shape personal and national identities. Third, photographs helped families keep a record of their lives, even if those images were sometimes idealized. Finally, the realistic nature of photographs matched the trend in American art towards showing everyday life.

Every photograph draws attention to something specific, showing what the photographer wants us to see. Because photographs are made by machines, they are records of real events, people, and things. However, each photograph also reflects the photographer's personal view. When we see a photograph, we might think we understand it because we recognize the subject, which is why photography is often called a ""universal language."" But the meaning of a photograph is more complicated than that. 

No image speaks for itself; it always comes with some context that helps us understand it, like a caption in a newspaper or its placement in a gallery. To understand a photograph's history, we need to consider why the photographer took it and how people first saw it. The same image can have different meanings depending on where and when it is viewed.

For a long time, the importance of the camera to artists was not well known, but today it is clear. In recent decades, artists like Andy Warhol have used photographs in their work in many ways. In summary, photography has become an important part of art, working alongside painting and shaping how we represent the world."""
83,"In 1890, William James, an American philosopher and doctor, defined psychology as the ""science of mental life."" This definition is still useful today. We all have a mental life, which means we have some understanding of our thoughts and feelings. Psychology can be studied in humans, rats, and monkeys, but it can be hard to understand completely. 

James focused on human psychology, which he believed had basic elements: thoughts, feelings, the physical world, and a way to know about these things. Our knowledge is mostly personal and comes from our own experiences. This means we often make judgments about psychological issues based on our own understanding. For example, we might have opinions about why someone feels unhappy or why they quit their job. 

However, problems can happen when two people see things differently. Formal psychology tries to find methods to decide which explanations are most likely correct in different situations. Psychologists help us tell the difference between our personal thoughts, which can be biased, and scientific facts. 

Psychology studies the mind and brain, but psychologists do not yet fully understand how the brain works. They often study behavior instead and use their observations to make educated guesses about what is happening inside us. This is challenging because the mind cannot be seen directly, unlike a machine. We can only understand it through behavior, which is like solving a crossword puzzle. 

Psychologists must carefully observe and measure behavior, analyze it scientifically, and use logical arguments. Psychology often involves complex interactions, and understanding these requires advanced techniques and theories. Like other sciences, psychology aims to describe, understand, predict, and learn how to change the processes it studies. 

Psychological research has helped in many areas, such as improving teaching methods, designing safer machines, and helping people express their feelings better. Although people have discussed psychological questions for a long time, scientific investigation has only happened in the last 150 years. Early psychologists used introspection, which means looking at one’s own thoughts and feelings, to find answers. While this is still interesting, it has limitations. 

William James compared trying to understand the mind through introspection to turning up the gas to see how darkness looks. Today, psychologists prefer to base their theories on careful observations of others' behavior rather than just their own experiences."
84,"In a storehouse in a regular business park in Michigan, USA, there is a place that shows the failures of consumer products. This place is informally called the Museum of Failed Products. It has items that were taken off the market because very few people wanted to buy them. The museum is owned by a company called GfK, and its owner, Carol Sherry, believes that each product has a sad story about the people who tried to sell it.

What is surprising is that this museum exists as a business. You might think that companies would keep their own failed products, but many do not. Each week, business leaders visit the museum, showing how rare it is for companies to keep samples of their failures. The museum started by accident. Robert McMath, a former marketing worker, wanted to create a library of consumer products, not just failed ones. He began collecting every new item he could find in the 1960s. He did not realize that most products fail. Because he collected so many new products, most of them turned out to be unsuccessful.

Today’s positive culture may be a reason for the products in the museum. Each product likely went through meetings where no one noticed it would fail. Even if they did, marketers might spend more money on a bad product to try to make it sell, instead of figuring out what went wrong. This focus on being positive is also common in the self-help industry. One popular idea is ""positive visualization,"" which suggests that if you imagine good outcomes, they are more likely to happen. Research by neuroscientist Tali Sharot shows that our minds may be naturally inclined to see things positively, which can help us survive. However, people who are well-balanced may not have a clear view of their true abilities compared to those who are depressed.

Psychologist Gabriele Oettingen and her team have studied how effective positive thinking is. They found that spending time imagining how well things could go can actually lower people's motivation to reach their goals. For example, people who thought about having a great week at work ended up achieving less.

Another psychologist, Carol Dweck, believes that how we view failure is connected to our beliefs about ability. People with a ""fixed mindset"" think that ability is something you are born with. They find failure very scary because it shows they did not meet expectations. For example, a sports star who thinks he is naturally talented may not practice enough and then fail. On the other hand, people with a ""growth mindset"" see failure as a chance to learn and improve. Dweck compares this to weight training: muscles grow stronger when they are pushed to their limits. Having a growth mindset is not only a better way to succeed but also a happier way to live."
85,"Text: 

Everyone knows that sports teams have an advantage when they play at home. But why is that? Many people think they know the answer, but professional sports are changing quickly, and what we used to believe is now being questioned. Two main reasons for this are science and money. Sports scientists want to understand what helps players perform their best, and they have many ideas about home advantage. At the same time, people who invest money in sports want to know why home advantage is still important. If players are paid well, shouldn’t they feel comfortable playing anywhere?

What about the fans? Would it matter if a team like Manchester United played some of their home games far away, like in the Far East, to reach more fans? It would matter to British fans who believe their team needs their support and loyalty. Fans often think that the order of events explains what happens. For example, when a team plays well, the home fans cheer loudly, and sometimes this leads to a goal. Fans remember the times they cheered and a goal was scored, but they forget the many times when their cheering did not lead to a goal.

There is one idea that fans believe, which is supported by scientific evidence. Home fans not only cheer for their team but also direct a lot of their noise at the referee. In a famous experiment, referees watched a match with crowd noise and another group watched it in silence. The referees who heard the crowd were less likely to call fouls against the home team. This shows that referees try to avoid extra stress from the crowd's reactions.

Recent studies show that home advantage has decreased in many sports, but not as much as expected. For example, in the early years of the Football League in England, home teams won about 70% of the points, while today they win about 60%. One reason for this change is travel. In the past, traveling was difficult, but now players travel in comfort. Stadiums also look more similar and less unique than before.

Despite these changes, the reason for home advantage still varies by sport. Basketball has the most home advantage, followed by football, while baseball has the least. This might be because baseball focuses more on individual players rather than teamwork. In team sports like basketball, players need to work together, and playing at home helps build their confidence.

Another interesting point is about players' testosterone levels. Researchers found that players have normal testosterone levels before away games, but their levels can be 67% higher before home games. This increase might be linked to a natural desire to protect their home ground. In recent Rugby World Cup games, underdog teams won at home by showing determination and strength, which are signs of home advantage. As one referee said, ""It’s the law of the jungle out there."""
86,"Text: ""‘The more I practice, the luckier I get,’ said golfer Gary Player many years ago. This saying is famous in sports and is important for many athletes and their coaches. It is easy to understand why. First, many people argue about who really said it first, as other golfers from that time are also mentioned. Second, the meaning of the quote is not clear. Player did not mean luck in a real way; he was being ironic. His real message was: ‘The more I practice, the better I get.’ 

However, there is a limit to this idea. The question of where that limit is, or if it even exists, is part of a big discussion about whether talent is something we are born with or something we learn. This discussion is not balanced; it seems that practice is more important than natural talent. This idea comes from psychologist Anders Ericsson, who said that anyone can become an expert in any field with 10,000 hours of practice. His theory has inspired many popular books, like Malcolm Gladwell’s Outliers, and others like Talent Is Overrated and Bounce: The Myth of Talent and the Power of Practice. These books generally agree that practice is the most important factor, and they suggest that ‘10,000 hours is enough to make anyone an expert in anything.’

But, as Epstein explains in his interesting book, this is not always true. He points out a big problem in studies about what makes people excellent: they often only look at successful people. He asks if there are other ways to understand why some people have certain abilities while others do not, and how to separate what is natural talent from what comes from environment, support, opportunity, and hard work. 

Epstein travels around the world, from Kenya to Sweden, and from the Caribbean to the Arctic, to find answers. In Alaska, he learns that the drive and desire of sled dogs in a tough race might be important, suggesting that both genes and learned traits play a role. Some people think that commitment and determination are choices we make. But what if, like the huskies, a person’s drive is also influenced by their genes? This shows how complex the topic is. 

Epstein talks about the difference between ‘hardware’ (nature) and ‘software’ (nurture), and he believes that both are important for elite athletes. He does not ignore the importance of training or environment. For example, he thinks that if Usain Bolt had grown up in the US, he might have been a good basketball player instead of the fastest man in history. But he also looks at cases where genes are very important. He discusses race and gender too. He asks: ‘If only practice matters, why do we separate men and women in sports competitions?’ Sometimes, the best questions are the most obvious."""
87,"A recent international report shows that many children in rich countries feel lonely and unhappy. Jay Griffiths asks a simple question: why are today’s children so sad? In her new book, Kith, Griffiths explains that these children spend too much time indoors, looking at screens like TVs and computers, and they have lost touch with nature, like forests, mountains, and rivers. She believes this is a big part of the problem.

A follow-up study talked to some children to understand their feelings better. The children did not say they wanted more high-tech toys; many said they would be happier if they could go outside more. Older people often remember their own childhoods fondly, saying they enjoyed playing outside, swimming in ponds, and exploring. They think this was much better and healthier than the lives of children today. However, they often forget that they are the ones who have made their children stay indoors for safety reasons.

Griffiths’ book has many strong arguments. She discusses how parents’ fears about dangers outside make them keep their children at home, which helps the toy and gadget industry sell more products to keep kids entertained. She also talks about strange rules, like giving medicine to children who can’t sit still or making them wear goggles for playground games. It’s unclear how common these rules are, but Griffiths expresses her anger about them in a powerful way.

While her ideas are interesting, Griffiths sometimes goes too far. She makes some extreme comparisons, saying that how we treat children today is like a form of racism, which seems excessive. She has a very romantic view of children, often ignoring their more difficult behaviors. For example, she says that “children are the musicians of thought,” which might be true if they had the chance to be creative, but it’s not always the case.

One important idea in the book is that children should be allowed to explore and take risks. Griffiths believes that children need to experience small accidents to learn how to avoid bigger ones later. However, she does not explain how to create these small accidents safely. Also, not all children want to explore the wild; some are shy or prefer to stay at home. Perhaps the real issue is that we try to make all children fit into the same mold, whether we keep them inside or push them outside."
88,"I am a bio-psychologist with a PhD, which means I have studied a lot. I am good at solving problems in my work and in life, but this skill does not come only from school. Many problems in life cannot be solved with complicated formulas or answers we learn in school. They need judgment, wisdom, and creativity that come from life experiences. For children, these experiences happen through play. 

My recent research focuses on how important play is for children's development. All mammals, including humans, play when they are young. Those who have more to learn tend to play more. For example, carnivores (meat-eaters) play more than herbivores (plant-eaters) because hunting is harder to learn than grazing. Primates, like monkeys and apes, play more than other mammals because they need to learn more and rely less on instincts. Children, who have a lot to learn, play more than any other young primates when they are allowed to.

Play is a natural way for both adults and mammals to learn. The most important skills children need to live happy and productive lives cannot be taught in school. These skills are learned and practiced through play. They include thinking creatively, getting along with others, cooperating, and controlling their emotions. Creativity is very important for success in today’s world. We do not need people who just follow instructions or do simple calculations. We need people who can ask new questions and solve new problems. If we can help people think ahead and find solutions, we will have a strong workforce. 

However, we cannot teach creativity directly. School can sometimes take away creativity by focusing on fixed questions and answers. It is also very important for children to learn how to get along with others, care for them, and cooperate. Children naturally want to play with each other, and through play, they learn social skills and fairness, which they will need later in life. 

Play is voluntary, which means players can choose to stop whenever they want. If they cannot stop, it is not really play. Players know they must keep each other happy to continue the game. This freedom makes play a very democratic activity. 

Unfortunately, school has become more difficult. There are fewer breaks, more homework, and more pressure for high grades. Outside of school, organized sports have taken the place of free play. “Play dates” with adults supervising have replaced unsupervised play in neighborhoods. Adults often feel they need to step in instead of letting children solve their own problems. 

These changes have happened slowly but have had a big impact. They are caused by many social factors, like parents’ fears, warnings from experts about dangers, and the belief that children learn more from adults than from each other. 

Our children do not need more school; they need more play. If we care about our children and future generations, we must change the trend that has been happening for the last fifty years. We need to give childhood back to children. They should be allowed to play and explore so they can grow into strong adults ready for an unpredictable future."
89,"In many countries, more young people in their twenties are using social media to find jobs. Websites like Twitter and LinkedIn allow them to connect directly with potential employers. This is different from the old way of trying to get noticed by standing outside an office with a sign saying ""hire me."" However, using social media can also lead to mistakes.

For example, a young job seeker in the US tried to connect with a senior marketing executive on LinkedIn. This executive had many important contacts, and the job seeker thought she could help him. But the executive was upset by his request. She felt it was wrong to share her contacts with someone she didn’t know. She rejected his request and sent a very rude message that many people saw online. Those who read her message were shocked, and she might regret how she wrote it. However, if this incident makes young people think more carefully about using social media for work, it could actually help them.

Social media can be risky for job seekers who do not know how to use it properly. Many young people are making mistakes. It is ironic because social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter have been a big part of young people's social lives for years. When older generations were teenagers, social media was a way to escape from parents and teachers. It was a place to show off and be creative. You could have long conversations online and then ignore those people in real life. You could change how you looked to others by choosing different pictures or songs for your profile.

However, using social media for professional reasons is very different. Some young people do not see this difference. They learned to be bold and confident online, which might explain why they still act this way. Just because many people liked your posts on Facebook does not mean you can impress employers on LinkedIn. Young people need to understand that the rules of social networking have changed, and they must meet employers' expectations to succeed in their careers.

One common complaint from employers is that young job seekers are too casual in their messages and seem arrogant. This makes older generations think young people feel entitled. In reality, many young people are struggling to find jobs, which is why they are using social media. This impression of arrogance can hurt their chances, even if they have the skills and motivation to be good employees.

So, how should you contact someone on a professional networking site? First, clearly explain who you are and what you can offer them, like helping with research. This way, you have a better chance of getting a helpful response. Avoid sending generic messages, and keep your tone polite to make a good impression. Remember, social media can help you make important connections, but you need to use it carefully to avoid being ignored."
90,"Text: ""Anyone who says they can predict the future of newspapers is either lying or not thinking clearly. The numbers show that newspapers are in trouble. Since 2000, the number of people reading most UK national newspapers has dropped by about one-third to one-half. In the USA, the Pew Research Centre says that only 26 percent of people get their news from newspapers now, down from 45 percent in 2001. Many people believe that printed newspapers will disappear within 15 years. However, history shows that old forms of media often survive. 

For example, in 1835, a journalist in New York said that books and theater were finished and that newspapers would be the most important source of news. But theater survived, even with the rise of newspapers, cinema, and television. Radio is still popular even with TV around, and cinema has continued to do well against videos and DVDs. Even vinyl records have become popular again, with online sales increasing by 745 percent since 2008.

Newspapers were once a new form of media too, but it took a long time for them to become the main source of news. This happened because it became possible and affordable to share news quickly with many people in the mid-19th century, thanks to inventions like the steam press, railways, and the telegraph. People also started to believe that everything around them was always changing, and they wanted to be updated regularly. In medieval times, people thought life was mostly about the seasons and big disasters like famine or disease, which they could not predict.

Before the 19th century, journalism was not a full-time job that could support someone. Even then, most people did not see the need for news every day or week. The regular publication of newspapers can feel limiting. Today, online news allows people to read when they want and focus on what interests them. Advanced search engines help us find news that matters to us. When big news happens, online sources can provide updates every minute. Mistakes can be fixed quickly, and we can often read full documents related to news stories. This is very different from the limits of newspapers.

However, many news providers do not seem to use the internet's ability to help people understand the news better. Instead, they often rush to be the first to report news, which can create confusion. In medieval times, news was shared in busy places like markets or taverns, where truth mixed with rumors and misunderstandings. In some ways, we seem to be going back to that time.

Newspapers have not always done a great job of explaining how the world works. They might be facing extinction. Or maybe, as the internet adds to our feeling that we live in a chaotic world, newspapers will find a way to help us understand and gain wisdom."""
91,"Text: 

If humans really felt at home under the moon and stars, we would walk happily in the dark, just like many animals that are active at night. But we are daytime creatures, with eyes that are made for seeing in sunlight. This fact is part of our nature, even if we don’t think about it. It helps explain what we have done to the night. We have changed the night by adding a lot of artificial light. This control is similar to building a dam on a river. While there are benefits to this, it also creates problems, known as light pollution, which scientists are just starting to study.

Light pollution happens mostly because of poor lighting design. This means that artificial light shines in the wrong directions, going up into the sky instead of down where it is needed. Bad lighting brightens the night and changes the natural light levels that many living things, including us, have adapted to. When man-made light spreads into nature, it affects important life activities like migration, reproduction, and feeding.

For most of human history, the term ‘light pollution’ would not have made sense. Imagine walking towards London on a moonlit night around 1800, when it was the largest city in the world. Almost a million people lived there, using candles, torches, and lanterns for light. Only a few homes had gas lights, and there were no public gas lights in the streets for another seven years. From a distance, you would have smelled London more than you would have seen its faint glow.

We have brightened the night as if it were empty, but that is not true. There are many nocturnal animals. Light is a strong force in nature, and it attracts many species. Scientists say that some birds, like songbirds and seabirds, can be ‘captured’ by bright lights, flying in circles until they fall. Birds that migrate at night often crash into tall buildings that are brightly lit, and young birds are especially affected. Some birds, like blackbirds and nightingales, sing at strange times because of artificial light.

At first, it was thought that light pollution only bothered astronomers, who need to see the night sky clearly. Most of us may not need to see the stars for our work, but we still need darkness. We cannot ignore darkness; it is just as important for our health as light is. Changing our natural sleep and wake cycles can cause health problems. The regular pattern of waking and sleeping is a natural response to the light and dark cycles on Earth. These patterns are so important that changing them is like changing our balance.

In the end, humans are just as affected by light pollution as frogs living near a bright highway. By living in our own bright lights, we have lost touch with our natural and cultural history – the light of the stars and the natural rhythms of day and night. Light pollution makes us forget our true place in the universe and the beauty of a dark night with the Milky Way shining above us."
92,"The founder of a large international company recently said that his business will no longer keep track of how much paid holiday time employees take. This idea seems to come from a smaller internet company that has a similar policy. The founder mentioned that he got the idea from a happy email from his daughter, which many newspapers shared. However, some people think this way of announcing the change is just a way to make a difficult decision seem nicer.

The two companies are very different. The internet company has 2,000 employees and offers one service, while the multinational corporation has 50,000 employees and many different services, like finance, transport, and healthcare. The idea of ""take as much time off as you want"" might work better in a smaller company where employees know each other’s work schedules. In a big company, it is harder to know if taking time off will hurt the business.

The founder said employees can take as much leave as they want, as long as they feel sure that their work and their team are up to date. But is it really possible to be that sure? No matter how much work you finish before a holiday, there will always be more work waiting for you when you return. This can make employees feel guilty about taking time off, which can lead to stress. If workers feel guilty, they might not take enough leave, which can lower their productivity over time.

There can also be pressure from coworkers about who is taking time off and for how long. In many companies, especially in corporate jobs, there is a culture of working late. This can create a situation where employees feel they cannot take holidays, especially if they want to get promoted. If workers feel they cannot take their legal holiday time, they might feel lazy for wanting to rest.

The new policy could make employees feel stuck, as they might not take their entitled leave. They might still use their legal rights as a guide, making the new policy useless. Modern technology allows workers to receive messages about work anytime and anywhere, which makes it hard to separate work time from free time.

The internet company started its unlimited leave policy because employees wanted to know how to balance their work with the old holiday rules. If the company cannot track how much time employees work, why should it have different rules for time off? However, having no set working hours can mean that employees feel they are always working. This can lead to stress and unhealthy habits.

Employment laws exist to protect workers. They are entitled to a minimum amount of paid holiday because rest is important for their health. While the company hopes that unlimited leave will improve morale and productivity, I am not sure that allowing employees to take as much holiday as they want is the best solution."
93,"**Simplified Text:**

Journal-based peer review is the process where experts check a scientific research paper before it is published. This process is seen as a way to ensure the quality of research. It is supposed to stop bad or silly papers from being published. However, reviewing a paper can take a long time, sometimes up to a year. Is this delay worth it to make sure the research is trustworthy? The answer is both yes and no. 

I still believe in journal-based peer review, but I see changes happening. More researchers are using preprints, which are drafts of papers shared online before they are reviewed. Preprints help researchers share new findings quickly so others can read and discuss them. Publishing in journals has become more about gaining fame and advancing careers, which can change the reasons why authors write and why reviewers check papers.

Competition for spots in well-known journals pushes scientists to do their best work, and these journals do publish great research. But the rewards for publishing in top journals can lead to shortcuts, where important data is left out. Reviewers often focus on whether a paper is good enough for a specific journal rather than if it is good overall. For top journals, this can depend on how interesting or newsworthy the paper is, not just its scientific quality.

Many people know about these problems, but not enough are willing to change the current system. However, some scientists, like Ron Vale, believe that preprints could help solve these issues without changing everything. Even though preprint archives have been around for twenty years, not all researchers use them. This slow acceptance is partly because many scientists think journals will not accept papers that have been shared as preprints. There is also a worry that publishing papers without peer review could lead to bad science, but this has not happened yet.

Preprints may not be peer-reviewed, but authors know that their work will be open to feedback from a global community of reviewers. For example, Tanya Elks, a psychology professor, shared her paper as a preprint. This allowed the original authors of a paper she critiqued to respond, and all comments were public. This way, readers can judge the quality of the arguments. If a paper is rejected by a journal, the authors still have their preprint and the comments, so their work is not wasted.

Preprint archives allow scientists to have informal discussions that used to happen only between individuals. They can also be a good place to share negative results, which are important but often ignored by journals that focus only on new discoveries. Additionally, papers on preprint archives are read and cited more often, showing that sharing research this way is effective. By using the internet's openness and the collaborative spirit of the scientific community, preprints can help shift the focus back to the research itself, rather than where it is published."
94,"When I ask my literature students what a poem is, they often say things like ""a painting in words."" Their answers usually do not satisfy me or them. One day, I asked a group of students to pick an object and write two paragraphs about it. One paragraph was to describe the object like a scientist would, and the other was to be from the object's point of view, titled ""Poem."" One student wrote: 

""Poem: I may look strange or scary, but I am a device that helps people breathe. I am only used in emergencies and for a short time. Most people will never need to use me."" 

The object was an oxygen mask. This unusual choice helped the class understand how poetry works in a unique way. The exercise was fun and led to good discussions. 

When I was in school, I found poetry confusing. I thought every poem was a silly puzzle that made it hard to understand feelings. After school, most people pay less attention to poetry. Sometimes, you see a poem, and it stands out because it is not like regular writing. It challenges you to read it, but often you feel let down by its simplicity or because you don’t understand it at first. Still, you feel good for trying. 

What do we want to find in poems? We might expect deep feelings, beautiful images, or clever humor. The answer seems to be yes. But if we want tears, we watch movies; for information, we read articles. Novels take us to different worlds, paintings are nice to look at, and music is hard to beat with its mix of words and sounds. 

However, one thing poems can do is show us ambiguity, which is common in everyday life. But this does not really explain what a poem is. If you look up ""poem"" online, it leads you to ""poetry,"" which is described as a type of literary art that uses the beauty and rhythm of language. This is a fancy way of saying it, but it misses the word's origins. ""Poem"" comes from the Greek word ""poí?ma,"" meaning ""a thing made,"" and a poet is someone who makes things. 

So, if a poem is a thing made, what kind of thing is it? Some poets compare poems to wild animals that cannot be controlled or to machines that are precise, depending on how they see it. But these comparisons can break down when you think about them closely. The best part of trying to define a poem through comparison is the discussion it creates. Whether you see a poem as a machine or a wild animal, this can change how you think about both. It can help you see ordinary things in a new way. 

Thinking of a poem as a mental object is not hard, especially since song lyrics can easily get stuck in our heads. The mix of words and music has a strong effect, just like schoolyard rhymes. But can words sometimes hurt us? Think about a poem in a newspaper or magazine, looking right at you. A poem can touch you like nothing else, even though it is just ink on paper, like the prose around it. 

What about the empty space around the poem? This space could have been used for a longer article or an ad. A poem is written and rewritten like any article or story, but it is not usually made to be sold. Publishers send out press releases and review copies of poetry books, but few expect them to make money. A poem is not just a product; it exists for its own sake. Because of its special place in a magazine or book, a poem can still surprise us, even if just for a moment."
95,"I bought my first metal detector soon after I got married. £70 was a lot of money back then, and I could have spent it on something useful for our home. However, my wife, Marion, was very impressed when I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first trip. Over the years, every brooch and coin I found made me happy. I liked feeling connected to the past. But after the gold ring, it took 40 years before I found something that impressed Marion again.

One dull February afternoon, I had a couple of hours free and a place in mind to search. It was raining, so I chose a closer spot where I knew there were old farming tools. When my detector beeped for the first time, I found a piece of a metal wheel. Then it beeped again. I tried to ignore it, but I had to check. I dug down half a meter and lay in the mud when I saw a round, golden ball. I had found brass curtain rails before, so I tried not to get my hopes up. But as I cleaned it, I saw it was a beautiful, thick loop with patterns. I stopped and stared, remembering to breathe. I had seen something like this before - the Great Torc, which is in the British Museum. It is a famous piece from Iron Age Britain, over 2,000 years ago. A torc is a beautiful necklace made of gold and silver, with gold rings on each end.

I took it to my car and looked at it on the way home. I rinsed it in my kitchen sink, probably the first clean it had in a long time. “Marion!” I shouted, “I have something for you.” When she came in, she stopped and asked, “What is it?” I told her it was a very old and rare piece of jewelry. We didn’t try it on because we didn’t want to damage it. At bedtime, I hid it in our wardrobe. I was worried about it being stolen, so I eventually took it out, unscrewed a floorboard in my office, and hid it there.

The law says I must report such finds to the authorities within 14 days. I wanted to enjoy the torc as much as I could before giving it up. I even took it in a plastic bag to show a friend in the hospital. Finally, I took it to the council office in the same bag. The registrar was talking to someone when I placed the torc on his desk. He turned around, stopped talking, and looked at it. The torc was confirmed as real and was sold to my local council. It is now in the British Museum in London. I received £350,000, which was shared between the owner of the field and me. 

But the torc is more than just a lucky find. It is something I have saved for the nation. People ask me, “Now that you found something so amazing, will you stop detecting?” But I still find brooches and coins interesting. Besides, if a fisherman catches a big fish, he doesn’t stop fishing, especially if there is a chance to catch a bigger one tomorrow."
96,"Sleeping is one of my favorite things about traveling, but I don’t talk about it much because I feel a bit guilty. When my friends share their carefully planned trips with lots of activities like visiting museums and hiking, I just smile and don’t say much. What would they think if they knew that my travel plans include time for naps during afternoon rainstorms and lazy mornings in nice hotel beds? Sleeping better is one of the nice surprises of traveling. 

When I went to Mexico's Yucatán coast in my early 20s, I was surprised by how many hours I slept—more than 12 hours most days. There were many loud birds nearby, but it didn’t bother me. Far from home, with new smells and sounds, I could sleep deeply and enjoyably. Without alarm clocks and responsibilities, it was easier to sleep. 

I believe that sleep is part of our travel experience, not just a break from it. When we travel, we see, hear, and smell new things. All these new experiences fill our minds, and when we sleep, we process them. This is why sleep feels so different when we are traveling. 

People often worry about jet lag, but I think the challenges I face after long trips are more about adjusting to new places and cultures than just time changes. For example, on the Caribbean island of Trinidad, people wake up very early to avoid the heat, slow down around 10 a.m. when the sun is strong, and then become active again in the cool evening. Even though Trinidad is only one hour ahead of New York, it takes me days to get used to their different sleep patterns. When I finally adjust, I feel like I have truly arrived.

I remember one afternoon in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic, when I had a big lunch with new friends in an apartment with a view of the blue Caribbean Sea. After eating, we all felt sleepy, and one by one, my friends went to relax on hammocks and sofas. I understood then why they had so many pillows on the floor. I joined them and took a nap. I had heard about the Latin American tradition of the siesta, but that day I really experienced it. I shared not just sleep, but a part of Dominican life.

Travel sleep has another great quality: I remember it. Being away from home, I enjoy the new smells, textures, and sounds that fill my mind while I sleep. If enjoying every moment of travel is what makes a modern traveler aware, then sleeping is one of the slowest things we can do. Maybe I should stop feeling embarrassed about my love for sleep and tell my ambitious friends that travel sleep is an important part of the experience too."
97,"The woman turned away from the mirror. “What do you think? Be honest,” she asked. Mia picked up a medium-sized hat that was soft and had a pretty layer of gauze and a silk bow. “I still think this one looks best on you,” she said politely. The woman wrinkled her nose and made a funny face, looking a bit like a bulldog. “But it is so boring,” she said. “Every other woman will wear a hat like that at my daughter’s wedding. This little beauty will make me stand out.” She sighed and touched the red and black mini top hat on her head. “Yes,” she said firmly, “this is the one I want.” 

Mia knew she couldn’t change the woman’s mind. With a smile, she agreed that the woman would stand out at the wedding. Mia thought about her own daughter, Jen. It was Jen’s thirtieth birthday today, and they were having a family gathering. It had been a while since everyone was together, and Mia was excited to see Jen, Dan, and Luke. She was also looking forward to meeting Jen’s friend, Tattie, who they didn’t know much about. When Jen called last week to ask if she could bring Tattie, Mia’s husband, Jeff, had quickly reacted. “Tattie? What kind of name is that?” he asked. “It’s short for Tatiana,” Mia replied. “I think it’s nice.” “More like something very strange,” Jeff said. He didn’t like anything fancy or showy. He also didn’t understand Mia’s way of being polite. He would have told the woman in the shop that she was choosing the wrong hat and that a dustbin lid would look better on her. “The trouble with you, Mia,” he often said, “is that you’re too polite for your own good.”

An hour later, Mia closed her shop and entered Medlar House through the back door. It took her only forty seconds to get home from work. Four years ago, when Luke, their youngest child, left home, Mia decided to turn the unused barn next to their house into a bright space for her business. Jeff was doubtful. “Do you really think people want to buy hats?” he asked. But Mia knew from her friends that many women had trouble finding the perfect hat for special occasions. She was right. From the first day, after Jen helped her create a website, Mia’s Hats became a success. Women came from far away to her shop in Little Pelham, where she made them feel welcome and allowed them to try on as many hats as they wanted. She encouraged her customers to bring their outfits so they could find the perfect match. Recently, she also started selling handbags and costume jewelry."
98,"It’s a long way from London to Atlanta, and at his new home in America, Lawrence Okoye thinks about his amazing sports journey. He is very confident but is also surprised by how far he has come, from competing in the Olympic discus final to possibly changing sports again. Even though he has never played American football before, Lawrence is likely to be chosen for one of the big teams in the USA.

In Atlanta, Lawrence is still learning about his new position in football. It is surprising that a 21-year-old who has never played before might be selected for one of the biggest teams in American sports. But Lawrence is good at proving people wrong. He was offered a place at Oxford University to study law, but he decided to focus on training for the discus instead, after playing rugby before. In just 20 months of training, he became the fourth-best discus thrower in the world.

Lawrence originally went to Atlanta for warm-weather training for the discus, preparing for the world championships. When asked about his sudden interest in American football, he said, “Yeah, it was in the back of my mind, but I only decided to try it when I got to the USA.” He had thought about it while in school in London, but it seemed like a crazy idea then. After arriving in America, he learned about the NFL trials in Atlanta. Even though he had never played football, he thought he could be good enough to attend the trials. “Pretty much,” he said simply. He applied online.

Was he nervous about competing with experienced football players? “No, not at all. I don’t get nervous for many things,” he replied. He doesn’t talk a lot, but he is sure of his abilities. His performance in tests showed that he was the most impressive player. “I was very happy to hear that,” he said, showing a rare smile of pride.

However, he is also cautious. He has no experience in football. How can he make it into an NFL team? “The coaches say I have all the qualities needed. It’s just about how hard I work,” he answered. Will he be calm while waiting to hear if he has been selected? “I will be. There’s no pressure on me. Many people say I will be chosen, but I’m not too worried.”

This calmness might come from his disappointing Olympic final, where he finished last. He seems to have moved on from that experience and is proud that he qualified for the final with a great last throw. “That was an amazing day,” he said. “The final didn’t go as I wanted, but that’s part of sports. I can always return to it.”

After his Olympic disappointment, some people thought he let that moment affect him. Lawrence does not want to talk about it. The minimum salary for an NFL player is over $400,000 a year, so there are clear financial reasons to switch sports. Lawrence has moved from rugby to athletics and now to American football. With all his physical talent, wouldn’t it be better to focus on just one sport? “I understand why someone would say that,” he replied. “I’m trying to achieve something I’ve dreamed about since I was a kid. If it doesn’t work out, I can go back to the discus, the sport I love. Every decision I’ve made has been thought out.”"
99,"We had been flying east all night, and I woke up to see that it was already morning. Looking out of the window, I saw the empty land below. The dark shades of brown and green made me feel better because, even though it was mid-September, it was still summer in Siberia. I could see no signs of people, just mountains, streams, and forests stretching to the horizon. I shook my head. My neighbor woke up and smiled at me. “Good morning, Robert,” he said slowly with a Russian accent. 

Sergei was a salesman from Moscow. He was flying to sell safety clothing to the local mining companies. His English was almost as bad as my Russian, but with a dictionary, I explained that I was going to the city of Magadan in far-eastern Siberia with a one-way ticket because I planned to ride my bicycle back home to England. “But, Robert,” he said, “there is no road from Magadan; you cannot ride a bicycle.” I told him I believed there was a road, but not many people used it. “Alone?” he asked, pointing at me. “No, I will ride with a friend named Al.” “Just one friend?” “Yes, just one,” I nodded. Sergei still looked unsure and pointed outside, saying “Holodna” (cold). I tried to show him with my hands that I had warm clothes, but I didn’t mention that I was on a tight budget. Most of my clothes and gear were bought at low prices. I wasn’t sure if they would be good enough, especially my big postman’s over-trousers that I bought for £10.

It all started in a lecture hall in Scotland. That morning, the hall was full of tired students. Some were taking notes without much energy. The lecturer was talking on and on. I was thinking about a question. Should I ask him or not? “Well, why not?” I wrote a note: “Hi Al, Do you want to cycle across the Karakorum Highway between Pakistan and China this summer? Rob.” Al, my old school friend, was sitting in front of me. I tapped him on the shoulder and passed the note. He tried to read it, wrote something back, and passed it to me. I opened it and held my breath while I read, “OK.”

Six years later, I was going to meet Al in Siberia. I had been working as a geography teacher. Although I was still learning how to manage my classes, the job was good for me. It was often challenging, rarely boring, and very fulfilling. Plus, I had long holidays to go on adventures. Twice since I started teaching, I had used my holidays to meet Al. After our bike ride in Pakistan, Al caught the adventure bug and decided to cycle around the world instead of teaching. Since our first ride together, Al had taken on bigger and bigger challenges. This trip around the world by bike was his biggest yet. Sometimes he thought the ride would be too hard for him. Even though it sounded tough, I envied him. He was having an amazing adventure, facing new challenges every day, and proving the doubters wrong. He was doing something that scared him almost every day, and it made him feel alive."
100,"In The Red Bull Air Race, twelve pilots take turns racing through tall pylons that are between 15 and 25 meters high. They make sharp turns, do barrel rolls, and loops while flying at speeds of up to 370 km per hour. I was invited to experience what it feels like to be part of this race.

An hour before my flight, I had to sign two forms. The first form confirmed that I was healthy, and the second said I would empty my pockets because small objects can be dangerous during the flight. I learned that I needed to stay aware of my surroundings. I was told, “The horizon is your best friend,” and the pilot would guide me on where to look. I also had to promise to relax and enjoy the view when flying upside down.

Half an hour before the flight, I had a safety briefing. I was told not to touch anything during the flight. When we started moving down the runway, I was nervous. My legs were up, my feet were away from the important pedals, and my hands stayed away from the switches. I decided I would not relax and enjoy the flight. This is a challenge in high-speed acrobatic flying. To stay safe, you need to be calm and focused. You must know when to tense up and when to relax. Panicking is not a good idea.

As we began to speed down the runway, I felt anxious. Dario, the pilot, and I were in the Zivko Edge 540, one of the fastest acrobatic planes in the world. The plane took off, and two seconds later, we turned sharply to the right. I felt the air push out of my lungs. I looked at the horizon, tensed my body, and gasped as I sank into my seat. For a moment, I felt like I weighed 6.2 times my normal weight. Then we leveled out and made another sharp turn, diving down. My stomach felt like it was left behind at 2,000 meters, and I felt my lungs pressed against the top of the plane.

Seconds later, we were just 10 meters off the ground, aiming for a small space between two pylons. We passed them at 400 km per hour, and I felt a rush of excitement, but then we made a sharp right turn. We hadn’t even started the acrobatics yet. For two minutes, I got to fly the plane, but my hand was shaking so much that the plane shook too. It was very sensitive to my movements. Then Dario said something, but I couldn’t hear him. Instead of answering, he did a barrel roll, turning the plane completely upside down. He asked, “Are you okay?” I said, “Yes.” He then asked, “Have you had enough?” I replied, “No,” even though I was lying.

Next, he did a loop, flying the plane up and over in a full circle. I know many people would find this exciting, like those who enjoy rollercoasters. But for me, it was a bit too much. At the top of the loop, while we were upside down, I heard a voice saying, “Relax, relax, look up.” I looked up and saw some fields below us. The flight lasted 10 minutes, and it felt easy compared to what the pilots experience during the race. When we landed, Dario happily took out some sandwiches to eat. I didn’t eat for hours, and that night, I kept dreaming about doing loops in the air."
101,"Doug Allan films wild animals in cold places. If you have ever seen amazing videos of polar bears in a nature documentary, it is likely that he filmed them. He says his favorite temperature is -18°C. Allan trained as a marine biologist and commercial diver. Diving was his first love, where he learned how to survive in cold environments. His big opportunity came when a TV crew came to Antarctica, where he was working, to make a wildlife documentary. He helped the crew find different locations, and after 48 hours, he realized that being a wildlife cameraman was perfect for him: it included travel, adventure, and underwater experiences.

Now, he is a well-known cameraman and has worked on many important TV wildlife series. He started his career at a good time because not many people had been to Antarctica. There were people who filmed coral, elephants, and chimpanzees, but he became known as the ""cold man."" He felt that many amazing scenes were waiting to be filmed.

When he began 35 years ago, the camera and communication technology were very simple. He says, ""It is much easier to film today. Back then, if you filmed something, you had to remember it. Now, with digital technology, you can film a lot and see it right away. You had to think about what shots you needed next and what you missed. You filmed less because film was very expensive. Today, you can have too much footage.""

Allan believes his experience in cold conditions is very valuable. He feels comfortable on sea ice, and it has become easy for him, like crossing the street. He does get cold toes, but he says the poles are healthy places with no leeches, diseases, or mosquitoes.

Wildlife filming has many successes, but also failures and embarrassing moments. Once, he was in the Orkneys to film kittiwakes, but he could not identify the birds. Recently, he got permission to film in Kong Karls Land, a group of islands in the Arctic Ocean. He knew it would not be easy. It is a place with polar bears and is very dangerous. In April, the temperature is usually -32°C, the wind is strong, and carrying cameras through deep snow is very hard. After walking for five or more hours a day and watching polar bear dens for 23 days, he had only seen one mother bear and her cub.

On the 24th day, he felt like he was part of the bear world. He describes how they would find a new hole and wait. They moved around to stay warm. After five hours of watching, he finally saw a brief glimpse of a bear. The camera was ready, and he quickly focused on it. At first, he saw just a black nose, then the bear's head appeared. In less than a minute, the bear was resting in front of the hole, looking at him without being scared. Just when he thought it couldn't get better, the bear slid down the slope, and then two cubs came out of the den. He felt like they were seeing the world for the first time, and it was an amazing moment.

Now, Allan wants to make his own film about climate change in the Arctic. He wants to talk to the people who live there and see how it affects their lives. He believes he could create an extraordinary documentary."
102,"In 2004, Pen Hadow became the first person to walk alone to the North Pole without getting supplies along the way. He had to swim in very cold water, deal with frostbite, and avoid polar bears. Eight months later, he reached the South Pole too. Now, he is back in the Arctic, getting ready for a new adventure that he says is even bigger. Explorers like Pen are confident and determined. This time, however, there is a lot more at stake. Pen and two friends will go on a three-month journey of 1,000 kilometers to the North Pole. They will measure the thickness and density of the ice. No one has done this before, and Pen knows the results will be very important for scientists. This will show how global warming is affecting the ice in the polar region.

Pen was prepared for this work since he was a child. His father’s old nanny, who worked for the famous polar explorer Scott of the Antarctic, took care of him. She made him tough by sending him out into storms with very few clothes. His father also loved adventures in cold places, and Pen grew up to be very strong. Pen is married to Mary, who loves horses and the outdoors. She helps him with his polar guide business and worries more about him when he is at home. She once raced against him in a famous mountain event and finished an hour ahead of him. Pen and Mary live in the countryside with their two children. 

Pen says it is harder to be away from his family this time. When he last went on an expedition, his children were very young. He made a mistake when he said goodbye to his son, telling him to take care of his mother and sister. His son took it seriously and worried about them a lot, which was too much for him. Because of this, Pen plans to have little contact with his family while he is in the Arctic. He believes that calling them will remind them of how far away he is. In the days before he leaves, he is carefully preparing his equipment. He knows that out on the ice, it is very hard to fix things or do anything complicated.

He will be joined by Ann Daniels, a leading polar explorer, and Martin Hartley, the expedition photographer. They will have a team of six people to help them by flying in supplies. Pen says being part of a team can be stressful for him, and he is also thinking about his age. He will turn 47 soon and feels he has not trained enough. He often gets busy with planning and worries about what he will have to do.

Pen believes that his mission connects exploration with the search for knowledge that drove explorers in the past. He admits that reaching the North Pole was a personal goal and not very useful to others. This time, scientists will benefit from the information they gather, and they want to involve as many people as possible in understanding what is happening in the Arctic Ocean. Pen feels this is important work, and they are the only ones who can do it. He believes their unique skills are now very relevant and useful to society again."
103,"Text: 'I took a year off. What was I going to do? Being a successful Olympian is amazing. I had the chance to do more writing, TV work, and speak to businesses and schools. Even though I enjoyed these activities, I wanted something competitive to focus on. I wanted to stay in shape so I could try for another Olympic spot if I felt inspired again. So, I signed up for marathons and triathlons. That should have been enough, but I kept thinking about Ben Fogle’s invitation: “Do you want to row across the Atlantic with me?” I have always loved rowing and how the boat moves through the water. I missed that feeling, but I wasn’t ready to train every day. Still, I wanted some kind of competition. I asked my rowing friends if they wanted to join the race, but they were not very excited. I knew that if I entered the race, I would want to win, even though it was called an adventure. Would rowing with Ben give me the best chance to win? Probably not. But being an underdog without pressure was interesting to me. I contacted Ben. He was going to join the race anyway and had found a way to pay the big entry fee and deposit for a boat, which made the race feel real. We talked about the other costs; the boat and equipment would cost £70,000, which is a lot of money. We thought we had a good chance, but it would still take work to get the money. I also had to think about losing income while I was away. Speaking at business conferences is one of the best ways to earn money as a retired athlete. It feels good that people are interested in what I have to say. But I find it hard to talk about my past without a new goal. Joining the race would mean I wouldn’t just talk about what I did before; I would actually be doing something again: rowing across the Atlantic. I learned a lot while planning this adventure, but one big lesson was to appreciate the easy life of a full-time athlete. My training for the Olympics was hard, but it was also simple. I trained almost every day, but my training plan was clear, and I had doctors and dieticians to help me. I was worried about what people would think of me racing with a TV presenter. I thought it might look like I just wanted to be on TV, and I should have picked a better partner to win the race. But my worries went away as we prepared. The Atlantic Rowing Race is about more than just rowing; it’s also about mental strength. Ben had completed tough challenges, like the Marathon des Sables, spent time at sea, and lived on a deserted island. But he didn’t know how to row. I was surprised by how little he understood about rowing, and he was surprised by my lack of patience. I could have been more understanding, but I needed to be honest with Ben about how much he needed to improve. I should have known what to expect when I agreed to race with him.'"
104,"Text: 

Just over a year ago, I left my job to work with huskies in the Arctic Circle in northern Finland. At 26, I felt restless. I dreamed of cold Arctic landscapes, maybe because I was tired of the noise and crowds of London. I found a small company run by Anna McCormack and her husband, Pasi Ikonen, in Finnish Lapland. They offered me a job as a husky dog handler for a busy winter season. From December to February, they take many tourists on sled rides pulled by huskies across the ice and snow, for trips that can last from one hour to five days. They started with six dogs, but now they have more than 100. Recently, they took over a second place called the 'wilderness farm,' which they described as a beautiful but basic location with unreliable electricity and no running water. They told me I could join the team for three months if I understood what I was getting into. ""The hours are long, the conditions are tough, and the work is very physical,"" they said. I started packing right away.

November 6, London
On my flight, I stared at a page with more than 100 pictures of huskies. I was supposed to memorize their names, but I felt distracted and nervous. I put the page down and looked out the window instead. It is said that spring moves north at about 26 km per day, bringing flowers and leaves. But I felt like I was seeing winter moving south, with rivers freezing over.

November 7, Helsinki and Hetta
The bus ride north was everything I hoped for. We drove through endless dark forests with thin trees covered in snow, stopping sometimes to let reindeer pass. I arrived at the farm after dark, and as soon as I walked in, I was given a pair of boots and sent out into the cold. ""Do you want to be thrown in at the deep end?"" Anna asked. I followed the sound of barking, which grew louder as I reached the dog sheds. Three people were running back and forth, pulling the huskies out and getting them ready for sleds. The dogs were very excited, pulling against their ropes. I could barely introduce myself because everyone was too busy. I stood to the side and petted one of the quieter dogs. Someone told me to ""Get in!"" and I almost fell into the nearest sled. A command was shouted, and we took off into the dark, with only a headlamp for light.

November 15, Hetta
I quickly learned how to be a husky guide, but first, I had to answer questions about what I could do. ""Are you useful?"" Anna asked. I was confused. I didn’t know if I was. After more questions, I realized I was not very useful: I had never driven a snowmobile, I hadn’t done woodwork since school, and I had never chopped anything with an axe. ""You do have a driving license?"" someone asked. I nodded, feeling relieved. 

I learned the basics of dog-sledding quickly: lean into the corners, use both feet on the brake to stop, and never let go of the handlebar. But other tasks were complicated. Simple things like feeding and watering the dogs became hard in freezing temperatures. A bowl of water would freeze quickly, so we had to make a 'soup' of meat in hot water for the dogs. By the end of my first week, I was overwhelmed with instructions, and my muscles hurt from pulling heavy sleds and being pulled around by excited huskies. But I felt proud. ""I can chop with an axe, hammer a nail, and use a circular saw,"" I emailed my friends. ""In the snow."""
105,"On that day, when Radcliffe ran past the finish line, reporters came to understand her amazing performance. They noted that her time was good enough to qualify for the men's marathon at the world championships in Paris. Curious journalists asked her about a special treatment called emu oil, which Olympic gold medalist Cathy Freeman had suggested to help Radcliffe heal from an injury caused by a bike accident during training. Radcliffe said that she didn’t fully realize how big her achievement was at the time. Looking back, she understands it was a significant moment, but she felt it was just what she was meant to do that day. She and her team decided not to set any limits on their performance, and their motto was ""no limits.""

During the race, Gary Lough, Radcliffe's husband and coach, was in a car with her support team, listening to the radio. Gerard Hartmann, her physiotherapist, was also with him. After 16 kilometers, Radcliffe's agent worried that she might not be able to keep up her fast pace and might drop out of the race. Hartmann was angry about this concern, but he understood that someone who didn’t know how fit Radcliffe was might think it was risky to start so quickly.

With 800 meters left, Radcliffe started to think about her time. She realized she could finish in under 2 hours and 16 minutes if she ran the last part in less than three minutes. She had already run 41 kilometers very quickly, but she managed to sprint the last distance in 2 minutes and 25 seconds. At the finish, she thought, ""I can run faster than that."" She remembered the race director, Dave Bedford, saying he never thought anyone would come close to that time for a long time. Radcliffe thought, ""I will come back and do it next year,"" and she really believed she could.

Unfortunately, that did not happen. After the race, everyone wanted to know how Radcliffe, who had an unusual running style, had beaten the skilled East African runners. Hartmann had worked with Radcliffe for weeks, helping her with daily training to support the 250-300 kilometers she ran each week. He said, ""I have worked with 63 Olympic medalists, and no one could handle the pain like she could. She would make me work hard because I had to go deep into her muscles, and I would be in pain afterwards.""

Hartmann described traveling 13 hours from Ireland to Radcliffe's training base in France, only to be greeted by her husband saying, ""Gerard, you're 15 minutes late, Paula's waiting."" There was no time for a friendly greeting; Radcliffe was ready for a two-hour training session. Hartmann said, ""Paula would push you to your limits, and that’s what made her so good."" He spent so much time with Radcliffe that his other athletes became jealous.

When asked why no one has come close to her record, Radcliffe said, ""I trained really hard, but there are more talented people out there."" She thought someone like Mary Keitany, a two-time London marathon winner, might break her record. Radcliffe explained that some runners focus more on competing against each other than on improving themselves. She believed that her strong mental focus helped her push through the race without relaxing, always trying to run as hard as she could.

Radcliffe did not know it at the time, but that marathon was the best performance of her career. She would never run that fast again, but she inspired many women to start long-distance running."
106,"When my first cooking show, In Search of Perfection, was released, I was unsure how viewers and critics would react. There was a lot of talk about a food ‘revolution’ happening in Britain, and I believed we had created a series that added something new to it. However, I worried if people would like a cooking show that included not just cooking techniques but also history and science. I watched the first episode feeling both happy and nervous. I didn’t need to worry. The show became very successful and led to many other interesting projects, including a book about my experiences at my restaurant. 

In each project, I felt like I was on a journey, whether it was exploring the past, understanding cooking techniques, or learning about different cultures. I wrote several books in a series called ‘Perfection’, each one linked to its own TV show. In these books, the journey was often physical, involving travel and new experiences. The latest book, In Search of Total Perfection, takes you around the world to meet amazing artisans, like a man who makes golden pasta that tastes better than any other. These artisans have spent many years trying to reach their own idea of perfection.

Perfection is different for everyone. Choosing which dishes to include in the series was very difficult, and I knew some people would be upset if their favorite dish was not included. I could imagine people asking, “Where is steak and kidney pie and bread and butter pudding?” But after a long meeting, the TV team and I created a list that would please many people. This showed me that everyone has their own idea of perfection, based on their feelings, memories, and experiences.

Even though the book is called ‘Perfection’, I knew I wouldn’t say that the recipes were the best or final. I believed that by using my cooking skills and knowledge, and by talking to food producers, chefs, and customers, I could discover what makes these dishes special. The dictionary says ‘perfection’ means being perfect, but it also means improving through practice and trying new ideas until you create something unique.

The TV series allowed me to explore many foods, people, and places I had never seen before. I was excited to learn about food and memories because I started my career in a similar way. Finding the best ingredients took me all over the world. I had many adventures, like visiting a canning factory that was using the wrong tomatoes and going to a dairy farm that did not meet our standards, so we had to stop filming there! While perfecting each recipe, I even hand-milked a cow and used dry ice to make ice cream, cooked chicken in a hospital machine, and almost burned my house down trying to make a real Neapolitan pizza."
107,"We were still a long way from Marrakech when the van made a loud noise, went off the road into a field, and stopped. John got out and opened the engine. He looked at it for a long time with his hands in his pockets and a serious look on his face. “Actually, I don’t know what I’m doing,” he finally said, and he and Mum started to laugh. Bea was worried. “We can’t stay here forever,” she said. The field was big and empty, just grass and many flowers like poppies and daisies. “No, we can’t stay here forever,” I agreed, because it was better to support Bea. We got back into the van and waited for Mum and John to stop laughing. We watched John get smaller as he walked away to find someone who could help with the van. Mum lay down on the grass. “Tell us a story,” she said. Bea lay down next to her. “Go on, tell us a story.” So, I told them about how the day before we left London, I heard two birds talking. I shared everything they talked about: breadcrumbs, other birds, the weather, and an argument over a worm. “That’s silly, no one understands bird language,” Bea said. My eyes felt wet. “I do.” But I didn’t sound very sure. “Liar,” she said. I felt embarrassed. How could I be lying if I remembered everything? The more I thought about it, the less sure I became. “Mum…?” But she had fallen asleep in the sun. 

John came back with three Moroccan boys who helped us push the van to the hotel. Bea didn’t want to get out. The boys didn’t mind. They waved and smiled at her through the back windows. We followed John into a café that was not far from where our van was parked. “It’s a hotel,” John whispered. “It might be a bit expensive.” “We’ll just have some tea,” Mum said, and we sat in the shade. The tea was made from mint leaves and was very sweet. Mum looked into the pot. “It’s like syrup,” she said. We stayed at the café all day while John looked sadly at the engine. “It’s a miracle it got us this far,” he said as it got dark. Mum took out blankets and made a bed for us in the hotel garden. It felt nice to sleep on the ground. “I’ll have to get us towed into Marrakech,” John said. 

Half an hour later, we were in a truck watching our van being pulled behind it with John driving. At first, Bea didn’t want to move, so John picked her up and put her in the truck. Now she sat in the front with the driver. I kept thinking about how we would get home now that our van had to be towed. I thought it might be easier to take a boat straight to London. Then I must have fallen asleep."
108,"Lucy was at a welcome party in a hotel ballroom. She was talking to two other pianists who were also at the Prague Classical Music Festival. One was a guy from Tokyo, and the other was a girl from a European city named Liesel or Louisa. They were both about ten years older than Lucy and spoke good English. They talked about the music they were playing and their recent travels. 

“I think I'm doing Tanglewood this summer,” Lucy said. It sounded impressive, but she didn’t really want to go to the Tanglewood festival. She often felt overwhelmed by the concerts and competitions that took her around the world. Because of this, she missed so much school that she wasn’t officially enrolled anymore. Instead, she worked with tutors from the University of San Francisco. 

Lucy hadn’t even wanted to come to the Prague Festival, which only accepted fifteen pianists her age from around the world. She was one of the lucky few chosen from thousands of applicants. At the party, her dad bought her a white-gold necklace with an L pendant to celebrate. Her little brother Gus dreamed about being at the same festival one day. Her teacher, Grace Chang, took Lucy out for a special dinner to plan her music pieces. The truth was, Lucy hadn’t applied herself. Her mom had filled out the form and sent in a CD. “I didn’t want you to be disappointed if you didn’t get in,” her mom had said. Lucy thought her mom just didn’t want to let her say no. Back then, Lucy believed that making waves was a bad thing, so she didn’t think about trying to get out of it.

The guy from Tokyo leaned in closer. “Tanglewood?” he asked. “Yeah,” Lucy replied. “How old are you?” he asked. “Fifteen,” she said. He looked at Liesel/Louisa, who said, “Wow.” Lucy didn’t mean to brag. It was hard to know when to share her achievements and when to keep quiet. “It’s just part of this new youth-spotlight thing they’re trying,” she explained. 

“Excuse me,” Liesel/Louisa said, looking away as if she saw someone she needed to talk to. The guy from Tokyo stayed and asked, “Have you ever been to Japan?” He had long, messy hair, like many musicians, to show he was a cool music nerd. “Once, when I was about eight,” Lucy replied. He started to say something when Lucy's grandfather appeared beside her. “Lucy, let me introduce you to someone,” he said, pulling her away. “And don’t get too friendly with the competition.” 

“They're not the competition,” Lucy replied. “Everyone is the competition,” her grandfather insisted. He took her around the room, making her talk to important people. Lucy smiled and nodded, understanding only part of what was said. 

In the elevator to their suite after the party, her grandfather said, “You did well in there, Lucy. I’m proud of you. This is an important festival, and people are talking about you. They all know who you are.” Lucy liked that. She enjoyed being recognized, even if some people were jealous or thought she was too young for the attention. Being a concert pianist didn’t earn her respect from the kids at her old school. Even her best friend, Reyna, didn’t know or care that she could play a difficult piece by Rachmaninov. But in places like this, Lucy felt she mattered."
109,"Text: ""‘You spend too much time online. You need to go outside and enjoy the real world,’ said Dad. It’s hard to argue with him, so I wanted to see what experts say about this. It’s quite interesting. Research shows that many teenagers who use social media have a lot of real-life friends, feel like they belong, and are learning important skills for the digital world. Simon Miles, an expert on online safety, says ‘social networking is a big part of growing up today. Teenagers don’t just use media like adults do; they live in it. This isn’t good or bad – it depends on how you use it.’ 

How does our social networking compare to what our parents did when they were young? Jim Matthews, a social media expert, says it’s like the youth clubs that parents used to go to. It helps teenagers share jokes and gossip, and it helps them grow away from their parents and deal with teenage problems. Psychologist Professor Keith Davidson says: ‘Adolescence is a time when you ask, who am I? Social networking can help you find your identity. You can share your favorite music or sports, find what you like, and see that others have different opinions. Research shows that active social networkers are not more self-centered than those who don’t use social media.’ He adds that social media can help shy people: ‘Talking online can be easier than in person, and it helps you practice social skills in a safe way.’

Professor Andrew Phillips is studying how young people use social networking sites. He believes they can help quiet people with special interests connect with others who like the same things. ‘If you’re one of only a few people in your school who likes a certain type of music, you might feel alone. But if you find a social media group with similar interests, you can feel more connected and popular in a different way,’ he says. 

Pauline White, a digital education expert, shared something interesting: ‘Young people who find new interests online, join groups, and create their own content are really using social networks well.’ She thinks social networking is becoming a way to be creative: teenagers are making videos, podcasts, and blogs about what they like. Photo-sharing sites are helping photographers connect, learn, and share their work. ‘This can help you get a job in the future,’ she says. ‘Every business uses social media to sell and promote themselves – you need to know how it works to attract customers. For example, if you create a product and have 1000 friends on social networks, they could all be potential customers. If you connect all those networks, you have your customer base.’

Teenagers who use social networking creatively will benefit when they grow up and start working, agrees Matthews. ‘One great thing about many sites is the chance to work with others to create and share content. Working together is an important skill in the 21st century and helps you get a job in the digital world.’"""
110,"When most people think of a relaxing family vacation, they might not imagine a long trip across nine western states in the US and a part of Canada. But my parents were not looking for a quiet time this summer. My dad decided to plan what he called the ultimate family bonding trip. He and my mom kept saying, “Not enough people do this anymore,” while my twin brother and I exchanged worried looks, thinking, “Maybe there’s a good reason for that!”

In mid-June, we packed our car with suitcases, coolers, and a mix of clothes for any weather. I was excited but knew I would miss my privacy for the next two weeks. Still, I had some ideas to cope. With barely enough space left in the car, we started our “Family Great American Road Trip.” Leaving our big home for smaller places for the next five thousand miles made me wonder what we were getting into.

We drove west through the Oklahoma panhandle. Even though we were still close to home, we had our share of adventures. We stopped for the night in Oklahoma, under a sky full of stars, after almost being blown off the road by a dust storm. We quickly learned that cattle have the right-of-way on the road!

The next day, we woke up early and continued our journey. The desert changed to mountains, and the days started to blend together, but each adventure was still special. We left our footprints in the Great Sand Dunes and then went to Pagosa Springs, Colorado, where we noticed a strong smell of sulfur. As we climbed to our next stop, we realized that the roads marked for Jeeps were best for Jeep drivers.

Every place we visited showed a mix of old and new. We got used to traffic from construction. We laughed when we saw the big “CLOSED” signs at the Four Corners Monument. On our way to Yellowstone National Park, we saw many wind farms and watched the sunset over bear habitats near the roads. We experienced “bear jams,” where traffic would stop to let bears cross, and we had a close encounter with a bear and a worried park ranger, which gave us unforgettable memories.

As we drove, life back home felt far away. Even the hotel we stayed in, which was old and had no internet or cell phone service, couldn’t take away our excitement. In return for these things, I got to see the most beautiful views I’ve ever seen. After watching a rainstorm from our hotel in Canada, my family and I headed back south. My parents were right; you don’t need to go to a faraway place to find something amazing.

It was a little sad to be home again, but at least I didn’t fight with my brother during our one hundred hours on the road! We had three thousand photos from our trip to look through. I knew that the best memories would be the unexpected and spontaneous moments."
111,"Rose Frost was sixteen years old and was going to live with her grandmother, Daisy. Rose's family was separating for two years. Her father, Jeff, had a job in another country, and her mother, Dahlia, would go with him. Rose and her older sister, Amy, would stay in England. Amy needed to finish her last year of school, so she would live at the college. She was happy because she got the best room, which had its own kitchen and study area. Amy also liked that she could use the Internet and phone for free. Jeff and Dahlia would check on Amy, even if she didn’t want them to.

Rose was moving to her grandmother’s house. She only remembered a few happy times with Daisy and had never met her grandfather. When Daisy offered Rose a place to stay, her parents were not very excited, but Daisy was happy to have Rose with her. Rose didn’t know why her parents didn’t get along with her grandma, but there had been a disagreement in the past. Because of this, Rose had spent her summers away from Daisy. The last time Rose saw her grandmother, she was only ten years old, but she remembered it fondly. Dahlia said living with Daisy would be interesting. Daisy was very social and loved to bring people together. Rose expected to get many dinner invitations, coffee mornings, and shopping trips soon, which made her smile. Daisy was not a typical old lady; she seemed to go to more events than anyone else.

Before the move, Dahlia and Rose talked. Rose was sensible and mature for her age. She knew about healthy eating, staying fit, and getting enough sleep. But Rose wanted one thing: her independence. She wanted to play music loudly, invite friends over, and go out without asking for permission. She felt she could be trusted to do these things. She didn’t want to be reminded about homework or staying out late, and she didn’t want to be taken around by her grandmother. Daisy understood this. Dahlia gave Rose a new touch-screen phone with a video camera for emergencies only, which made Rose very happy. They all agreed to trust each other. Daisy would trust Rose to make good choices, and Rose would trust Daisy not to be too strict. If either of them went too far, they would talk about it again.

Rose was not a wild child. Her few friends were similar, so her school reports were always good. In five weeks, Rose would start at a new school, meet new friends, and begin her life again. This would be her fourth school in five years, so she felt experienced. At least she knew this would be her last school before finishing. For Rose, it was a new beginning in her life."
112,"Charlotte Grainger shares that her primary school teacher was the first person to think she might write a novel. She said, “I thought writing a book would be a big achievement because it seemed very challenging. I didn’t know what other teenagers were doing, like competing in the Olympics. When I turned 13, I thought, ‘I should try this now.’” The novel she started at that age is now about to be published. 

Charlotte recently told her former teacher about her book, and the teacher was surprised. She had thought Charlotte would write a book when she was 30 or 40. Charlotte didn’t understand why she should wait to do something she was good at. 

It was a winter afternoon in the offices of Charlotte’s publishers. Even though I knew I was going to interview a 15-year-old girl about her book, I was surprised to see a teenager sitting there. The book is a great achievement: it has a strong story and is full of action. Nothing about it, except for the age of the main character, shows that it was written by a teenager. 

A public relations representative was with us in case Charlotte needed help, but she didn’t. She is confident, smart, and steady, which keeps her from being overly confident. Charlotte understands that she is still young. When I asked her about the complex moral questions in her book, she said, “I was trying to ask big questions, not answer them. I don’t have many life lessons to share with my readers.” She laughed and added, “I don’t think my age limits my understanding of the world, but I also don’t think I’m very wise. I just wanted to explore the idea of taking responsibility.”

Charlotte has a theory about how teenagers are often shown in books. She believes there are three types of teenagers in novels: the outsider who becomes accepted, the naïve teenager who knows little about the world, and the awkward teenager who struggles socially. She found it frustrating to read about these types. “What if you’re basically fine? There aren’t many stories about characters who are not inadequate in some way. Some writers give the impression that teenagers can’t know who they are because they lack experience. This can hurt their self-confidence.”

Charlotte has always loved reading famous fantasy authors, but their books almost made her stop writing. “My favorite fantasy writers explore deep topics about psychology and life. I wondered if I needed to write like that to create a good book and if I was capable of it.” However, she found a helpful book called How Not to Write a Novel. “It says that if the reader starts to guess what will happen, the suspense is probably gone.”

Some might say that Charlotte’s parents, who are both journalists, helped her get her novel published. Her father knew someone in publishing who read her book first. Charlotte knows she is lucky because it is hard for anyone to get a first novel read, no matter their age. “Every writer needs support and a bit of luck, but after that, you are on your own. In the end, writers succeed or fail based on their talent, so I don’t take anything for granted,” Charlotte concluded."
113,"""‘Remember, speed is your friend, not your enemy,’ said Gareth, our instructor, as we looked down the ski slope. ‘Now, who wants to go first?’ The group looked nervous. Then a guy named David, who had some experience with freestyle ski-jumping, stepped forward and skied down the slope towards the jump. He went up the ramp quickly and flew into the air, but something looked wrong. We held our breath. He landed hard, lost both skis, and fell into the snow. ‘Remember,’ Gareth said kindly, ‘speed can be unpredictable.’ 

I thought maybe freestyle skiing was not for me. On past skiing holidays, I enjoyed practicing turns in the snow. I was not like the teenagers who did tricks on ramps and half pipes in skate parks. I thought it looked fun, but I was afraid of looking silly if I tried to join them. Then my parents decided we would have a winter holiday at a freestyle skiing training center in the US. It had a big indoor area with trampolines and ski jumps covered in artificial snow. Students jumped and tried their new tricks, landing in foam pits – not a real introduction to skiing outside. 

After practicing indoors, students went outside to try their skills. ‘Progression is inevitable!’ the center’s slogan said. ‘Before places like this trained people, inexperienced ski jumpers would just go down the slopes and hope for the best,’ Gareth explained. ‘But remember – if you land on the knuckle, you’ll be in trouble.’ The ‘knuckle’ is the flat area behind the jump before the slope goes down to the landing zone. If you land in the zone, you keep moving forward, which is safer. If you land on the flat, you stop suddenly, which hurts. So, speed is important.

At first, it was hard to make my body go fast towards the jump. My legs wanted to slow down, so I landed on the knuckle. I didn’t fall, but by midday, I felt tired. ‘You need to control the jump, not let it control you,’ said Gareth. 

On the second day, we started on the trampolines. I thought I would hate being indoors, looking at the snowy mountains, but bouncing on the trampolines was fun. Some exercises copied the moves we would do while ski-jumping, and others helped us learn ‘aerial awareness’ – knowing what our bodies were doing while spinning in the air. Gareth gave us tips. My ‘aerial awareness’ needed improvement – every time I tried, I only remembered the moment before jumping and then found myself in the foam cubes next to the trampoline.

We went back to the mountain to try again. There were more mistakes before I finally landed correctly. Gareth was as happy as I was, and for a moment, I felt proud of my achievement. But that feeling didn’t last long. On my last run of the day, I made myself keep my speed up as I approached the jump, flew into the air, and landed in the right spot. Then I saw both skis sliding down the slope, no longer attached to my feet."""
114,"Imagine you are on a rollercoaster at an amusement park. Your hands are sweaty from fear, and you hold tightly to the safety harness. The ride stops suddenly, and you take a deep breath as the carriage slowly goes up. Then, there is a quick drop, and your stomach feels like it is in the air. You move fast, turning left and then upside down. You feel scared and let out a loud scream. But you chose to be there, just like millions of others who pay to enter theme parks.

It is interesting that amusement parks, with their exciting rides, are a big business. To create the thrills that people want, there are many teams of engineers and designers working behind the scenes. They make sure the rides are fun but also safe. The job of a rollercoaster designer might sound like something a child would dream of, but it is actually very challenging. Designers must find the right mix of excitement and safety while also making the rides new and interesting.

Many people think that rollercoasters are getting more extreme, but most of the ideas used today were created by a designer named John Miller in the early 1900s. Back then, there were fewer safety rules, and some rides were very scary for passengers. Now, designers have to follow the rules set by ride manufacturers.

I talked to three experts about rollercoasters. Professor Brendan Walker, a ""thrill engineer,"" said that the skill is in putting all the parts together. Dr. John Roberts explained that it is important to quickly switch between feelings of excitement and safety so that riders feel thrilled but not scared. 

To create an amazing ride, the teams must come up with a strong story, like a space adventure or a jungle chase, that goes well with the ride's features, such as height and twists. Professor Walker mentioned that, like in many creative jobs, experience and testing are very important. Jeff Hornick, a senior director in theme park development, said that it helps to love thrills when designing rollercoasters to understand what riders want.

I asked the experts if rollercoaster designers will use new technology, like virtual reality. Walker said we should not expect too much from it. He explained that while new technology can make rides more exciting, the real experience of being on a rollercoaster will always be the most important part for many years to come."
115,"At 25, Miranda Ellington has done a lot as a choreographer. She has created dances for many theatres and dance companies, and she still dances sometimes. I wonder why she does both things with her busy schedule. She says, ""Dancing again reminds me of being in the studio and following the orders of strict choreographers. It can be tense and frustrating. Choreographers sometimes forget what it’s like to rehearse all day.""

As a choreographer, Miranda teaches and enjoys working with young students. She explains, ""New dancers are often open to trying new ideas. Working with students can be easier than with professionals because they are willing to take risks. They want to succeed, but they don’t always know their strengths and weaknesses. This makes them open to even tough criticism. Sometimes they challenge what I say, but I appreciate their honest feedback.""

When Miranda starts with a new group, she focuses on the dance steps, and the music guides her. She says, ""There might be music I don’t like, but I still try to create the best dance routine for it. If dancers don’t respond well to a certain piece of music, it can be frustrating, but I have to find solutions. I wish I could be more experimental and change the music when things get tough in rehearsals. But now, I usually work on big productions where the music is already decided.""

Miranda believes in meeting new people and not sticking to one place. She says, ""It’s important to make connections, but I have to remember that each theatre and school has different methods and styles. I need to adapt my way of working each time I go somewhere new, so I don’t get stuck in my ways.""

We talk about a recent documentary about professional ballet dancers and choreographers. Miranda says, ""Some past documentaries looked glamorous but were not true. This one shows real life in a dance company. There’s a scene where a young dancer gets many corrections, and I smiled because I recognized that feeling. She knows she’s not doing it right but can’t make her body do what she needs. It’s hard to watch, but it’s real. People often underestimate the hard work and dedication in ballet.""

I ask Miranda what makes a great dance production. She replies, ""It’s when everything comes together – the music, costumes, lighting, and dancers. Perfection is hard to achieve, but aiming high is important. It helps you get away with some mistakes. I’ve been in productions where the dance was great, but the costumes or props were distracting, and that’s disappointing.""

Miranda has done many different types of work, so I ask if she sees herself as a modern dance choreographer or a ballet specialist. She says, ""People like to label you, but I don’t understand why. There’s a trend to focus on one area of expertise, but I don’t follow that. Maybe one day I will be known for one thing, but for now, I want to explore more."""
116,"A friend once asked me why I travel when I can see everything on television. I agreed that there are amazing things on TV, but why stay at home when there is so much to experience outside? This conversation inspired my crazy four-day trip and a film that encourages people to turn off their TVs. 

A friend was getting rid of his old sofa, which became the star of my film. I added three wheels and some cables to it and used old seatbelts to carry it. I put my luggage on the sofa and slept on it each night, even one night on the beach. Some friends joined me, helping to pull the sofa and encouraging me to keep going. 

I have walked on many trips in recent years, but this was very different. It was the longest distance I have ever walked, and I walked on main roads. This allowed me to stop at roadside cafés and relax on the sofa with a cappuccino instead of sitting on a rock with my sandwiches blowing away in the wind. 

I often told people, “No, I’m not doing this for charity, and I’m not training for a marathon.” When someone at work asks about my weekend, I prefer to share how I dragged a sofa 100 miles across southern England instead of talking about the latest TV show. You can watch the film on my website."
117,"When I read about guided swimming trips in the sea around some small Greek islands, I felt excited. I had never tried group trips before. My brother, who I had traveled with before, was busy, so I thought a group holiday would be good for me. The man at the Greek port looked surprised when I asked for a single ferry ticket because the islands are popular with families. I told him I wouldn’t be alone for long; I would join ten others to swim around the small islands. He still looked confused, but he smiled and showed me on board.

Before we started, our group had exchanged emails, but there was not much time to talk before our first swim. Our guides told us that a support boat would be with us the whole time and showed us how to communicate with it. We did a short swim to divide us into speed groups, and then it was time for our first long swim of 1.5 km. I was nervous. I had trained in my local pool and swum in rivers, but I had never swum long distances in the open sea. Soon, the waves got bigger, and I found myself at the back of the slow group, which was not where I wanted to be. I watched the faster swimmers move ahead like dolphins. I wanted to finish this first distance, and I was very happy when I finally did it on my own.

The next days followed a routine: jumping in, swimming at a comfortable speed, and stopping to enjoy the beautiful views. As the swims got longer, I also got faster and enjoyed them more. I felt like I didn’t need the support boat much anymore. I can’t wait to come back again next year!"
118,"Being a flight attendant is not easy, but it has many rewards. Since I started this job, I have traveled to many places, from the US to Australia. I work with amazing people, have a lot of free time, and my life is always interesting. This makes it a great job for someone young like me!

When I was a child, I went to a boarding school far from my family. I often flew alone when school started and ended. Sometimes I felt lonely, so I asked the flight attendants if I could help serve meals to the passengers. Some of them let me help. This experience stayed in my mind when I wanted to change from my banking job and look for something new.

At the interview for the flight attendant job, there were many young people, and many of them were hired. They were often very qualified, just like me, and were also changing careers. Before the interview, I practiced what to say. I talked about my skills and past work experience, not just my love for travel, which everyone else would say. Because of this, I got the job!

I would recommend this job to anyone because there are many good things about it. The free flights are nice, but they are not the best part. Most airline staff work very hard, and there is a saying: ""No one is finished until everyone is finished."" It feels like a big family. Even if we don’t see each other all the time, we are still close.

When I am not working, I don’t have to take my work home. If I do have difficult passengers, which is rare, I know the flight will end soon, and I probably won’t see them again!"
119,"At the summer camp where I work, I really enjoy seeing the children do things they never thought they could do. Most of the children already know how to swim and play table tennis before they come here, but rock climbing is new for many of them. Some children feel nervous at first, but with some encouragement, they try and eventually reach the top. This makes them feel very happy.

At the start of the week, some children miss their homes. It is not the younger ones who feel this way the most; it is usually the ten- to thirteen-year-olds. We do not let them use their mobile phones all the time. We tell them they can call home after lunch. When they ask again after dinner, we say it is too late to call and that they can do it tomorrow. Most children feel better after a couple of days, and by the end of the week, they come to us and thank us because they had a great time.

Sometimes, it is not just the children who feel lonely. We also have parents who call a lot to ask how their child is doing, which is not really needed. Often, their child is busy playing games or doing other activities, so we have to tell the parents to call back later.

We also see some children who come dressed in expensive new clothes. These children often argue when we ask them to change into something more suitable, but soon they understand why it is important."
120,"Text: 'Rock the Planet is a musical show where the actors also need to be good musicians. It opened in London last year after being in the USA for five years, where it won the title of ‘Best Musical’ four times! However, it was challenging to do the show with an all-British cast. In the UK, there are more rules about how many performances young actors can do each week compared to the USA, where they can do more shows. Because of this, they needed twice as many actors in the UK. Fortunately, the director found many talented actors in the UK, and they have just won their first ‘Best Musical’ award. 

The theatre in London is bigger than the one in the USA, and it has been full every night. Everyone wants to hear the songs that became popular in America. I met Jamie, an 11-year-old actor in the show. He said, ‘It’s amazing that I get paid to play, especially with a beautiful and expensive Gibson guitar.’ He talked about how busy the young actors are. ‘We have regular school lessons at the theatre. The teacher is great, but I miss my old school friends.’ 

I asked Jamie what his classmates thought of the show. He said, ‘My whole class came! The theatre offers special ticket prices for schools. They loved it, and that made me feel really confident. My parents come when they can, but it’s expensive for them.’ When I told Jamie that I also play guitar, he found a spare one and invited me to play with him and the other young actors. We played a song called Days, which I didn’t know. Jamie helped me learn it, and I felt happy when I finally got it right. I was impressed by Jamie’s skills and wished I could play like him. I was just trying to keep up and was glad the show’s director wasn’t there to hear my mistakes! 

Even though the young actors were already musicians and some played several instruments, none had played in a band before. Luckily, they found it easy. Jamie said the hardest part was looking natural when they first performed together. They were so focused that they forgot to smile! The show will be in London for another year, and it is definitely worth seeing.'"
