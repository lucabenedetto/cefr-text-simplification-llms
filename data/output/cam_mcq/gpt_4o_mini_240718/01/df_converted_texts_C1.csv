1,"Some time ago, a website pointed out the dangers of public check-ins, which are online updates about where you are. The website's message was clear: while you might think you are simply saying, ""I’m at this place,"" you are also letting many people know your location, including those you might not want to meet. This reflects a growing understanding that sharing everything online can have negative consequences. The internet offers many exciting opportunities to share our lives with a global audience, which can lead to wealth and fame. However, as we dive into the online world, sharing personal stories and photos, we may find ourselves overwhelmed and lost.

This situation may seem discouraging, but there is hope. The future has been mapped out for us by early internet pioneers who explored these challenges. In the early days of the web, they faced many difficulties, losing jobs and friends while navigating the temptations of fame, long before social media existed. These pioneers, known as the first bloggers, have experienced what many of us are now going through. It is important to learn from their experiences.

In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started posting on the World Wide Web, which was mostly used by graduate students and scientists. The web was created at CERN, a physics lab in Switzerland, to help researchers share their work. Hall saw a different opportunity: to share his life. He created a personal website filled with stories, photos, and art. In January 1996, he began a daily blog, attracting many readers who were fascinated by his bold exploration of this new medium. Hall was open about everything; no topic was off-limits. While some might see this as attention-seeking behavior, there was also a unique beauty to his work that many would consider art.

However, one day, visitors to Hall’s site found it replaced by a single, emotional video titled ""Dark Night."" In it, he shared that he had fallen deeply in love, but when he wrote about it online, he was told, ""either the blog goes, or I do."" He realized that sharing his life online made people distrust him. The blog was removed, but the issue remains. Sharing online can be wonderful, but if you think it will make people want to be around you, you might be disappointed.

In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a young web worker in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job at a software company. One day, an anonymous coworker shared her blog's address with the company's vice presidents, including some she had criticized, which led to her losing her job. Researchers studying online behavior have a term for this: the ""online distribution effect,"" which describes how people often feel they can say things online that they would never say in person. However, the internet is not a separate reality where we can speak freely without consequences. Our online lives are connected to our real lives, and ignoring this can lead to serious mistakes.

Armstrong's story had a positive outcome. Although she was upset and stopped blogging for a while, she eventually got married and restarted her blog, focusing on her new family. Today, she is a well-known ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing supports her family. Once a cautionary tale of online mistakes, she has become skilled at sharing her life in a thoughtful way. Armstrong's experience teaches us an important lesson: while the internet allows us to say anything, that doesn’t mean we should."
2,"Some scientists recently started a campaign to warn people about a low-budget film called *What the Bleep Do We Know?* This film mixes documentary and drama to suggest that there is much we do not understand about our universe. While scientists can sometimes be arrogant, even the most enthusiastic physicist would not claim to know everything about the cosmos. However, some scientists felt it was important to publicly criticize the film, calling it everything from ""atrocious"" to ""very dangerous."" This made me curious to see the movie.

At first, I didn’t understand why there was so much concern. Various scientists made harmless statements about how new discoveries were showing that the universe is stranger than we thought. It was only when the film discussed some of these discoveries that I began to understand the controversy—like the claim that water molecules can be influenced by thoughts. I had heard about a Japanese researcher who suggested that the shape of a water molecule could change based on the feelings of people nearby. However, the film only provided images of ice crystals that looked beautiful after being spoken to positively and ugly after being exposed to negative emotions. Many people find this kind of evidence convincing because it is simple and easy to understand. However, scientists typically respond with skepticism, saying, ""Give me a break."" 

I understand their point. The idea that thoughts can affect water is fascinating and suggests new forces in the universe. But before we get too excited, we need solid proof that this effect is real. Beautiful pictures of crystals, while nice, are not enough. The real issue is that the movie's claims were not strange enough. For example, water molecules might have properties linked to a mysterious energy that could be driving the expansion of the universe. This idea is supported by decades of research from laboratories and observatories worldwide.

In reality, discoveries are being made that confirm the film's claim that the universe is much stranger than we ever imagined. Astronomers have discovered that the universe contains an unknown type of matter and is expanding due to a mysterious force called ""dark energy."" Additionally, researchers in other fields are making remarkable discoveries. Neuroscientists have found that our awareness of events is delayed by about half a second, a delay we do not notice because our brains edit it out. Anthropologists believe they have identified where modern humans originated and how they spread across the globe. Some theorists even suggest connections between life on Earth and the fundamental structure of the universe.

Despite what some may think, science is far from complete. In fact, we seem to be further from knowing everything than ever before. Many natural phenomena may never be fully understood. The ideas of chaos and quantum uncertainty have shown that there are limits to what we can know. This has led some of the world's top theoretical physicists to work on a ""Theory of Everything,"" which aims to explain all the forces and particles in the universe with a single equation. Ultimately, many of us believe that the universe can be described in one word: incredible."
3,"To put it simply, I find writing novels challenging, while writing short stories is a joy. If writing novels is like planting a forest, then writing short stories is more like planting a garden. Both processes work together to create a beautiful landscape that I cherish. The trees provide shade, and the wind rustles their leaves, which can turn a bright gold. In the garden, flowers bloom, and their colorful petals attract bees and butterflies, showing the gentle change of seasons.

Since I started my career as a fiction writer, I have often switched between writing novels and short stories. My routine is this: after finishing a novel, I want to write short stories; after completing a set of short stories, I feel ready to focus on a novel. I never write short stories while working on a novel, and I don’t write a novel while working on short stories. The two types of writing likely use different parts of my brain, and it takes time to switch from one to the other.

I began my career with two short novels in 1975, and from 1984 to 1985, I started writing short stories. I didn’t know much about writing short stories then, so it was challenging, but I found the experience memorable. I felt my fictional world expand, and readers seemed to enjoy this different side of me as a writer. One of my early works, “Breaking Waves,” was included in my first short-story collection, Tales from Abroad. This marked my beginning as a short-story writer.

One of the joys of writing short stories is that they don’t take long to complete. Usually, it takes me about a week to shape a short story (though revisions can take longer). It’s not the same level of commitment as writing a novel, which can take a year or two. I can go into a room, finish my work, and leave. Writing a novel can feel endless, and I sometimes wonder if I will make it through. Therefore, writing short stories provides a necessary change of pace.

Another nice thing about short stories is that you can create a story from the smallest ideas—like a thought, a word, or an image. Often, it feels like jazz improvisation, where the story leads me where it wants to go. Plus, with short stories, you don’t have to worry about failing. If an idea doesn’t work out, you can just accept it and move on. Even great writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver didn’t write a masterpiece every time. This thought comforts me. You can learn from your mistakes and use that knowledge in your next story.

When I write novels, I try to learn from both my successes and failures in writing short stories. In this way, short stories serve as a kind of experimental space for me as a novelist. It’s hard to experiment the way I like within a novel, so without short stories, writing novels would be even more difficult.

My short stories are like soft shadows I have left in the world, faint traces of my thoughts and feelings. I remember exactly where I placed each one and how I felt at that moment. Short stories are like guideposts to my heart, and it makes me happy as a writer to share these intimate feelings with my readers."
4,"At its core, science is closely related to philosophy, but it also has practical applications, such as curing diseases. Science has improved our lives but also poses risks. It seeks to understand everything from tiny atoms to the vast universe, yet it often struggles to do so. Science influences poets, politicians, philosophers, and even frauds. Its beauty is often recognized only by those who study it deeply, while its dangers are frequently misunderstood. People have both overestimated and underestimated its significance, and the mistakes made by scientists are sometimes ignored or exaggerated.

The history of science is marked by constant conflict. Established theories are often changed or completely rejected, similar to how new music styles are initially mocked before becoming popular. The battle between old and new ideas is rarely respectful. Scientists can be driven by jealousy and anger. This book presents science as a collection of ideas that have significantly impacted not just science, but also many areas of human thought. While science has practical uses, this book focuses on the ideas themselves, appreciating their beauty and creativity, while also recognizing the limitations of human understanding.

Science is inherently changeable. There is always a scientist challenging the ideas of another. Most of the time, these changes do not disrupt society. However, sometimes they can lead to major shifts in our beliefs. For example, in the seventeenth century, science introduced the idea of a mechanical universe, like a giant clock. Three hundred years later, physics began to question basic ideas, leading us to a complex understanding where our observations can influence the universe, and we struggle to grasp the true meaning of fundamental concepts.

Some people view the instability of scientific theories as a sign that science cannot explain the universe. However, scientific changes usually improve our ability to understand and predict natural events. For instance, Isaac Newton could explain much more than the ancient Greek thinker Aristotle, and Albert Einstein, the founder of modern physics, could explain even more than Newton. Science may falter, but it continues to progress. 

At the end of the nineteenth century, many physicists believed there was little left to discover in their field. Then came breakthroughs like radioactivity, X-rays, the electron, and many new particles, along with concepts like quantum mechanics and relativity. Biology has also made significant advancements. Today, some claim that a complete theory explaining the universe's origins and workings is on the horizon. 

Science is not just an academic exercise. Over the last two centuries, we have shifted from merely observing nature to influencing it, sometimes disrupting its balance in ways we do not fully understand. It is crucial for non-scientists to engage with scientific developments, as these advancements will shape the world their children will live in. Science is now a key part of how humanity envisions and shapes its future. The implications of scientific progress can impact everything from government budgets to the health of future generations and the long-term survival of life on Earth."
5,"From around 2015, after many years of growth, major publishers began to notice that ebook sales had stopped increasing and, in some cases, had even decreased. This raised new doubts about the future of ebooks in the publishing industry. One anonymous publishing executive recently admitted that the excitement around ebooks may have led to poor investments, causing his company to lose faith in the value of printed books. Despite the clear idea that digital and print books can coexist, the debate about whether ebooks will replace print books continues. Whether people are trying to predict or dismiss this idea, it remains a topic that sparks our imagination and intense discussions. 

Why is this idea so strong? Why do we see the relationship between ebooks and print books as a battle, even when evidence suggests otherwise? The answers to these questions go beyond ebooks and reveal much about our mixed feelings of excitement and fear regarding innovation and change. In my research, I have explored how the idea of one medium replacing another often appears with new technologies. For example, after television was invented, many believed that radio would disappear. However, radio adapted and found new ways to be used, such as in cars and factories. The fear of books disappearing is not new either. As early as 1894, people worried that the phonograph would replace books with what we now call audiobooks. This pattern has repeated itself many times. Movies, radio, television, hyperlinks, and smartphones have all been thought to threaten print books as sources of culture and entertainment. Some believed that the end of books would lead to cultural decline, while others exaggerated the benefits of ebooks in a digital future.

The idea of books disappearing often arises during times of technological change. This narrative reflects our mixed feelings about technology. To understand why we react this way, we must recognize that we form emotional connections with different media as they become important in our lives. Many studies show that we develop strong attachments to objects like books, televisions, and computers, even naming our cars or getting frustrated with our laptops. Therefore, when a new technology, like e-readers, appears, it not only signals economic and social change but also forces us to rethink our relationship with something that has become a part of our daily lives. As technology evolves, we often miss what we used to know but no longer have. This is why entire industries form around nostalgic products and older technologies. For instance, the printing press in 15th-century Europe led people to seek out original manuscripts. The transition from silent to sound movies in the 1920s created nostalgia for the older format. The same occurred with the shift from analog to digital photography and from vinyl records to CDs. 

Not surprisingly, e-readers have sparked a renewed appreciation for the physical qualities of traditional books, even their unique smell. This should reassure those who worry about the future of print books. However, the idea of disappearing media will continue to be a compelling story about the power of technology and our fear of change. One way we cope with change is by using familiar narrative patterns, such as stories of tragedy and endings. These narratives are easy to remember and share, reflecting both our excitement for the future and our fear of losing parts of our familiar world—and ultimately, parts of ourselves."
6,"For a year and a half, I woke up every weekday at 5:30 AM. I brushed my teeth, made coffee, and wrote about how some of the greatest thinkers of the last four hundred years managed their time to do their best work. I focused on the everyday details of their lives—when they slept, ate, worked, and worried—hoping to show a new side of their personalities and careers. I wanted to create interesting portraits of these artists as people with routines, just like us. 

The French writer Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin once said, “Tell me what you eat, and I shall tell you what you are.” I would say, “Tell me what time you eat and if you take a nap afterward.” In this way, my book is somewhat superficial. It looks at the conditions for creativity rather than the creative work itself. However, it is also personal. The novelist John Cheever believed that even a simple business letter reveals something about the writer. 

My main concerns in this book reflect my own struggles: How can you do meaningful creative work while making a living? Is it better to focus entirely on one project or to work a little each day? When time is limited, do you have to give up things like sleep, income, or a tidy home? Or can you learn to do more in less time, as my dad always advises? I don’t claim to answer these questions definitively—some may not have clear answers—but I provide examples of how many successful people have faced similar challenges. 

I wanted to show how big creative ideas can be broken down into small daily actions and how our habits affect our work and vice versa. The title of the book is Daily Rituals, but I really focused on people’s routines. While routines can seem ordinary and thoughtless, they can also be powerful tools for managing limited resources like time, willpower, and optimism. A good routine creates a path for our mental energy and helps us avoid being controlled by our moods. 

Psychologist William James believed that we should automate parts of our lives through good habits, allowing us to focus on more interesting activities. Ironically, he struggled with procrastination and could not stick to a regular schedule. Interestingly, it was my own procrastination that inspired this book. One Sunday afternoon, while trying to write a story for a small architecture magazine, I found myself cleaning my workspace and making coffee instead of working. As a morning person, I can concentrate well in the early hours but struggle after lunch. To feel better about this, I started looking online for information about other writers’ schedules. I found many entertaining stories and thought it would be great to collect them, which led to the Daily Routines blog I started that day and now this book.

The blog was informal; I simply shared descriptions of people’s routines from biographies, magazine articles, and obituaries. For the book, I gathered a much larger and better-researched collection while trying to keep the variety of voices that made the blog enjoyable. I let my subjects speak for themselves through quotes from their letters, diaries, and interviews. In some cases, I summarized their routines from other sources. I must acknowledge that this book would not have been possible without the research of many biographers, journalists, and scholars. I have listed all my sources in the Notes section, which I hope will guide further reading."
7,"Howard became a palaeontologist because of a change in interest rates when he was six years old. His father, who was careful with money and had a big mortgage, said that their planned holiday to Spain was no longer possible. Instead, they rented a chalet on the English coast. On a rainy August afternoon, Howard found an ammonite on the beach. He had always wanted to be a palaeontologist, and by the end of university, he knew what kind he wanted to be. He became more interested in the very early stages of life on Earth, rather than the more famous periods like the Jurassic and dinosaurs. He studied small, delicate creatures found in grey rocks.

As he finished his doctoral thesis, he wondered if he would find a job, especially in the kind of institution he wanted. He was confident in his abilities, but he understood that hard work does not always lead to success, and that the hiring process in academia can be unfair. When a position for an Assistant Lectureship at Tavistock College in London opened up, he applied, but did not expect much.

On the day of his interview, the professor who was supposed to lead the panel had a fight with his wife, which made him distracted. He ended up in the hospital after crashing his car. The interview went ahead without him, and a colleague who disliked Howard’s former professor took his place. This colleague was able to help Howard get the job. Howard was surprised by this unexpected support and felt grateful, but later learned the true reason behind it. Although he would have liked to think he was chosen for his skills, he was just happy to have the job and be able to do the work he loved.

Howard often compared his orderly professional life, where he could plan and pursue scientific truth, to the chaos of personal life. He realized that strangers could unexpectedly change his situation, as he experienced when his briefcase, containing notes for a lecture, was stolen at a train station. Upset, he returned to college, called to postpone the lecture, and reported the theft. Afterward, he went for coffee and met a colleague who was hosting a curator from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. This conversation led Howard to learn about a new collection of fossils that needed to be studied, which would become his biggest challenge and secure his future in his career. Because of the theft, he quickly changed his plans. He decided not to attend a conference in Stockholm or take students on a field trip to Scotland. Instead, he would find a way to visit the museum in Nairobi."
8,"Charles Spence is willing to try almost any food. He mentions that he has ice cream made from bee larvae at home, which may look strange but supposedly tastes ""slightly nutty and floral."" One of Spence's goals is to make eating insects more acceptable. As a Professor of Experimental Psychology at Oxford University, he studies how our senses work together to shape our taste experiences. His research influences what we eat and drink, from large food companies to high-end restaurant menus.

Spence and his colleagues study how various factors affect our perception of food. For example, who we eat with, how food is presented, the colors and textures of plates and utensils, and even background noise can change how we taste food. In his book, *The Perfect Meal*, co-authored with Betina Piqueras-Fiszman, Spence shares interesting findings about eating. For instance, the first person to order in a group tends to enjoy their meal more, and we eat about 35% more food when dining with one other person, and 75% more with three others.

Spence's lab in Oxford is quite simple, filled with basic equipment. He has soundproof booths and older audio-visual tools. By keeping costs low, he can collaborate with chefs who may not have the budget for research. Much of his work is funded by a large food company. Traditionally, research funded by the industry was viewed negatively in universities, but now it is seen as valuable, especially since the government wants universities to show their work has real-world impact.

Currently, Spence is helping well-known brands reduce salt and sugar in their products, which is important for keeping customers healthy. Interestingly, many companies make these changes slowly so that consumers do not notice the difference. Spence explains that when people are informed about these changes, they tend to focus on the taste and often dislike it more.

Spence first met famous chef Heston Blumenthal while working on a project for a major food company. At that time, people thought combining science and food was unappealing, even though food is inherently scientific. Blumenthal's collaboration with Spence led to the creation of the ""Sound of the Sea"" dish in his restaurant. Spence notes that similar ideas were explored by early 20th-century Italian futurists, but they did not become popular.

Now, the food industry is applying Spence's research on sensory experiences to many products. For example, he found that higher-pitched music can make food taste sweeter, while lower-pitched sounds can make it taste bitter. An airline is planning to match music with the food served to passengers, and a well-known brand recently released an app that plays music while ice cream melts, although they did not match the music to the taste.

At home, Spence's dinner parties can be quite unique. One time, they served rabbit with the fur still on the cutlery, and another time, they experimented with colored lights and sound generators while tasting different drinks. For Spence, home, sweet shops, food conventions, and gastronomy conferences are all extensions of his research lab."
9,"Our brains are more active than ever. We are constantly bombarded with facts, false information, chatter, and rumors, all pretending to be useful information. We have to sort through this to find what we really need to know and what we can ignore. At the same time, we are doing more tasks ourselves. Thirty years ago, travel agents booked our flights and salespeople helped us find what we needed in stores. Now, we handle most of these tasks on our own. We are trying to manage the responsibilities of many different roles while also keeping up with our lives, families, careers, hobbies, and favorite TV shows. Our smartphones help us do all of this, becoming part of the modern rush to fill every spare moment with activity.

However, there is a problem. Although we believe we are multitasking—doing several things at once—this is a misleading idea. Earl Miller, a neuroscientist at MIT, explains that our brains are not designed to multitask effectively. When we think we are multitasking, we are actually switching quickly from one task to another. Each time we switch, it costs us mentally. Instead of being expert jugglers, we are more like amateur plate spinners, hurriedly moving from one task to another while worrying that something will fall apart.

Even though we think we are accomplishing a lot, multitasking actually makes us less efficient. It has been shown to increase stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline, which can overstimulate our brains and lead to confusion. Multitasking creates a craving for constant stimulation, rewarding our brains for losing focus. Additionally, the prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain we need to stay focused, is easily distracted by new things, similar to how shiny objects attract babies' attention.

Just the chance to multitask can harm our ability to think clearly. Glenn Wilson, a former psychology professor, calls this problem ""info-mania."" His research found that trying to focus on a task while seeing an unread email can lower our effective IQ by nearly 10 points. The cognitive losses from multitasking are even worse than those caused by being tired. Russ Poldrack, a neuroscientist at Stanford, discovered that learning new information while multitasking sends that information to the wrong part of the brain. For example, if students do homework while watching TV, the information from their studies goes to a part of the brain that stores skills instead of facts. Without distractions, the information goes to the hippocampus, where it is organized and easier to remember.

Moreover, multitasking often involves making decisions, like whether to respond to a text message or ignore it. Decision-making is also challenging for our brains, and small decisions use the same mental resources as big ones. After making many small decisions, we can become mentally exhausted and may end up making poor choices about important matters.

In discussions about information overload with business leaders and scientists, email is frequently mentioned as a major issue. It’s not that email itself is the problem, but rather the overwhelming amount of communication we receive. When a 10-year-old boy was asked what his father does for a living, he replied, ""He answers emails."" His father admitted that this was quite accurate. We feel we must respond to emails, but it often seems impossible to do that and accomplish anything else."
10,"In a zoo in Sweden, a chimpanzee named Santino spent his nights breaking concrete into pieces to throw at visitors during the day. Was he being mean? In caves in the US, female bats help unrelated fruit bat mothers if they struggle to give birth. Are they being kind? Fifty years ago, these questions were mostly ignored. Animals had behaviors that led to measurable results, and scientists focused on those results. The idea that animals have thoughts, feelings, and moral beliefs was considered unscientific and sentimental. However, this view has started to change. Research on the behavior of bats, chimps, rats, dolphins, and chickens has begun to explore animal emotions, which were once a taboo subject. This shift has influenced popular science books like Mark Bekoff’s ""Wild Justice"" and Victoria Braithwaite’s ""Do Fish Feel Pain?"". It has sparked a debate that may never be resolved: do animals have consciousness? This leads to another important question: do animals have a moral sense that guides their actions? 

In a recent experiment with cows, those that opened a locked gate to get food showed more happiness—by jumping and kicking—than those that had the gate opened for them. If this research suggests that cows enjoy solving problems, what does it mean for how we produce and eat beef? While the observations are clear, their meaning is debated. Dr. Jonathan Balcombe, author of ""Second Nature,"" argues that the logical response to this research is to stop eating meat. He believes humanity is on the brink of a major ethical change, similar to the abolition of slavery. Aubrey Manning, a professor at Edinburgh University, thinks we should reconsider how we view animal intelligence, suggesting that animals have a simpler understanding of the mind than humans do. Professor Euan MacPhail believes we should avoid attributing human feelings to animals. These three perspectives may never agree because the core issue is not just scientific or moral, but philosophical. Since defining consciousness is very difficult, can we ever truly understand what it is like to be a bat, as philosopher Thomas Nagel asks?

Balcombe describes an important experiment he conducted that suggests starlings, a type of bird, can experience depression. In a study at Newcastle University, starlings were divided into two groups. One group lived in spacious, comfortable cages, while the other lived in small, empty cages. Both groups learned to eat tasty worms from one box and avoid unpleasant ones. However, when only unpleasant worms were offered, only the starlings in the comfortable cages would eat. Balcombe concluded that living in a poor environment made the starlings more pessimistic about life. Balcombe, who has worked with animal rights organizations, has a clear bias. He states, “We look back with horror at a time of racism. Our views on animals will eventually be the same. We can’t support animal rights while eating a cheeseburger.” If he were the only one with this view, it might be easy to dismiss him as extreme. However, Professor Aubrey Manning shares similar beliefs. Manning has written a textbook called ""An Introduction to Animal Behaviour."" He notes, “What we are witnessing is a shift in thinking. At the start of the 20th century, some believed animals thought like us, and there was a backlash against that. Now we are moving back in that direction. But this is a complex topic, and it’s important to listen to academics with different opinions.”"
11,"Critical or analytical thinking is a way to engage with what we read or hear to gain a deeper understanding. Adrian West, a research director at the Edward de Bono Foundation U.K., notes that many believe that arguing helps us find the truth. While technology helps us store and process information, there are growing concerns that it is changing how we tackle complex problems and making it harder to think deeply. West points out that we are often exposed to poor but appealing ideas, trends, and opinions, which can overwhelm our ability to reason. Ironically, having more data does not necessarily lead to better knowledge or decision-making. West highlights that the quality of our thinking has not improved much despite the increase in information.

According to the National Endowment for the Arts, literary reading has dropped by 10 percentage points, and this decline is speeding up. Patricia Greenfield, a psychology professor, believes that the focus on visual media may be harming our critical thinking skills. She argues that there is more emphasis on real-time media and multitasking instead of concentrating on one task. However, there is still no clear answer on how technology impacts critical thinking. The presence of technology has complicated the situation, making it hard for scholars to rely on previous beliefs. 

It is tempting to see computers, video games, and the internet as either good or bad, but the truth is they can be both, and different technologies can lead to different outcomes. For instance, a computer game might encourage critical thinking or hinder it. Reading online can improve analytical skills, but constantly clicking on links may prevent deeper thinking. Greenfield, who has studied over 50 research papers on learning and technology, says that technology changes how people think. She notes that reading enhances thinking and imagination in ways that visual media like video games and television do not. Reading develops imagination, reflection, and critical thinking, as well as vocabulary. However, she also found that visual media can improve some types of information processing. Unfortunately, most visual media do not allow time for reflection or analysis, which can lead to underachievement, especially among younger people.

How society views technology greatly influences its perceptions of critical thinking. This conflict is especially clear in the debate over video games and cognitive skills. James Paul Gee, an educational psychology professor, argues that video games are often misunderstood. While many believe they are harmful to children, he claims they can be valuable learning tools. Evidence suggests that video games can help develop better reasoning skills. Games like Sim City and Civilization teach decision-making and analytical skills in engaging, virtual environments that mimic the real world. These games also allow players to explore ideas that might otherwise be difficult to access. As reading and math scores decline in the digital age, it is important to closely examine how technology affects our thinking and analysis."
12,"When Matthew Crawford is not writing about how we should live, he works as a motorcycle mechanic. He chose this job after feeling unhappy with office work and his role in social policy. His first book praised the value of manual trades, while his latest book discusses how to deal with modern life. He was inspired to write it when he noticed advertisements appearing on a credit card machine during a brief moment of waiting while entering his pin number. Crawford realized that these distractions are becoming harder to escape. What we want to focus on at any moment is personal, but we often cannot choose this for ourselves because of things we usually do not notice. It is becoming increasingly difficult to think or remember conversations. To avoid constant interruptions, people tend to isolate themselves and stop doing simple things like talking to strangers. Crawford points out that we often experience the world through representations aimed at us, such as video games and apps, which can manipulate our desires and take control of our attention.

Crawford is not alone in his concerns. Many office workers complain about emails but then spend their free time checking them. Research shows that our attention can wander if a phone is simply visible on the table. Although there is no scientific proof yet that our attention spans have changed, people have worried about this since the invention of the telegraph in 1837. What is clear is that we are more aware of other things we could be doing. While it is easy to blame technology for this issue, Crawford believes that technology has made it easier for us to focus on ourselves. Living in a world of endless choices puts a strain on our self-control, which affects our social interactions. Many people prefer to text friends instead of having face-to-face conversations. By only interacting with representations of people rather than real people, Crawford argues that we risk losing something essential in our society.

Screens are not the only issue. Crawford uses his gym as an example. In the past, there was one music player in the center of the room that everyone could use. People had different music tastes, which sometimes caused tension. Now, most people listen to their own music through earbuds. “The gym used to be a social place, but it has lost that quality,” he says. Real connections with others often happen through conflict, like discussing different music preferences.

Crawford suggests two solutions. First, we need to manage noise and distractions in public spaces. More importantly, he believes we should engage in skilled activities to connect with the world in a more fulfilling way. He mentions cooks, ice hockey players, and motorcycle racers as examples of people whose jobs require them to interact with the physical world. No representation can match the real experience of feeling a hockey puck on ice or gravel under your tires. These roles depend on good judgment and the ability to share space with others. “When you engage with the world this way, manufactured experiences seem less satisfying compared to real ones,” he explains. This does not mean everyone should become a chef; rather, it is important to find ways to use your judgment. There are many benefits beyond job satisfaction. Constantly fighting distractions can be tiring and make it harder to focus on what is important. In contrast, practicing attention on one thing can help you pay attention to other things more easily."

""What do you do for a living?"" This is a common question in small talk, and we often define ourselves by our jobs. However, as a philosopher, I find it a bit more complicated. Saying I am a philosopher can sound pretentious. It feels more acceptable to say I study or teach philosophy, but claiming to be a philosopher might suggest I have special knowledge or insight that others do not. This idea is misleading; philosophers are just like everyone else. 

So, why do people have this stereotype of philosophers? One reason is that philosophers often evaluate the actions of others and promote intellectual life. The Greek philosopher Aristotle believed that a life of contemplation, or philosophical thinking, was the best kind of life. While few modern philosophers fully agree with this, philosophy is still seen as connected to deep thinking. Another Greek philosopher, Socrates, said that ""the unexamined life is not worth living,"" meaning that simply accepting societal norms without questioning them leads to an unsatisfying life. Our ability to reflect on the world helps us take control of our lives and make our own choices.

However, living an examined life does not require extensive reading of philosophical texts or a life focused solely on intellectual thought. It simply means paying closer attention to our daily experiences to ensure they are meaningful. You don’t need to be a wise person living apart from society to evaluate life fairly. In fact, examining life can be very practical and should involve sharing knowledge, as it is essential for a good life.

Another reason for the misunderstanding about philosophers is that academic philosophy has become more disconnected from real-life experiences, especially for those without formal training. This is not entirely the philosophers' fault; university funding and evaluations are often linked to expensive academic journals, making it hard for philosophers to share their ideas with anyone outside their small group of experts. As a result, philosophy can seem distant from everyday life. While some philosophers have tried to challenge this view, many have accepted it. The academic environment has created a sense of isolation, and as philosophy has become more focused on specific technical debates, it has become harder for those outside the field to understand.

I sometimes call myself an ""ethicist"" because most of my work is in ethics, which is the area of philosophy that looks at human actions. Recently, I have felt that this title does not fully capture my work, as ethics is often seen as related to formal rules and values. There is a new trend in philosophy where ethics is understood as applied ethics, which examines the fairness of specific social practices. The role of an ethicist today is to decide if certain actions are ethical or acceptable. These are important questions that I often explore.

However, philosophy is more than just this. A typical discussion might start by asking if illegally downloading movies is unethical (it is) and then move on to deeper questions about responsibility, our views on art, and the effects of consumerism. In this way, philosophy helps people reflect on the practices and behaviors that shape their lives. Sometimes we may confirm what we already believe; other times, we may find that our beliefs are difficult to defend. Either way, by examining these ideas, we contribute to the benefit of everyone."
14,"Food lovers, chefs, and anyone who enjoys food might think that thinking deeply about what and how we eat can enhance our enjoyment of food. However, throughout history, discussions about food in philosophy have often been secondary to other philosophical topics. When philosophers have discussed eating, it has usually been a metaphor for something else, like gaining knowledge. Sometimes, there are philosophical discussions that seem to be about food, but a closer look shows they are actually exploring different, loosely related ideas.

One interesting example is the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus, who promoted the idea of seeking pleasure and avoiding pain in various aspects of life. Despite this, Epicurus is often associated with a love for eating and drinking, as seen in restaurant names and food websites. Businesses likely hope to benefit from this connection to a famous philosopher.

Food is inherently social and cultural. The food we eat comes from historical backgrounds and is shared within our communities. These communities provide us with dining partners and the systems that grow and distribute food. We interact with food more often and in more essential ways than with any other product, making it a clear subject for philosophical exploration.

Once food is prepared, critics begin to discuss and write about it. But why do these critics hold such a special status? One philosopher pointed out that tasting food is not a unique skill; rather, successful food critics are simply better at describing flavors. This area has been overlooked in philosophy, as most studies on perception focus on sight, which should change.

Another important aspect of food is its aesthetics. We often describe paintings or music as beautiful, but we rarely talk about the beauty of food's taste. Some philosophers argue that, with the growth of modern gastronomy, food deserves a place in discussions about aesthetics, just like art or poetry. However, food is consumed and disappears when enjoyed, unlike visual or auditory art forms, which remain. Therefore, it is incorrect to consider food a true aesthetic object.

There are also many ethical questions related to food. We can ask what we should eat: organic, free-range, locally grown, vegetarian, or non-genetically modified foods? Our answers often reflect our ethical beliefs, and philosophers will question why we hold these beliefs, making such discussions about food important.

Another topic is the difference between cooking at home and in restaurants. Home cooks have a special responsibility to their guests, based on love and friendship. In a home kitchen, everyone shares food and companionship. In contrast, professional cooks have obligations to their employers and the food itself, meaning their kitchens are not open to everyone, and their relationships are more about colleagues than friends.

A recent essay called ""Diplomacy of the Dish"" explores how food and dining can help bridge cultural differences. This happens in two ways: first, by learning to enjoy other cultures' food, and second, by building personal connections through shared meals, a practice with a long history in international diplomacy. The essay is filled with engaging examples and stories that make this aspect of food philosophy lively and relatable for readers."
15,"Rob Daviau, from the United States, creates ‘legacy’ board games. He felt that the traditional board games he enjoyed as a child were no longer fun or challenging, so he began to think about how board games could change. He wondered if they could have a storyline and if choices made in one game could affect future games. He took a classic game called Risk and made a new version called Risk Legacy. For the first time, decisions made during the game had lasting effects. Players might have to tear up cards, mark the board, or open packets with new rules at important moments. The games are played over a set number of sessions, and long-standing rivalries become part of the game. Daviau explained, “You could point to the board and say: ‘Right here! You did this!’”

Daviau was later invited to work on a legacy version of Pandemic, a very popular cooperative board game where players try to cure diseases that threaten humanity. His next project was a game called SeaFall. While Pandemic Legacy received great praise, SeaFall was seen as a true test of the legacy format because it was the first game that did not follow an earlier version. Set in the age of sailing (from the 16th to the mid-19th century), players become sailors exploring a new world. Designers of legacy board games must think about all possible player choices to keep the story coherent. To do this, they use play-testers to see how the games develop. Jaime Barriga, a play-tester for SeaFall, said, “It takes a huge amount of time. Sometimes the first few games go well, but then after a few more, it can start to fall apart, and you have to go back and fix everything.”

Legacy board games were not expected to become very popular. When Daviau was developing the idea, he thought it would appeal to only a small group of people. He said, “I thought it was really different and pretty good, but it’s unusual and breaks many rules. I expected it to be successful with just a few people. I thought I would be known as the guy who did this strange project.” However, many players, like Russell Chapman, loved the idea. He believes it is one of the biggest advancements in game design in recent years. He said, “It brings a new level of commitment, intensity, and excitement. There’s nothing more thrilling for a board gamer than learning a new game or a new way to play, and you get that constantly with legacy games.”

Another fan, Ben Hogg, said that the excitement of an unfolding story outweighed any worries about the game’s longevity. He mentioned, “At first, I was worried about making changes and possibly ruining my board, but that concern was eased by Pandemic Legacy. Most people don’t go to the cinema to watch the same movie twice, do they? You’re buying into an experience. It adds a storytelling element similar to video games.” The legacy format is influenced not only by video games but also by the demand for episodic entertainment from popular TV shows. While in college, Daviau wanted to be a television writer but ended up in advertising and then game design. Still, he loved storytelling.

Matt Leacock, the creator of Pandemic, compares the legacy design process to writing a novel. He said, “You need to know how you want it to end and have a good idea of where to start, but it’s not enough to just have a general outline.” While Daviau feels a sense of ownership over the idea, he is curious to see how others will develop it. He also tries to downplay its importance, thinking that gamers will soon ask, “What’s next?” Colby Dauch, the studio manager for the publisher of SeaFall, is less certain. He believes the legacy format has changed how people think about board games."
16,"One night not long ago, an octopus named Inky escaped from his tank at New Zealand’s National Aquarium. He crawled across the floor and squeezed into a narrow drain that led to the Pacific Ocean. This story, which sounds like something from a children’s movie, became popular online. Part of the enjoyment comes from imagining animals as similar to us. Octopuses are especially fascinating because they are very intelligent and look so different from humans. They can open jars, recognize faces, use coconut shells for protection, and even play in complex ways.

Some people think that seeing human traits in animals is unscientific. However, Dr. Frans de Waal, who studies primates like gorillas and chimpanzees, believes that it is actually a mistake to ignore the human-like qualities of animals. He calls this mistake ""anthropodenial."" After studying many years of research on animal intelligence, he shows that animals, except for their lack of complex language, display many behaviors once thought to be unique to humans. These include the ability to think about the past and future, show empathy, and understand the intentions of others. In other words, animals are much smarter than we often believe.

De Waal thinks that anthropodenial is a recent issue. In medieval and early modern Europe, people believed that animals were intelligent enough to be put on trial for crimes. Even in the nineteenth century, many scientists looked for similarities between human and animal intelligence. Charles Darwin, who changed our understanding of evolution, wrote that the difference between human and higher animal minds is one of degree, not kind.

In the twentieth century, the rise of behaviorism, which focused on training animals through rewards and punishments, changed how people viewed animal intelligence. For much of that century, animals were seen as simple machines or robots with instincts. Anyone who suggested that animals have inner lives was often dismissed as unrealistic. This change in thinking coincided with a time when humans were destroying animal habitats, polluting the environment, and treating livestock poorly.

Fortunately, de Waal believes we are starting to recognize that animal intelligence exists on a similar spectrum to human intelligence, even if they are not the same. He notes that there has been a surge of knowledge about animal cognition in recent years, especially shared online. He argues that the best tests of animal intelligence consider the unique traits and skills of each species. For example, squirrels may not do well on human memory tests, but they can remember where they hide their nuts, something we struggle with when we misplace our phones.

In her book, The Soul of an Octopus, naturalist Sy Montgomery suggests that if an octopus were to test human intelligence, it might focus on how many color patterns we can create on our skin. If we failed, the octopus might think we are not very smart.

De Waal is cautious about Inky’s escape. He notes that while other octopuses have escaped from tanks, it might be too hopeful to think Inky knew how to reach the ocean. However, he understands how powerful viral stories can be in increasing our appreciation for animal intelligence. He once conducted an experiment to see if capuchin monkeys could feel envy. When some monkeys received cucumbers, which they liked, while others got grapes, which they liked even more, the cucumber monkeys became upset. This study was published in a well-known scientific journal, but what really convinced people was a short video of the experiment released ten years later. This highlights the unique way our minds work."
17,"Text: 'Robotics, once just a topic in science fiction, is now set to cause major changes in technology, similar to what happened during industrialization. Robots have been used in car manufacturing and other industries for many years, but experts believe we are about to see a significant increase in their use across many fields. Many people see robotic automation as a force that will change jobs. Interestingly, while about two-thirds of people think robots will take over most jobs in the next 50 years, around 80% believe their own jobs will still exist in the same way. This shows a common belief that our jobs are safe, but they are not: every industry will feel the impact of robotic automation soon.

For instance, an Australian company called Fastbrick Robotics has created a robot named Hadrian X that can lay 1,000 bricks in one hour, a task that would take two human workers a whole day or more. Another example is Tally, a robot from a San Francisco startup, which moves through supermarket aisles to check that products are well-stocked and correctly priced, rather than cleaning the aisles.

Supporters of robotic automation argue that robots currently cannot maintain or program themselves, which could lead to new, skilled jobs for technicians and programmers. However, critics warn that we should not forget the importance of human interaction in the workplace. Dr. Jing Bing Zhang, an expert in robotics applications, studies how robotics is changing the workforce. His recent report suggests that in two years, nearly one-third of robots will be smarter and able to work alongside humans. In three years, many top companies will have a chief robotics officer, and some governments will create laws about robots. In five years, salaries in the robotics field are expected to rise by at least 60%, but many jobs will remain unfilled due to a lack of skilled workers.

Zhang emphasizes that automation will affect lower-skilled workers, and he believes they should not rely on the government to protect their jobs. Instead, they should seek ways to retrain themselves, as job security is no longer guaranteed. Additionally, advancements in technology will lead to new types of robots designed for consumers, such as humanoid robots that can live and interact with us in our homes. This presents a unique opportunity for companies, but it also brings challenges, including the need for new regulations to ensure safety and privacy.

With millions of jobs at risk and a potential global employment crisis, it is crucial to focus on education to prepare for the future workforce shaped by robotics. Developed countries need more graduates in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) to stay competitive.'"
18,"Text: George Mallory, a famous mountaineer, is often quoted as saying he wanted to climb Mount Everest ""because it’s there."" This response reflects a common question people have: why would anyone risk their life to climb a mountain? Mallory's answer might encourage some to pursue their dreams, suggesting that adventure and fun are valid reasons for climbing. 

In 1967, Bolivian writer Tejada-Flores wrote an important essay called ""Games that Climbers Play."" He described seven different climbing activities, from bouldering to climbing high peaks, each with its own rules. He argued that the approach to each climb, such as the amount of equipment used, should depend on these rules. Over the years, this idea has become popular in climbing discussions, appearing in magazines and casual conversations. 

Many climbers love the sense of freedom that climbing brings. However, climbing can also feel restrictive. For instance, being stuck in a tent during a storm is not what most people think of as freedom. This creates a paradox in climbing: while it can feel limiting, the challenges can also simplify life, offering a different kind of freedom.

When asked ""Why climb?"", US rock climber Joe Fitschen suggests a better question: ""Why do people climb?"" He believes climbing is part of our nature; we are driven to take on challenges and test our limits, even if it involves risks. The joy of climbing may be more about our biology than logical reasoning.

US academic Brian Treanor adds that climbing can help develop important qualities like courage, humility, and respect for nature. While not all climbers show these traits, Treanor believes they are especially valuable in today's risk-averse society. Climbing, therefore, can have practical benefits, helping people grow and thrive outside of climbing.

Another interesting idea is that climbers who rely on themselves rather than others or technology must be fully committed to succeed. Expert climbers Ebert and Robinson stirred some debate by claiming that independent climbs, which are often harder and riskier, deserve more recognition than those done with teams or artificial aids like bottled oxygen. This view raised concerns that it might encourage climbers to take unnecessary risks.

We can also explore climbing from a different perspective. Many climbers report experiences of being fully present, or ""in the zone."" The physical effort, the meditative state while climbing, and intuitive problem-solving are all key aspects of the activity. Some argue that climbing techniques are similar to those in Zen philosophy, which aims to achieve a state of peace. This connection offers another insight into why people are drawn to climbing."
19,"Over the past sixty years, pianist Alfred Brendel became a leading figure in classical music. He was known for his serious and thoughtful approach, focusing on important European piano works. Although he wrote and performed a lot, he did not teach often. Those close to him saw a fun side to his personality, but this was rarely shown during his concerts. His life was a constant routine of studying, traveling, and performing.

About four or five years ago, a young boy named Kit Armstrong came to one of Brendel’s concerts and asked for lessons. At first, Brendel did not take this request seriously. He had very few students and did not see a reason to start teaching now. He quoted another famous pianist, saying, “You don’t hire a mountain guide to teach a child how to walk.” However, he was impressed by Kit, who was around 14 years old. After listening to him play, Brendel thought, “I have to make time for him.” Kit played beautifully and had a unique ability to connect the music from start to finish, which is rare among musicians.

As Brendel steps back from the spotlight, Kit is starting to shine, although Brendel worries about him burning out too quickly. Now 19, Kit is always busy, learning new languages, studying math, writing computer code, or playing tennis, all while his mother keeps a close watch on him. He also composes music. Brendel believes this is important because writing music helps one learn to read it better. He noticed that Kit has an incredible memory and is excellent at reading music. More importantly, Kit listens carefully to his own playing and understands Brendel’s instructions well. When Brendel teaches him something in a piece, Kit applies it throughout the entire piece.

Brendel is cautious about raising expectations for Kit. He dislikes when newspapers label Kit as the next great pianist of the 21st century, saying it can be harmful. Like many talented young musicians, Kit can play some pieces exceptionally well, while others require more practice and experience. It would be unfair for critics to expect perfection from him.

Now at 80 years old, Brendel shows a softer side in his retirement. He reflects on his youth, saying he never aimed for fame quickly but wanted to achieve certain goals by age 50. When he reached 50, he felt he had accomplished most of those goals but still wanted to do more. Although he no longer has the physical strength to perform, he continues to think about music and enjoys this new phase of his life."
20,"When I was a child, I thought gardens were beautiful places. My grandfather’s garden was by a river, sloping gently down to the water. Although we couldn’t reach the river, we could hear the water flowing and the birds singing in the trees. I believed all gardens were like this – peaceful and a place to escape. 

Grandad’s garden didn’t have anything special like a greenhouse, unlike some neighbors who had greenhouses made from old window frames and patched with plastic where glass was broken. At home, my father was often quiet and reserved. He had a sense of humor and enjoyed silly things. He liked to say, “It’s immaterial to me,” instead of just saying “I don’t mind.” Deep down, he might have felt disappointed about his life. He left school without qualifications and became a plumber, which he didn’t love. He wasn’t very ambitious, although he and my mother once thought about moving to Canada, but it never happened. 

My father was skilled at home projects, whether it was building bookshelves or cupboards. My parents only moved house once during their marriage, but my mother was adventurous with furniture. Just when you got used to one chair, another would appear. The biggest change was when a piano arrived. I wanted to like it, but it intimidated me. I only liked the two brass candlesticks on it, but my mother said they were too fancy and they disappeared while I was at school. I was never allowed to play the piano; my sister took lessons instead. When I asked my mother later why I wasn’t given the chance, she simply said, “You’d never have practiced.”

Of the three places to explore – moors, woods, or the river – I always chose the river. I could let my imagination run wild there. With a fishing net over my shoulder and old sandals on my feet, I would walk along the riverbank looking for a good spot to take off my sandals and leave them with my picnic. I would carefully look through the water for fish to catch, but after failing to keep them alive in the backyard, I returned them to the river.

I wanted to leave school as soon as possible, but it seemed unlikely until one day my father said, “There’s an opening for an apprentice gardener in the Parks Department. I thought you might be interested.” In that moment, he went against his usual judgment. He might have preferred if I became a carpenter, but I like to think that deep down, he hoped things would turn out well if I pursued gardening. Maybe I’m fooling myself, but I believe that even though he didn’t like gardening, he had seen my enthusiasm for it and recognized my passion for growing things."
21,"Lawrence MacEwen is crouching on his Scottish island, the Isle of Muck, and I am doing the same. A strong wind from the Atlantic threatens to blow us off the steep cliff in front of us and into the ocean below. MacEwen’s sheepdog, Tie, approaches, and his owner gently pets him. Despite the fierce wind, MacEwen feels completely at home on his island. 

He shows me around, pointing to the north and shouting, “That island is Eigg. The one to the west is the Isle of Rum, which gets twice as much rain as we do.” I see dark clouds pouring rain on Rum’s tall mountains. “Just beyond Rum is the island of Soay.” 

Suddenly, MacEwen says he needs to move his sheep as rain approaches. We walk down the slopes, and he shares some facts about the island: Muck is three kilometers long and one and a half kilometers wide; its geese eat a lot of grass; and the MacEwen family has lived here for 3,000 years. 

As we herd the sheep, Tie is not doing a good job. “Away to me, Tie. Away to me,” MacEwen commands, meaning the dog should circle to the right. Instead, Tie runs straight through the flock, causing confusion. MacEwen sounds disappointed, saying, “That will never do.” Tie looks ashamed.

The Isle of Muck is mainly run by the MacEwen family. Lawrence and his wife, Jenny, manage the farm; their son Colin, who is newly married, takes care of the island cottages; and their daughter Mary runs the island hotel, Port Mor, with her husband, Toby. Mary and Toby enjoy that their two boys can explore the island freely and sail small boats in the summer. “They go out the door and come back only when they’re hungry,” Mary says.

However, life on the island has its challenges. For example, electricity is only available part of the time. On my first evening, I anxiously wait for the lights to come on. The next morning, I find Mary preparing breakfast by flashlight. I also have to deal with no mobile phone service. “You can get reception on the hill,” Mary explains. “Most people last a couple of days, then just put their phone away.” So, I do the same.

Everything on Muck feels wonderfully surprising. A boat arrives today with groceries and three musicians who come off carrying their instruments. Their concert in the island’s tearoom is a great success, with the locals tapping their feet to the music. 

That night, sitting by a warm fire while it rains outside, Lawrence tells me how he met Jenny. “Her father saw a small farm on the Isle of Soay advertised in a newspaper and bought it without even visiting. He had never been to Scotland. Jenny was sent to manage it.” I ask if Jenny knew anything about farming. “She had good typing skills,” he replies.

I go to bed listening to the rain and wake up to more rain. But I eat well, as almost all my food comes from the island. Mary sends me to fisherman Sandy Mathers for fresh fish. I carry it back through the village and deliver it to Mary at the kitchen door. By 7 pm, our fish is on the table, incredibly delicious.

The next morning, I worry about my ferry ride to the next island. Many ferries had been canceled in the past two months due to rough seas. If my ferry doesn’t come, I would be stuck on Muck for two more days, which, secretly, I would not mind at all."
22,"Initially, the game design industry was mostly made up of computer scientists and self-taught individuals, and it did not have many ways for people to enter. Often seen as just a hobby for young fans, the video game industry is now being taken seriously. This may come as a surprise, but industry experts are not surprised at all. However, entering this field is not easy. Creating video game spin-offs that come out quickly after a new movie requires many team members and months of hard work and skill.

Like many industries, getting into game design can be challenging, but it is growing. Jim Donelly, a spokesperson for an online games magazine, says, “It’s very difficult to make progress in big companies or to influence major mainstream games. But the truth is, the industry needs game designers now more than ever. Not just those at the top who manage entire games, but also those who design systems and individual elements.”

So, how can you enter this competitive field? Many companies prefer candidates with a degree in computer science, but Jim has a different view. “There is only one way: make games. The tools are available. You won’t get a job if you haven’t created something, and you won’t succeed on your own if you’re not making things. Game design is more than just a job; it’s a way of life. Like any creative work, it must be practiced to be real.”

Another expert, John Field, acknowledges that while “just doing it” is important, it is more complex than that. Many people want to work in games, but few meet the industry’s requirements today. Even fewer have the creativity, technical skills, vision, and entrepreneurial spirit needed to truly contribute to this evolving field. Can you succeed on your own? “Maybe, but it’s quite difficult,” says John. “However, a good postgraduate course in games can help and provide valuable support and guidance. Most game designers start as programmers or artists and work their way up. They are interested in all forms of entertainment and have a strong passion for the arts and contemporary culture. They may have spent some time working after graduation but have realized that games are their true passion. They are not just fans; they are excited about the future of games and understand the growing variety in this medium. 

Finally, networking can be very helpful. This is often overlooked, but to advance in games, as in many other fields, you need to make connections. The stereotype of a young boy playing video games has changed to a more accurate view of games as a serious medium that captures our attention. Families often engage with interactive consoles, and smartphones offer many new games through apps and social media. John believes there is a lot of potential for growth. “Games have become popular among larger audiences. They are also a great way to learn, and I see this already significant area as full of expanding possibilities and opportunities.”"
23,"Since I was a child, I have always wanted to play football. My dad encouraged me to play, but he never forced me, and I appreciate that. I had a friend whose dad was very demanding. He often said, “You can’t do this, you can’t do that.” My friend could have been a good player, but he lost interest and stopped playing football altogether. I’m glad that didn’t happen to me, but I know it could have been different.

When I score an amazing goal from far away, people often say it’s just luck, but it’s not. I have practiced taking long shots since I was young. You can only score great goals by practicing. The best players in the world, who have natural talent, also needed years of practice to achieve their success. Sometimes, I see young players colliding with each other, but I was taught the right techniques. When I teach kids, I focus on helping them enjoy learning new skills.

At school, I played many sports, from rounders and baseball to athletics and basketball. I now understand the importance of a good education, but back then, football was my main focus. The teachers were doing a good job, but I didn’t realize it at the time. I want my son to have a different experience. We are already trying to read him books, even though he is too young to sit still for long. I hope that his habit of kicking the books around doesn’t mean he will be like me in that way.

At the start of my professional football career, the manager made sacrifices so that younger players like us could join the first team, but he never made a big fuss about it. He didn’t gather us and say, “This is your big chance,” but we all understood the importance of it. I scored in the first game of the season, but we lost, and a well-known TV presenter said, “You can’t win anything with kids.” This made us realize how much we needed to improve. We had some doubts, but we believed in ourselves as a team despite his comments.

I rely a lot on my close friends and family. However, having a lot of money can sometimes create issues. For instance, people often ask me why I let my mother continue working. I have helped my parents financially; I paid off their house loan and bought them a car last Christmas. My family is strong, and I think they would be upset if they felt they should rely on me completely. My mum doesn’t earn much as a hairdresser, but she loves her job. On the other hand, I enjoy using my money to make life easier for those around me. I have more money than people think, but it doesn’t solve all my problems.

After I stop playing, I plan to take a year off or even longer to do things I haven’t been able to do for years. I want to go skiing the day after I retire. I can’t do that now because if I were to break a leg while skiing and couldn’t play football again, I wouldn’t be insured."
24,"It was Sam Carter who helped us move to Reef Point. He was my father’s agent in Los Angeles. My father was struggling to write there, and Sam, worried about losing clients and money, offered to find us a cheap place to live. During the summer, the beach was mostly empty because sea fogs often covered the sun. Reef Point was not a popular spot for day visitors. The road to it was not inviting, and the nearby resort of La Carmella attracted most people. Only those who were broke or really loved surfing would come to Reef Point. 

However, with the hot weather, the beach became crowded with people and activities. My father was busy every day trying to finish a script, and he was feeling stressed. While he worked, I often went to the beach with a book and my dog, Rusty. When we first arrived at Reef Point, we didn’t have a dog, but Rusty started hanging around. I tried to chase him away, but he kept coming back. One morning, I felt sorry for him and gave him some water. My father threw a boot at him, but it was just a weak attempt to scare him off. Rusty understood this and got closer. I asked my father, “Who does he belong to?” My father replied, “You’re wrong, Jane. He thinks we belong to him.”

Rusty loved the beach and often dug up things to bring to me. Sometimes he found items that didn’t belong to him, like a new sneaker or a bright beach towel, which I had to return to their owners. He also loved to swim and always wanted to join me, even though I could swim much faster. Surprisingly, he never got discouraged. 

That day, after swimming, my father had gone to Los Angeles to deliver his script, leaving Rusty and me to enjoy the beach. As the sun began to set, it got cooler, and we watched the surfers. They had been surfing all day and seemed to never get tired. One surfer stood out to me; she was very skilled and made the others look clumsy. Eventually, she decided to finish for the day and rode in on a final wave. 

“Hi,” she said, “why didn’t you join us?” 
“I don’t have a surfboard.” 
“You could get one.” 
“I don’t have any money.” 
“You’re British, right? Are you visiting?” 
“No, I live here.” 
“Is your father American?” 
“No. He came here to write a film script based on a novel he wrote.” 
“No kidding? Have I heard of him? What’s his name?” 
“Rufus Marsh.” 
“You mean, *Tall as the Morning*?” I nodded. 
“I read that cover to cover.” 

She looked at me with new interest, and I realized that people were friendly but often only showed interest when I mentioned my father’s book."
25,"Violet Hetherington stood in a long line at the Southampton docks, waiting to board the Queen Caroline. The line was spilling out of a shed labeled ‘Departures’, and no one was moving. Her friend Annie, who was experienced in traveling, had told her it was better to arrive late to avoid waiting too long. However, this time, Annie's advice was wrong. 

After some time, an announcement came over the loudspeakers: there was a problem with the computer system. This news made the atmosphere among the waiting passengers tense. Some tried to stay patient, while others attempted to lighten the mood, but most people felt frustrated. They had paid a lot of money for this trip, and it was supposed to be a special experience. The delays did not give them confidence.

Violet felt uneasy and wanted to leave. She reached into her bag for her phone but realized it was missing. This was more frustrating than the long wait. It made her question whether going on a cruise was a mistake. Without her phone, she couldn’t call the taxi company to see if she had left it in the cab, as all her important numbers were stored in it. This was the kind of mistake her older son, Harry, always warned her about.

Behind her in the queue was a friendly couple. Violet asked if she could borrow their phone to make a call. She called Harry and left a message asking him to ask their neighbor, Kristina, to check if her phone was at home. If it wasn’t, she would be in trouble because she had no other way to find important numbers in New York. Part of her felt relieved about the missing phone, but she didn’t share this feeling with Harry. He often thought he was more knowledgeable than his mother, while her younger son, Daniel, was more understanding of her mistakes because he made them too. 

Eventually, the line moved, and Violet reached the window to hand over her travel documents. However, her spirits dropped when she entered the ship’s foyer, which looked like a cheap imitation of a fancy hotel. It had shiny fake wood panels, extravagant chandeliers, polished brass, and carpets that reminded her of airports. 

She followed the signs to the elevators, which were crowded with tired passengers. As the lift moved up, it stopped at each floor, letting people out who were relieved to escape. Finally, on the twelfth floor, she stepped out and felt free. Thankfully, her room had the balcony she had requested. She had been worried about what to say if it didn’t. Ignoring Annie’s advice to wait for a better deal, she had decided to pay the highest price she could afford to ensure she had a view of the sea."
26,"When John Maloof bought a box of old photo negatives at an estate auction, he had no idea he was about to uncover the mystery of Vivian Maier. Maloof was searching for images for a book about the Portage Park neighborhood in Chicago. Instead, he discovered 30,000 photographs taken by Maier, a talented street photographer known for her striking images. Since then, Maloof has built a collection of Maier’s life and work. In his home attic, he keeps her cameras, 2,000 rolls of film, 3,000 prints, and 100,000 negatives, along with many 8mm films and audiotapes.

One morning, Maloof looked around at his collection, realizing he was on the brink of something significant, all due to luck. “When I bought this, I had no idea what it was,” he said. “I could have easily sold it all to someone else.” For a while, Maloof and his friend Anthony Rydzon have been piecing together details of Maier’s life. They reached out to families who had employed her as a nanny and spoke with staff from the shop where she developed her film.

Maier was born in 1926 in New York and spent much of her childhood in France. She returned to New York in 1951 and moved to Chicago in 1956 to work as a nanny. Maier was known to be a private person with a unique personality, always carrying a camera. She wore large coats, wide-brimmed hats, and sturdy shoes. “On her day off, she would have her camera around her neck and wouldn’t be seen again until late at night,” said Maren Baylaender, whose husband employed Maier to care for his daughter. “She was private but had strong opinions about movies and politics.”

Maier was knowledgeable about theater and film. Although she was not very social, she often walked the streets with her camera and engaged with people, some of whom she interviewed on audiotape. She seemed to be dedicated to her “second job” of documenting the world around her. “She was a true artist who followed her dreams,” said Rydzon. “Nothing stopped her.”

Maier’s work is a pure form of art; she did not create it for commercial reasons. Her photographs often focus on women, children, the elderly, the poor, and abstract subjects. “What is fascinating about Vivian is the number of interesting pictures,” said photography expert Larry Silverman. He sees influences from other photographers in her work and wonders if she developed her own style independently. “Was Vivian sophisticated enough to do this, or did she borrow ideas from those before her?”

Maloof often thinks about whether he will ever sort through all the negatives, which he keeps in three tall, fireproof cabinets. Interestingly, he had no real interest in photography until he discovered Maier’s work. Inspired by her architectural photos, Maloof began taking his own pictures. “As I improved as a photographer and revisited her work, I realized that the cityscapes were not what mattered to her. It was the people, the street scenes, and the overall composition,” he said. “There was so much more to her work than I thought, and I realized I was sitting on something more important than I ever imagined. Now our goal is to make her name known and to include Vivian Maier in the history books.”"
27,"When a novel is called ambitious, it often suggests that it has not fully succeeded. However, this is not the case with Eleanor Catton’s book, The Luminaries. I interviewed her in the UK when her book was very successful, and she was at the center of a lot of attention. Despite being in her twenties, she appeared calm. She had just arrived from Germany and was flying back to New Zealand the next day. She shared a story about being stopped at passport control and asked to prove she was a writer. She pressed her novel against the glass, and the official asked, “What’s it about?” This is not an easy question for an author. 

The Luminaries takes place in New Zealand during the 1860s, where a series of crimes have occurred, leading a council of 12 men to come together to solve them. The plot becomes very complex. Catton intended to write a murder mystery, not a historical novel, but she found that the past allowed for more complications and misunderstandings for her characters. The book is over 800 pages long because she wanted to give each of the 20 main characters a fair chance to shine.

When I asked her how it feels to be so successful at a young age, she responded thoughtfully. “It’s nice coming from a small country because everyone feels part of the success. There’s a family-like feeling at home, and I received a lot of support from people’s grandmothers.” She also mentioned that it bothers her when people assume her book is not a serious philosophical work.

Catton explained that she wanted to write the book in a spiral shape, with each part being half the length of the previous one, which makes the story speed up as it progresses. I asked if it matters whether readers notice these patterns. She said she aimed to create a book with structural patterns that readers could discover if they wanted to, but that they were not essential to enjoy the story.

Despite its unique structure, The Luminaries remains an exciting murder mystery with a captivating plot. Interestingly, Catton did not plan the story in advance. “I would write myself into a corner and then see how creatively I could get out of the difficult situation I had created,” she said. One of her goals was to make the book enjoyable for readers.

We also discussed her love for television dramas, noting how The Luminaries uses cliff-hangers, different viewpoints, and dialogue. I asked if she would be interested in writing for screen. “That could be pretty cool,” she replied, her excitement evident in her voice. 

She expressed how being in different places changes her imagination. “I see why writers leave New Zealand for more populated areas, to be surrounded by more people.” However, for now, New Zealand will remain her home. I hope it continues to inspire her for many more novels."
28,"As a child, Jonny Kinkead spent his time either building things in his father's garage or playing the guitar. For the last forty years, he has made a living by handcrafting steel-string acoustic guitars. He expresses his fascination with the guitar, wondering how two pieces of wood can create such beautiful sounds and how different types of wood can change the sound. Jonny learned to play his brother's guitar at the age of eleven and later wanted to learn the bass guitar when he was sixteen. Instead of saving money for one, he decided to build it himself. He studied how different shapes and types of wood affect sound and how to assemble them.

Before making the bass guitar, Jonny and his brothers had already built model boats and airplanes, so he was familiar with the process. His father taught them how to use tools like saws and chisels. Jonny had also customized and repaired instruments for his friends. Although his bass guitar turned out well, he had not yet considered a career in guitar-making. He was also interested in painting and sculpture, so after finishing school, he chose to study architecture at university, thinking it would be a good fit for his design interests. However, halfway through the course, he dropped out, feeling too independent for that path. 

Leaving university helped him realize that guitar-making was a form of sculpture that involved creating sound. He believed it was a more practical career than pure art because it produced items that people use. Since then, Jonny has made guitars for a living. In the first ten years, he worked part-time cleaning windows to support himself. His early guitars were sold at the cost of materials, but as he gained a reputation as a skilled guitar-maker, he could charge more. Even now, after nearly forty years, he describes his work as ""still scratching a living,"" as he can only make about ten guitars a year, which limits his income.

In the beginning, Jonny focused on getting known in the music community. He attended music festivals on weekends, encouraging musicians to try his guitars and spread the word. He also had to learn how to price his instruments, as he initially struggled with this aspect of the business. Jonny believes that it is easier for new guitar-makers in the UK today. When he started, many people thought only American-made acoustic guitars were valuable, even though the UK has always had good instrument-making programs. Now, however, UK-made guitars have gained the recognition they deserve.

Jonny thinks that valuable skills can be learned in classes, and he encourages new instrument-makers to take available courses. However, he also believes that there is no substitute for learning through experience. He advises looking at other instruments to see what works and what doesn’t. For example, if the back of a guitar is too thin or too thick, it will not produce a good sound. He feels that being self-taught allows for a broader understanding, while learning from someone else may limit you to just one method."
29,"Any discussion about English conversation, like any English conversation itself, usually starts with the weather. Following this tradition, I will quote the well-known comment from the eighteenth-century writer Dr. Johnson: ""When two Englishmen meet, their first talk is of the weather."" This statement is still true today, just as it was over two hundred years ago. However, many commentators stop here or struggle to explain why the English seem so focused on the weather. They often make a mistake by thinking that when we talk about the weather, we are genuinely interested in it. 

For example, the American writer Bill Bryson points out that English weather is not particularly interesting. He notes that in England, we do not experience extreme weather events like tornadoes or blizzards, which are common in other places. Therefore, he finds it hard to understand why the English are so preoccupied with it. On the other hand, the English broadcaster Jeremy Paxman disagrees with Bryson. He believes that the English fascination with the weather is not about strong feelings; rather, it is about its unpredictability. He argues that while we may not have dramatic weather, living on the edge of an ocean means we can never be completely sure what the weather will be like.

From my research, I believe both Bryson and Paxman miss the main point: our conversations about the weather are not really about the weather itself. Instead, talking about the weather serves as a way for English people to connect with each other. For instance, phrases like ""Nice day, isn’t it?"" or ""Ooh, isn’t it cold?"" are not genuine questions about the weather; they are common greetings or ways to start a conversation. In this sense, English weather talk is similar to ""social grooming"" among monkeys, where they spend time grooming each other to bond socially.

There are specific situations where weather talk is used. Some writers claim that the English talk about the weather all the time, but this is not accurate. In reality, there are three main contexts for weather talk: as a simple greeting, as a way to break the ice before discussing other topics, or as a fallback topic when conversations stall and there is an awkward silence. This frequent use of weather talk can give outsiders the impression that English people talk about little else. An English conversation might start with a weather-related greeting, include some ice-breaking weather talk, and then return to weather topics when other discussions slow down. This is why people from other countries, and even some English commentators, think that the English are obsessed with the weather."
30,"Alice Leader stood in front of Hadrian’s Wall in Britain, explaining to her class of 12- and 13-year-olds what an amazing engineering achievement it was for the Romans to build a structure that is 120 km long and 5 meters high about 1900 years ago. The students were excited about this trip, choosing it over more glamorous tours to Spain, Greece, or France. However, they were curious about why the wall was built, and Alice felt her answers were not enough. Unable to find a suitable historical novel to help her explain life at the Wall during Roman times, she decided to write one herself.

After retiring from teaching for 31 years, Alice began a new career as an author in 2001. She felt that moving from teaching to writing was a big change. “Teaching is like acting; it’s a performance every day and very physically demanding. Writing is exciting and a bit scary, but it’s not as exhausting. My former colleagues envy me because I still connect with children through my stories,” she said. Alice aims to fill a gap in children’s fiction. “Much of today’s adolescent fiction focuses on negative experiences. It’s well written, but often dark, or it’s pure fantasy like Harry Potter. My books are different.”

Alice always taught English and History together, using lessons about ancient Greece alongside the novel ""Tale of Troy."" She is motivated by her love for children. “I’m fascinated by the moment when a child goes from being bored to interested, and then from not understanding to understanding. I enjoy having bored children because it challenges me to engage them.” She views her writing as an extension of her teaching.

Alice was inspired to write her first novel partly because she saw a gap in the market, but also because her two sons were leaving home, creating an ‘empty nest’ for her. Additionally, her head teacher suggested she take a creative writing course, which surprised her. “I had been teaching for 25 years, and she thought it would be good for me. But I didn’t want to spend my summer on a course I didn’t think I needed.” Before being accepted into the course, she had to submit her best piece of fiction, which she only learned about a few days before it started. “I quickly wrote a story about a Roman couple and their unborn baby.” After three hours and 30 pages, she submitted it and was accepted.

During the course, her classmates reviewed her work and encouraged her to publish it. With only 8,000 report cards as proof of her writing skills, she asked her school’s head teacher for a year off to write her first novel. Alice’s husband, Zachary Leader, is a critic and editor, and his help was crucial in editing her book. “My mother-in-law thinks we’re rival authors, but I believe we complement each other. He works with what I’ve written, changing sentence structures and suggesting word changes if something isn’t working. My instinct is to keep adding more scenes. That’s the difference between a fiction writer and an editor.”"
31,"To raise money for charity, a newspaper and a TV company challenged brothers Jonny and Alistair Brownlee, who are champion triathletes, to participate in a special race. This race would have Jonny racing in a car on the roads, while Alistair would race on a mountain bike across the countryside. The race took place in the beautiful and rugged Yorkshire Dales in northern England, starting at Semerwater lake in Wensleydale and ending at Fleet Moss, Yorkshire’s highest road, which is about 350 meters high.

As they prepared to start, Jonny expressed his excitement, saying he had never done anything like this before and was looking forward to the beautiful views from the car, especially since it was very cold outside. Alistair, dressed in full winter cycling gear, was also eager but joked about Jonny’s driving skills, saying he might stop for tea during the race.

The race began, and Alistair quickly took off on his bike, heading straight up the hill, while Jonny got into his car and started driving. However, Jonny's confidence was quickly challenged when he encountered a large tractor blocking the road just 15 seconds into his drive. He complained to the cameraman about the delay, saying if Alistair won, it would be because of the farmer.

After getting past the tractor, Jonny continued driving, while Alistair faced difficulties on the steep slope. He had to get off his bike and carry it up the hill, which was a strange sight for the sheep in the fields. Eventually, Alistair reached the top and was able to pick up speed as he rode down the other side.

Meanwhile, Jonny was dealing with narrow roads and obstacles in the villages, which were not designed for fast driving. He carefully navigated through a narrow corner and a stream on the road. Once he was clear of the last village, he sped towards the finish line.

Neither brother knew how close they were to each other. As Jonny accelerated through the final stretch, Alistair was racing across his last field and back onto the road. He pushed hard and finally reached the finish line, looking up to see if Jonny was there. When he found out Jonny had not yet arrived, he celebrated his victory.

A few moments later, Jonny's car pulled up, and he stepped out, congratulating Alistair but expressing his disappointment at losing. ""Well done,"" he said, ""I’m gutted."""
32,"The silence is what you notice when you play on Centre Court at Wimbledon. You bounce the ball quietly on the soft grass, toss it up to serve, and hit it, hearing only the echo of your own shots. The well-kept grass, the rich history, the old stadium, the players in white, and the respectful crowds all create a peaceful atmosphere that separates you from the outside world. This quiet is good for my game. The biggest challenge in a tennis match is to focus only on the game and the point I am playing. When a point ends, the silence is broken by applause, cheers, and people shouting my name. I hear them, but it feels distant. I don’t realize there are fifteen thousand people watching every move I make, nor that millions are watching me play Roger Federer in the 2008 Wimbledon final – the most important match of my life.

I had always dreamed of playing at Wimbledon. My uncle Toni, my coach, taught me from a young age that this was the biggest tournament. By the time I was 14, I was sharing my dream with friends that I would play there one day and win. Before 2008, I had played and lost to Federer twice – in the final the year before and the year before that. The loss in 2006 was not too hard; I was just happy to have made it that far at twenty. Federer won easily, but my defeat in 2007 was devastating. I knew I could have played better; it was not my skill that failed me, but my mindset. I cried for half an hour in the dressing room after that loss. Losing is always painful, but it hurts more when you have a chance and let it slip away.

Toni, who is usually tough on me, surprisingly told me there was no reason to cry and that there would be more chances at Wimbledon. I told him he didn’t understand; I felt this might be my last chance to win. I know how short a professional athlete's career is, and I want to make the most of it. Every moment matters, but some moments are more important than others, and I had missed a big one in 2007. There was nothing Toni could do to ease my pain. However, he turned out to be right. Another chance came in 2008, just a year later. I was confident I had learned from my previous defeat; this time, my mindset would be strong. 

The night before the final, at dinner with family, friends, and my team, we avoided talking about the match. I didn’t explicitly ask them not to mention it, but they understood that I was already mentally preparing for the game. From that moment until the match started, that mental space was mine alone."
33,"In early April 1957, a young and idealistic Englishwoman named Jane Goodall arrived in Africa. In her first letter home, she wrote, “I am living in the Africa I have always longed for.” She would spend most of her life in Africa, becoming known as a citizen, journalist, scientist, activist, and environmentalist. 

In 1963, the National Geographic Society helped make Jane Goodall famous by publishing articles and making documentaries about her research on chimpanzees. Her fame grew with her own writing, including popular children’s books and the 1971 bestseller *In the Shadow of Man*, which has been translated into 47 languages and is still available today. Jane Goodall is one of the most celebrated female scientists of the 20th century, second only to Marie Curie. However, her fame sometimes overshadows her real achievements. Many articles and interviews tell her story, but they often focus on her personal life rather than her work. 

Despite the many images of her as an adventurous girl or a privileged woman, Jane Goodall should be recognized for her significant contributions to science. Her research has influenced many students who have gone on to important roles in biology. Over her forty-year study, she has gathered a vast amount of data, making her a leading zoologist. Most importantly, she has greatly improved our understanding of the social and emotional lives of chimpanzees.

Before Goodall's work, people misunderstood the dangers of wild chimpanzees. No one knew that chimpanzees ate meat or used tools, and we did not realize they share similar emotions with humans or have complex social systems. Goodall discovered that chimpanzee communities in Africa have unique cultural traditions. Her book, *The Chimpanzees of Gombe* (1986), is considered the most important work in chimpanzee research and is the first comprehensive guide on the subject. Her long-term study in Gombe State, Nigeria, is regarded as one of the great scientific achievements of the Western world.

Jane Goodall changed how we study animals and how we view ourselves, as chimpanzees are our closest relatives. Even as a child, there were signs of her future as a biologist. One clear example occurred in the autumn of 1939 when she was just five years old. One day, she disappeared, prompting a search by the police, neighbors, and family. After a frantic search, she returned, covered in straw. When her mother asked where she had been, Jane explained that she wanted to know how hens lay eggs. To find out, she had hidden in a henhouse for five hours until a hen laid an egg. This moment can be seen as the start of her journey as a biologist."
34,"During our first hour-long conversation, Shirley Ford talks to me using the voices of a playful 8-year-old boy, the boy’s tired mother, a funny elderly Scottish woman, and a very fast-talking alien. Her voices are familiar to fans of children’s TV shows and cartoons, as well as people who have seen computer programs about health and safety. “I just did a voiceover about back injuries,” she says, “so I had to quickly learn how to pronounce many medical terms.” 

Shirley explains what it takes to do voiceovers. “Many actors, even very famous ones, think they can do funny voices, and many probably can,” she says. “But there’s more to it. You need to bring the script to life for an audience that can’t see you. You wouldn’t believe how many well-known people want to do voiceover work. Producers invite them to auditions because of their fame, but often they don’t get the roles because they are too used to acting with their whole bodies.”

After school, Shirley joined a drama course, hoping for a traditional acting career. During the course, she occasionally worked singing jingles for TV ads. “One day,” she recalls, “the man who ran the recording studio suggested I try out for the voice of a rabbit in a cartoon. It seemed silly – I hadn’t studied drama to play rabbits – but I tried it for fun and, surprisingly, got a major role.” Shirley discovered she could do voices and that voiceover work might be her path. “Things just happened for me,” she says. “In my second film, I was lucky to play the main character, her brother, and her mother.”

Adult female actors are often asked to voice small boys and girls because their voices are lighter than those of male actors. Hiring child performers involves complicated procedures and many forms, which production companies prefer to avoid. Shirley has learned to create the right sounds and to vary her child voices by watching children’s TV. Cartoons are the best part of her job, which also includes educational videos and vacuum cleaner ads. “Those are tough because you have to sound excited about something you don’t care about, but my years in this job help,” she says. “I’ve learned that the trick is to smile while you talk – it makes your voice sound bright and cheerful. When I have days doing animation work, it feels like a holiday; interacting with other actors makes a big difference.”

The competition for work is strong, and having a good showreel – a recording that shows what the artist can do – is very important. “It’s definitely worth investing in a strong showreel,” Shirley advises. “There are agencies that help voiceover artists create them.” She believes she has reached her level of success – near the top of her field – through determination as much as talent. “Whether it’s making your showreel and taking it to film and TV companies, advertising agencies, and recording studios, or just practicing your voices, it’s all about setting goals and not giving up.”

For anyone thinking about a career in voiceovers, Shirley recommends attending “specialist workshops – they cover all types of voiceover.” She also thinks a love for human sound is essential, describing herself as obsessed with voices and, in a way, becoming the characters she plays. “If I’ve been in the studio doing a specific American voice, for example, it can take over me, and I’ll be speaking like that for hours, maybe even days afterwards,” she says. “My children have grown up hearing their mom talk in completely different voices.”"
35,"People often ask me how I became a cartoonist. This is understandable because cartooning is a job many children dream about, like being a race car driver. However, most people eventually give up these childhood dreams and choose more practical careers, such as tax lawyer or auto parts manufacturer. The idea of making a living by drawing simple doodles, like those in high school notebooks, seems silly at first. Yet, some people do just that.

Not everyone becomes a cartoonist in the same way, but most have wanted to be one for a long time. For me, I had a typical childhood for a cartoonist, with a strong love for comic strips, contributing to school publications, and being known as ""the kid who draws."" I studied graphic design in college and, after graduating, I showed my illustrations to different companies. I was fortunate to find someone at a newspaper who needed political cartoons about local issues. I created a few ideas, and they bought them. Within a few months, I was earning enough to support myself.

Becoming a cartoonist doesn’t require much. You don’t need a university degree, a lot of money, or even advanced drawing skills. You just need your mind, your hand, and something to make marks with. However, if it were that easy, there would be as many cartoonists as there are teachers. While the technical barriers are low, the job is still challenging. You should only pursue this career if you feel you cannot do anything else. It is much easier to find a regular job that pays the bills and allows time for family, home repairs, and hobbies.

The more skills you have, the better your chances of making a living from your art. I have created political cartoons, comic strips, and comic books. I have also worked as a writer, caricaturist, and designer. I accept all kinds of work because you can learn a lot, even from jobs you don’t enjoy. It helps to be intelligent, well-read, and curious about the world.

Now, let’s talk about the business side of being a cartoonist. There was a time when many cartoonists could find steady jobs with different newspapers and magazines. However, those days are fading. For most people today, cartooning is an entrepreneurial activity, meaning you must not only create the work but also sell it. The more comfortable you are with this process, the more successful you will be. I have seen many cartoonists with average creativity but strong business skills do much better than those who are very talented but lack other skills.

It surprises me how often I meet people who have never sold a cartoon but are afraid someone will steal their ideas. Some are so worried that they won’t even let others see their work! Legally, to protect your work, you just need to draw a small ‘c’ for ‘copyright,’ circle it, and write your name and the date next to it. However, the reality is that it is more likely no one will be interested in your work. If, by chance, someone steals a cartoon and it becomes popular online, it’s not a disaster—it could actually be a lucky opportunity!"
36,"Twenty years ago, I was moving to a new house and decided to get rid of some things. One of the items I chose to throw away was an electric guitar that my dad had given me for my 16th birthday. It was a beautiful, black guitar made in Japan. I usually hate throwing things away, so I was surprised that I wanted to get rid of it. I took it to the dump and was about to leave it on a pile of trash when a young man approached me, looking confused. He asked, “You’re not really going to throw that away, are you?” I told him I was, and I started to feel regret. He asked if he could take it, and I said yes. We parted ways, but I felt sad about my decision for many years.

A few months ago, I received an email that changed everything. I remembered a story about a man who lost his wedding ring in the ocean and found it years later in a fish he was eating. That’s how I felt when I opened the email from a guitar dealer named Keith Rushton. He told me, “I’ve got your electric guitar.” It had changed hands many times since the young man at the dump took it. Keith found a name-and-address label on the back of the guitar and used it to find me online. He contacted me through the newspaper I work for and offered to sell it back to me. I was overwhelmed with emotion and would have paid anything for it, but his price was very reasonable. I had forgotten that my dad always put name-and-address stickers on my belongings, including the guitar. I could imagine my dad laughing at this strange situation.

My parents wanted me to learn classical guitar because it was popular in the 1970s. I loved the sound of it; it was calming and gentle, and it sounded good even when played by beginners. However, I struggled to improve, so I switched to the electric guitar and played simpler music. This was also the time of punk music, where anyone could be a rock star, even if they weren’t great musicians.

When I opened the box that Keith sent me and took out my old guitar, I suddenly remembered my birthday in 1978 when my parents gave it to me. Holding it again felt smooth and familiar, though it was smaller than I remembered. I sat down to play but quickly stood up and put the strap over my shoulder, as electric guitars are meant to be played standing. My fingers instinctively knew where to go. I couldn’t explain the chords I wanted to play, but my hands remembered. My middle-aged fingers felt the familiar pain of pressing down the strings to form a chord. 

The electric guitar is usually played in a group. Now that I’m learning it again, I think I should start a band. My son is learning the saxophone, so maybe we can play together. Or perhaps I can find others my age who have had similar experiences. We could call ourselves “The Regainers”!"
37,"There has been a lot of discussion about sleep recently. When I wrote my book, Insomniac, about people who cannot sleep, I felt like I was one of the few warning about the dangers of not getting enough sleep and how it affects our minds, bodies, and emotions. Anyone who struggles with insomnia will tell you that sleep is essential for our mental, physical, and social health. Interestingly, those who have the most trouble sleeping often understand the importance of sleep the best. It is encouraging that sleep is finally receiving the attention it deserves. However, I wonder about dreams. I haven’t seen much discussion about them. We are losing our dreams all the time. When you wake up early because of an alarm, you miss out on the last hour or two of sleep, which is mostly REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep, the stage where we have the most dreams. Our most vivid and powerful dreams happen during REM sleep, especially just before we wake up in the morning. A good sleeper spends about a quarter of their sleep time in REM, so someone who lives to be 90 years old will spend around six or seven years in this stage. When researchers prevent people from experiencing REM sleep, they find that the next night, the amount and intensity of REM sleep increases to make up for it. This suggests that dreams serve a purpose.

When REM sleep was discovered in 1953, many agreed with the psychologist Sigmund Freud, who believed that understanding dreams was the best way to learn about our minds. However, later research did not support this idea, and the focus shifted to the physical reasons behind dreams rather than the psychological ones. Currently, there is little agreement among dream researchers, according to Harvard sleep scientist Robert Stickgold. 

Dreams are significant. At a meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Society, P.F. Pagel from the University of Colorado Medical School shared a study showing that actors, writers, and directors remember and use their dreams much better than others. He concluded that the use of dreams increases with a person's interest in creativity. It makes sense that filmmakers have a strong connection to their dreams, as film is one of the most dream-like forms of art. However, I wondered if only creative people benefit from their dreams. Don’t teachers, software designers, and politicians also need to think creatively? 

Stickgold explains that dreams help us connect ideas in new and surprising ways, using knowledge from our past and present to create new associations. Dreams may help us discover new patterns and combinations that break our usual ways of thinking. For instance, Stickgold found that when people are awakened from REM sleep and asked to respond to a specific word, their answers are more original than when they are woken from other sleep stages. They tend to think outside the box and combine ideas in unexpected ways, which is a key part of creativity. I personally find that I write better after having intense dreams. Even a difficult dream, or one I can barely remember, seems to inspire my thoughts. On those days, words and images flow so quickly that I can hardly keep up with my typing. I don’t fully understand how it works, but it does seem effective.

Creativity is not just for writers or artists. We live in a complex world, and everyone needs their brains to work well. We must think creatively and flexibly as we interact with colleagues, family, and friends. This is why dreaming is important."
38,"Twenty years ago, Susie Ray moved from London to a small coastal town in south-west England. When you enter her studio, which has a stunning view of the sea, you see several empty frames on the walls, along with happy photos of her two daughters. As a leading artist in the copyist art movement, Susie can recreate the beauty of early 20th-century impressionist paintings and the brilliance of 16th-century Caravaggio portraits. It’s surprising that she doesn’t keep any of her own work. “I don’t have any around,” Susie says with a shrug. “As soon as I finish them, they go.” 

The reason is that Susie is very popular. Over her 30 years as a copyist artist, she has painted works by many famous artists, including Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh. Her reproductions are so accurate that art experts sometimes mistake them for the originals. While the original paintings can sell for millions at auctions, her copies sell for a few hundred pounds to £12,000, depending on how much time she spends on them. Susie doesn’t reveal most of her clients, but they include galleries and private collectors. While many collectors truly love art, some are more interested in status. One celebrity likes to show off his “Van Gogh” painting, which is actually a “Susie Ray Van Gogh.” “Many famous people pass off my copies as originals,” she says. “That’s their choice.” Some collectors save on insurance by keeping the original in a bank safe and displaying Susie’s copy.

Susie is always honest about her work. When she copies an old masterpiece, she aims to make it look as real as possible because she believes doing a poor job would disrespect the original artist. However, she signs her name on the back of the canvas. It is illegal to sell a copy as the real thing, and although she knows people who have made money that way, she has never been tempted. Those who create fakes often get into trouble. Susie admits she isn’t wealthy and has faced challenges, but her situation is more stable now, and it wouldn’t be wise to risk her reputation with collectors and artists.

Susie didn’t always work as a copyist. After earning her art degree, she worked as an illustrator for a botanical garden for several years, earning very little. Looking back, she sees that this experience helped her develop her skills and gave her a love for plants, even though it was hard to make ends meet. She had to be very precise and get things right on the first try. She has no regrets about that time but is happy to have found a more financially rewarding career.

When younger artists ask Susie for advice, she emphasizes the importance of learning to draw accurately. She also highlights how much she has studied to reach her level of skill. Her training allows her to draw anything from plants to perfect copies of 15th-century masterpieces and 20th-century abstract art, although she now focuses on French impressionists, with Manet, Cezanne, and Degas being her favorites. Susie notes that many people think modern art is simple, almost like child’s play. However, she believes that while impressionists painted quickly and freely, they were also very careful, and achieving that balance is quite challenging.

Given her talent, it seems unusual that Susie doesn’t create her own original art. Isn’t art about self-expression? Could a Susie Ray original be worth more than her copies? She explains that her work is the result of years of training and dedication, and she earns a good living from it. She has tried creating her own pieces, like oil paintings of fishing nets, but they ended up looking like photographs—acceptable, but not impressive. It’s as if she has spent a lifetime enjoying gourmet meals and now finds it hard to settle for plain bread and water. Ultimately, Susie is a perfectionist."
39,"During her racing career, Ellen MacArthur cared most about the sea and being the fastest on it. This passion started in her childhood. She felt a strong connection with the boats that took her around the world; they worked together as one. When she returned to land, everyday life felt unimportant. People were too curious about her race, and she quickly wanted to be back on the ocean, challenging nature, even in places that had almost defeated her.

After finishing second in the Vendée Globe, a solo, non-stop round-the-world race, she showed me the small, stuffy cabin of her boat, Kingfisher. This cabin had been her home, workplace, and survival space for 94 days. She explained how carefully she planned her supplies, counting every item, even how many rolls of kitchen paper she would need. Preparation was crucial for her. She proudly displayed her unappealing stock of freeze-dried food, a small gas stove, and neatly organized medical supplies. Her ability to keep her boat clean and organized was as impressive as her sailing skills. The boat was her entire world, and she took care of it because her life depended on it.

Now, she views the world as a boat: a small, beautiful, and fragile thing with limited resources. A significant moment for her was a trip to South Georgia, a remote island in the South Atlantic, where she helped with a bird survey on albatrosses. This experience made her reflect and see things differently. The many abandoned whaling stations served as a warning to her. She felt that humanity often takes what it wants and moves on without considering the consequences.

When I arrived at Ellen’s office, she was finishing a tense conference call. She explained why we need to act now to protect the planet. “Coal, oil, and gas are no longer being made. They are valuable resources we have only once. We need to find ways to use them wisely.” Initially, her message was negative—encouraging people to use less—but she later realized there was a more positive approach. Now, she focuses on reusing materials, passionately discussing things like reusable industrial carpet tiles.

For the past three years, she has been visiting factories, mines, and power stations, speaking with government and business leaders about our dependence on non-renewable resources. “I will never be an expert,” she admits. “But I am like a sponge, soaking up information. I couldn’t ignore the current situation. Compared to this, sailing felt selfish. This is about finding how my voice can be most helpful. It truly matters.”

She also started the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a charity that works with businesses and schools to inspire young people to create a sustainable future. “I do miss the adventure of being at sea,” she says. “It defines who I am. You feel connected to everything around you, and there’s no time to feel lonely. You focus on records, practical matters, and survival. My new message is more complex than just saying, ‘I want to be the fastest around the world.’ I may have been the fastest, but this work is more important than anything I’ve ever done.”"
40,"Jordan Romero is 13 years old and wants to be the youngest person to climb Mount Everest. If he succeeds, he could become very famous among teenagers. He hopes to encourage other young people to explore the outdoors instead of just playing on computers and video games. Jordan's climbing team includes his father, Paul, and mother, Karen. They call themselves ""Team Romero."" Climbing Everest is just one part of their goal. If Jordan climbs both Everest and Vinson Massif in Antarctica, he will be the youngest person to complete the Seven Summits, which are the highest mountains on each continent. Very few people achieve this before turning thirty. Jordan has already climbed five of these mountains and might finish the challenge before he turns 20.

I spoke with several experienced Everest climbers, and none thought it was a good idea to take a 13-year-old up the highest mountain in the world. They believe that while a young climber might be physically strong, they may not be emotionally ready. They also doubt that a teenager has enough experience to make safe decisions while climbing. The Romero family has heard these opinions before. Paul says, ""I know there is criticism, but I can’t focus on it – we have a lot to do. We think about the risks, but we believe our experience as climbers will help us. Watching Jordan grow gives me confidence. He is getting stronger and more mature.""

I also wonder about Jordan’s reasons for wanting to climb. Is it just his father's ambition? Paul insists, ""This project isn’t about me wanting to be famous through my son. At first, Jordan thought it was something to do later in life, but we decided, ‘Why not now?’ We talk to him often to ensure he still wants to do it."" When I ask Jordan what he enjoys about the challenge, he says, ""I just focus on reaching my goal.""

In the past, few people cared about being the youngest or fastest to climb a mountain or sail an ocean. Today, every adventure is shared online, and every climb is seen as a chance to break records. This creates a challenge for Jordan. While some may say that focusing on achievements takes away from the enjoyment of climbing, if he wants to inspire others, he needs to engage with the media. This means blogging, taking photos, and giving interviews. He needs to do something impressive, like climbing Everest. Paul adds, ""If Jordan comes home tomorrow and says he wants to stop climbing and play basketball instead, we will end this project and go to the gym."""
41,"When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, it’s likely they are not listening to classical music. Many people can name many pop groups, but if you ask my friends about Brahms, they usually don’t know who he is. I have just started a music degree, but my classmates know as little about classical music as most people our age. If you don’t know who composed the music, you probably don’t own any of their recordings. This situation is concerning for classical music lovers. Last year, only 3% of concert tickets sold were for classical music events, and the average classical album sells only about 300 copies. This is hard to believe. 

So, why is interest in classical music declining, even though it has existed for centuries? Older people often blame our love for TV and video games for this decline, but I don’t think that’s the reason. The truth is that classical music doesn’t attract most people, especially teenagers, who are the main buyers of music and concert tickets. I know some teenagers who enjoy classical concerts, but they are not the majority. Even though I play in an orchestra, I’m not a big fan of classical music. I enjoy many styles, but my classical music listening is probably close to that 3% figure.

Why don’t teenagers like classical music? First, the pace and rhythm of classical music, with its many mood changes, can be challenging for us. We prefer fast conversations, quick games, and rapid thoughts. Experts say we struggle to pay attention for more than three minutes, which is too short for most classical pieces but perfect for pop songs. Pop music is simple and easy to listen to, while understanding classical music takes time and focus. Additionally, pop music often deals with topics that interest teenagers, while classical music usually does not.

The way we listen to music has also changed. In the past, families would gather to make music together, and playing an instrument was highly valued. Now, you can find any music online, but classical music is rarely part of our daily lives. When was the last time you heard classical music in a store? One of my teachers says that audiences at classical concerts have increased recently. Maybe, but I doubt many of those new attendees are teenagers. In my orchestra, we perform classical music in various places, but when I look at the audience, I mostly see older people. I don’t know why more middle-aged people enjoy classical concerts, but I do know that if your parents love something, you might want to avoid it.

Some people blame schools for teenagers' lack of interest in classical music, but many students are eager to play classical music in their school orchestras. They come early to practice and stay late to rehearse. They enjoy classical music when they perform, but it is not their preferred music outside of that. The two activities have become separate. When we want to relax, we usually choose pop music."
42,"Bonnie Wyndham stepped out of her mother’s car and looked at Almonside School. “I’ll make you regret I came here,” she said with a smile. Her mother was getting out of the other side, so she didn’t hear, but Bonnie didn’t mind. Her mother understood how she felt. Mrs. Wyndham looked around. Almonside was an unusual school, with buildings scattered among the trees on a hillside; it was quite confusing at first. Then she noticed signs on a post: Science block, gymnasium, riding centre… “Riding centre,” Bonnie said, suddenly interested. “Headmaster’s study,” her mother replied. “This way.” Bonnie followed her mother along a wide path that curved between the trees. “I wish you’d walk next to me instead of trailing behind like a dog,” Mrs. Wyndham said tiredly, but she didn’t expect Bonnie to change. A few minutes later, her mother was talking to Bonnie’s new headmaster in his study, while Bonnie waited outside the door. Suddenly, Bonnie stood up. “Why should I just sit here?” she thought. “I’ll be kicked out soon anyway, so I might as well get it over with.” She left the building and walked towards the riding centre, following the sign. 

There was a charming old building for the horses and a large indoor riding area. Bonnie looked around, but no one was there. She approached the horses with a sense of respect. She could see they were well cared for. Almost every stall was occupied, and she walked along, carefully observing each horse. “I know what you’re doing here,” she said to a small pony, gently touching its nose. Then she noticed the next horse. “But aren’t you the best of the bunch!” she exclaimed. He was brown with a bit of white. He looked lively, which Bonnie liked. “I feel like we’ve met before,” she said, stroking his neck. “In my dreams, I was riding you to victory in a big competition…” Above the stall was his name: Maverick. Suddenly, she couldn’t resist the urge to ride him. “I wonder where I can find a bridle and a saddle. It can’t be far.” 

Bonnie was thrilled to find the room with all the riding gear was unlocked. As she focused on putting a saddle on Maverick, she forgot all about her mother and the headmaster. When she climbed onto the big horse outside, she felt like a queen, in control of everything around her. Her nickname at her old school had been Queen Bee, and she laughed as she remembered it. “You’re the best horse I’ve ever ridden, Maverick,” she said with admiration. “I’m serious, I know about horses, even if I don’t know much else.” She nudged him into a walk, then a trot. “If I stay here, I think we could be great friends,” she said. She rode around the paddock, feeling exhilarated as a gentle breeze brushed against her cheek. She sensed that Maverick trusted her, and she was sure he would jump well."
43,"I have met Cody Simpson before and have always admired his calm confidence. The 15-year-old Australian has already released many successful songs. So, how did a relaxed surfer become a performer in front of thousands of fans? Cody explains, “I first picked up a guitar when I was six and started writing songs at seven.” He remembers that swimming and surfing were his main interests back then. “I was busy with my life. At 13, while in high school, I posted a few videos online.” 

These videos changed everything. He started by sharing a video of himself and a friend singing at a school concert. Fans began to comment online, asking for more videos. Cody, who had recorded more songs at home, was happy to share them. The response was amazing. 

Cody was also a talented swimmer. He trained hard with top coaches and focused on improving his skills. However, record labels showed interest in him, and he faced a difficult decision: stay in Australia and continue swimming or take a big risk by signing a deal and moving with his family to the US. Cody decided to take the chance. “It was very hard for me, especially at such a young age, to choose a career. Can you imagine being 12 or 13 and trying to decide what you want to do for the rest of your life?” 

He had to tell his swimming coach and friends that he was moving to the States. “It surprised most people. I’m the quiet kid,” he recalls, remembering their shocked faces. “I’m very modest, and I think it’s important to stay that way in this crazy industry.” So, Cody packed his bags and moved with his family across the world, giving up one dream to pursue another. 

Although his family stays out of the spotlight and is not directly involved in his career, they support him from behind the scenes. Cody believes it’s important to have a close circle of good people around you to stay grounded. Everyone has moments of doubt. “Sometimes when I’m alone, I think, ‘How does my decision affect my little brother and sister?’ My little brother is eight and travels the world, doing school on the road; he doesn’t have a normal life,” Cody admits. “I worry about how this affects him, but my family always reassures me that they support me in everything I do.” 

Success in any career comes from being willing to say ‘yes’ to opportunities, even when it’s scary. “Everything happened so quickly and unexpectedly,” Cody says. “Now, I’m visiting countries I never thought I would see and performing in front of hundreds of thousands of fans. It’s something many people dream of achieving. But I know it won’t last forever.”"
44,"I jumped out of bed, pulled back a corner of the bedroom curtain, and looked down at the river bend. A new crack in the ice sparkled in the morning sun. I shaded my eyes and looked upstream at the sandbags, which were there to protect the buildings from flooding as the ice melted. My back still hurt from lifting the sandbags into place. Last week, I had worked long hours with most of the adults in town, showing that I could handle the job. My grandfather, however, didn’t seem to notice. 

With one hand still on the curtain, I scanned the half-mile stretch of dark water created by the release pipe from the wood processing factory in Milltown. There were fragile ice shelves on both sides, and solid ice further downstream. As I took off my pajamas and put on my kayaking wetsuit, I saw a boy on the other side of the river. I didn’t recognize him. I frowned as I watched him trying to balance on an ice shelf near the warm water from the factory. I zipped up my wetsuit and grabbed my kayaking jacket. I checked the pocket for my lucky chain – a silver chain my famous grandfather brought back from an expedition in South America. This chain is more special to me than having a famous grandfather, as only he, my mom, and I know about it. I also have the diary he kept during that trip, which I read before I sleep. I touched the chain again and went to the kitchen.

“Good morning, Rex,” my mom said with a smile as I took a banana from the counter. “You’re up early for a Saturday. I’ll make brunch after your training session. Be careful.” 

“Thanks, Mom.” I walked down the hallway and almost bumped into my tall grandfather as he came out of his bedroom. 

“Can’t you watch where you’re going?” he shouted. “Where are you going?” 

“Sorry, Grandpa. I’m going kayaking.” It was obvious from my wetsuit, and he had seen me in my kayak every morning. I tried to ignore his anger, but it was getting harder. 

“What’s the point of training? You didn’t win the competition,” he said. His harsh words hit me hard, but I took a deep breath and counted to three. He walked away and slammed the bathroom door. My mom came in with a sympathetic smile. 

“Don’t mind him. He’s…” 

“...not himself at the moment,” I finished for her. I wanted to say he had always been like this, but I tried to be understanding. When I was younger, he was my hero, especially when he showed me photos of himself in National Geographic. Those old photos still hang on his bedroom wall, along with his dusty medals and trophies. But I don’t go into his room anymore. I have my own growing collection of trophies, and maybe one day, my own face in National Geographic. Still, a part of me wants to stay loyal to him, this grumpy old man. 

Mom smiled. “At least he’s coming out of his bedroom more. Have a good session, Rex. I admire your determination to keep going, even in this cold weather!” 

I smiled back as I peeled my banana. “It’ll be warmer in South America if I find sponsors for my expedition.” She laughed and went back to the kitchen. I finished my banana and went downstairs. Stepping into the backyard, I hurried towards the boathouse."
45,"Mum grabbed Jess by the arm. ""Come with me,"" she said. Jess followed her into the study, where she saw an unframed painting on the table, leaning against the wall. It was clearly one of Grandpa's works, but it looked different from his usual style and was obviously unfinished. ""Do you know anything about this?"" Mum asked. Jess shook her head. ""I've never seen it before. I didn't know he was working on anything."" 

Jess looked closely at the painting. It showed a river that took up most of the scene; it wasn't a river she recognized and might not even be real, just a fantasy. The painting was strange and beautiful in a haunting way. The riverbank was barely visible, with just a hint of green that made the viewer focus on the pale waters leading to a hidden sea. There were no animals, birds, or people in the painting, and it felt right that way. It seemed like there was no place for living things in this distant image. Still, she found it captivating, thinking about autumn coming after a long summer.

Mum spoke again. ""It has a name."" There was something in her voice that showed her excitement, even though she tried to sound casual. Jess understood why. Grandpa never named his paintings; he just painted them and let others interpret them. Mum turned the painting over and pointed to the words Grandpa had written. Jess read them aloud: ""River Boy."" The words felt strangely significant to her, but she couldn't explain why. 

Then she noticed something else. She looked at Mum. ""There is no boy."" 

""Exactly. It's strange, isn't it? For him to be so specific. But maybe he will add the boy later since he hasn't finished it yet. I made the mistake of asking him about it."" 

""Mum! You should have known better."" 

""I know, but I couldn't help it. It's such an unusual painting, especially with a name. You can guess his response."" 

Jess didn't need to guess; she knew what Grandpa would say. ""He told you it's not the artist's job to explain a painting because each one has its own life and language, just like a poem, and we either understand it or we don't. He said painting is hard enough without having to explain it to every fool..."" 

""… every ignoramus,"" she added. 

""… every ignoramus about what it means. If artists had to explain their work to everyone who asked, they would never get anything done. And he said..."" Mum interrupted, laughing. ""Something like that. Anyway, I was hoping you might know something about this painting since you seem to inspire him."" 

""Inspire?"" 

""Yes, someone who motivates an artist."" Jess understood the term. Grandpa often used it when she watched him paint, but he usually meant that the muse wasn't helping him that day or that he needed to be nice to the muse because he had a tough part to work on. He never suggested that the muse was her. In fact, she always thought he meant some kind of goddess, not a real person. It was hard to imagine anyone, even a goddess, influencing someone as stubborn as Grandpa. 

""He doesn't need me to inspire him,"" she said. ""He's been painting all his life."""
46,"When I woke up this morning, I didn’t plan to cut a hole in my bedroom carpet. I’m not saying it was an accident, but it could have been. For example, if I had tripped over the bed with Dad’s Stanley knife in my hand, the blade might have accidentally gone into the carpet and made a big cut. That’s something that could have happened, but I’m not saying it did. I just want to clarify that I didn’t intend to damage the carpet. I didn’t wake up thinking, “Today I will cut a hole in my carpet.” It just seemed like a good idea at the moment, as often happens. Later, I wondered why I thought that, but by then it was too late. This kind of thing happens to me quite often. I feel unlucky in that way.

What I was really doing was trying to find a way to fit my corner cabinet into a corner. My grandmother gave me the cabinet when she moved from her house to a flat. It’s very cute! It’s small, painted white, with pink and blue flowers around the edge, and it has tiny glass doors. My grandmother used to keep china ornaments in it, like shepherdesses and old-fashioned ladies selling balloons. Now, I keep my collection of shells, fossils, and interesting stones there. My grandmother knew I loved her corner cabinet, so I was very excited when she gave it to me!

The problem is that it is a corner cabinet, which means it has to fit in a corner. I only have two corners in my bedroom because it’s the smallest room in the house, shaped like a wedge of cheese. The big front bedroom belongs to my parents, the back one is my sister Angela’s, the little one over the garage is my brother Tom’s, and my room is the size of a broom cupboard. My mother says that when Angela goes to university, Tom can have her room, and I can have his. Then, when Tom goes to university, I can choose any room. But since Angela is only fifteen, I think I will be stuck in my small room for a long time. 

I don’t really mind; I like my little bedroom. It’s cozy, like a nest. I love the sloping roof and the window at floor level. The only problem is the lack of corners! My bed is in one corner, and my wardrobe is in the other. I tried to fit my grandmother’s cabinet into the space between the roof and the floor, but it was just a little too tall. I thought, if I can’t cut anything off the cabinet, how about cutting a hole in the carpet? It seemed like the obvious solution. What Dad calls lateral thinking. I thought he would be pleased with me because he always tells us to “think outside the box.” And that’s exactly what I was doing!"
47,"The novel ""The Borrowers"" tells the story of a family of tiny people who live secretly in the walls and floors of a house. They ""borrow"" items from regular-sized people to survive. When I was asked to direct a TV adaptation of this novel, I knew it would be challenging to meet people's expectations. Fans of the book have strong opinions about how everything should look. I relied a lot on the original illustrations because I wanted to avoid criticism for getting it wrong.

The author wanted the series to show the story from the Borrowers' point of view, not from the humans'. This made filming more complicated. A key aspect was getting the size right. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans, so when we filmed them walking across a room or going on their borrowing adventures, we had to position the camera ten times further away than usual. To capture the Borrowers' perspective, the crew had to crawl on the ground and film from no higher than 15 centimeters. They went through many pairs of jeans!

We only raised the cameras for aerial shots. One major challenge was creating realistic shadows when combining the tiny Borrowers with the normal-sized background. We developed a special technique for this. After the series aired, famous director George Lucas called to ask how we achieved it.

The only permanent set we built was the Borrowers' home under the floorboards, filled with oversized objects to make the actors appear small. It was wonderfully surreal. I remember asking them to carry giant scissors, and they really embraced the idea. The coins we used were larger than dinner plates and hard to lift, which often made the crew laugh. 

In the story, there is a scene where the Borrowers are swept down a drain. To film this, the actors had to be pushed down a tunnel with hoses, and they found it so scary that they didn’t need to act. 

Getting the costumes right was very important to me, and it had been a challenge for other directors in previous adaptations. I had the costumes made from heavy canvas so they would stick out like doll clothes. This made it very difficult for the lead actress to move; she couldn’t sit down during breaks and had to be sewn into her dress every morning. The lead actor's trousers were made from a rug because regular fabric would have looked too smooth. Unfortunately, it was very hot during filming, and I don’t think they appreciated my attention to detail!

Most of the action away from the Borrowers' home was filmed with the actors in front of a blue screen on an empty set. It was hard for them to react to things that weren’t really there. I had to draw pictures of each scene to show how they should look, and by the end, I had created 2,000 drawings. They weren’t perfect, but they were helpful. 

We didn’t have enough budget for special effects studios during the day, so I worked nights for three months. We had to work quickly; once, I filmed an entire scene before realizing there was no film in the camera. In the end, everything came together, and I believe the series successfully captured the magic of the books."
48,"Mom stops the car at the corner of my new school, Palm Grove High School. She looks around nervously, expecting to see journalists, but there are none. I wonder how long it will take for the chaos to start. It always does. The fake smiles, the people who want to be my friends, and the ones who will ask for free tickets to my dad’s concerts. “Everything will be fine,” I tell her. She kisses her fingertip and touches my cheek before I get out of the car. Then she drives away, leaving me alone in this new school and situation. But this is what I wanted. I wanted to escape my old life of touring and private tutors. While the rest of the band is renting here for recording, we are staying for good. I insisted on coming to this school because I want to meet regular kids for a change. I want to meet kids with parents who have normal jobs, like working in an office or cutting grass. That would be so cool and normal.

I walk into the school’s main office. “Hi, I need my schedule, please,” I say to the school secretary. “Name?” she asks, looking unfriendly. “Desert McGraw.” “Desirée?” she asks, leaning closer. “Desert,” I repeat. The secretary seems confused. “Oh,” she says and types “McGraw” on her keyboard. That’s one good thing; few people recognize my last name because my dad uses his stage name. “What grade?” she asks. “Eleventh.” “One moment, it’s printing,” she replies. Then she tears the sheet and hands it to me. English Literature is my first class. Great, I can handle that. English has always been my favorite subject. But I’ll be late. English is in Room 214 on the second floor. I studied the map the night before so I wouldn’t look foolish searching for my classes.

When I reach the door, I hear the teacher taking attendance. “Aurelio Gonzalez.” “Here.” I slip in quietly and sit at the last desk in the second row. The girl next to me smiles and looks at my very normal outfit—jeans and a T-shirt. No one will suspect me now! “Nice shoes,” she whispers. I look down at my expensive shoes with tan embroidered flowers. Oh no, I shouldn’t have worn these. “Thanks,” I say. The teacher pauses. “Desert... McGraw?” she says carefully. “Here.” The teacher smiles and introduces herself as Ms. Smigla. She talks a lot and eventually gives us our course outlines. After we review them and she tells us about the books we will read this year, she actually lets us socialize! All teachers should understand how important this is.

“So why did you move here?” my new friend asks. I have a few options. Should I say it’s because I wanted a normal life away from cameras and reporters? Or the real reason, according to Dad? “We need a change, Desert,” he said, “and this is the perfect place to record the new album. Energy, color, culture... just what our last album needed.” Essence? I think he just wants to relax on the beach. Why else would they choose South Beach Sounds, a recording studio so close to the sand? “My dad had to relocate,” I tell her. Yes, lies are easier. “What does he do?” she asks. Oh well, everyone will find out eventually. But at least I can pretend to be normal for a while. “He’s an artist,” I say, fiddling with the zipper on my backpack. “Cool. I’m Becca, by the way.” And she doesn’t seem to care much. Great."
49,"Not only is the average American teenage girl expected to be the president of the Student Council, but she also needs to have a part-time job, volunteer, and excel in all these areas. This is what it means to be a teenager in America today. Both boys and girls cannot just go to school and blend in; being average is no longer enough. Mediocrity is not acceptable, and not having high ambitions is seen as laziness. 

Kristen Loose, a teenager, points out that many adults forget how much pressure teenagers face today. They have a lot of homework, tests, extracurricular activities, jobs, chores, and responsibilities at home, all while trying to maintain a social life. Despite these stresses being common, negative stereotypes about teenagers still exist, often spread by the media. These stereotypes include being lazy, disrespectful, rebellious, loud, reckless, and self-centered. While some teenagers may fit these descriptions, many believe it is unfair to label an entire generation this way.

Kristen Loose believes that many people wrongly assume teenagers spend most of their time watching TV or using their phones. She admits to having her phone nearby most of the time, but not for trivial reasons. For her, it is a tool that helps make life easier. Today, students are expected to have quick access to information and to be reachable at all times, which can create the impression of a phone addiction. With smartphones, tablets, and social media, students can do their homework anywhere, and instead of just listening to music on the way to school, they might be listening to language lessons.

Schoolwork and other activities now require attention around the clock, which adds to the burden on already busy teenagers. Many start their days around 6 a.m. or 7 a.m. and often finish after midnight. Their schedules are filled with school, after-school activities, family responsibilities, and homework. They then have to wake up and do it all over again the next day, often getting less than the recommended nine hours of sleep. A survey by the US National Sleep Foundation found that only about 20 percent of American teenagers get the recommended amount of sleep, and 28 percent admitted to falling asleep in school about once a week due to lack of sleep.

Teenager Lindamarie Olsen believes that after all her activities, she has about 18 hours of free time each week. With 168 hours in a week, 18 hours is not much. Olsen rarely spends this time on social media or TV; instead, she dedicates it to volunteer work. She thinks the stereotype of teenagers is that they are self-centered and only care about their own interests. However, she enjoys volunteering and looks forward to making a positive impact in her school and community.

In 20 years, the stereotype of teenagers may change, but they will continue to challenge these views and push the world forward. There will always be a new generation of students making a difference before they even finish school."
50,"The teenage members of the Earth to Sky Calculus Club live in Bishop, a mountain town in the US, surrounded by wilderness east of the Sierra Nevada mountains. In recent years, this small group has launched over fifty balloons to the edge of space, about 35 km above the Earth. This ongoing science project combines astronomy with adventure, which is likely why teenagers are drawn to it. I joined them one weekend in late spring as they prepared to release a high-altitude balloon to capture images of shooting stars. Shooting stars happen when a rock or metal piece from space enters the Earth's atmosphere, creating a bright trail of light.

As night falls, the teenagers attach a soft insulated $5 lunch box to the bottom of the balloon. Inside, there is a camera, an altitude measuring device, and a thermometer to track temperature changes during the ascent. Two GPS trackers are placed on the outside of the lunch box to help them find it later. They use a gas tank, donated by a supporter from a nearby state, to inflate the balloon, which gradually expands to the size of a small car. An older boy made a seven-hour round trip to get the tank, but he didn’t mind. For the kids in this club, such efforts are normal.

Finally, it’s time for lift-off. They count down, “Five, four, three, two, one,” and the balloon starts to rise. Some of the teenagers run after it, shining powerful flashlights to track its path in the dark sky. There is a moment of silence and a shared sense of wonder as the balloon disappears into the night. After the launch, most students go home, but a few stay to watch for shooting stars. They lie on blankets on the mountainside, gazing at a sky so clear that it’s hard to believe they are only four hours from Los Angeles, a busy city with around 4 million people. I see a boy climb into a sleeping bag and quickly fall asleep. “We’re the only ones talking,” one girl whispers. “I know,” replies another. Suddenly, a meteor streaks across the sky.

As the balloon rises, the air pressure decreases, causing it to expand until it nearly reaches the size of a house. Then it pops with a loud bang. A parachute helps the lunch box land safely back on Earth. The students will retrieve it the next day using the GPS trackers. Finding it is not easy, but that’s part of the fun. There is little inhabited land around Bishop, so the lunch box usually lands in a remote area. “Recoveries are a big part of the program,” says the group’s leader, noting they have only lost two lunch boxes in 53 launches. “This journey helps us get to know the landscape in a way we normally wouldn’t.”

On this occasion, the lunch box landed 84 km west of Bishop, but the recovery team had to drive south of the Sierra and then back up the western side of the mountains. They had to decide whether to drive or walk, as it could be dangerous if the lunch box landed on a high peak or in a tall tree. “These students are familiar with the Eastern Sierra,” their leader explains. “What seems wild and risky to some is just a normal part of life for others.” In the end, it took them 11 hours to find the lunch box, which was in a canyon on a flat rock near a waterfall. Unfortunately, the camera did not capture any shooting stars. While this was disappointing, it provided a chance to discuss atmospheric waves and their effects above mountain ridges. It also became another exciting story to share with anyone who asks."
51,"Chloe Morgan admits that she was not very interested in science, especially Palaeontology, until she turned fifteen. Her interest began by chance when her younger brother was fascinated by dinosaurs, a phase she had not gone through. She helped him with a science project and found an article about recent discoveries in Palaeontology that amazed her. She realized that this was a field she wanted to pursue.

I asked Chloe about the support she received, as Palaeontology was not a common career choice for young people at that time. She recalled meeting her first professional palaeontologist, Matt Cornelius, who was already well-known despite his youth. Although she was nervous, he was friendly and patient, which made her feel more comfortable.

I also asked Chloe about how palaeontologists are portrayed in movies and TV shows. She expressed that films like Jurassic Park have increased public interest in dinosaurs, but they often misrepresent palaeontologists. She feels that they are usually shown as either quirky geniuses or socially awkward individuals, which does not reflect the reality of their work.

Chloe explained that her job is very diverse. She spends time digging for dinosaur bones, working in laboratories to analyze fossils, and writing scientific papers. Although not always required, she believes it is important to communicate scientific findings to the public, especially to young people. She wants to inspire them to learn about science, using dinosaurs as a way to spark their interest in the natural world.

The recent TV documentary Walking with Dinosaurs gave Chloe a chance to influence how dinosaurs are shown on screen. She noted that the producers were knowledgeable, and her role was mainly to ensure accuracy, such as confirming that the dinosaurs depicted lived during the same time period. The documentary attracted viewers of all ages because it presented dinosaurs in a way that was much more realistic than in movies like Jurassic Park.

Chloe believes that dinosaurs continue to captivate us and remain a focus of research because they appeal to our sense of exploration. They represent the unknown and the excitement of discovery. In a world that feels smaller, prehistoric creatures remind us that there is still much to learn, and Palaeontology offers a unique way to explore the past."
52,"When you travel by car with your family, even if you are just six years old, you probably know that you are not “there yet,” even if you keep asking, “Are we there yet?” The truth is, once you arrive, it’s not “there” anymore; it’s “here.” So if you think you might be “there,” you should really be asking, “Are we here yet?” I’m sure no one wishes to be “there” more than the parents who hear that question repeatedly on long trips.

Think about it: wouldn’t you rather relax in the back seat, with no responsibilities? You could watch DVDs, listen to music, or do puzzles while enjoying the beautiful views outside. Meanwhile, your parents are in the front seat, managing snacks and the radio, making sure everything runs smoothly.

But then, something unexpected happens—usually caused by my younger brother, Tim. He might put his foot on my side of the seat. I can’t let that happen, so I put my foot on his side. Soon, he’s invading my space, and a fight breaks out. Our parents have to reach back to separate us while driving, telling Tim to stay in his own seat. This calms things down for a bit, and we continue to enjoy the scenery.

Later, while I’m trying to read, I feel a draft on my arm. The window isn’t open, so where is it coming from? Tim is next to me, quietly blowing air in my direction. He’s not touching me, so he thinks he’s being clever. This makes me angry, and the tension rises again. Tim gets scolded, and the car swerves a bit. Eventually, things calm down again.

Over the years, Dad has come up with ways to handle us in the back seat. When we ask, “Are we there yet?” he often replies, “Yes, we’re here. Get out of the car.” When we point out that we are still on the highway, he says, “Oh, then maybe we’re not there yet.” This usually keeps us quiet for a while. 

You can tell when you finally arrive because the adults quickly get out of the car and move away from the kids who have bothered them for hours. So remember: if your parents are still close enough to answer your question, the answer is no, you are not there yet."
53,"John and Zuzi Morgan have opened a café in Oxford, UK, where people can enjoy coffee, cake, and play board games. They hope that customers will love the experience and want to come back. Zuzi explains their motivation: “There’s so much technology today. Everyone is busy with their phones and gadgets. We wanted to bring people together in a way that doesn’t involve staring at screens. It’s natural for people to connect and communicate with each other.”

The games played in their café are called ‘Eurogames’. These games often have gentle themes, like farming and building landscapes. The first Eurogame was The Settlers of Catan, created by German designer Klaus Teuber. In this game, players build settlements on an island and trade resources, keeping everyone engaged until the end, so no one feels left out. This idea was further developed in ‘co-operative’ games, where all players either win or lose together, encouraging more social interaction. One popular co-operative game is Pandemic, designed by North American Matt Leacock. In Pandemic, players work together to solve global problems. Leacock was inspired by a Eurogame called Lord of the Rings, which is based on the famous book. He recalls, “When I played that with friends, we felt scared and excited. In the end, everyone felt good, whether they won or lost. I wanted to create something similar.”

Leacock’s love for board games started when he was a child. He enjoyed receiving games as birthday gifts but often felt disappointed when they didn’t meet his expectations. With help from his game-loving uncle, he began redesigning games to make them better. Pandemic became a huge success, and its follow-up introduced even more storytelling. Leacock explains, “It’s like an electronic game where you develop characters, gain new rules, and the story evolves.”

Interestingly, the rise of video games has helped the popularity of modern board games. Many people now play games on their smartphones, making them more open to playing board games. Ben Hogg, who works for a major games company, says, “Everyone plays mobile games now. Most people with smartphones have at least one game they enjoy.” 

For a while, video games allowed for social interaction in places like arcades or through multiplayer games played together in the same room. However, as multiplayer games moved online, players became more distant from each other. This led some people to seek out ways to play games with others in person again. 

As seen in John and Zuzi's busy café, tabletop gaming has become more than just entertainment. In our increasingly online world, games are now something to be shared directly and physically, and this trend is likely to continue."
54,"Jamie Scott has written and produced some of the biggest hits in the UK in recent years. His story shows that endurance and persistence are important in the music industry, even if your career starts with many setbacks. He mentions that his mother was an ""amazing singer"" who encouraged him to play the guitar. The only radio station he listened to at home was one aimed at middle-aged people, which influenced his musical taste as he grew up. He was 12 years old when he first heard a modern song. Around the same time, he had to choose between playing tennis, which he did at a national level, and pursuing music. He spent his school lunchtimes in the music room learning songs on the piano. He recalls, ""I was quite good at tennis, but it wasn’t what I wanted to do for my whole life. It was just too much hard work.""

At 17, he left school to become a performer. He formed a duo with a friend who was a good guitarist but not as passionate about performing. Jamie remembers telling his parents, ""This is what I want to do. I’ve been writing lyrics in economics class and playing the piano every day while others were outside."" His father gave him 18 months to succeed in music; if he didn’t, he would need to find a job. After several close calls with record labels, he was signed by a music publisher at 19 based on one song. However, the labels wanted him to be a solo artist, so he had to part ways with his friend.

Eventually, he found success behind the scenes rather than on stage. After a tough time with a UK record label, he asked to leave and joined another label to release a new album, but fame did not come right away. He reflects, ""I feel like I’ve been in the wrong place at the wrong time for much of my artist career, but as a writer, I’ve been in the right place at the right time."" Writing for other artists is where he truly found his success. He believes he is one of the main writers that UK labels turn to for new artists, helping them launch their careers.

Sometimes, he has to reassure the artists he works with that aiming for chart success is not something to be ashamed of. He asks them, ""Don’t you want 10 million people streaming your music next month?"" He emphasizes that they should aim to create something amazing that will also sell well. It is refreshing to hear someone in pop music speak openly about wanting to write hit songs. Jamie is not arrogant; he simply understands that he wants to write number one hits and has the talent to do so. Instead of worrying about how others perceive him, he focuses on his goals. He states, ""When I go into the studio with someone, we need to aim for global success and write the best music for next year. It’s not just about what’s trendy; we want to create classic modern pop songs."""
55,"Tony Connor is a new kind of celebrity. He is very popular online, but many people, like me, may not know him because we don’t watch videos of people doing bike stunts. He is known as a ‘street trials cyclist.’ This means he jumps from difficult places, like roofs or walls, to land safely in other challenging spots. These stunts are recorded and shared online.

On the day I interview him, we meet at a BMX park on a Saturday morning. The local kids all recognize him, and several older people come over to show their respect, calling him ‘an absolute legend.’ After watching him perform, I agree with them. Even though I came with some doubts, I am impressed by his bravery, creativity, and willingness to take risks. Before each stunt, he explains what he plans to do, and sometimes I can’t believe he will succeed. However, when I compliment him afterward, he seems uninterested and a bit down.

Despite his online fame, Tony says he is not comfortable with being a celebrity. He finds the social aspect challenging. He understands the importance of connecting with fans, but he prefers to focus on doing stunts rather than talking about them. This is ironic because his fame comes from social media and the small cameras that capture his stunts. He reflects, “This technology allows people like me to earn a living.” He feels that many people are always recording themselves or looking at screens, and he doesn’t fully agree with that.

Tony is not complaining, though. He makes a good income from his videos, which would have just been a hobby for someone in the past. After years of interviewing top athletes, I’ve learned that two key factors turn a passionate child into a top competitor: energy and the ability to handle emotional disappointment. These traits can be more important than talent and help someone keep going despite failures. In riskier sports, it is even more important to have mental strength.

Even at the park, Tony fell a few times on what he considered easy but new challenges. He simply got back up and kept trying until he succeeded. Not everyone sees Tony as a hero. Some people think he is reckless and takes too many risks. He responds, “Those who criticize me may be worried, but they don’t understand. They probably have never ridden a trials bike and don’t know much about the sport. They don’t realize I get advice from experts to reduce risks.”

In reality, Tony is careful about the risks he takes. He explains, “People are different. Some never feel scared, and they shouldn’t be doing these sports. It’s important to recognize the dangers. The rest of us can be divided into those who can overcome fear and those who can’t. I belong to the group that feels fear but finds a way to move past it. I’m not addicted to risk; I spend a lot of time planning and preparing. Sometimes, I ride around for a while to get in the right mindset before trying a new stunt. I know I must stay calm just before I jump. If I fully commit, I’ll be fine.”"
56,"Television presenter Helen Skelton has taken on many dangerous challenges for charity, such as running a marathon in the desert and traveling down the Amazon River in a small boat. For her latest challenge, Helen walked on a high wire, which is a long, thin piece of metal, 66 meters above the ground, between two towers of an empty power station. There was no safety net; she only had a belt around her waist connected to another wire above her. To help her balance and avoid falling, she carried a long stick that weighed eight kilograms. 

Helen trained with an expert high-wire walker. Although she had some circus skills, she found that high-wire walking was very different. “The training was a shock,” Helen said. “I didn’t realize how strong I needed to be. Every day started at 8 am with a run up a steep hill, followed by an hour of exercises, and then another hour practicing on the wire. I also had to learn how to fall onto the wire so I could keep going if I slipped. Every time I fell, it hurt a lot. But it was important to stay positive: if I got nervous and started shaking, the wire would shake too!”

On the day of the challenge, it was windy, and Helen calmed herself by taking deep breaths as she moved step by step along the wire. The 150-meter walk took 15 minutes. “That was the scariest thing I’ve done,” she said afterward. “I’m glad it’s over!” Despite this experience, Helen is already planning her next charity project: to reach the South Pole by skiing, kiting, and biking."
57,"In 2006, Jeff Somers started a journey around the world on a penny farthing, an old-style bicycle with one large wheel and one small wheel. He had previously written a book about his travels in Canada using a 50-year-old car. Jeff loved motorsport and worked building racing car engines. To save money, he rode an old bicycle to work and also used it for a holiday in Amsterdam. He said, “That trip opened my eyes,” and decided he wanted to see the world by bike. Instead of a regular touring bike, he wanted to build one himself. He thought the most unique bike would be a penny farthing, so he visited a museum to learn how they were made.

After two attempts in 2001 and 2003, which ended because of a knee injury, he finally began his journey in 2006. He traveled for three years, visiting 23 countries across four continents. The highlight of his trip was reaching Tibet and seeing Mount Everest. He met other cyclists who could ride up mountains, but he never regretted using his penny farthing. The further he traveled from home, the more people were amazed by his bike.

His toughest experience was when he had to drink dirty water from a stream, which made him very sick. He spent ten days in a hostel without medicine and had no money for a hospital or to return home. Despite these challenges, Jeff now says, “If I could afford it, I would start traveling again tomorrow on my penny farthing.”"
58,"I work at a university in the US with my team, and we are studying water birds, especially the American black duck. We have recently started using a new tool called a ‘night-vision scope’ that helps us see the ducks in the dark. We are concerned about black ducks because their population has decreased significantly, and we are unsure if there is enough food for them on the east coast. We have a lot of information about their activities during the day, but we know very little about what they do at night because we did not have the right equipment. This new scope will give us clear images, even on nights without a moon, allowing us to learn more and make better decisions about protecting their habitat.

Our work is challenging. There are four of us, and each of us works six hours a day. We have studied ducks in various locations, and I have had to take a boat to some sites to record every duck I see. The weather has been difficult; some nights are warm, but most are rainy. It is so quiet that I have needed a lot of coffee to stay awake! We have only missed one workday because the snow was too deep for our special vehicles. Despite the challenges, I enjoy this work, especially when I think about the summer, which will involve long hours in a laboratory analyzing our results together. Being inside will be tough, but it is necessary, and I wouldn’t change this experience for anything!"
59,"Whenever I tell people about my job, they often find it hard to believe it exists. But I’m serious! I spend my workdays tasting chocolate! Tasting is a crucial part of ensuring that customers receive perfect, high-quality chocolate from my company. Each week, I get samples, which are small amounts of chocolate from our factory, and I need to check them for taste, texture, and smell. I also taste the raw materials we use, like nuts and fruit, to select the best ones for our chocolate. 

Next to my office, I have a kitchen where I can test and taste the products I create, and I keep my colleagues happy by sharing samples! My kitchen is filled with machines and ingredients to experiment with. It’s great to have a private space to go to during the day. No two days are the same in this job. Sometimes I work in our food lab, and other times I travel abroad to buy raw materials, which can be challenging since I have a young family. However, I enjoy the variety and lack of routine in my work, although I think the chocolate itself is the best part! 

People often ask me if I ever get bored of chocolate. I’ve worked with it for a long time, and I’ve never felt tired of eating it. In fact, I often go home and enjoy more chocolate in the evening!"
60,"Have you ever thought about what it’s like to perform in a circus? Sophia Grayson works at Circus Experience, a center that teaches young people circus skills. She says her course is popular because it offers many different skills, such as juggling, throwing and catching objects like balls or even fire, and trapeze, which involves flying through the air in front of an amazed audience. 

During the year-long course, students gradually take more risks in each class, and parents can attend some classes to see their progress. Sophia explains, “To have a career in the circus, performers need to avoid doing the same thing repeatedly – it’s essential to keep performances exciting and full of action. If you want to be successful in the circus, you must keep practicing. Another great aspect is the friendships formed with other performers and the opportunity to learn from them. Staying fit is also very important – circus artists, like athletes, train every day to stay strong. Training is crucial, but the best performers are those who are determined to succeed, have creativity, and continuously work on improving their skills. 

People often think that circus performers are likely to get injured or that they only work for a short time each year. However, the real challenge is planning for the future because you can only perform while you’re young, and then you need to think about other options.” The course also includes business planning. Many former students have started their own businesses around the world and are happy to share their experiences. However, Sophia warns that it’s not a profession for making a lot of money! “The work usually does not provide a regular salary. It’s also competitive – but it’s a lot of fun!”"
61,"You may not know her name or face, but you have likely heard her many times. Mariam Hobson is a professional backing singer, which means she sings in the background to support the main singer. Many people think backing singers are not as talented as lead singers, but that is not true—they often have to be even better. People like Mariam are the true stars of the music industry!

“What I love about my job is that when I enter the recording studio, I never know what I will be asked to sing,” she says. “It could be classical, jazz, hip-hop, or rock. Sometimes, it might even be a silly tune for a radio station or an advertisement. I am often surprised by what producers ask for. Once, I was asked to sing like a fish underwater! But I never complain; I just do my job!”

“Excellent musical skills are very important for my work, along with the ability to learn quickly. There is often no sheet music to follow. I will never forget my first experience recording background music for a film. It was very complicated because there were eight of us, each singing a different part, along with an orchestra. I was scared because I knew that if I made a mistake, we would have to record everything again, which nobody likes. Recording sessions are already long enough!”

“One of my favorite jobs is recording for songwriters. Less experienced writers sometimes do not know which musical range works best for a female voice. By listening to me sing their song, they can figure out how to improve it.”"
62,"Julie Deane started with only basic knowledge of fashion, but she built a successful business selling ‘satchels,’ which are traditional bags used by schoolchildren. These satchels are now sold in famous shops and are popular among many celebrities. Before deciding to sell satchels, Julie considered various business ideas, such as cake decorating and party planning, instead of just going with her first thought. 

When she chose to focus on satchels, not everyone supported her idea. Julie recalls, “Many said there was no demand for them – but I was convinced.” She involved her family from the beginning, working with her mother, who had never had a career but had a natural talent for business. The design of the satchels was inspired by children’s storybooks. 

Although Julie was not familiar with fashion blogs, they played a key role in her success. Initially, she sold about one satchel a week. To generate interest, she sent satchels to fashion writers, hoping they would write about them in their blogs. They did, and interest in her products grew, along with the speed at which her company produced the satchels. Now, Julie enjoys waiting to see which celebrity will be seen with a satchel next!

While other companies spend money on online advertising, Julie uses the internet community to gather ideas for new and exciting styles. There was a difficult time when another company copied her satchel design to sell similar products. Because of this, she now ensures she has confidence in her production team, just as she does in her own staff. Visitors often comment on the positive atmosphere in her offices, where people enjoy working. There is now a new factory, and while the buildings are important, it is the team that makes the workplace special."
63,"When Vicky Harmiston was a child, her parents allowed her and her brother Jamie to choose how they spent their free time. Vicky enjoyed playing many sports. She was a good swimmer, and her coach believed she had the potential to become a champion. However, the swimming club was far from her home, making it hard for her to balance training with her schoolwork. 

As teenagers, Jamie, who loved cycling, bought a special racing bike and began competing. Vicky found this exciting and decided to try cycling too. She later said it was the best choice she ever made. Soon, she was cycling every day and doing very well. The cycling track was close to her school, so attending training sessions after school was easy for her. Vicky had a successful career in track cycling and won several competitions. When she turned 28, she retired from competitive cycling. Vicky explained, “For years, I loved winning, but I started to feel tired of it all. When the excitement fades, it loses its meaning. Fortunately, I found a new career.”

Vicky now works for a charity called CycleZone. She said, “We help young people who have never enjoyed sports. The first thing we do is teach them how to ride a bike. We want them to believe in themselves and their abilities. CycleZone does important work and brings young people together, making them feel part of a larger community.” The charity uses celebrities to promote their work. Vicky mentioned, “Some people doubt that celebrity support is always good for a charity. They argue that celebrities may be more interested in their own image, which can distract from the charity's real work. But if famous singers and actors can help, I believe they should.”"
64,"Singer-songwriter Ana Ronson grew up in Ireland. Even though her parents were not musicians, music was always present in her home. Her grandfather played the guitar and taught Ana and her brother how to play. The first time Ana sang in front of an audience was at school, and she was so nervous that her teacher had to help her off the stage. This teacher suggested that Ana join the school theatre club to build her confidence. After participating in the club for some time, she happily sang with 50 other students at a concert at the end of the term.

A year later, her brother, who was in a band, asked her to write a song for them. She wrote her first song, ""Falling Stars,"" in just three days and enjoyed it so much that she signed up for a songwriting course with a professional songwriter. Although she was the youngest student, she already knew more about music than many of her classmates. However, Ana felt that the teacher did not listen to her ideas, which inspired her to write the song ""Something to Say"" about her frustration. She shared this song online, and it became very popular. She was thrilled when people commented that they loved it and found new meanings in the lyrics each time they listened.

Joss Alton, the owner of a recording company called Isotope Music, traveled from the other side of Ireland to invite her to join his company. At first, Ana was unsure because she did not know much about Isotope and did not want anyone telling her what to sing. However, Joss convinced her that this would not happen. Soon after, she performed at a concert in Dublin organized by Isotope, and all the tickets sold out quickly, making it a wonderful evening.

Ana prefers to write songs about difficult times rather than happy moments, as she feels she has more to express during those times. One of her favorite songs is ""Decision,"" which is about why her brother stopped singing for a while and how unhappy it made him. While she hopes her fans will enjoy her music, her goal is to write about personal experiences that are important to her."
65,"Last year, I went on an incredible trip – a guided boat tour along the west coast of Canada. It was my brother Harry’s idea. He is a journalist, like me, and wanted to write articles about the journey. He loves boats, which is not something I share with him. However, I had always dreamed of visiting this area since I saw it on TV as a child, especially because it was where our great-grandparents lived before moving to Europe. I kept asking Harry if I could join him until he finally said yes!

A few days before our trip, there were storms in the area we were going to. Fortunately, the weather forecast for our time there predicted calm seas. I was busy with work and didn’t have much time to prepare, but Harry assured me he would handle everything, so I stopped worrying.

After we arrived in Canada, we met the group, packed our limited supplies into small boats, and set off. The guide told us that very few people live along that coast now, and indeed, the only other living creatures we saw that first morning were dolphins and birds. We could see islands in the distance, but the early-morning fog made it hard to see far, so I focused on the beautiful patterns our boat made in the water.

We often stopped for hours to explore the rock pools on the beaches. They were full of colorful fish, many of which I didn’t recognize. It was wonderful to forget about how fast or slow the day was going. We always remembered to have lunch and dinner, which we cooked together over campfires. Each evening, when we fell asleep on the boats, even though the beds were hard, it felt like a stress-free life!

When it was time to leave, I felt sad. How could I go back to normal life? But I knew I would miss my family and friends if I stayed. I was also excited to share our adventures with everyone back home!"
66,"My dad was a professional basketball player in Germany, just like his father before him. When I was a child, I went to many of his games. You might think that watching so many matches would make me love basketball, but it actually did the opposite. I enjoyed telling my friends how good my dad was, especially when he won, but I often brought a book to read instead of watching the games.

When I started secondary school, I was still two years away from being a teenager, but I was already two meters tall. Because of my height, my sports teacher asked if I wanted to train with the basketball team. I liked the training sessions, but I thought I needed to improve my skills before playing in a real match. However, my teacher believed in me more than I believed in myself. After some time, I agreed to play, and a few weeks later, I found myself in a game against another school. My parents watching made me more nervous, but it turned out fine!

For the next four years, I practiced every day and did very well, even joining an adult team before moving to a special sports academy in the USA when I was fifteen. The coach there trained Olympic basketball players, and it was amazing to work with him. However, I didn’t enjoy being away from my parents at first. At home, I hadn’t spent much time with friends because of all the training, so that part wasn’t too different for me. Eventually, I got used to my new life, and my English improved quickly too!

I became a professional player at eighteen, three years after arriving in the USA. I had been taller than most players in the professional league since I was fifteen, but I needed to gain weight to match my height. My coach knew a team that would take me while I was still in college, so I joined them and have never regretted that decision."
67,"Seven years ago, I was studying Tourism at college, but I needed a part-time job because my course was quite expensive. After thinking about different options, I decided to train as a weekend tour guide in my hometown, Chicago, USA. This job involved showing visitors around the city, and I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. I got to see the city I had lived in all my life from the perspective of tourists, and it felt like a new experience each time!

After I finished my studies, I chose to become a full-time tour guide. I thought it would be easy, but when I looked into it, I realized I needed to learn a lot more to get a license as a full-time guide. All tour guides in Chicago must be able to answer many questions about the city, including its architecture, history, and public transport rules. After several challenging but interesting months, I earned my tour guide qualification and registered as an independent guide.

Being a tour guide is not just about knowing historical facts or keeping track of your group in busy areas. There are many other important skills. You need to be entertaining and tell engaging stories. Most importantly, you must be able to adapt to unexpected situations, like if a place you planned to visit is closed or if the route changes. Tourists don’t want to hear about problems; they just want to enjoy a well-organized tour.

I have to ensure that visitors are happy with my tours, as negative reviews online can harm my business. Like many tour guides, I understand that good reviews are crucial because they attract more customers. That’s why it’s essential to make tours enjoyable and stress-free. I believe that the enthusiasm and energy I bring to my job help me receive great reviews, and my tours are often recommended to other visitors coming to Chicago."
68,"My name is Ella, and I am 22 years old. Last year, I traveled to Thailand for two weeks with my sister, Josie. Even though she is five years younger than me, we have a good relationship. We went to volunteer at an elephant sanctuary, which is a place where people care for sick and rescued elephants. At first, I was unsure if we would connect with the other volunteers because they were all older than us. We were also nervous since it was our first experience doing something like this. However, we ended up having a great time.

One of our main tasks at the sanctuary was to gather food for the elephants. Elephants eat a lot of grass and banana plants, so this took most of our day. Josie found it quite challenging, but seeing the elephants enjoy their meals made it worthwhile for me. We also helped wash the elephants in the river using large brushes and soap. I found this very enjoyable, even though I ended up getting wetter than the elephants!

The part of the day I looked forward to the most was the evening. By moonlight, we led the elephants into the forest where they would spend the night. All the volunteers stayed in the same house. Josie and I shared a bedroom, which was a bit cramped, but we chose to do this because Josie didn’t want to be alone. It was hot and humid, especially at night, but we were prepared for that. The meals were delicious and did not include meat, which we both do not like.

After dinner, all the volunteers and staff would spend the evenings talking and playing games. Now that we are back in the UK, Josie doesn’t often mention Thailand. However, if someone asks her if she enjoyed her time at the sanctuary, she says she loved it. I’m not sure she is being completely honest, though. I think she might feel a bit frustrated with herself for not fully enjoying her time there because she missed her friends too much. But when she reflects on the experience, she realizes how lucky she was to go. Maybe she will return one day – I definitely will!"
69,"I’m Gina D’Costa, and I own a flower shop in the UK. We sell flowers not just to people for their homes or gifts, but to many different customers. Hotels and offices often use flowers in their reception areas, and we sometimes provide flowers for businesses' advertising photos. Once, I even decorated a castle with flowers for a wedding. It was a lot of work, but I felt very proud of what we accomplished.

My day starts at 4 a.m. when I go to the market to buy fresh flowers. Most people are still asleep at that time, and my friends think I’m a bit crazy, but I love what I do. It can be quite cold and dark, but I don’t let that bother me. The flower market is amazing, with flowers from all over the world. The beautiful sights and smells make it hard to choose. If I were picking for myself, I would probably choose only pink flowers because it’s my favorite color. However, I have to remember that my preferences may not match what my customers want. 

Sometimes, it’s difficult to find the flowers that customers want because not all flowers are available all year round. I don’t enjoy negotiating prices with the flower sellers, but it’s part of the job. Flowers can be expensive, so I try to get the best price I can. 

Back at the shop, we check customer orders and arrange the flowers I bought into vases. Then, we create flower bunches and calculate the costs of the orders. Customers are often surprised by the prices, and I sometimes have to ask them to reconsider their choices. Some people might think this is too much work, but I enjoy figuring out how to create the best flower arrangements for the budget someone has. That’s what selling is about, and I wouldn’t want to do anything else!"
70,"My city has a modern cinema that shows the latest films and many children's movies on weekends. It is close to my home, but a year ago, I realized I wanted something more – the chance to discuss a film in detail with others after watching it. So, I started a film club with two friends! We decided not to rent a cinema for our screenings. Instead, we choose a different location in the city each month. For example, we rented an old factory to show a film set in Antarctica. It was very cold, which created a great atmosphere for the film, and it was fantastic! Some places we use are even free because the owners sell snacks during the film, allowing us to keep our prices low. We are happy to cover our costs without trying to make a profit. Each time we show a film, it gets easier, especially now that we have our own reliable equipment. We can also track ticket sales online, so we don’t worry about empty seats anymore! There is always a lot to do, but it feels wonderful when people of all ages tell us how much they enjoyed the experience. Our website has been very helpful, and we are now connected with other film clubs across the country. We have visited them to learn how they operate, but it’s always nice to return to our own club! We also started a blog because we know most people look online for film information instead of reading local reviews. We have tried putting up posters in cafés, but nothing is as effective as word of mouth – when people recommend us to their friends. The audience loves the special activities we organize with each film; last month, we had a movie quiz that everyone enjoyed."
71,"Taking photographs was always my favorite activity as a child. When I turned 15, I wanted to take my hobby further, so I started a special project: I would take one photograph every day for a whole year. Many young photographers had done this before, but I thought it was a great idea, so I began. 

After a few weeks, I decided to share my photos on a website for young photographers. I wanted to create a photo diary and show my work to others. I was surprised to find that people liked my unique perspective. I enjoyed photographing many different subjects. Then, someone suggested that if my photos had a common theme, my project would be even better. I agreed and decided to focus on nature, especially birds and the sky. 

Most of my photos were in black and white, which was different from what many other young photographers were doing, as they preferred color. This made me doubt my project at times, and I almost gave up. However, I learned to trust my feelings and became more confident in my style and choices. 

One day, I showed my project to my art teacher. She told me about a national photography competition for my age group, so I entered some of my photos just for fun. I will never forget the moment when the judges announced that I had won first prize. I was so happy because my project meant a lot to me. It was the first time I realized that my photography might be good enough for a professional career. Now, I have my own photography studio, and I have never regretted my choice of career."
72,"I joined the National Youth Challenge (NYC) last year because I wanted to try new activities like camping, sailing, and public speaking. These were things I had never done before. In the NYC, you can participate in various activities that challenge you, and you are always learning. There are different levels, from beginner to advanced, led by adult volunteers called ‘leaders’. When you complete each level, you receive a certificate.

When I first joined, my leader suggested that my first challenge should be to help organize activities at a local children’s club for two hours a week. I was unsure about this because I had joined that same club when I was eight and found it hard to make friends. I was shy, and the other children already had their own groups, so I stopped going after a few weeks. However, I decided to accept the challenge because I wanted to earn my first NYC certificate. 

Soon, I found myself wanting to spend all my free time at the children’s club. It became much more important to me than just getting the certificate. After I completed the challenge, the NYC leader allowed me to continue volunteering at the club because I had formed great relationships with the children. Now, I spend about four hours a week there, and I always look forward to it.

Because of what I learned at the children’s club, I have decided that when I finish school in three years, I want to go to college to become a qualified youth worker, someone who works with children. I had never thought about this career before starting at the club. In fact, I had never considered my future job, and the idea of youth work had never crossed my mind. This has been my favorite part of the NYC so far, and I have improved my communication skills while helping others. I now have several NYC certificates, and yes, one of them is for camping!"
73,"I was born in Denver, USA, and I started snowboarding when I was eight years old. My dad took me to a mountain resort about two hours from Denver. The slope looked very steep, so my dad had to convince me to try snowboarding. I was too young to ask him if I could start, but he loved the sport and wanted me to enjoy it too. He made it look easy, and eventually, I did well. After that first experience, I quickly fell in love with snowboarding and improved my skills. I began competing when I was ten. Some people enter many competitions and get bored, but my passion for competing and winning has only grown stronger as I’ve aged, which motivates me to work harder.

I like not having a strict plan, and sometimes this works out well. For example, I became the first female to score a perfect 100 at a local competition. I didn’t think I would attempt the difficult jumps that earned me that score until I actually started. That achievement boosted my confidence in my abilities. In the summer, I focus on training and my studies since there’s no snow. I train every day, but I don’t have to follow a strict diet like I do in winter. I also spend a lot of time with my friends, which helps me cope with not being able to do what I love most.

I need to think about my future. Snowboarding is a big part of my life now, but I believe it’s important to have another career option in case I don’t succeed as a professional snowboarder or if I get injured. I’m considering whether becoming a doctor is possible if my active lifestyle allows me to attend college. I can’t imagine getting tired of snowboarding, but I know I can’t do it forever."
74,"When I was fifteen, I wanted everything my friends had, and I never thought about the future. For example, I didn’t know what I wanted to do after school. One day, my best friend got a new phone for her birthday, and I thought I should have one too. My parents said I could only get it if I paid for it myself, so I decided to work part-time and save money. I am very thankful to my parents for making me do that because it taught me an important lesson.

I worked every Saturday in a café, but I didn’t enjoy it much. My parents suggested I start my own small business instead. I had seen my mum making necklaces, so I asked if I could try it too. I never thought I would find it easy, as it looked complicated when I watched my mum. My friends thought it sounded boring, but I was excited about it. My mum showed me that I could create something nice at home with simple tools and materials.

I sold my first pieces of jewellery to my friends and family as soon as I finished making them. They said they loved them, but I thought they were just being nice. Even though I was happy they bought them, I still needed to be sure they looked good enough for other people to want them. The only way to find out was to rent a market stall with my mum. There are many tourists where I live, and they bought a lot of my jewellery to take home to their families and friends. Soon, we started getting calls from all over the country from people wanting to buy more. They thought we were a big company with many employees, but we were just two people at a market stall!

That was when I realized my business could succeed, and it was time to take the next step – creating a website. Since then, I have made thousands of pounds from my business, mostly online, but we still have our stall too. It has been a lot of fun so far."
75,"When Janine Stuart was just 13 years old, she wrote a novel called Being Amelia, which became a bestseller. The book is partly inspired by Janine’s own life. In an interview, she explained, “Because my father’s job made us move around the country a lot, I learned how to make new friends easily. I know what it feels like to be the new student in a class, which helped me write about Amelia’s experiences in a new school. Some of the funniest moments in the book are about Amelia’s home life, especially her relationship with her older brother. Since I’m an only child, I had to use my imagination to create that.” 

Janine started writing her novel one summer when she was bored at home. Her mother had always wanted to be a published author, and her teachers encouraged her to write, so it felt natural for Janine to spend her time this way. The year before, she had won a short story competition on a young writers’ website. This is why, when she finished Being Amelia and sent it to a publishing company, they were eager to read it. They loved the book, and a year later, it was available in bookstores.

One review of Being Amelia notes that, even though the cover shows happy teenagers, the characters face real challenges, which makes them believable. The reviewer mentioned that, despite Janine’s young age and the book’s short length, she has shown that she is a better writer than many bestselling authors. Janine is still adjusting to her fame: “At first, I would hide when people recognized me in the street, but now it’s fine. I want to give advice to other young writers, but they need to discover what works for them. For me, I just need to spend time with my friends, and I’ll soon find something interesting to write about!”"
76,"My name is Tom, and I am fifteen years old. Three years ago, my family and I moved into a castle on a small island. This happened because my father was invited to manage the castle. He works for an organization that takes care of historical buildings and keeps them open for visitors. He was excited about this opportunity, but it took some time for the rest of us to agree that he should accept the job. We were worried about what life on the island would be like. We knew the castle might not be as comfortable as our cozy home across the water, and there was no school nearby.

However, once we moved, we quickly adapted to island life. The castle is not particularly beautiful, but our apartment inside it is comfortable. In the summer, the island feels very lively because many visitors come, and there are often beach parties. In winter, we mostly see the other families who live on the island, but there are not as many teenagers as I had hoped. The adults support each other and help with repairs, which often requires a lot of hard work.

The biggest change for me was taking a boat every day to my old school. I looked forward to the stormy days with big waves, but the ferries do not run then! I also learned that if I miss the bus to the harbor after school, I will miss the last ferry home, which is stressful. So, when my school friends come to visit, I always tell them to hurry! 

Despite these challenges, we often enjoy amazing views, especially when the sun sets over the sea. Some days, it is so foggy that you cannot see anything, but then, within hours, it can be bright and sunny again. This still feels incredible, even after living here for a while. Of course, we do experience terrible storms, and I sometimes wonder if the castle is strong enough to withstand them. But then I remind myself that it has been here for centuries and is still standing strong!"
77,"I live in a house in the beautiful countryside of Scotland. I have always loved nature and wild animals, and six years ago, I started a new hobby: birdwatching! I went to the mountains in northern Scotland with my family, where we saw many birds in their natural habitat. I spent hours watching them with my parents, who taught me how to identify different species and find the best spots to see them. It was incredible, and when we returned home, I joined a local birdwatchers’ club for young people. My goal is to see 200 different bird species, and I am close to achieving it. During family holidays abroad, I have had the chance to see birds from other countries as well. We always look for places with group birdwatching activities so I can add new birds to my list! I have been to Egypt, and last summer we traveled to South America, where I hoped to see my 200th species. I wasn’t too disappointed when it didn’t happen, as I have learned that patience is important in this hobby. I shared a video online about this challenge, and many teenagers found it interesting and commented positively. When my teachers saw it, they asked me to give a presentation about birdwatching at school. I didn’t feel nervous until just before I walked onto the stage. I knew I would remember what to say and had some notes to help me, but the whole school and all my friends were watching! I only relaxed when it was over, and the teachers said I had prepared well and that they enjoyed it. I might even do another presentation next year! I feel lucky to live in the countryside. I understand why many teenagers in cities might not consider becoming birdwatchers, but there are actually many birds to see, especially in areas with lots of greenery. I also believe that birdwatching clubs should work to attract more young people to this hobby. Everyone should connect with nature, no matter their age, and it doesn’t have to be expensive."
78,"I began playing football when I was 7 years old. I would hurry home from school to play with other kids. I loved it, and soon I became a decent player. My family knew I often got excited about new hobbies and then lost interest, so they probably thought I would do the same with football. But that never happened. I even started dreaming of playing football professionally when I grew up. 

The chance came sooner than I expected. I played in local tournaments, and one of the referees saw that I had talent. He asked the manager of a professional women’s club to watch me play. After that, she invited me to join her club. I was surprised at first because I didn’t know young girls could join women’s clubs. But the manager was impressed, and I began regular training with a big club when I was just 13. After that, I improved a lot. 

Still, some people doubted I would ever become a star player, which made me a little sad. But my coach encouraged me to be myself and to believe in my abilities. He even let me play in one of the club’s championship matches earlier than I expected! I ran harder than ever because I didn’t want to let my teammates down. By chance, I scored the winning goal. Even with a large crowd, I could hear my coach cheering for me, and after the match, my teammates carried me around the pitch. It was amazing! Since then, I have scored many more winning goals.

Next month, my coach and I are organizing a football tournament in my area. The goal is to get teenagers interested in football and give them a chance to meet other players from my club. It will show them what a professional environment is like and inspire them to believe they could play for a top team if they work hard. My advice to them will be the same as my coach gave me: there will be good times, but also some challenges. Fortunately, I have faced very few challenges, so I consider myself lucky!"
79,"One of the most interesting changes in education in the UK and around the world in recent years is the push for new students to get involved in research as soon as they start their studies. This change acknowledges that research is not just for famous scholars at old universities or scientists making new discoveries, but is also a natural way to build knowledge and skills. Research skills will be helpful not only in your studies but also in your future jobs, as they help you think critically about the world and how to approach your work.

As a student, you contribute to knowledge. You do not just learn and repeat information; you create it. Creating knowledge involves asking questions instead of accepting things as they are. You might wonder: Why? How? When? What does this mean? What if things were different? How does it work in this situation? What should we think about the facts, opinions, or beliefs we encounter? Why is this important? These questions are at the heart of what we call research.

Research can be seen as a range of activities. On one end, there is complex, groundbreaking research done by highly trained experts, which leads to significant changes and new knowledge. However, research can also start from simple inquiries that involve careful work, thoughtful questions about issues, and practical suggestions. Most students have always been researchers in some way. You have likely done research for school projects or answered questions at work since you began studying. You have asked questions that required investigation, whether you were deciding where to go on holiday, how to grow plants, fix things at home, train your dog, or find the right music system online.

In college and higher education, you are expected to have an inquisitive mind, identify problems and questions, critically explore and evaluate information, and create your own responses and knowledge to contribute to discussions. Some students may find this challenging because, in some cultures, knowledge is seen as fixed, and learning comes from listening to teachers and texts. It may feel disrespectful to question established knowledge or authority, and you might think you should be told what is important to learn. However, in higher education in the UK, US, much of Europe, and Australasia, questioning established knowledge and authorities is encouraged.

This process of inquiry and knowledge creation can seem overwhelming. Critical thinking is especially important in research. The research done by others is valuable for students, academics, and professionals, but we must not simply repeat what we read or accept everything as fact. Instead, we should engage with the information, think critically about it, test it, and determine if it is logical and supported by evidence. We should avoid relying blindly on the facts and information provided by others in our readings or discussions."
80,"Cities have always been centers of intellectual activity. In the 18th century, coffee houses in London were places where people discussed science and politics. In modern Paris, cafés on the Left Bank were where artists like Pablo Picasso talked about modern art. However, living in a city can be challenging. The same cafés that encouraged discussion also contributed to the spread of diseases like cholera, and Picasso eventually moved to the countryside. 

Today, cities are known for their creativity, but they can also feel overwhelming and unnatural. Scientists are now studying how city life affects our brains, and the findings are concerning. While it has been known that city life can be tiring, new research shows that living in cities can actually reduce our ability to think clearly. One major reason for this is the lack of nature in urban environments. Studies have shown that hospital patients recover faster when they can see trees from their windows. Even small views of nature can help our brains by providing a break from the stress of city life.

This research comes at a significant time: for the first time in history, more people live in cities than in rural areas. Instead of enjoying open spaces, we are packed into concrete environments filled with strangers. It has become clear that these unnatural surroundings can negatively affect our mental and physical health and change how we think. 

When walking down a busy street, our brains must manage many distractions, like other pedestrians and traffic. This constant need to pay attention to so many things can be exhausting because it forces our brains to work hard to decide what to focus on. The brain is like a powerful computer, but paying attention uses a lot of its energy. In contrast, natural environments require less mental effort. This idea is known as attention restoration theory, developed by psychologist Stephen Kaplan. He suggested that being in nature can help restore our attention because natural settings have elements that naturally attract our focus without causing stress.

Long before scientists studied this, philosophers and landscape architects warned about the negative effects of city life and sought ways to include nature in urban areas. Parks, like Central Park in New York, provide a much-needed escape from city life. A well-designed park can enhance brain function in just a few minutes. While many have looked for ways to boost mental performance, such as energy drinks or office redesigns, nothing seems to be as effective as simply taking a walk in nature.

Given the many mental challenges caused by city living, one might wonder why cities keep growing. Even in our digital age, cities remain important for intellectual life. Research from the Santa Fe Institute shows that the same crowded features of cities that can lead to attention and memory problems—like busy streets and close proximity to others—are also linked to innovation. Scientists believe that the “concentration of social interactions” is key to urban creativity. Just as the crowded streets of 18th-century London led to new ideas, the busy environment of 21st-century Cambridge, Massachusetts, supports its role as a hub for technology and creativity. 

The challenge is to find ways to reduce the negative effects of city life while keeping its unique advantages. After all, there will always be moments when someone might say, “I’m tired of nature; take me to the city!”"
81,"Where should we search for the mind? This question may seem strange because we usually think that thinking happens inside our heads. Today, we have advanced brain imaging techniques that support this idea. However, I believe there is no strong reason to limit the study of the mind to just the brain or body. There is a lot of evidence, from ancient times to now, showing that objects, as well as brain cells, play a role in how we think. 

From an archaeological perspective, it is clear that items like stone tools, jewelry, carvings, clay tokens, and writing systems have significantly influenced human evolution and the development of our minds. Therefore, I propose that what exists outside our heads may also be part of our minds. 

It is understandable why we often connect the mind with the brain. Most of our knowledge about the mind comes from studying people in isolation from their surroundings. This approach is practical for neuroscientists, especially when using brain scanners. However, this often overlooks the fact that much of our thinking happens outside our heads. I do not intend to deny the importance of the brain in thinking, but I want to emphasize that the mind is more than just the brain. 

Instead, we should consider the idea that human intelligence extends beyond our bodies into culture and the material world. This is where my new theory, called Material Engagement Theory (MET), comes into play. MET explores how objects can become extensions of our thinking or be integrated into our bodies. For example, when we create numbers and symbols from clay or use a stone to make a tool, we are engaging with materials in a cognitive way. 

MET also looks at how these interactions have changed since ancient times and what these changes mean for our thinking. This perspective provides new insights into what minds are and how they are shaped by the things around us. 

Consider a blind person using a stick. Where does this person’s self begin? The connection between the blind person and the stick illustrates how minds and objects can be seen as interconnected. It also shows the flexibility of the human mind: by using the stick, the blind person transforms touch into a form of sight, and the stick itself plays an active role. The sensation felt at the tip of the stick connects the person to the environment, leading the brain to treat the stick as part of the body.

The blind person’s stick reminds us that human intelligence can adapt and change significantly by incorporating new technologies. I view the human mind as an ongoing project, always evolving. It is essential to remember that, regardless of what form the “stick” has taken throughout our history—whether it be ancient stone tools or modern technology—its main purpose is to connect us to the world rather than to limit us.

Through these “sticks,” humans explore, learn, and understand their environment, while also shaping their future. This is different from how monkeys use sticks to get food. For humans, “sticks” are tools for satisfying our curiosity. This unique human ability to engage with material culture explains why we create things and how those creations, in turn, shape our minds. I call this concept metaplasticity—our minds are flexible and develop as they interact with the material world.

I aim to reintroduce the importance of materiality in understanding cognition. MET provides a new perspective on how various forms of material culture, from ancient tools to modern smartphones, have played a crucial role in defining and transforming who we are and how we think. While the idea of technology changing our minds may sound futuristic, it is important to realize that humans have been using such technology since our earliest days."
82,"Few inventions have changed civilization and our understanding of the world as much as photography. This is especially true in the United States, where photography quickly became part of culture at all levels—practical, scientific, industrial, and artistic. It also opened up a new world of entertainment. Historians argue that photography is the greatest contribution of the US to the visual arts, as no other art form has had such a significant impact.

To fully appreciate photography's influence, we need to look at its origins in the mid-19th century. Why was this new art form so attractive? First, photography was a mechanical process that matched the growing interest in technology, reflecting a national attitude that embraced change. Just as steam power, railroads, and electricity made communication and travel easier, photography brought the wonders of the world into people's homes in an immediate and exciting way.

Second, the camera became the preferred tool for expressing identity, allowing individuals to present themselves to the public in a society that constantly reinvented personal and national identities. Third, the camera played a crucial role in creating and preserving family memories, even if those memories were somewhat idealized. Finally, the realism of photographs aligned with a broader artistic trend towards realism and the depiction of everyday life in US art.

Every photograph draws attention to something specific, showing what the photographer wants us to see. Because photographs are created by machines, they are records of events, people, and objects, which gives them a sense of objectivity. However, since each photograph is taken by a specific person, it also carries a subjective point of view. We might think we understand a photograph because we recognize its subject, leading to the idea that photography is a ""universal language."" Yet, the meaning of a photograph is more complex. 

Few subjects—people, objects, or events—speak for themselves, and every image comes with context that shapes our understanding, such as captions in newspapers or layouts in magazines. To understand a photograph historically, we must consider its purpose and role within its cultural context: Why did the photographer take the picture? How was it first seen? Additionally, the same image can have different meanings depending on where and when it is viewed.

While the importance of the camera to artists was not widely recognized for a long time, it is now clear. In recent decades, starting with artist Andy Warhol's use of photographs in his work, many artists have incorporated photography in various ways. In summary, photography has become an essential part of art, complementing painting and shaping our ideas of representation even before the camera was invented."
83,"In 1890, William James, an American philosopher and physician known as one of the founders of modern psychology, defined psychology as the ""science of mental life."" This definition is still relevant today. We all have a mental life, which gives us some understanding of what this means. Although we can study mental life in animals like rats and monkeys, it remains a complex concept. James focused on human psychology, which he believed included basic elements: thoughts, feelings, the physical world, and a way of knowing about these elements. Our knowledge is mostly personal and comes from our own experiences, which may or may not align with scientific facts.

Because of this, we often make judgments about psychological issues based on our own experiences. We act like amateur psychologists when we share opinions on complex topics, such as whether brainwashing is effective or why people behave in certain ways, like feeling insulted or unhappy. Problems can arise when two people interpret situations differently. Formal psychology aims to provide methods to determine which explanations are most likely correct in specific situations. Psychologists help us differentiate between subjective thoughts, which can be biased, and objective facts.

While psychology studies the mind and brain, psychologists do not yet fully understand how the brain works in relation to our emotions and behaviors. It is often difficult to study the brain directly, so psychologists learn more by observing behavior and forming hypotheses about what happens inside us. A challenge in psychology is that scientific facts should be objective, but the mind's workings are not easily observable. Instead, we can only infer them from behavior, similar to solving a crossword puzzle by interpreting clues.

Psychology aims to describe, understand, predict, and influence the processes it studies. Achieving these goals helps us understand our experiences and apply findings to real life. Psychological research has been beneficial in various areas, such as improving reading methods for children, designing safer machine controls, and helping emotionally distressed individuals communicate their feelings better.

Although psychological questions have been discussed for centuries, scientific investigation began only in the last 150 years. Early psychologists used introspection, or self-reflection, to answer psychological questions, focusing on identifying mental structures. While this remains an interest, introspection has limitations. As Sir Francis Galton noted, it only reveals a small part of the brain's automatic functions. William James compared introspection to trying to see in the dark by turning up the gas quickly. Today, psychologists prefer to base their theories on careful observations of others' behavior rather than solely on their own experiences."
84,"In a storehouse located in a typical business park in Michigan, USA, there exists a unique collection known as the Museum of Failed Products. This collection, owned by a company called GfK, includes items like A Touch of Yogurt shampoo and Breakfast Cola, which were taken off the market because few people wanted to buy them. The museum's owner, Carol Sherry, believes that each product represents a story of disappointment for the designers, marketers, and salespeople involved.

What is surprising is that this museum operates as a successful business. Many companies do not keep samples of their failed products, showing how uncomfortable they are with discussing failure. The museum was started by Robert McMath, a former marketing professional, who initially wanted to create a library of consumer products, not just failed ones. He began collecting new items in the 1960s, not realizing that most products fail. As a result, his collection ended up being mostly unsuccessful products.

Today’s optimistic culture likely contributes to the products found in the museum. Each product likely went through meetings where no one recognized its potential failure. Even if they did, marketers might invest more money into a failing product to save face. There is often little effort to understand why a product failed, and people involved may choose to forget about it.

This focus on optimism is also common in the self-help industry, where the idea of ""positive visualization"" is popular. This concept suggests that if you imagine positive outcomes, they are more likely to happen. Research by neuroscientist Tali Sharot indicates that our brains may be wired to see positive outcomes as more likely than they actually are. Her studies show that well-adjusted people often have an overly optimistic view of their ability to influence events compared to those who are depressed.

However, how effective are these positive thoughts about the future? Psychologist Gabriele Oettingen and her team have explored this question. Their findings reveal that spending time imagining successful outcomes can actually reduce people's motivation to achieve their goals. For instance, people who were encouraged to visualize a productive week at work ended up accomplishing less.

Psychologist Carol Dweck suggests that our experiences with failure depend on our beliefs about ability. Those with a ""fixed mindset"" believe that ability is something you are born with, while those with a ""growth mindset"" think it can develop through effort and challenges. People with a fixed mindset often find failure very distressing, seeing it as proof that they are not as capable as they thought. For example, a talented athlete who believes they are naturally gifted may not practice enough to reach their full potential. In contrast, those with a growth mindset view failure as a sign that they are pushing their limits. Dweck compares this to weight training, where muscles grow stronger by being challenged. Ultimately, having a growth mindset is a more positive way to approach life, regardless of whether it leads to success."
85,"Text: 'Everyone knows that sports teams have an advantage when they play at home. But why is that? Many of us think we understand, but professional sports are changing quickly, and what we once accepted as true is now being questioned. Two main factors are challenging the idea of home advantage: science and money. Sports scientists want to discover what helps players perform their best, leading to many theories about home advantage. At the same time, those who invest in sports want to know why home advantage is still important. If players are paid well, shouldn’t they feel comfortable playing anywhere?

This raises questions for fans. For example, would it matter if Manchester United played some home games in the Far East to reach their fans there? It would matter to British fans, who believe their team needs their support and loyalty. This belief may lead them to confuse cause and effect. When a team plays well, home fans cheer loudly, and sometimes this leads to a goal, causing even more excitement. Fans often remember the times they cheered when a goal was scored, forgetting the many times their cheers did not lead to success.

However, there is one common belief among fans that scientific evidence supports. Home fans not only cheer for their team but also direct their energy towards the referee. In a well-known study, referees watched a match with crowd noise and another version without sound. The referees who heard the crowd were less likely to call fouls against the home team compared to those who watched in silence. Interestingly, the crowd noise did not make them more likely to call fouls against the away team. The researchers concluded that referees try to avoid extra stress from making calls that upset the home crowd. They do not simply follow the crowd's wishes; they aim to avoid provoking their anger.

Recent studies on home advantage have looked at long-term trends. They show that while home advantage has decreased in all major sports, it has not declined as much as expected. For example, in the early years of the Football League in the 1890s, home teams won about 70% of the points, compared to 60% today. One reason for this change could be travel. In the past, travel was difficult, but now players travel in great comfort, and if their hotel is not satisfactory, the club will find them a better one. Local conditions used to vary greatly, but now top stadiums are increasingly similar in their efficiency.

Despite these explanations, none fully explains the data. These changes, like pampered players and similar stadiums, have occurred relatively recently. The mystery remains as to why home advantage varies by sport. Basketball offers the most home advantage, followed by football, while baseball has the least. One reason could be that home advantage is more about teamwork, and baseball focuses more on individual matchups between batter and pitcher. Team sports require coordination among teammates. In basketball, success depends on teamwork, which builds confidence in players' ability to work together at home, regardless of playing conditions.

Another possibility relates to a more primal aspect of sports. Researchers found that players' testosterone levels were normal before training and away games but increased by up to 67% before home games. This territorial instinct may connect to a basic urge to protect their home ground, as seen in recent Rugby World Cup matches. In two notable games, underdog teams won at home against stronger opponents, showing determination and aggression—key elements of home advantage. As one referee put it, ‘It’s the law of the jungle out there.’'"
86,"""The more I practice, the luckier I get,"" said golfer Gary Player about fifty years ago. This saying has become famous in sports and is appreciated by many dedicated athletes and their coaches. The quote's origin is often debated, with many claiming it was said by other golfers of that time. Its meaning is also unclear. Player was not talking about luck in a literal sense; he was being ironic. His true message was: ""The more I practice, the better I become."" However, there is a limit to this improvement, and the question of where that limit is relates to the nature-nurture debate—whether talent is something we are born with or something we develop through practice.

This discussion is not balanced; it heavily favors the idea that practice is more important than natural talent. This belief is largely based on the work of psychologist Anders Ericsson, who proposed that anyone can become an expert in any field with 10,000 hours of practice. His theory has inspired popular books like Malcolm Gladwell's ""Outliers,"" as well as ""Talent Is Overrated"" and ""Bounce: The Myth of Talent and the Power of Practice."" These books generally agree that practice is the most important factor in achieving expertise, suggesting that 10,000 hours of practice is both necessary and enough to become an expert.

However, as Epstein discusses in his engaging book, this idea is often not true. He points out a significant flaw in much of the research on excellence: it usually focuses on already successful individuals. He asks if there are better ways to understand why some people have certain abilities while others do not, and how to separate innate talent from factors like environment, support, opportunity, and determination.

Epstein travels around the world—from Kenya to Sweden, the Caribbean to the Arctic—to find answers. In Alaska, he discovers that the drive and desire of sled dogs in a tough race may be influenced by their genetics, suggesting a link between inherited traits and what we think of as voluntary characteristics. This raises the question: can commitment and determination be chosen, or are they also influenced by genetics?

Epstein emphasizes the complexity of this topic. He distinguishes between ""hardware"" (nature) and ""software"" (nurture), agreeing that both are essential for elite athletes. He does not deny the importance of training or environment. For example, he suggests that if Usain Bolt had grown up in the US, he might have become a good basketball player instead of the fastest man in history. However, he also examines cases where genetics play a crucial role that cannot be overlooked.

Additionally, Epstein addresses the issues of race and gender in sports. He questions why we separate men and women in athletic competitions if only practice hours matter. Sometimes, the most important questions are the most obvious ones."
87,"A recent international report shows that many children in rich, developed countries feel lonely, out of place, and unhappy. Jay Griffiths asks a simple question: why are today’s children so unhappy? In her new book, Kith, Griffiths explains that these children spend too much time indoors, stuck in front of screens, whether watching TV or using computers. As a result, they have lost touch with nature – the woods, mountains, rivers, and streams. She believes this is the main issue. 

A follow-up study interviewed children to understand their feelings better. It found that many of them do not wish for the latest technology; instead, they would be happier if they could spend more time outside. Many adults over 40 often reminisce about their own childhoods, recalling how they enjoyed long summer days exploring, swimming, or building forts. They believe this was much healthier than the protected lives of today’s children. However, they often forget that they are the ones who created these protective environments for their kids, avoiding risks like building forts in old sheds.

Griffiths’ book contains strong arguments. She discusses how the fear of dangers in the outside world leads parents to keep their children at home, which benefits the toy and gadget industry that sells entertainment for indoor kids. She also criticizes trends like prescribing medication for restless children or requiring kids to wear goggles during traditional playground games. While I am unsure how common these strict rules are, Griffiths expresses her frustration with great passion. She also shares inspiring thoughts about childhood freedoms and limitations, from fairy tales to school rules.

However, Griffiths sometimes goes too far with her ideas and ignores important counterarguments. At one point, she even compares the modern treatment of children to a subtle form of racism, which seems extreme. She tends to have a romantic view of children, often overlooking their more challenging behaviors. For example, she claims that “children are the musicians of thought,” suggesting they would be creative if given the chance. While this might be true in some cases, it is not universally applicable.

One of the main themes of the book is that children should have the freedom to explore and take risks. Griffiths argues that children need to experience small accidents to learn how to handle bigger dangers later. However, she does not explain how to create these “right-sized” accidents. Additionally, not all children may want to follow the adventurous path Griffiths admires. What about those who are naturally shy or prefer staying at home? Perhaps the real issue is that we often try to fit all children into the same mold, whether by keeping them too safe or pushing them too hard."
88,"I am a research bio-psychologist with a PhD, which means I have studied a lot. I am good at solving problems in my work and personal life, but this skill is not just from my education. Many life problems cannot be solved with complicated formulas or memorized answers from school. They need judgment, wisdom, and creativity that come from real-life experiences. For children, these experiences often happen through play. 

My recent research focuses on how important play is for children's development. All mammals, including humans, play when they are young, and those that have the most to learn tend to play the most. Carnivores play more than herbivores because hunting is harder to learn than grazing. Primates play more than other mammals because they rely more on learning than on instinct. Children, who have the most to learn, play more than any other young primates when they are given the chance. 

Play is a natural way for both adults and mammals to learn. The most important skills children need to live happy and productive lives cannot be taught in school. These skills are learned and practiced through play. They include thinking creatively, getting along with others, cooperating, and managing their own feelings. Creativity is essential for success in today’s economy. We no longer need people who simply follow instructions or perform routine calculations. Instead, we need people who can ask new questions and solve new problems. If we can encourage creative thinkers, we will have a strong workforce. 

However, we cannot teach creativity directly; it can be stifled by a school system that focuses on fixed questions and answers. More importantly, children need to learn how to interact with others, care for them, and cooperate. Children naturally want to play with each other, and through play, they develop social skills and learn about fairness and morality, which are important for their future. 

Play is voluntary, meaning players can choose to stop at any time. If they cannot quit, it is not truly play. Players understand that to keep the game enjoyable, they must make sure everyone is happy. This ability to quit makes play a very democratic activity. 

Unfortunately, school has become more demanding, with fewer breaks, more homework, and greater pressure for high grades. Outside of school, organized sports have taken the place of spontaneous games. Supervised playdates have replaced unsupervised neighborhood play, and adults often feel they must step in rather than let children solve their own problems. These changes have happened slowly but have had a significant impact over time. They are influenced by various social factors, including parents' fears, warnings from experts about dangers, less connected neighborhoods, and the belief that children learn more from adults than from each other.

Our children do not need more school; they need more play. If we care about our children and future generations, we must change the negative trend of the past fifty years. We need to give childhood back to children. They should be allowed to follow their natural instincts to play and explore, so they can grow into strong adults ready for an unpredictable future."
89,"In many countries, more young people in their twenties are using social media to find jobs. Websites like Twitter and LinkedIn allow them to connect directly with potential employers, which is much easier than the old method of standing outside an office with a sign saying ""hire me."" However, this increased access also means there is a higher chance of making mistakes.

For example, a young job seeker in the US reached out to a senior marketing executive on LinkedIn. This executive had many influential contacts, and the job seeker thought she could help him. However, the executive was offended by the idea of sharing her contacts with someone she didn’t know. She rejected his request and sent a sarcastic message that quickly spread online. Many people were shocked by her response, and she might regret her tone, if not her message. Yet, if this incident makes young people think more carefully about using social media for professional purposes, it could actually help them.

Social media can be a risky tool for job seekers who do not know how to use it properly, and many are making mistakes. Ironically, social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter have been a big part of young people's social lives for years. When my generation was young, social media was a way to escape from parents and teachers. It was a place to impress others and create a different image of ourselves. You could have long conversations online and then ignore those people in real life. With the right pictures and songs on your Facebook page, you could seem like a more interesting person overnight. 

However, using social media for professional networking is very different, and some young people do not see this difference. We learned to be bold and confident online, which might explain why some still think this is a good approach. Just because many people liked your posts on Facebook does not mean you can use LinkedIn to show employers you are worth hiring. We need to understand that what we learned about social networking as teenagers does not apply anymore, and we must meet employers' expectations to succeed in the job market.

One common complaint from employers about young job seekers on professional networking sites is that they are too casual and come across as arrogant. This reinforces the stereotype of young people as an ""entitled generation."" In reality, many of us are struggling to find jobs, which is why we are using social media. This perception of arrogance can hurt the job prospects of young people who actually have the skills and motivation to be valuable employees.

So, how should you contact someone on a professional networking site? First, clearly explain who you are and what you can offer them, like doing some research or helping in another way. This approach increases your chances of getting a positive response. Avoid sending generic messages, and keep your tone respectful to prevent leaving a bad impression. Remember, social media can be a great way to make important connections, but it requires careful use to avoid being ignored."
90,"Anyone who claims they can accurately predict the future of newspapers is either lying or mistaken. The numbers show that newspapers are in trouble. Since 2000, the circulation of most UK national daily newspapers has dropped by 30 to 50 percent. The Pew Research Centre in the USA reports that only 26 percent of US citizens now rely on newspapers for news, down from 45 percent in 2001. Many people confidently predict that the last printed newspaper will disappear within 15 years. However, history shows that traditional media often survive longer than expected. 

In 1835, a journalist in New York claimed that books and theatre were finished and that newspapers would become the main source of social life. Yet, theatre has survived alongside newspapers, cinema, and television. Radio has thrived even in the age of TV, and cinema has continued to do well against videos and DVDs. Even vinyl records have made a comeback, with online sales increasing by 745 percent since 2008. 

Newspapers were once a new form of media, but it took centuries for them to become the main source of news. This change happened because producing timely news for a large audience became possible and affordable in the mid-19th century, thanks to the steam press, railways, and telegraphs. Additionally, people began to understand that the world is always changing and that they need regular updates, a concept that was not common in medieval times. 

In the past, people mainly experienced the passing of seasons and unexpected disasters like famine or disease, which they could not predict. Life was seen as cyclical, and the most important truths were those that repeated. Before the 19th century, journalism as a profession was not well established, and there was no clear need for regular news updates. 

Today, the regular publication of newspapers can feel restrictive. Online news allows readers to access information based on their own interests and the urgency of events. Advanced search engines and algorithms help personalize news. When significant stories happen, online news sources can provide updates almost instantly. There are no space limits that restrict storytelling or analysis, and readers can often access full documents or events mentioned in news articles. 

This is very different from the limitations of newspapers. However, many news providers seem focused on being the first to report news, generating comments, and creating excitement, which can lead to confusion. In medieval times, news was often shared in busy marketplaces or taverns, where truth mixed with rumors and misunderstandings. In some ways, we seem to be returning to that chaotic environment. 

Newspapers have not always been effective at explaining how the world works. They may be facing extinction, or perhaps, as the internet adds to our feeling of living in a chaotic universe, newspapers will find a way to help us gain wisdom and understanding."
91,"If humans truly belonged under the moon and stars, we would walk in the dark happily, just like many night creatures that thrive in it. However, we are daytime creatures, with eyes that are made for sunlight. This fact is deeply rooted in our genetics, even if we don’t often think of ourselves as daytime beings, just like we don’t think of ourselves as primates or mammals. This understanding helps explain what we have done to the night. We have changed the night by filling it with artificial light. This control is similar to building a dam on a river. While there are benefits to this, it also leads to problems known as light pollution, which scientists are just starting to study. 

Light pollution mainly comes from poor lighting design that allows artificial light to shine into the sky instead of focusing it down where it is needed. Bad lighting brightens the night, changing the light levels and patterns that many living things, including us, have adapted to. Wherever artificial light spreads into nature, it affects important life activities like migration, reproduction, and feeding. 

For most of human history, the term ‘light pollution’ would not have made sense. Imagine walking towards London on a moonlit night around 1800, when it was the most populated city on Earth. Nearly a million people lived there, using candles, torches, and lanterns. Only a few homes had gas lighting, and there were no public gaslights in the streets for another seven years. From a distance, you would have been more likely to smell London than to see its faint glow. We have illuminated the night as if it were empty, but that is far from the truth. There are many nocturnal species among mammals. Light is a strong biological force that attracts many species. Scientists have noted that songbirds and seabirds can be ‘captured’ by bright lights, circling them until they fall. Birds that migrate at night often crash into brightly lit tall buildings, and young birds on their first journey are especially affected. Some birds, like blackbirds and nightingales, sing at odd hours because of artificial light.

It was once believed that light pollution only bothered astronomers, who need to see the night sky clearly. While most of us may not need a perfect view of the night sky for our work, we, like many other creatures, do need darkness. Rejecting darkness is pointless. It is just as important for our health as light is; changing our internal clock can lead to various health issues. The regular cycle of waking and sleeping is a biological reflection of the natural light changes on Earth. These rhythms are so essential to our existence that disrupting them is like changing our center of gravity. 

In the end, humans are just as affected by light pollution as frogs living near a brightly lit highway. By living in our own artificial light, we have disconnected ourselves from our evolutionary and cultural roots—the light of the stars and the natural rhythms of day and night. Light pollution makes us forget our true place in the universe and the vastness of our existence, which is best understood against the backdrop of a dark night filled with the Milky Way overhead."
92,"The founder of a large international company recently said that his business will stop tracking how much paid holiday time employees take. This decision seems to be inspired by a similar policy from an internet company. The founder mentioned that he got the idea from a cheerful email from his daughter, which many newspapers have shared. However, this way of announcing the change feels like a superficial attempt to make a potentially unfair policy seem more friendly. 

Is this idea practical? The internet company and the multinational corporation are very different. The internet company has 2,000 employees and offers one service, while the multinational has 50,000 employees and many different services, including finance, transport, and healthcare. The idea of ""take as much time off as you want, as long as it doesn’t hurt the business"" seems more suitable for a smaller company where employees know each other’s workloads better. In a larger company, it is harder to know if taking time off will negatively impact the business or one’s career.

The founder has said that employees can take as much leave as they want, as long as they feel completely sure that their team is up to date on all projects and that their absence won’t harm the business or their careers. But is it really possible to be that sure? No matter how much work you finish before a holiday, there will always be more waiting for you when you return. This means that employees might feel guilty about taking time off, which can lead to stress. If workers don’t take enough leave, it could reduce their productivity over time. 

Additionally, there may be pressure from colleagues and office gossip about who is taking time off and for how long. This pressure can already influence when people start and finish their workday. In many corporate environments, there is a culture of working late, which could lead to a ""no holiday"" culture in a company with unlimited leave, where employees compete for promotions. If the security and rights that come with statutory leave are removed, workers might feel they cannot take the time off they need for fear of being seen as lazy. 

This could create a situation where employees feel stuck and do not take their entitled leave, or they might continue to use their legal rights as a guideline, making the new policy ineffective. Modern technology allows us to receive work messages anytime and anywhere, which has blurred the lines between work and personal time. The internet company started its unlimited leave policy because employees wanted to know how to balance this new way of working with the old time-off rules. If the company cannot track how much time employees spend working, why should it apply a different standard for time off?

However, a problem with having no set working hours is that every hour could feel like a working hour. Employees may never be sure if their working hours are being watched by their employer, which can lead them to self-discipline in unhealthy ways. Employment laws exist for a reason. Workers have the right to a minimum amount of paid annual leave because rest and leisure are essential for their mental and physical health. The benefits of increased morale, creativity, and productivity that are expected from the unlimited leave policy can exist without compromising worker well-being. Therefore, I am skeptical that allowing employees to take as much holiday as they want is either the true goal or the likely result of this policy."
93,"Journal-based peer review is the process where experts in a field evaluate a scientific research paper before it is published. This process is often seen as a way to ensure the quality of research, as it aims to prevent the publication of flawed or nonsensical papers. However, reviewing a paper can delay its publication by up to a year, raising the question of whether this delay is worth it for the trustworthiness of published research.

While I still believe in the importance of some form of review before publication, I see changes happening in scientific publishing. The increasing use of preprints—drafts of papers shared online without peer review—plays a significant role in this change. Preprints allow researchers to quickly share new findings so that others can read, critique, and build upon them. The focus of journal publication has shifted more towards reputation and career advancement, which can distort the motivations of authors and reviewers. 

Competition for publication in prestigious journals encourages scientists to produce high-quality work, but the pressure to publish in top journals can lead to shortcuts, such as omitting inconvenient data. Reviewers often focus on whether a paper is good enough for a specific journal rather than its overall quality. For top journals, the decision can depend more on the paper's relevance or newsworthiness than on its scientific merit.

Despite these known issues, many in the scientific community are hesitant to change the current system. However, as biologist Ron Vale recently suggested, preprints could offer a solution without drastically changing the norm. Although preprint archives have existed for twenty years, they have not been widely adopted. This slow acceptance is partly due to scientists' conservative nature and the misconception that journals will not accept papers that have been posted as preprints. There is also concern that publishing papers without peer review could lead to the spread of poor-quality research, but this has not happened so far.

Preprints may not undergo peer review, but authors understand that they are open to critique and discussion from a global community of reviewers. For example, psychology professor Tanya Elks shared her experience of critiquing a published paper through a preprint. This allowed for open dialogue with the original authors, ensuring that all viewpoints were considered. The risk of rejection by journals is less concerning since the preprint and its comments remain publicly available, meaning the work is not wasted.

Preprint archives facilitate informal scientific discussions that were once limited to private correspondence. They can also provide a platform for sharing negative results, which are often overlooked by journals focused on new discoveries. Additionally, having work on preprint archives increases the chances that it will be read and cited by others, demonstrating the effectiveness of this method of sharing research. By embracing the internet's culture of openness and collaboration, preprints can help shift the focus back to the quality of the research itself, rather than the prestige of the publication."
94,"When I ask my literature students to define a poem, they often say it is ""a painting in words."" However, these answers usually do not satisfy either me or them. One day, I asked a group of students to choose an object and write two paragraphs about it: one as a scientist would, describing it objectively, and another from the object's perspective, titled ""Poem."" One student wrote: 

**Poem**  
I may look strange or scary, but I am a device that helps people breathe. I am used only in emergencies and for a short time. Most people will never need to use me. The object? An oxygen mask – an unusual choice that helped the class understand how poetry works in a unique way. This exercise led to laughter and valuable discussions.

When I was in school, I found poetry confusing. I saw every poem as a silly puzzle that made it hard to understand and feel. After school, poetry often becomes less appealing to most people. Occasionally, a poem stands out because it is not continuous prose. It challenges you to read it, but often you feel let down by its simplicity or because you don’t understand it at first. Still, you feel good for trying.

What do we hope to find in poems? Aren’t they places for deep emotions, beautiful images, thoughtful reflections, or sharp humor? The answer seems to be yes. But if we want tears, we watch movies; for information or sharp criticism, we read online articles. Novels let us escape, paintings please our eyes, and music combines lyrics, instruments, and melody in a way that is hard to match. 

However, one useful aspect of poetry is its ambiguity. Everyday life is full of uncertainty, unlike reading sentences one after another. But these thoughts still don’t explain what a poem truly is. If you search for ""poem"" in an online encyclopedia, it leads you to ""poetry,"" defined as ""a form of literary art that uses the beauty and rhythm of language."" This sounds impressive, but it overlooks the word's origins. ""Poem"" comes from the Greek word poí?ma, meaning ""a thing made,"" and a poet is someone who ""makes things."" So, if a poem is a created thing, what kind of thing is it?

Poets sometimes compare poems to wild animals – untamed and unpredictable – or to machines – carefully designed and precise – depending on their perspective. However, these comparisons often break down upon closer examination. The most valuable part of trying to define a poem through comparison is not the comparison itself but the discussion it generates. Whether you see a poem as a machine or a wild animal, this process can change how you think about both. It can help you rethink familiar ideas and see ordinary things in a new way.

The idea of a poem as a mental object is not hard to grasp, especially when we consider how song lyrics can stick in our minds. The combination of words and melody has a strong impact, similar to schoolyard rhymes like ""Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt me."" But aren’t words sometimes like sticks and stones? Think about a poem on a newspaper or magazine page, right in front of you: A poem can resonate deeply like nothing else, even though it is just ink on paper, like the prose around it. 

What about the empty space around the poem – space that could have been used for a longer article or an ad? A poem is written and rewritten just like an article, story, or novel, but it does not become a product for sale. Publishers send out press releases and review copies of poetry collections, but few expect them to make back their printing costs. A poem exists not as a marketable item but for its own sake. Because of its unique status in a magazine or book, a poem can still surprise us, even if just for a moment."
95,"I bought my first metal detector shortly after getting married. At that time, £70 was a lot of money, and it might have been better spent on something practical for our home. However, my wife, Marion, was impressed when I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first outing. Over the years, every brooch and coin I discovered brought me joy. I have always enjoyed feeling connected to the past. After the gold ring, it took 40 years before I found something that impressed Marion as much.

One dull February afternoon, I had a couple of hours free and a place in mind to search. It was raining, so I chose a nearby spot that I knew had old farming equipment. When my detector first beeped, I found a piece of a metal wheel. Then it beeped again. I tried to ignore it, but I couldn’t walk away without checking. I dug down half a meter and lay in the mud when I saw a rounded, golden ball. I had previously dug up brass curtain rails, so I tried not to get my hopes up. But as I cleared more dirt, the ball turned into a thick, beautifully designed loop. I stopped and stared, remembering to breathe. I had seen something like this before—the Great Torc, which is displayed in the British Museum. It is the most famous object from Iron Age Britain, over 2,000 years ago. A torc is a beautiful necklace made of gold and silver, with a gold ring at each end, just like the one I was holding.

I took it to my car and kept looking at the torc on the passenger seat during the drive home. I rinsed it in my kitchen sink, probably the only cleaning it had received since ancient times. “Marion!” I called out, “I have something for you.” As I admired my find, I heard my wife enter the room and stop. “What is it?” she asked after a moment. I explained that it was a very old and rare piece of jewelry. We didn’t try it on because we were worried about damaging it. At bedtime, I hid it in our wardrobe. Although we had never been robbed, I felt anxious and restless. Eventually, I got up, unscrewed a floorboard in my office, and hid it underneath.

The law requires that such finds be reported to the authorities within 14 days. I wanted to enjoy the torc as much as I could before giving it up. I even took it in a plastic bag to show a friend in the hospital. Finally, I brought it to the council office in the same bag. The registrar was talking to someone with his back to me. When I placed the torc on his desk, he turned around, stopped mid-sentence, and looked at it. The torc was verified and later sold to my local council. It is now in the British Museum in London. The £350,000 from the sale was shared between the owner of the field and me. 

However, the torc has meant much more to me than just a lucky find. I feel like I have saved it for the nation. People often say to me, “Now that you’ve made such a great discovery, will you stop detecting?” But I still find brooches and coins just as interesting. Besides, if a fisherman catches a big fish, he doesn’t stop fishing—there’s always the chance of catching an even bigger one tomorrow."
96,"Sleeping is one of my greatest joys when I travel, but I rarely talk about it because I feel a bit guilty. When my friends share their carefully planned trips, filled with activities like visiting museums and hiking, I just smile and don’t say much. What would they think if they knew my travel plans often include long naps during afternoon rainstorms and lazy mornings in comfortable beds in Italy? Better sleep is one of the nice benefits of traveling. 

When I visited Mexico's Yucatán coast in my early 20s, I was surprised by how many hours—over 12—I spent sleeping each day. There were many loud birds nearby, but it didn’t bother me. Away from home and my own bed, surrounded by new smells and sounds, I could enjoy a deeper, more dream-filled sleep than I ever expected. Without alarm clocks and responsibilities, sleep comes more easily. 

However, I believe that the quality of sleep while traveling is different for a reason. I think sleep is actually part of our travel experience, not just a break from it. When we travel, we expose ourselves to new sights, sounds, smells, and ways of living. This flood of new experiences fills us, and when we sleep, we process all of it. It makes sense that sleep feels more intense when we are traveling.

Sleep also changes from place to place. People often worry about jet lag, but I think the challenges I face after long trips are more about adjusting to local cultures than just time differences. For instance, in Trinidad, people wake up at dawn to avoid the heat, slow down around 10 a.m. when the sun is strong, and then become active again in the cool evening. Even though Trinidad is only one hour ahead of New York, it takes me days to adjust to their different sleep patterns. When I finally adapt, I feel like I have truly arrived.

I remember one afternoon in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic, when I had a large lunch with new Dominican friends in an apartment overlooking the beautiful Caribbean Sea. After eating, we all felt sleepy, and one by one, my friends left the table to lie down on hammocks and sofas. I realized why they had so many pillows around. I took some for myself and joined them. I had heard about the Latin American tradition of the siesta, but that day I truly experienced it. I shared not just sleep, but a piece of Dominican life.

Travel sleep has another wonderful quality: I remember it. Being far from my usual routine, I enjoy the new smells, textures, and sounds that fill my mind while I sleep. If the idea of ‘slow travel’—fully enjoying each experience instead of rushing—is what defines the modern traveler, then what could be slower than sleep? Maybe I should stop feeling embarrassed about my love for sleep and tell my ambitious friends that travel sleep is, in fact, an important part of the journey."
97,"The woman turned away from the mirror. ""What do you think? Be honest,"" she asked. Mia picked up a medium-sized hat with a soft layer of gauze and a silk bow. ""I still think this one looks best on you,"" she said diplomatically. The woman wrinkled her nose and made a face that resembled a bulldog. ""But it’s so boring,"" she replied. ""Every other woman will wear a hat like that at my daughter’s wedding. This little beauty will make me stand out."" She sighed and adjusted the red and black miniature top hat on her head. ""Yes, this is the one I want,"" she decided. 

Mia knew she couldn’t change the woman’s mind. With a smile, she agreed that the woman would indeed stand out at the wedding. As she thought about her own daughter, Jen, she remembered that it was Jen’s thirtieth birthday today, and they were having a family gathering. It had been a while since everyone was together, and she looked forward to seeing Jen, Dan, and Luke. She was also curious about the friend Jen was bringing, someone they didn’t know much about. Her husband, Jeff, had quickly pointed this out when Jen called last week to ask if she could bring Tattie. 

""Tattie?"" Jeff had said when Mia shared the news. ""What kind of name is that?"" 

""It’s short for Tatiana,"" Mia replied. ""I think it’s nice."" 

""More like something pretentious,"" Jeff responded. He didn’t like anything showy and often criticized Mia for being too polite. He would have told the woman in the shop that she was choosing the wrong hat and might have even said a dustbin lid would look better on her. ""The trouble with you, Mia,"" he often said, ""is that you’re too polite for your own good.""

An hour later, Mia closed her shop and entered Medlar House through the back door. Her commute from work took only forty seconds. Four years ago, when Luke, their youngest child, left home, Mia decided to convert the unused barn next to their house into a bright space for her business. Jeff had been doubtful. ""Do you really think there’s a demand for hats?"" he asked. 

Mia knew from her friends that finding the perfect hat for special occasions was difficult, so she was sure there was a demand. She was right. From the first day, after Jen helped her create a website, Mia’s Hats became successful. Women traveled from far away to her showroom in Little Pelham, where she provided a relaxed atmosphere for them to try on as many hats as they needed. She encouraged customers to bring their outfits to ensure a perfect match. Recently, she expanded her business to include handbags and costume jewelry as well."
98,"It’s a long journey from London to Atlanta, and at his new home in America, Lawrence Okoye reflects on his incredible sports journey. He is confident but also surprised by how far he has come, from competing in the Olympic discus final to possibly starting a new career. Although he has never played American football before, Lawrence is likely to be chosen for one of the major teams in the USA. In Atlanta, he is still figuring out what his new position involves.

The idea that a 21-year-old newcomer from London could be selected for one of the biggest teams in American sports seems unbelievable. However, Lawrence is known for proving people wrong. He was offered a place at Oxford University to study law but decided to focus on training for the discus instead, having previously played rugby. Within 20 months of starting, he became the world’s fourth-best discus thrower.

Lawrence initially came to Atlanta for warm-weather training for the discus, preparing for the world championships. When asked about his unexpected chance at an NFL contract, he confirms, “American football was on my mind, but I only decided to try it when I got to the USA. I had thought about it in school, but it seemed crazy then.” After arriving in America, he learned about the NFL trials in Atlanta. Even though he had no experience, he believed he could be good enough to attend the trials. “Pretty much,” he says. “I went on the site and applied.”

Was he nervous about competing with experienced players? “No, not at all. I don’t get nervous for many things.” Although he doesn’t talk much, he is confident in his abilities. His performance in various tests impressed the coaches, and he was recognized as the best player. “I was very happy to hear that,” he admits, showing a rare moment of pride.

However, he remains cautious. With no basic experience, how can he make it onto an NFL team? “Coaches say I have all the qualities needed. It’s just about how hard I work,” he explains. Will he be relaxed while waiting to hear if he has been selected? “I will be. There’s no pressure on me. Many people say I will definitely be chosen, but I’m not too worried.”

This calmness may come from his disappointing Olympic final, where he finished last. He seems to have moved on from that experience and is proud that he qualified for the final with a strong last throw. “That was an amazing day,” he reflects. “The final didn’t go as I wanted, but that’s part of sports. I can always return to it.”

After his Olympic disappointment, some speculated that he let the moment affect him. Lawrence chooses not to comment on that. The minimum salary for an NFL player is over $400,000 a year, making the financial benefits clear. So, Lawrence has shifted from rugby to athletics and now to American football. With all his physical talents, wouldn’t it be better to focus on just one sport? “I understand why someone would say that,” he replies. “I’m trying to achieve something I’ve dreamed about since I was a kid. If it doesn’t work out, I can always go back to the discus, the sport I love. Every decision I’ve made has been thought out.”"
99,"We had been flying east all night, and I woke up to find it was already daylight. Looking out the window at the empty landscape below, the dark shades of brown and green reassured me that, even though it was mid-September, Siberia had not yet changed for autumn. I saw no signs of human life, just a strange mix of mountains, streams, and forests stretching to the horizon. I shook my head. My neighbor woke up and smiled sleepily at me. “Good morning, Robert,” he said, saying my name with a slow Russian accent. Sergei was a salesman from Moscow, traveling to the remote areas to sell safety clothing to local mining companies. His English was almost as poor as my Russian, but with a dictionary, I managed to tell him that I was flying to the far-eastern Siberian city of Magadan with a one-way ticket because I planned to return home to England by bicycle. 

“But, Robert,” he argued, “there is no road from Magadan; you cannot ride a bicycle.” I explained that I believed there was a road, even if not many people used it anymore. “Alone?” he asked, pointing at me. “No, I will be riding with a friend named Al.” “Just one friend?” “Yes, just one,” I nodded. Sergei still looked doubtful and pointed outside, saying “Holodna” (cold). I tried to convince him with hand gestures that I had plenty of warm clothes, but I didn’t mention that I was on a tight budget for my trip. Most of my clothes and gear were bought at low prices. In reality, I wasn’t sure if they would be good enough, especially my large postman’s over-trousers that I bought for £10.

It all started in a lecture hall in Scotland. That morning, the hall was full of students slumped in their seats. Some were taking notes without much energy. The lecturer was droning on. I was thinking hard about a dilemma: should I ask him or not? “Well, why not?” I tore a fresh sheet from my pad and wrote, “Hi Al, Do you want to cycle across the Karakorum Highway between Pakistan and China this summer? Rob.” In the row in front of me sat Al, my old school friend. I tapped him on the shoulder and passed the note. He tried to read my handwriting, scratched his head, wrote something, and passed it back. I unfolded it and held my breath while I read, “OK,” it said.

Six years later, I was going to join Al in Siberia. I had been working as a geography teacher, and although I still struggled to control my classes fully, the job met many important needs for me. It was often challenging, rarely boring, and fulfilling, plus there were long holidays to seek adventures. Twice since I started teaching, I had used these holidays to meet Al. He had caught the adventure bug after our bike ride through Pakistan and decided to do something more exciting than teaching: to cycle around the world. Since that first ride together, Al had taken on bigger challenges. This round-the-world bike trip was certainly his biggest yet. Sometimes he thought the ride would break him. Although it sounded tough, I envied him in many ways. He was having an extraordinary adventure, facing each new challenge, even when it seemed impossible. He was proving wrong those who said he could not do it. He was doing something that scared him almost every day, and it made him feel alive."
100,"In The Red Bull Air Race, twelve pilots take turns racing through tall pylons that are between 15 and 25 meters high. They make sharp turns, barrel rolls, and loops while flying at speeds of up to 370 km per hour. I was invited to experience what it feels like to participate in this race. 

An hour before my flight, I had to sign two forms. The first confirmed that I was healthy, and the second stated that I would empty my pockets, as small objects can be dangerous during the flight. I learned that I needed to stay oriented throughout the experience. I was told, “The horizon is your best friend,” and the pilot would guide me on where to look. I also had to promise to relax and enjoy the view when flying upside down.

Half an hour before the flight, I attended a safety briefing where I was warned not to touch anything. As we were taxiing down the runway, I was nervous. My legs were up, my feet avoided the important steering pedals, and my hands stayed away from the many switches nearby. Despite the instructions, I found it hard to relax and enjoy the flight. This is the challenge of high-speed acrobatic flying: to survive, you must stay calm and focused, tensing and relaxing at the right moments. Panicking is not a good idea.

As we began to accelerate down the runway, I felt anxious. Dario, the pilot, and I were in the Zivko Edge 540, one of the fastest acrobatic planes in the world. The plane took off, and just two seconds later, we made a sharp turn to the right. It was a sudden and intense movement that took my breath away. I looked at the horizon, tensed my body, and gasped as I sank into my seat. For a brief moment, I felt 6.2 times my normal weight. Then we leveled out, turned sharply to the left, and dove down, leaving my stomach behind at 2,000 meters.

Seconds later, we were just 10 meters off the ground, heading for a small space between two pylons. We passed them at 400 km per hour, but my excitement was interrupted by another sharp turn. I was allowed to fly the plane for two minutes, but my hand shook so much that the plane shook too. It was very responsive. Then Dario spoke, but I couldn’t hear him. Instead of answering, he performed a barrel roll, a full 360-degree turn. “Are you okay?” he asked. “Yes,” I replied. “Have you had enough?” “No,” I lied.

Then he did a loop, flying up and over, completing a full circle in the air. I know many people would find this thrilling, like those who enjoy roller coasters. However, I thought it was overwhelming. At the top of the loop, while upside down, I heard a voice saying, “Relax, relax, look up.” I looked up and saw fields below us. The flight lasted only 10 minutes, but it felt much softer compared to what the pilots experience during races. To show how relaxed he was, Dario pulled out sandwiches as soon as we landed, while I couldn’t eat for hours. That night, I kept dreaming about doing loops in the air."
101,"Doug Allan is a filmmaker who captures wild animals in cold environments. If you have ever been impressed by videos of polar bears in a nature documentary, it is likely that he filmed them. He believes that the ideal temperature for him is -18°C. Allan studied marine biology and worked as a commercial diver. Diving was his first love, where he learned how to survive in cold conditions. His big opportunity came when a TV crew arrived in Antarctica, where he was working, to make a wildlife documentary. He ended up guiding the crew to various locations, and after 48 hours, he realized that being a wildlife cameraman was perfect for him because it involved travel, adventure, and underwater experiences.

Now, he is a well-known cameraman and has worked on many important wildlife TV series. He started his career at a time when few people had explored Antarctica. While there were experts for coral reefs, elephants, and chimpanzees, he became known as the ""cold man."" He felt that many incredible scenes were just waiting to be filmed. When he began 35 years ago, the camera and communication technology were very basic. He explains that filming is much easier today. In the past, if you recorded something, you had to remember it. Now, with digital technology, you can shoot a lot of footage and review it immediately. In the past, you had to carefully plan your shots because film was expensive, but now it is easy to have too much material.

Allan believes that his experience in cold environments is valuable. He feels comfortable on sea ice, which now seems as easy as crossing the street to him. Although he sometimes gets cold toes, he finds the polar regions to be healthy places without leeches, diseases, or mosquitoes. He acknowledges that wildlife filming has many successes, but also failures and embarrassing moments. For example, while filming kittiwakes in the Orkneys, he struggled to identify the birds.

Recently, Allan received permission to film in Kong Karls Land, a group of islands in the Arctic Ocean. He knew it would be a challenging task, as it is home to polar bears and is only accessible to the bravest or most reckless individuals. In April, temperatures can drop to -32°C, and the strong winds make carrying cameras through deep snow very difficult. After walking for five or more hours each day and observing polar bear dens for 23 days, he had only seen one mother bear and her cub. However, on the 24th day, he felt as if he was in the world of bears, moving at their pace and using their senses.

He describes a moment when he spotted a bear. After waiting and watching, he finally saw a black nose appear, which soon became a full head as the bear emerged from the den. The bear looked at him but seemed unbothered. Just as he thought the moment couldn't get any better, the bear slid down the slope, seemingly enjoying herself. Then, two cubs appeared at the entrance of the den, clearly seeing the world for the first time. Allan felt like he had front-row seats to an incredible show.

Now, Allan hopes to create his own documentary about climate change in the Arctic, speaking with the local people who experience its effects firsthand. He believes he could make an extraordinary film."
102,"In 2004, Pen Hadow became the first person to walk alone to the North Pole without getting supplies along the way. This journey involved swimming in extremely cold waters and facing dangers like frostbite and polar bears. Just eight months later, he reached the South Pole as well. Now, he is back in the Arctic, getting ready for an even more challenging expedition. Explorers like Pen are confident and determined. However, this time, there is much more at stake. Pen and two colleagues will embark on a three-month, 1,000-kilometer journey to the North Pole, where they will carefully measure the thickness and density of the ice. No one has done this before, and Pen understands that the results will be very important for scientists. This research will provide a clearer understanding of how global warming is affecting the polar ice.

Pen was prepared for this kind of work from a young age. He was raised by his father's old nanny, who had worked for the famous polar explorer, Scott of the Antarctic. She toughened him up by sending him out into harsh weather with minimal clothing. His father also inspired his love for adventure in cold places, and Pen developed strong physical endurance. He is married to Mary, a horsewoman who shares his passion for the outdoors. Mary helps run his polar guide business and often worries about him more when he is at home than when he is on an expedition. She once raced against him in a well-known mountain event, finishing an hour ahead of him.

Pen and Mary live in the countryside with their two children. He admits that it is harder to be away from them this time. When he last went on an expedition, his children were very young, and he made a mistake in how he said goodbye. He told his son to take care of his mother and sister, which put too much pressure on the boy. This time, Pen plans to have little contact with his family while he is in the Arctic, as he believes that calling them will only remind them of how far away he is.

In the days leading up to his departure, Pen is carefully preparing his equipment. He knows that once he is on the ice, it will be very difficult to fix anything or do anything complicated. He will be joined by Ann Daniels, a leading polar explorer, and Martin Hartley, the expedition photographer. They will also have a support crew of six people who will fly in supplies.

Pen feels that being part of a team can be stressful for him, and he is also concerned about his age. He will turn 47 soon and feels he has not trained as much as he would like. He often finds that organizing things takes priority over training, which makes him anxious about the challenges ahead.

Pen believes that his mission connects exploration with the quest for knowledge that motivated earlier explorers. He acknowledges that reaching the North Pole was a personal goal, but this time, the data they collect will benefit scientists and help raise awareness about what is happening in the Arctic Ocean. He feels that their unique skills, which may seem unusual in everyday life, are now very important and useful."
103,"Text: ""I took a year off. What was I going to do? Being a successful Olympian is a wonderful experience. I had the opportunity to do more writing and TV work, and to speak to businesses and schools. While I enjoyed these different activities, I felt there was nothing competitive to focus on. I wanted to stay fit so I could compete for an Olympic spot if that dream came back to me. So, I signed up for marathons and triathlons. That should have been enough, but I kept thinking about TV presenter Ben Fogle’s invitation: ‘Do you want to row across the Atlantic with me?’ I have always loved rowing and the feeling of the boat moving through the water. I missed that feeling, but I wasn’t ready to train every day. Still, I wanted some kind of competition. I asked some of my rowing friends if they wanted to join the race, but they weren’t very interested. I knew that if I entered the race, even though it was called an adventure, I would want to win. Would rowing with Ben give me the best chance to win? Probably not. But being an underdog without pressure was appealing. I contacted Ben. He was going to participate in the race anyway and had managed to gather the large entry fee and deposit for a boat, making the race a real possibility. We discussed the other costs; the boat and equipment would cost £70,000, which was a lot of money. We believed we had a better chance than most, but it would still require effort to secure funding. Additionally, I had to consider the loss of income from being away from home. Speaking at business conferences is one of the best ways to earn money as a retired athlete. It’s nice that people are interested, but I find it hard to talk about my past achievements without a new goal. Joining the race would mean I wouldn’t just be discussing my past; I would actually be doing something again: rowing across the Atlantic. I learned a lot while planning this adventure, but one of the biggest lessons was to appreciate the easier life of a full-time athlete. My preparation for the Olympics was tough, with my life focused on getting in the best shape possible. Looking back, it was quite straightforward. Yes, I trained almost every day, but the training program was organized, and I had doctors and dieticians to help. I was concerned about how people would react to me racing with a TV presenter. I worried it would seem like I just wanted to be on TV, or else I would have chosen a better partner to win the race. However, my worries faded as we prepared. The Atlantic Rowing Race is about more than just rowing; it’s also about mental strength. Ben had completed the difficult Marathon des Sables, spent a lot of time at sea, and lived on a deserted island for a year. However, he didn’t know how to row. I was surprised by how little natural ability he had with a boat, and he was shocked by my lack of understanding. I could have been more patient, but I felt it was important to be honest with Ben about the significant improvements he needed to make. I should have realized that this would be his level when I agreed to race with him."""
104,"Text: ""Just over a year ago, I left my job to work with huskies in the Arctic Circle in northern Finland. At 26, I felt restless and dreamed of cold, empty landscapes, perhaps because I was tired of the noise and crowds of London. I found a small company run by Anna McCormack and her husband, Pasi Ikonen, in Finnish Lapland. They offered me a position as a husky dog handler for a busy winter season. From December to February, they take many tourists on sled rides pulled by huskies across the ice and snow, which can last from one hour to five days. They started with six dogs, but now have over 100. Recently, they took over a second location called the 'wilderness farm,' which they described as a beautiful but basic place with unreliable electricity and no running water. They told me I could join the team for three months if I understood the challenges: 'The hours are long, the conditions are tough, and the work is very physical.' I began packing right away.

On November 6, while flying to Finland, I stared at a page with over 100 pictures of huskies. I was supposed to memorize their names, but I felt distracted and anxious. Instead, I looked out the window. I remembered that spring moves north at about 26 km per day, bringing flowers and leaves. However, I felt like winter was moving south, freezing the rivers.

On November 7, I took a bus north, which was everything I hoped for. We drove through endless dark forests with snow-covered trees, stopping occasionally for reindeer. I arrived at the farm after dark and was quickly given a pair of boots and sent out into the cold. Anna asked, 'Do you want to be thrown in at the deep end?' It was a rhetorical question. I followed the barking sounds to the dogsheds, where three people were busy harnessing the excited huskies to sleds. I could barely introduce myself because everyone was too busy. I stood aside and petted one of the calmer dogs. Someone urged me to join in, and I almost fell into the nearest sled. A command was shouted, and we took off into the dark, guided only by a headlamp.

By November 15, I was starting to learn how to be a husky guide, but first, I faced a tough questioning about my skills. 'Are you useful?' Anna asked. I was unsure. Further questions revealed that I was not very useful: I had never driven a snowmobile, done woodwork, or used an axe. Finally, someone asked if I had a driving license, and I nodded, feeling relieved. 

I quickly learned the basics of dog-sledding: lean into the corners, use both feet on the brake to stop, and never let go of the handlebar. However, other tasks were complicated. Simple things like feeding and watering the dogs became hard in freezing temperatures. A bowl of water would freeze quickly, so we had to make a 'soup' of meat in hot water for the dogs. By the end of my first week, I was overwhelmed with instructions, and my muscles ached from pulling heavy sleds and being pulled by excited huskies. But I felt proud. I emailed my friends, 'I can chop with an axe, hammer a nail, and use a circular saw—in the snow!'"""
105,"On that day, as Radcliffe ran past the finish line, reporters gathered to understand her amazing performance. They noted that her time was fast enough to qualify her for the men's marathon at the world championships in Paris. Curious journalists asked her about the benefits of emu oil, a natural treatment recommended by Olympic gold medallist Cathy Freeman to heal injuries Radcliffe suffered when she accidentally collided with a bike during training. Radcliffe says that the achievement didn’t fully register with her at the time. Looking back, she realizes it was a significant moment, but she felt it was just part of her plan for the day. She and her support team had decided not to set any limits, following the motto: no limits.

During the race, Gary Lough, Radcliffe's husband and coach, was in a car with her support team, listening to the radio coverage. Gerard Hartmann, her physiotherapist, was also with him. After 16 kilometers, Radcliffe's agent questioned whether she could maintain her fast pace, worried it might cause her to drop out. Hartmann was angry at this concern, although he acknowledged that anyone unfamiliar with her fitness might see it as a risk to start so quickly.

With 800 meters left, Radcliffe began to calculate her finish time. She realized she could finish in under 2 hours and 16 minutes if she crossed the line in less than three minutes. After running 41 kilometers at high speed, she managed to sprint the last stretch in 2 minutes and 25 seconds. At the finish, she thought, ""I can run faster than that."" She remembered race director Dave Bedford saying he never thought anyone would come close to that time for a while, and she thought, ""I will come back and do it next year."" Unfortunately, that did not happen.

After the race, everyone was curious about how an athlete with such an unusual running style had outperformed the skilled East African runners. Hartmann had spent weeks with Radcliffe, providing daily training sessions to support her as she covered 250-300 kilometers each week. He said, ""I've worked with 63 Olympic medallists, and no one could handle the level of pain she could. She would push me to my limits; I had to ice my thumbs afterward because I was in so much pain.""

Hartmann described traveling 13 hours from his home in Ireland to Radcliffe's training base in France, only to be greeted by her husband saying, ""Gerard, you're 15 minutes late, Paula's waiting."" There was no time for a friendly greeting; she was ready for a two-hour training session. ""Paula would push you to give everything you had. That's what made her so successful."" Hartmann dedicated so much time to Radcliffe that his other athletes became resentful.

Can Radcliffe explain why no one has come close to her record? ""Not really. I trained very hard, but there are more talented people out there. I thought Mary Keitany (two-time London marathon winner) might break it. Maybe it's because people are competing against each other instead of focusing on their own performance."" What does she mean? ""That mental attitude of never easing up, even when you’re winning, probably helped me because I never thought, 'I can relax now.' It was always about pushing myself as hard as I could.""

Radcliffe did not realize at the time that this marathon was the peak of her career. She would never run that fast again, but she inspired many women to take up long-distance running."
106,"When my first cooking show, In Search of Perfection, was released, I was unsure how viewers and critics would react. At that time, there was a lot of discussion about a food ‘revolution’ happening in Britain. I believed we had created a series that truly contributed to this movement, but I still worried: would people enjoy a cooking show that included not just techniques but also history, nostalgia, and science? I watched the first episode feeling both excited and anxious. Fortunately, I didn’t need to worry. The show became successful and led to many other interesting projects, including a book about my experiences at my restaurant. Each project felt like a journey, whether into the past, the mind, or cooking techniques. I later wrote several books in a series called ‘Perfection’, each linked to its own TV show. In these books, the journey was often physical, involving travel and exploration. 

The latest book, In Search of Total Perfection, takes you around the world to meet amazing artisans, like a man who dedicates his life to making golden pasta that tastes better than any other. These artisans have spent years chasing their own ideas of perfection. Perfection is very personal. Even the simple task of choosing which dishes to feature in the series was challenging, and I knew I would disappoint some people by not including their favorites. I could imagine them asking, “Where’s steak and kidney pie and bread and butter pudding?” However, after a long meeting with the TV production team, we finally created a list that would satisfy everyone. This experience reinforced my belief that everyone has their own idea of perfection, shaped by their emotions, memories, and environment.

Despite the book’s title, I never claimed that the recipes were ‘definitive’. I believed that by using my skills and knowledge, and by talking to food producers, artisans, chefs, and their customers, I could identify what made these dishes special. The dictionary defines ‘perfection’ as being perfect, but it also means improving through constant experimentation—trying ideas and refining them until something unique is created. The TV series allowed me to explore many foods, people, and places I had never seen in restaurants, and I was excited to connect food with memory and nostalgia, as I started my career in a similar way. 

Finding the best ingredients took me around the world. I had many adventures, like visiting a canning factory that was processing the wrong type of tomato and going to a dairy farm that did not meet our standards for perfection, which forced us to stop filming there! While perfecting each recipe, I ended up hand-milking a cow and using dry ice to make ice cream, cooking chicken in a hospital scanning machine, and almost burning my house down trying to get my oven hot enough for a real Neapolitan-style pizza."
107,"We were still a long way from Marrakech when the van made a loud noise, swerved off the road into a field, and stopped. John got out and opened the hood. He looked at the engine for a long time with his hands in his pockets, looking like he knew what he was doing. “Actually, I have no idea what I’m doing,” he finally admitted, and he and Mum started to laugh. Bea was worried, saying, “We can’t stay here forever.” The field went on for miles, filled with grass and many flowers like poppies and daisies. “No, we can’t stay here forever,” I agreed, wanting to support Bea. We got back into the van and waited for Mum and John to stop laughing. We watched John get smaller as he walked away to find someone who could help with the van. Mum lay down on the grass. “Tell us a story,” she said. Bea lay down next to her and encouraged me, “Go on, tell us a story.” So, I shared a story about how the day before we left London, I heard two birds talking. I told them everything the birds discussed: breadcrumbs, other birds, the weather, and an argument over a worm. “That’s silly, no one understands bird language,” Bea said. My eyes felt teary. “I do.” But I didn’t sound very sure. “Liar,” she replied. I felt embarrassed. How could I be lying if I remembered every word? The more I thought about it, the less certain I became. “Mum…?” But she had fallen asleep in the sun. 

John returned with three Moroccan boys who helped us push the van down the road to a hotel. Bea didn’t want to get out, but the boys didn’t mind. They waved and smiled at her through the back windows. We followed John into a café that was a little away from the road, not far from where our van was parked. “It’s a hotel,” John whispered. “It might be a bit expensive.” “We’ll just have some tea,” Mum said to comfort him, and we sat in the shade of the terrace. The tea they served was made from mint leaves and was very sweet. Mum looked into the pot and said, “It’s like syrup in there.” We stayed at the café all day while John looked sadly at the engine. “I guess it’s a miracle it got us this far,” he said as it started to get dark. Mum took out blankets and made a bed for us in the hotel garden. It felt nice to sleep on solid ground. “I’ll have to get us towed into Marrakech,” John said from the other side of Mum. 

Half an hour later, we were in a truck watching our van being pulled behind with John driving. At first, Bea didn’t want to move, so John picked her up and put her in the truck. Now she sat in the front with the driver. I kept wondering how we would get home now that our van had to be towed everywhere. I thought it might be easier if we could take a boat straight to London. Then I must have fallen asleep."
108,"Lucy was at a welcome party in a hotel ballroom, talking to two other pianists who were also at the Prague Classical Music Festival. They were older than her by about ten years. One was a guy from Tokyo, and the other was a girl from a European city whose name Lucy couldn’t quite hear over the noise. They were both good at English and discussed the music they were playing, their recent travels, and their future plans. 

“I think I’m doing Tanglewood this summer,” Lucy said, trying to sound impressive. However, she didn’t really want to go to the Tanglewood festival. She often felt overwhelmed by the concerts and competitions that took her around the world, making her miss so much school that she wasn’t officially enrolled anymore. Instead, she worked with tutors from the University of San Francisco. 

Lucy hadn’t even wanted to come to the Prague Festival, which only accepted fifteen pianists her age from around the world. She had been selected from thousands of applicants. At the celebration, her dad bought her a white-gold necklace with an L pendant to congratulate her, and her little brother Gus dreamed of being at the same festival one day. Her teacher, Grace Chang, took her out for a special dinner to plan her music pieces. The truth was, Lucy hadn’t applied herself; her mother had filled out the form and sent in a CD. “I didn’t want you to be disappointed if you didn’t get in,” her mom had said. Lucy thought her mom just didn’t want to give her the chance to say no. Back then, she believed that making waves was the worst thing to do, so she didn’t even think about trying to back out.

The guy from Tokyo leaned in, seeming surprised. “Tanglewood?” he asked. “Yeah.” “How old are you?” “Fifteen.” He exchanged a look with the girl, who said, “Wow.” Lucy hadn’t meant to brag; it was hard to know when she was sharing her achievements and when she was showing off. “It’s just part of this new youth-spotlight thing they’re trying…” The girl then looked across the room, as if she saw someone she needed to talk to, and left. The guy stayed and asked, “Have you ever been to Japan?” He had long, shaggy hair, like many musicians, to show that they were serious about music but also a bit rebellious. “Once, when I was about eight,” Lucy replied. He started to respond when Lucy's grandfather appeared beside her. 

“Lucy, let me introduce you to someone,” he said, taking her arm and pulling her away from the conversation. “And don’t get too friendly with the competition.” “They’re not the competition,” Lucy replied. “Everyone is the competition,” her grandfather insisted. He took her around the room, making her talk to important people. Lucy smiled and nodded, understanding only part of what was said. 

Later, in the elevator to their suite, her grandfather turned to her. “You did well in there, Lucy. I’m proud of you. This is an important festival, and people are talking about you. They all know who you are.” She liked that part—being recognized. Even if some people were jealous or thought she was too young for the attention she received. Being a concert pianist didn’t earn her respect from the kids at her old school. Even her best friend, Reyna, wouldn’t care that she could play a difficult Rachmaninov piece perfectly. But in places like this, Lucy felt she mattered."
109,"Text: ""‘Spending too much time online isn’t good for you. You should spend more time in the real world,’ said Dad. It’s hard to argue with him, so I looked into what experts say about this topic, and I found some interesting information. Research shows that most teenagers who use social media have many real-life friends, a strong sense of identity, and are learning important technical skills for the digital world. Simon Miles, an e-safety expert, explains that ‘social networking is now a key part of growing up. Teenagers don’t just use media like adults do; they live in it. This isn’t necessarily good or bad – it depends on how you use it.’ 

How does our social networking compare to what our parents did when they were young? Jim Matthews, a social media analyst, says it’s like the modern version of hanging out at a youth club, where parents used to share jokes and gossip. He believes it helps teenagers build their identity away from their parents and learn to handle teenage issues while connecting with their peers. 

Psychologist Professor Keith Davidson states, ‘Adolescence is a time for figuring out who you are. Social networking can help with this: you can share your favorite music or sports, find out what you enjoy, and see that others have different perspectives. Research shows that active social networkers are not as self-centered as those who don’t use social media.’ He adds that social media can be helpful for shy people: ‘Talking online can feel easier than in person, and it allows you to practice social skills in a less stressful way.’

Professor Andrew Phillips is studying how young people use social networking sites. He believes they can be beneficial for quiet individuals with specific interests because they connect with others who share those interests. ‘If you’re one of the few people in your school who likes a certain type of music, you might feel alone. But finding a social networking group of similar people can make you feel part of a community,’ he says.

Pauline White, a digital education expert, shared something interesting: ‘Young people who discover new interests online, join networks of like-minded individuals, and create their own content are truly making the most of social networks.’ She believes social networking is becoming a creative outlet: teenagers are making videos, podcasts, and blogs about their interests. Photo-sharing sites are changing creativity, allowing photographers to connect, learn, share images, and deepen their skills. ‘This enhances employability and will be valuable in the workplace,’ she says. ‘Every business uses social media to sell and build brand awareness – understanding how it works is essential. For instance, if you create a product and have 1,000 friends on various social networks, they could all be potential customers. Linking these networks creates your customer base.’

Teenagers who use social networking creatively will benefit when they become adults and enter the job market, Matthews agrees. ‘One great aspect of many sites is the chance to collaborate with others to create and share content. Collaboration is a vital skill in the 21st century and is important for being employable in a digital world.’"""
110,"When people think of a relaxing family vacation, they might not imagine a long trip across nine western states in the US and a Canadian province. However, my parents were not looking for a quiet getaway when they planned our summer vacation this year. My dad seemed determined to create what he thought was the perfect family bonding experience, which my twin brother and I found terrifying. “Not enough people do this anymore,” my parents kept saying, while we exchanged worried looks.

In mid-June, we packed our car with suitcases, coolers, and a mix of clothes for any weather. I was excited but knew I would miss my privacy for the next two weeks. With barely enough space left for us, we began “The Family Great American Road Trip.” Leaving our spacious home for smaller places over the next five thousand miles made me wonder what we had gotten ourselves into.

We headed west through the Oklahoma panhandle. Even though we were still close to home, we had our share of adventures. We stopped for the night in Oklahoma, under a sky full of stars, after almost being blown off the road by a dust storm. We quickly learned that cattle have the right-of-way on the road!

The next day, we woke up early and continued our journey. The desert changed to mountains, and the days started to blend together, but each experience was still unique. We left our footprints in the Great Sand Dunes and then moved on to Pagosa Springs, Colorado, where we noticed a strong smell of sulfur. As we climbed to our next stop, we realized that the roads marked for Jeeps were best for actual Jeep drivers.

Every place we visited showed a mix of old and new. Dealing with construction traffic became normal. We laughed at the large “CLOSED” signs in front of the Four Corners Monument. On our way to Yellowstone National Park, we saw many wind farms and watched the sunset over bear habitats near the roads. We experienced “bear jams,” where traffic would stop to let bears cross, and had a memorable encounter with a bear and a nervous park ranger.

As we continued driving, life back home felt distant. Even our hotel, an old building with no internet or cell service, couldn’t dampen our excitement. Instead, I enjoyed some of the most beautiful views I had ever seen. After watching a rainstorm from our hotel in Canada, we began our journey back south. My parents were right: you don’t need to travel to a faraway place to find something amazing. 

Returning home was a mix of emotions, but at least I hadn’t argued with my brother during our one hundred hours on the road! We had three thousand photos from our adventure to look through, and I knew I would remember the unexpected and spontaneous moments the most."
111,"Rose Frost was sixteen years old and was going to live with her grandmother, Daisy. Her family was separating for two years because her father, Jeff, had a job overseas, and her mother, Dahlia, would join him. Rose and her older sister, Amy, would stay in England. Amy needed to finish her last year of school, so it was better for her to remain there. She was happy to have the best room at her college, which included a kitchen and a study area, along with free Internet and phone access. Jeff and Dahlia would keep an eye on Amy, whether she liked it or not. 

Rose was moving to her grandmother’s house. She only had vague memories of her grandmother from past holidays and had never met her grandfather. When Daisy offered Rose a place to stay, her parents were not excited about it, but Daisy was eager to reconnect with her granddaughter. Rose didn’t fully understand why her parents had issues with her grandmother, but there had been a disagreement in the past, leading to summers spent away from Daisy. Rose remembered her last goodbye to Daisy when she was ten, and those memories were happy. Dahlia suggested that living with Daisy would be interesting. Daisy was very social and loved to bring people together. Rose could expect dinner invitations, coffee mornings, and shopping trips soon, which made her smile. Daisy was not a typical frail old lady; she seemed to attend more social events than anyone else.

Before the move, Dahlia and Rose had a serious talk. Rose was sensible and mature for her age. She understood the importance of healthy eating, fitness, and sleep. However, she wanted her independence. Living with Daisy would meet her needs, but Rose wanted to play music loudly, invite friends over, and go out without always asking for permission. She believed she could be trusted with these small things. She didn’t want to be nagged about homework or curfews, and she didn’t want to be dragged around by her grandmother. Daisy understood this.

Dahlia gave Rose a new touch-screen mobile phone with a video camera for emergencies only, which made Rose very happy. They all agreed that their relationship would be based on trust. Daisy would trust Rose to act maturely, and Rose would trust Daisy not to be too controlling. If either of them crossed a line, they would talk about it again.

Rose had never been a wild child. Her few school friends were similar, so her school reports were always good, and her exam results were excellent. This helped her a lot. In five weeks, Rose would start at a new school, meet new friends, and begin her life again. This would be her fourth senior school in five years, so she felt experienced. At least she knew this would be the last time, as she would be starting her final two years of school. For Rose, this was a new chapter in her life."
112,"Charlotte Grainger shares that her primary school teacher was the first person to think she might write a novel. She felt that writing a book was a big challenge and thought it would be a great achievement. When she turned 13, she decided to try writing a novel. Now, that novel is about to be published. Recently, she told her former teacher about it, and the teacher was surprised. She had expected Charlotte to write a book when she was 30 or 40, but Charlotte didn’t understand why she should wait to pursue something she was good at.

On a winter afternoon, I am in the offices of Charlotte’s publishers to interview her about her book. I was surprised to see a 15-year-old girl sitting there. The book is a significant accomplishment; it is well-written and exciting. The only thing that shows it was written by a teenager is the age of the main character. A public relations representative is with us, ready to support Charlotte if needed, but she doesn’t require any help. Charlotte is confident, intelligent, and steady, which keeps her from being overly confident.

Charlotte is aware of the limits of her youth. When I ask her about the complex moral questions in her book, she says, “I was trying to ask big questions, not answer them. I don’t have many life lessons to share with my readers.” She believes her age does not limit her understanding of the world, but she also doesn’t think she is particularly wise. She was interested in the theme of taking responsibility.

Charlotte has a theory about how teenagers are often misrepresented in fiction. She believes there are three common types of teenagers in novels: the outsider who becomes accepted, the naïve teenager who knows little about the world, and the socially awkward teenager. She found it frustrating to read about these stereotypes. “What if you’re basically fine? There aren’t many stories about characters who are not inadequate in some way. Some writers unintentionally suggest that teenagers don’t know who they are because they lack experience, which can hurt their self-confidence.”

Charlotte enjoys reading famous fantasy authors, but their work almost discouraged her from writing. “These books explore deep psychological themes, and I wondered if I needed to do the same to write a good book.” However, she found a helpful book called How Not to Write a Novel, which taught her that if readers can guess what will happen next, the suspense is lost.

Some might think that having journalist parents helped her get her novel published. In fact, her father’s connection in publishing helped her get her book read. Charlotte recognizes her good luck, as it is difficult for any new writer to get someone to read their first novel. “Every aspiring writer needs support and a bit of luck, but after that, you are on your own. Ultimately, writers succeed or fail based on their talent, so I don’t take anything for granted,” Charlotte concludes."
113,"""‘Remember, speed is your friend, not your enemy,’ said Gareth, our instructor, as we looked down the ski slope. ‘Now, who wants to go first?’ The group looked nervous. Then David, who had some experience with freestyle ski-jumping and wanted to show off, stepped forward and skied down the slope towards the jump. He approached the ramp quickly and flew into the air, arms flailing. Even we could see something was wrong. We held our breath. He landed hard, lost both skis, and flipped into the snow. ‘Remember,’ Gareth kindly reminded us, ‘speed can be unpredictable.’ 

Maybe freestyle skiing wasn’t for me. On past skiing holidays, I enjoyed practicing turns in the snow. I wasn’t like those teenagers who did tricks on ramps and half pipes at skate parks. I thought it looked fun, but I felt I would be ridiculed for not knowing how to do it. Then my parents decided we would have a winter holiday at a freestyle skiing training center in the US. It had a large indoor facility with trampolines and ski jumps covered in artificial snow. Students practiced their tricks and landed in foam pits, which was not a realistic way to prepare for the slopes. 

After practicing indoors, students went outside to try their skills for real. ‘Progression is inevitable!’ the center’s slogan cheerfully promised. ‘Before places like this trained people, inexperienced ski jumpers would just throw themselves down the slopes and hope for the best,’ Gareth explained. ‘But remember – if you land on the knuckle, you’ll be in trouble.’ The ‘knuckle’ is the flat area behind the jump before the slope becomes the landing zone. If you land in the zone, you keep moving forward, which reduces the impact. If you land on the flat, you stop suddenly, which hurts. So, speed is important.

At first, it was hard to convince my body to ignore my brain’s fears and go straight towards the jump. My legs seemed to go backward as I neared the launch point, and I landed hard on the knuckle. I didn’t fall, but by midday, I felt exhausted. ‘You need to control the jump, not let it control you,’ Gareth advised. 

On the second day, we started on the trampolines. I thought I would dislike being indoors while looking at the snowy mountains, but bouncing on the trampolines was fun. Some exercises mimicked ski-jumping moves, while others helped us learn ‘aerial awareness’ – understanding what our bodies were doing while spinning in the air. Gareth provided commentary. My ‘aerial awareness’ needed improvement – I only noticed the moment before take-off and then found myself in the foam cubes next to the trampoline.

We returned to the mountain to try again. There were more challenges before I finally landed correctly. Gareth seemed as happy as I was, and for a moment, I felt proud of achieving this difficult goal. But that feeling didn’t last long. On my last run of the day, I forced myself to keep my speed up as I approached the jump, took off, and landed correctly in the landing zone. Then I saw both skis sliding down the slope ahead, no longer attached to my feet."""
114,"Imagine you are on a rollercoaster at an amusement park. Your hands are sweaty from fear, and you grip the harness tightly. Suddenly, the ride stops, and you take a deep breath as the carriage slowly climbs up. There’s a pause, then a sudden drop that makes your stomach feel weightless. You rush forward, turn sharply to the left, and then go upside down. Your senses are overwhelmed, and you scream in fear. But you chose to be here, just like millions of others who pay to enter theme parks.

What surprises me is how big the amusement park industry is, with thrilling rides designed to attract crowds. Behind the scenes, there are many creative and skilled engineers, designers, and marketing experts working hard. The idea of being a ""rollercoaster designer"" might sound like a childhood dream, but it is actually a difficult job. Designers must find the right mix of excitement and safety while also introducing new features to keep visitors interested. 

While many people think rollercoasters are becoming more extreme, most of the techniques used today, like the wheels that allow rides to go upside down, were developed by American designer John Miller in the early 1900s. During his time, there were fewer safety regulations, and some rides were quite risky for passengers. Now, designers must follow the track designs provided by specialized manufacturers.

I spoke with three experts in rollercoaster design. Professor Brendan Walker, a ""thrill engineer,"" explained that the skill lies in putting all the elements together. Dr. John Roberts, a member of the Royal Academy of Engineering, added that it’s about quickly alternating between feelings of excitement and safety, so riders feel thrilled but not unsafe. 

To create an amazing ride, teams must develop a strong story, whether it’s a space adventure or a jungle chase, that combines with exciting features like the tallest drops or the most twists to provide a smooth experience. However, Professor Walker noted that, like in many creative fields, intuition, experience, and trial-and-error are crucial. Jeff Hornick, a senior director in theme park development, agreed that understanding what riders want and testing the rides before they open is important.

I asked the experts if rollercoaster designers would need to use new technologies like virtual reality. Walker responded that while virtual reality can enhance the experience, it is not a replacement for the physical thrill of the ride. He believes that the real rollercoaster experience will continue to be the main attraction for many years."
115,"At 25, Miranda Ellington has already accomplished a lot as a choreographer, creating performances for many theatres and dance companies. She also dances occasionally. I wonder why she manages to do both activities in her busy life. She explains, “Dancing again reminds me of what it’s like to be in the studio, following the instructions of demanding choreographers, which can be tense and frustrating. Choreographers sometimes forget how it feels to rehearse all day.”

As a choreographer, she takes on a teaching role and enjoys working with young students. “Beginners are often open to trying new ideas. In some ways, it’s easier to work with students than professionals because they are willing to take risks. They are eager to succeed but don’t yet fully understand their strengths and weaknesses. This lack of a complete picture makes them more open to even tough criticism. However, they might still question what I say, and I appreciate their honest feedback.”

When Miranda starts with a new group, she focuses on the dance steps, letting the music guide her. “There might be music I don’t like, but I still aim to create the best dance routine for it. If dancers don’t respond well to a certain piece, it can be frustrating, but I must find solutions. I won’t just choose a new piece of music. Ideally, I’d like to experiment more and have the option to switch pieces, which would help improve the mood during tough rehearsals. Unfortunately, I often work on large productions where the music is already decided and cannot be changed.”

Miranda believes in making connections with new people rather than sticking to one institution. “It’s important to meet new people, but I have to remember that each theatre and school has different methods and styles. I need to adapt my approach each time I go somewhere new, rather than just repeating what I’ve done before. This helps me avoid becoming too set in my ways.”

We discuss a recent documentary about professional ballet dancers and choreographers. “There have been glamorous documentaries in the past that were misleading,” Miranda says. “This one tries to show the real life inside a dance company. There’s a scene where a young dancer receives many corrections, and I smiled because I recognized that struggle. She knows she’s not getting it right but can’t make her body do what’s needed. It’s hard to watch, but it’s not staged for the cameras. The public often underestimates the hard work and dedication required in ballet.”

I ask Miranda what makes a great dance production. “It’s when everything the company has put into it – the music, costumes, lighting, and dancers – comes together. Perfection might be too much to expect, but aiming high is appreciated by audiences and can help you overlook some artistic mistakes. I’ve been part of productions where the dance steps were excellent, but something about the costumes or props was distracting, which is disappointing.”

Given her wide range of work, I wonder how she sees herself: is she a modern dance choreographer or a ballet specialist? “People often want to label you, and I don’t understand that. There’s a trend to encourage expertise in a narrow area, but I don’t follow that. Maybe one day I’ll be happy to be known for one thing, but for now, I want to broaden my horizons.”"
116,"A friend once asked me why I travel when I can see everything on television. I agreed that there are amazing things to watch on TV, but I believe it’s better to go out and experience the world. This conversation inspired my unusual four-day trip and a film I made to encourage people to turn off their TVs. A friend was getting rid of his old sofa, which became the main focus of my film. I added three wheels and some cables to the sofa and attached them to old seatbelts that I wore over my shoulders. I placed my luggage on the sofa and even slept on it at night, including one night on the beach. Some friends joined me during the trip, helping to pull the sofa and motivating me to keep going. I have done many walking trips in recent years, but this was very different. It was the longest distance I have ever walked, and I walked along main roads. This allowed me to stop at roadside cafés and relax on the sofa with a cappuccino, instead of sitting on a rock with my sandwiches blowing away in the wind. I often had to tell people, “No, I’m not doing this for charity, and I’m not training for a marathon.” When someone at work asks about my weekend, I prefer to share the story of dragging a sofa 100 miles across southern England rather than talking about the latest TV show. You can watch the film on my website."
117,"When I read about guided swimming trips in the sea around some small Greek islands, I felt excited. I had never tried organized group trips before. My brother, who I had traveled with before, was busy, so I thought a group holiday might be a good idea for me. The man at the Greek port looked surprised when I asked for a single ferry ticket, as the islands are usually popular with families. I explained that I wouldn’t be alone for long; I would be joining ten others to swim around the small islands. Although he still looked confused, he smiled and let me on the boat.

Our group had exchanged emails before we left, but there was little time to talk before our first group swim. Our guides explained that a support boat would follow us the whole time and made sure we knew how to communicate with it. We did a short swim to divide us into speed groups, and then it was time for our first proper swim of 1.5 km, which made me nervous. I had trained in my local pool and done some river swimming, but I had never swum long distances in the open sea.

Soon, the waves got bigger, and I found myself at the back of the slow group, which was not where I wanted to be. I watched the faster swimmers move ahead like dolphins. However, I wanted to finish this first distance, and I was very happy when I finally did it on my own. 

The following days had a routine: jumping in, finding a comfortable speed, and stopping to enjoy the beautiful scenery. As the swims became longer, my speed and enjoyment also increased. I felt like I didn’t need the support boat much anymore. I can hardly wait to come back again next year."
118,"Being a flight attendant is not an easy job, but it has many rewards. Since I started, I have traveled to many places, from the US to Australia. I work with amazing people, have plenty of time off, and my life is always interesting, which makes it a great job for someone young like me!

As a child, I attended a boarding school far from my family, so I often flew alone at the beginning and end of each term. Sometimes I felt lonely, so I would ask the flight attendants if I could help serve meals to passengers, and some of them let me. This experience stayed with me when I decided to leave my banking job and look for a new career.

At the interview for the flight attendant position, I saw many other young people, many of whom were also changing careers. They were often very qualified, just like me. Before the interview, I practiced what to say. I wanted to stand out, so instead of just saying I loved to travel, I talked about my skills and past work experience. This approach helped me get the job!

I would recommend this job to anyone because it has many benefits, although the free flights are not the main reason. Most airline staff work very hard, and there is a saying: ""no one’s finished until everyone’s finished."" It feels like a big family; even if we don’t see each other all the time, we are still close. When I’m off duty, I don’t have to take work home with me. If I do encounter difficult passengers, which is rare, I remind myself that the flight will end soon, and I probably won’t see them again!"
119,"At the summer camp where I work, I really enjoy watching the children achieve things they never thought they could. Most of the children already know how to swim and play table tennis before they arrive, but rock climbing is a new experience for many of them. Some kids feel nervous at first, but with some encouragement, they decide to try, and in the end, they all reach the top. This makes them feel wonderful.

At the beginning of the week, some children miss their homes. Interestingly, it is not the younger ones who feel this way the most; it is usually the ten- to thirteen-year-olds. We limit their use of mobile phones. We first tell them they can call home after lunch. When they ask again, often after dinner, we say it is too late to call and suggest they do it tomorrow. Most children feel better after a couple of days, and by the end of their week, they come to us to say thank you because they have had a great time.

It is not just the children who feel lonely. Sometimes, parents call frequently to check on their child, which is often unnecessary. Their child is usually busy playing games or doing other activities, so we have to ask the parents to call back later.

We also notice a certain type of child who comes to camp, often dressed in expensive new clothes. These children usually argue when we ask them to change into something more appropriate, but soon they understand why it is necessary."
120,"Text: 'Rock the Planet is a musical show where the actors also need to be good musicians. It opened in London last year after being in the USA for five years, where it won the title of ‘Best Musical’ four times! However, putting on the show with an all-British cast was difficult. The UK has stricter rules about how many performances young actors can do each week compared to the USA, where they can perform more often. Because of this, they needed twice as many actors in the UK. Fortunately, the director found many talented actors based in the UK, and they have just won their first ‘Best Musical’ award. 

The theatre in London is larger than the one in the USA, and it has been full every night, with audiences eager to hear the songs that became popular in America. I met Jamie, an 11-year-old actor in the show. He said, ‘It’s amazing that I get paid to play, especially with a beautiful and expensive Gibson guitar.’ He shared how busy the young actors are. ‘We have regular school lessons at the theatre. The teacher is great, but I miss my old school friends.’ I asked him what his classmates thought of the show. He replied, ‘My whole class came! The theatre offers special ticket deals for schools. They loved it, which made me feel really confident. My parents come when they can, but it’s expensive for them.’ 

When I mentioned that I also play guitar, Jamie found a spare one and invited me to join him and the other young actors. We played a song called Days, which I didn’t know. Jamie helped me learn it, and I felt proud when I finally got it right. I was impressed by Jamie’s talent and wished I had similar skills. I was just trying to keep up and was relieved that the show’s director wasn’t there to hear my mistakes! Although the young actors were already musicians, with some playing multiple instruments, none had played in a band before. Luckily, they found it quite easy. Jamie admitted that the hardest part was looking natural when they first performed together. They were so focused that they forgot to smile! The show will be in London for another year, and it is definitely worth seeing.'"
