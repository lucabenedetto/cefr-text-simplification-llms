1,"Some time ago, a website warned about the dangers of public check-ins, which are online posts that show where you are. The website's message was clear: when you say, ""Hey, I’m at this place,"" you are also telling everyone where you are, including people you might not want to meet. This reflects a growing understanding that sharing everything online can have negative effects. The internet gives us many chances to share our lives with a global audience, which can seem exciting: wealth, fame, and more. However, we often realize too late that the online world can be crowded and dangerous.

But don’t lose hope. There is guidance from early internet users who explored these challenges before us. In the beginning of the web, they faced many difficulties, lost jobs, and dealt with the temptations of fame, long before social media existed. These early bloggers experienced what many of us are now going through. It’s important to learn from their experiences.

In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started sharing his life online. At that time, the web was mostly used by graduate students and scientists. Hall saw a chance to share his personal story. He created a blog filled with his thoughts, photos, and art. In January 1996, he began posting daily, attracting many readers who were fascinated by his boldness. Hall was open about everything; no topic was off-limits. While some might see this as attention-seeking, there was also a creative side to his work.

However, one day, visitors to his blog found it replaced by a video called Dark Night. Hall shared that he had fallen in love, but when he wrote about it, he was told to choose between his blog and his relationship. He felt that sharing his life online made people distrust him. The blog ended, but the issue remains: sharing online can be great, but if you think it will make people want to be around you, you might be disappointed.

In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a young woman in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job at a software company. One day, a colleague sent her blog link to the company’s vice presidents, including some she had criticized, and she lost her job. This situation shows the ""online distribution effect,"" where people feel they can say things online that they wouldn’t say in person. However, the internet is not a separate reality; our online actions can have real-life consequences.

Armstrong’s story had a happy ending. Although she was upset and stopped blogging for a while, she later got married and started a new blog about her family. Today, she is successful as a ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing supports her family. Once known for her online mistakes, she has learned to share her life more carefully. Armstrong’s experience teaches us an important lesson: the internet allows us to say anything, but that doesn’t mean we should."
2,"Some scientists recently started a campaign to warn people about a low-budget film called *What the Bleep Do We Know?* This film mixes documentary and drama to show that there is much we do not understand about our universe. While scientists can sometimes be arrogant, even the most confident physicist would not claim to know everything about the cosmos. However, some scientists felt it was important to warn the public about the film, calling it everything from “atrocious” to “very dangerous.” This made me curious to see the movie.

At first, I didn’t understand why there was so much concern. Various scientists made simple statements about how new discoveries are showing that the universe is stranger than we thought. But when the film started to explain some of these discoveries, I began to understand the fuss. One claim was that water molecules can be influenced by thoughts. I had heard before about a Japanese researcher who suggested that the shape of a water molecule could change based on the feelings of people nearby. However, the film only showed pictures of ice crystals that looked beautiful after being spoken to nicely and ugly after being exposed to negative emotions. Many people find this kind of evidence convincing, but scientists often respond with skepticism.

I understand their point. The idea that thoughts can affect water is fascinating and suggests new forces in the universe. But before we get too excited, we need solid proof that this effect is real. Pretty pictures of crystals are not enough. The real issue is that the movie’s claims were not strange enough. For example, water molecules might have properties linked to a mysterious energy that is causing the universe to expand. This idea is supported by decades of research from scientists around the world.

In fact, discoveries are being made that show the universe is indeed stranger than we ever imagined. Astronomers have found that the universe is made of an unknown type of matter and is driven by a mysterious force called “dark energy.” On a more practical level, neuroscientists have discovered that our awareness of events happens about half a second after they occur, a delay we don’t notice because our brains edit it out. Anthropologists believe they have found where modern humans first appeared and how they spread across the world. Some theorists even suggest there are connections between life on Earth and the fundamental design of the universe.

Despite what some may think, science is not close to being complete. In fact, we seem to be further from knowing everything than ever before. Many natural phenomena may never be fully understood. The ideas of chaos and quantum uncertainty show that there are limits to what we can know. Some of the world’s top physicists are trying to create a “Theory of Everything” that would explain all the forces and particles in the universe with one equation. Overall, many of us believe that the universe can be described in one word: incredible."
3,"To put it simply, I find writing novels challenging, but writing short stories is a joy. If writing novels is like planting a forest, then writing short stories is more like planting a garden. Both processes work together to create a beautiful landscape that I love. The trees provide shade, and the wind moves the leaves, which can turn a bright gold. In the garden, flowers bloom, and their colorful petals attract bees and butterflies, showing us the gentle change of seasons.

Since I started my career as a fiction writer, I have often switched between writing novels and short stories. My routine is this: after finishing a novel, I want to write short stories; after completing a group of short stories, I feel ready to focus on a novel. I never write short stories while working on a novel, and I never write a novel while working on short stories. The two types of writing may use different parts of my brain, and it takes time to switch from one to the other.

I began my career with two short novels in 1975, and from 1984 to 1985, I started writing short stories. I didn’t know much about writing short stories then, so it was difficult, but I found the experience very memorable. I felt my fictional world expand, and readers seemed to enjoy this different side of me as a writer. One of my early works, “Breaking Waves,” was included in my first short-story collection, Tales from Abroad. This was my beginning as a short-story writer.

One of the joys of writing short stories is that they don’t take long to finish. Usually, it takes me about a week to shape a short story (though I can revise it many times). It’s not the same level of commitment as writing a novel, which can take a year or two. I can go into a room, finish my work, and leave. Writing a novel can feel like it goes on forever, and I sometimes wonder if I will make it through. So, writing short stories is a nice change of pace.

Another great thing about short stories is that you can create a story from the smallest ideas—like a thought, a word, or an image. Often, it feels like jazz improvisation, where the story takes me where it wants to go. Plus, with short stories, you don’t have to worry about failing. If an idea doesn’t work out, you can just accept it and move on. Even famous writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver didn’t write a masterpiece every time. This gives me comfort. You can learn from your mistakes and use that knowledge in your next story.

When I write novels, I try to learn from both the successes and failures I have in writing short stories. In this way, short stories are like a testing ground for me as a novelist. It is hard to experiment the way I want to in a novel, so without short stories, writing novels would be even more difficult.

My short stories are like soft shadows I have left in the world, gentle reminders of my feelings when I wrote them. They guide me, and it makes me happy as a writer to share these personal feelings with my readers."
4,"At its core, science is closely related to philosophy, but it also has practical uses, like curing diseases. Science has made our lives easier but has also posed threats to our existence. It tries to understand everything from tiny ants to the vast universe, but it often struggles to do so. Science has influenced poets, politicians, philosophers, and even frauds. Its beauty is often seen only by those who study it deeply, while its dangers are often misunderstood. People have both overestimated and underestimated its importance, and the mistakes made by scientists are sometimes ignored or exaggerated.

The history of science is filled with conflict. Old theories are often changed or completely replaced, similar to how new music styles are sometimes mocked before becoming popular. Scientists can be jealous and angry, and conflict is a big part of scientific history. This book will show how scientific ideas have changed not just science itself but also many areas of human thought. While science has practical benefits, this book will focus more on the ideas behind it, appreciating their beauty and being ready to question them. We will recognize both the creativity and the limitations of the human mind.

Science is always changing. There is always a scientist challenging the ideas of another. Most of the time, these changes do not disrupt society, but sometimes they can shake our established beliefs. For example, in the 17th century, science described the universe as a giant clock. Now, physics has raised questions about basic ideas, leading us to understand that observing the universe can change it, and we often do not fully understand our own concepts.

Some people think that the changing nature of scientific theories shows that science cannot explain the universe. However, these changes usually help us understand and predict nature better. For instance, Isaac Newton explained more than the ancient Greek thinker Aristotle, and Albert Einstein explained even more than Newton. Science may make mistakes, but it continues to progress. 

At the end of the 19th century, many physicists believed there was nothing important left to discover. Then came breakthroughs like radioactivity, X-rays, the electron, and many new particles, along with concepts like quantum mechanics and black holes. Biology has also made significant discoveries. Today, some people claim that a complete theory explaining everything about the universe is coming soon. 

Science is not just a harmless activity. In the last 200 years, we have moved from simply observing nature to controlling it in small but growing ways. Sometimes, we have disrupted nature in ways we did not fully understand. It is important for everyone, not just scientists, to understand scientific advances because they will shape the world for future generations. Science is now a key part of how humanity thinks about and shapes its future. The decisions made in science can impact budgets, health, and even the future of life on Earth."
5,"From around 2015, after many years of growth, major publishers began to notice that ebook sales had stopped increasing or even decreased in some cases. This raised new questions about the future of ebooks in the publishing industry. One anonymous publishing executive recently admitted that the excitement around ebooks may have led to poor investments, causing his company to lose faith in the value of printed books. Despite the clear idea that digital and print books can exist together, people still wonder if ebooks will replace printed books. Whether people are trying to predict or dismiss this idea, it is important to note that the thought of books disappearing continues to spark our imagination and create strong discussions.

Why is this idea so strong? Why do we see the relationship between ebooks and printed books as a battle, even when evidence shows they can coexist? The answers to these questions go beyond ebooks and reveal much about our mixed feelings of excitement and fear regarding change and innovation. In my research, I have shown that the idea of one type of media replacing another often comes up when new technologies are introduced. For example, after television was invented, many believed that radio would disappear. However, radio survived by finding new ways to be used, like listening in cars or on trains.

The idea that books might disappear is not new either. As early as 1894, people thought that the phonograph would replace books with what we now call audiobooks. This pattern has repeated many times. Movies, radio, television, hyperlinks, and smartphones have all been said to threaten the existence of printed books. Some people worried that the end of books would lead to a decline in culture, while others imagined a perfect future with ebooks and exaggerated their benefits.

The idea of books disappearing often appears during times of technological change. This story reflects our hopes and fears about new technology. To understand why we react this way, we need to recognize that we form emotional connections with different types of media as they become important in our lives. Many studies show that we develop strong feelings for objects like books, televisions, and computers, even naming our cars or getting frustrated with our laptops when they don’t work.

When new technology, like e-readers, appears, it doesn’t just mean economic and social change. It also forces us to rethink our relationship with things that have become part of our daily lives. As technology evolves, we often miss what we used to know but no longer have. This is why industries grow around older products and technologies. For example, when the printing press spread in 15th-century Europe, people began to seek out original manuscripts. The change from silent to sound movies in the 1920s made people nostalgic for the older style. The same happened when photography changed from analog to digital and from vinyl records to CDs. 

E-readers have also led to a new appreciation for the physical qualities of printed books, even their unique smell. This should comfort those who worry about printed books disappearing. However, the idea of a medium disappearing will continue to be an interesting story about the power of technology and our fear of change. One way we cope with change is by using familiar stories, like those of tragedy and endings. The story of the death of the book is easy to remember and share, reflecting both our excitement for the future and our fear of losing parts of our familiar world—and ultimately, ourselves."
6,"Text: 

For a year and a half, I woke up every weekday at 5:30 AM. I brushed my teeth, made coffee, and wrote about how some of the greatest thinkers of the last four hundred years managed their time to do their best work. I focused on the everyday details of their lives, like when they slept, ate, and worked, to show their personalities and careers. The French writer Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin once said, “Tell me what you eat, and I shall tell you what you are.” I believe, “Tell me what time you eat, and whether you take a nap afterward.” 

This book is not just about the creative work itself, but about the daily routines that help people be productive. I also share my personal struggles: How can you do meaningful creative work while making a living? Is it better to focus completely on one project or to work a little each day? When time is short, do you have to give up things like sleep or a clean house, or can you learn to do more in less time? I don’t claim to answer these questions, but I provide examples of how many successful people have faced similar challenges. 

The title of the book is Daily Rituals, but I really focus on people’s routines. Routines can seem ordinary, but they can also help us use our time, willpower, and optimism effectively. A good routine can help us stay focused and avoid being influenced by our moods. The psychologist William James believed that having good habits allows us to focus on more interesting things. Ironically, he struggled with procrastination and could not stick to a regular schedule.

This book started because of my own procrastination. One Sunday, while trying to write a story for a small architecture magazine, I found myself cleaning my workspace and making coffee instead of working. I am a “morning person” and can concentrate well in the morning, but I struggle in the afternoon. To feel better about this, I began searching online for information about other writers’ schedules. I thought it would be interesting to collect these stories, which led to the Daily Routines blog I started that day, and now this book.

The blog was simple; I shared descriptions of people’s routines from biographies and articles. For the book, I have gathered a much larger and better-researched collection while keeping the variety of voices that made the blog enjoyable. I let my subjects speak for themselves through quotes from their letters, diaries, and interviews. In some cases, I summarized their routines from other sources. I want to acknowledge the many biographers, journalists, and scholars whose research helped me. I have listed all my sources in the Notes section for further reading."
7,"Howard became a palaeontologist because of a change in interest rates when he was six years old. His father, who was careful with money and had a big loan, said that their planned holiday to Spain was no longer possible. Instead, they rented a chalet on the English coast. One rainy August afternoon, Howard found an ammonite on the beach. He had always wanted to be a palaeontologist, and by the end of university, he knew what kind he wanted to be. He was interested in the very early history of life, not in dinosaurs or the Jurassic period. He studied small creatures found in grey rocks.

When he finished his doctoral thesis, he wondered if he would get a job, especially in the kind of place he wanted. He was confident in his abilities, but he knew that hard work does not always lead to success. When a job opened up at Tavistock College in London, he applied, but did not expect much.

On the day of his interview, the professor who was supposed to lead the panel had a fight with his wife. He left home upset, crashed his car into a gatepost, and ended up in the hospital. The interview went ahead without him, and a colleague who did not like the professor took his place. This colleague helped Howard get the job, even though Howard did not know him. At first, Howard was grateful, but later he learned the truth about how he got the job. He was a bit disappointed, wishing he could believe he was chosen for his skills. However, what mattered most was that he had the job and could do the work he loved.

Howard often thought about how organized his professional life was, where he could plan and achieve goals, compared to the chaos of personal life. Sometimes, strangers could unexpectedly change everything, like when his briefcase with important lecture notes was stolen at a train station. Angry, Howard went back to college, called to postpone his lecture, and reported the theft. He then went for coffee and met a colleague who was with a visitor from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. This conversation led Howard to learn about a new collection of fossils that needed to be studied, which would be a great opportunity for him.

Because of the theft, Howard changed his plans. He decided not to go to a conference in Stockholm or take students on a trip to Scotland. Instead, he would find a way to visit the museum in Nairobi."
8,"Charles Spence is a professor at Oxford University who enjoys trying unusual foods. He mentions that he has ice cream made from bee larvae at home, which may look strange but supposedly tastes a bit like nuts and flowers. Spence and his team are working on making eating bugs more acceptable. His research focuses on how our senses work together to create the flavors we experience. This research influences what we eat and drink, from large food companies to high-end restaurants.

Spence studies many factors that affect our taste, such as who we eat with, how food is presented, and even the noise around us. In his book, ""The Perfect Meal,"" co-written with Betina Piqueras-Fiszman, he shares interesting facts about eating. For example, the first person to order in a group usually enjoys their meal more, and we tend to eat 35% more food when dining with one other person, and 75% more with three others.

Spence's lab is simple and not very modern. It has soundproof booths and old audio-visual equipment. By keeping costs low, he can work with chefs who cannot afford research on their own. Much of his funding comes from a large food company. He notes that in the past, research funded by the food industry was not taken seriously in universities. However, now it is important for universities to show that their work has real-world effects.

Spence helps food brands reduce salt and sugar in their products, which is important for keeping customers healthy. Surprisingly, many companies make these changes slowly so that customers do not notice. He explains that when people know about these changes, they often focus too much on the taste and may not enjoy it as much.

Spence first met famous chef Heston Blumenthal while working on a project for a food company. At that time, people thought combining science and food was strange, but Spence believed it could change how people think about food. Their collaboration led to the creation of a dish called ""Sound of the Sea,"" which uses sound to enhance the dining experience.

Spence has found that different sounds can change how we taste food. For example, high-pitched music can make food taste sweeter, while lower sounds can make it taste bitter. Soon, an airline will match music with the food served to passengers. Last year, a well-known brand even released an app that played music while ice cream melted, but they did not match the music to the taste, which is often the case.

At home, Spence's dinner parties can be quite unique. One time, they ate rabbit with the fur still on the cutlery, and another time, they used remote-controlled colored lights. They have even experimented with sounds and different drinks to see how they affect taste. For Spence, home, sweet shops, food conventions, and gastronomy conferences are all part of his research."
9,"Our brains are working harder than ever. We are bombarded with facts, false information, chatter, and rumors, all pretending to be useful information. We have to sort through this to find what we really need to know and what we can ignore. At the same time, we are doing more tasks ourselves. Thirty years ago, travel agents booked our flights and salespeople helped us in stores. Now, we do most of these things on our own. We are trying to manage many responsibilities, including our lives, families, jobs, hobbies, and favorite TV shows, often with the help of our smartphones. These devices have become part of our busy lives, filling every free moment with tasks. 

However, there is a problem. Although we believe we are multitasking—doing several things at once—this is a misleading idea. Earl Miller, a neuroscientist at MIT, explains that our brains are not designed to multitask effectively. When we think we are multitasking, we are actually switching quickly between tasks. Each time we switch, it costs us mental energy. Instead of being expert jugglers, we are more like amateur plate spinners, quickly moving from one task to another and worrying about what we might drop. Even though we feel productive, multitasking actually makes us less efficient.

Research shows that multitasking increases stress hormones, which can lead to confusion and unclear thinking. It creates a desire for constant stimulation, rewarding our brains for losing focus. The prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain we need to stay focused, is easily distracted by new things. This means that the very area we rely on to concentrate is often pulled away by distractions.

Just the chance to multitask can hurt our ability to think clearly. Glenn Wilson, a former psychology professor, calls this problem ""info-mania."" His studies found that trying to focus on a task while seeing an unread email can lower our IQ by almost 10 points. The cognitive losses from multitasking are even worse than those caused by being tired. Russ Poldrack, a neuroscientist at Stanford, discovered that learning while multitasking can send information to the wrong part of the brain. For example, if students do homework while watching TV, the information from their studies goes to a part of the brain that stores skills instead of facts. Without distractions, the information goes to a part of the brain that organizes it better, making it easier to remember.

Additionally, multitasking often involves making decisions, like whether to reply to a text or ignore it. Making decisions is also hard on our brains, and small decisions use the same mental energy as big ones. After making many small choices, we can end up making poor decisions about important matters.

In discussions about information overload, email is often mentioned as a major issue. It’s not that email itself is the problem, but the overwhelming amount of messages we receive. When a 10-year-old boy was asked what his father does for work, he said, ""He answers emails."" His father agreed that this was quite accurate. We feel we must respond to emails, but it often feels impossible to do that and accomplish anything else."
10,"In a zoo in Sweden, a chimpanzee named Santino spent his nights breaking concrete into pieces to throw at visitors during the day. Was he being mean? In caves in the US, female bats help other fruit bat mothers if they can’t find the right position to give birth. Are they being kind? Fifty years ago, these questions were not considered important. Animals had behaviors, and science focused on measuring those behaviors. The idea that animals have thoughts, feelings, and moral beliefs was seen as silly. However, this view has started to change. Research on bats, chimps, rats, dolphins, and chickens has begun to explore animal emotions, which were once a forbidden topic. This change has led to popular science books like Mark Bekoff’s ""Wild Justice"" and Victoria Braithwaite’s ""Do Fish Feel Pain?"". This has sparked a debate that may never be fully answered: do animals have consciousness? This debate raises another question about conscience, which is a person’s sense of right and wrong that guides their actions.

In a recent experiment with cows, those that opened a locked gate to get food showed more happiness—by jumping and kicking—than those that had the gate opened for them. If this research suggests that cows enjoy solving problems, what does it mean for how we produce and eat beef? While the observations are clear, their meaning is debated. Dr. Jonathan Balcombe, author of ""Second Nature,"" believes the only logical response to this research is to stop eating meat. He thinks humanity is close to a major change in ethics, similar to the end of slavery. Aubrey Manning, a professor at Edinburgh University, believes we should reconsider how we view animal intelligence. He thinks animals have a simpler understanding of the world than humans do. Professor Euan MacPhail suggests we should avoid attributing human feelings to animals. These three views may never agree because the main issue is not just scientific or moral, but philosophical. Since defining consciousness is very difficult, can we ever truly understand what it is like to be a bat, as philosopher Thomas Nagel asks?

Balcombe describes an important experiment he conducted that suggests starlings, a type of bird, can feel depressed. In a study at Newcastle University, starlings were divided into two groups. One group lived in spacious, comfortable cages, while the other lived in small, empty cages. Both groups learned to eat tasty worms from one box and avoid unpleasant worms from another. However, when only unpleasant worms were offered, only the starlings in the comfortable cages would eat. Balcombe concluded that living in a bad cage made the starlings feel pessimistic about life. Balcombe, who has worked with animal rights groups, has a strong opinion. He says, “We look back with horror at a time of racism. One day, our views on animals will be the same. We can’t support animal rights while eating a cheeseburger.” If he were the only one with this view, it might be easy to ignore him. But Professor Aubrey Manning shares similar beliefs. Manning has written a textbook called ""An Introduction to Animal Behaviour."" He says, “What we are seeing is a swing in ideas. In the early 20th century, some people thought animals thought just like us, and there was a backlash against that. Now we are moving back to the idea that animals have feelings. But this is a very controversial topic, and we should be careful of academics with strong personal opinions.”"
11,"Critical thinking is a way to engage with what we read or hear to understand it better. Adrian West, a research director at the Edward de Bono Foundation in the U.K., believes that arguing can help us find the truth. While technology helps us store and process information, there are worries that it is changing how we solve complex problems and making it harder to think deeply. West points out that we are often exposed to poor but appealing ideas, which can confuse our ability to reason. He notes that having more information does not always lead to better knowledge or decision-making. 

According to the National Endowment for the Arts, fewer people are reading literature, and this decline is speeding up. Patricia Greenfield, a psychology professor, thinks that focusing more on visual media may be hurting our critical thinking skills. She says that people are now more focused on real-time media and multitasking instead of concentrating on one thing. However, we still do not have a clear answer on how technology affects critical thinking. 

Technology has made critical thinking more complicated, and experts can no longer rely on old beliefs. It is easy to see technology as either good or bad, but the truth is that it can be both, depending on how it is used. For example, a computer game might help or hurt critical thinking. Reading online can improve analysis skills, but constantly clicking on links can prevent deeper thinking. Greenfield, who studied over 50 research papers on learning and technology, says that technology changes how people think. 

She explains that reading helps develop imagination and critical thinking in ways that visual media, like video games and television, do not. However, she also found that visual media can improve some types of information processing. Unfortunately, most visual media do not give people time to reflect or think deeply. As a result, many young people may not reach their full potential. 

How society views technology affects how we think about critical thinking. This is especially clear when looking at video games and learning. James Paul Gee, a professor of educational psychology, argues that video games can actually be beneficial for children. He says that while many believe video games are harmful, they can also be a great learning tool. Evidence shows that playing video games can help children develop better reasoning skills. Games like Sim City and Civilization teach decision-making and analytical skills in engaging environments that mimic the real world. 

In the digital age, as reading and math scores decline, it is important to examine how technology affects our thinking and analysis."
12,"When Matthew Crawford is not thinking and writing about how we should live, he works as a motorcycle mechanic. He chose this job after becoming unhappy with office work and his role in social policy. His first book praised the value of manual jobs, while his latest book discusses how to deal with modern life. He was inspired to write it when he noticed advertisements appearing on a credit card machine while he was shopping. Crawford realized that these distractions are hard to avoid. What we want to think about at any moment is personal, but we often cannot choose this for ourselves because of things we do not even notice. It is becoming harder to think or remember conversations. To avoid constant interruptions, people are closing themselves off and are less likely to talk to strangers. Crawford says we increasingly experience the world through things like video games and apps, which often try to manipulate us. These things reflect our desires perfectly and can take over our lives.

Crawford is not alone in his concerns. Many office workers complain about emails but still spend their free time checking them. Studies show that just seeing a phone can distract us, which many of us have felt when bored at dinner, wanting to check our phones. There is no scientific proof yet that our attention spans have changed, but people are more aware of other things they could be doing. While it is easy to blame technology for this problem, Crawford believes it has made it easier for us to focus on ourselves. With so many choices, it is hard to control our attention, which affects our social lives. People prefer to text friends instead of talking to them. By only interacting with representations of people, we risk losing important connections in society.

Crawford uses his gym as an example. In the past, there was one music player for everyone, which could lead to disagreements over music choices. Now, people listen to their own music with earbuds, and the gym has lost its social atmosphere. Real connections often happen through conflict, like discussing different music tastes.

Crawford suggests two solutions. First, we need to manage noise and distractions in public spaces. More importantly, he believes we should engage in skilled activities to connect with the world in a more meaningful way. He mentions cooks, ice-hockey players, and motorcycle racers as examples of people who deal with real materials. No representation can replace the feeling of a hockey puck on ice or gravel under a motorcycle tire. These roles require good judgment and the ability to interact with others.

Crawford argues that when we engage with the world this way, we see that manufactured experiences are not as fulfilling as real ones. This does not mean everyone should become a chef, but it is important to use our judgment in daily life. There are many benefits to this approach, including professional satisfaction. Constantly fighting distractions can be tiring and make it harder to focus on what is important. In contrast, paying attention to one thing helps us pay attention to others."
13,"Text: 

""What do you do for a living?"" This is a common question in small talk, and we often define ourselves by our jobs. However, if you are a philosopher like me, it can be a bit more complicated. Saying you are a philosopher can sound pretentious. It feels better to say you study or teach philosophy, but calling yourself a philosopher might make people think you believe you know some special truth. This is not true; philosophers are just like everyone else. Still, this stereotype makes me think twice about how I describe myself.

One reason this stereotype exists is that philosophers are seen as people who judge what others do and value intellectual life. The Greek philosopher Aristotle believed that a life spent thinking deeply was the best kind of life. While not all modern philosophers agree with him, philosophy is still connected to thinking and understanding life. Another Greek philosopher, Socrates, said that ""the unexamined life is not worth living,"" meaning that simply accepting what society says can lead to an unsatisfying life. Our ability to think about the world helps us control our lives and make our own choices.

However, living an examined life does not mean you have to read many philosophical books or spend all your time thinking. It just means paying attention to the everyday experiences that shape our lives and making sure they are meaningful. You don’t have to be a wise person living away from society to do this. In fact, examining life can be very practical and should be shared with others, as it is important for a good life.

Another reason people misunderstand philosophers is that academic philosophy has become more distant from real-life experiences, especially for those who do not have formal training. This is not entirely the philosophers' fault; universities often focus on expensive academic journals, making it hard for philosophers to share their ideas with anyone outside their small group of experts. As a result, philosophy can seem disconnected from everyday life. While some philosophers have tried to change this view, many have accepted it. The academic world has created an environment that feels isolated, and as philosophy has become more focused on specific debates, it has become harder to explain these ideas to people who are not trained in the field.

I sometimes call myself an ""ethicist"" because I mainly work in ethics, which is the part of philosophy that looks at human actions. Recently, I have felt that this title does not fully describe my work because ethics is often linked to formal rules and laws. There is a new trend in philosophy where ethics is seen as applied ethics, which examines the fairness of certain social practices. The role of an ethicist today is to decide if an action is ethical or acceptable. These are important questions that I often explore.

However, philosophy is more than just this. A typical discussion might start by asking if illegally downloading movies is unethical (it is) and then move on to deeper questions about responsibility, our views on art, and the effects of consumerism. In this way, philosophy helps people think more carefully about the actions and behaviors that shape their lives. Sometimes we might confirm what we already believe; other times, we might find that our beliefs are hard to defend. Either way, by examining these ideas, we can benefit everyone."
14,"Food lovers, chefs, and anyone who enjoys food might think that thinking about what and how we eat can make eating more enjoyable. However, throughout history, discussions about food in philosophy have often been less important than other philosophical topics. When philosophers talk about eating, they often use it as a metaphor for something else, like gaining knowledge. Sometimes, there are discussions that seem to be about food, but when we look closer, we see they are actually about different, but related, ideas.

One interesting example is the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus. He believed in seeking pleasure and avoiding pain in many areas of life. However, his name has become closely linked to enjoying food and drink. We see his name used in restaurants, food shops, and recipe websites, likely because these businesses hope to attract customers by connecting with a famous philosopher.

Food is also a social and cultural experience. The food we eat comes from history and is shared with our communities. These communities provide us with people to eat with and the systems that help grow and distribute food. We interact with food more often and in more important ways than with other products, making it a clear topic for philosophical discussion.

Once food is prepared, critics begin to talk and write about it. But why do these critics have such a special status? One philosopher pointed out that tasting food is not a special skill; rather, good food critics are just better at describing flavors. This area of taste has not been studied much in philosophy, as most research has focused on vision. This needs to change.

Another important aspect of food is its beauty. We often describe paintings or music as beautiful, but we rarely talk about the taste of food in the same way. Some philosophers believe that, with the growth of modern cooking, food deserves to be discussed in the same way as art forms like sculpture or poetry. However, food is consumed and disappears when we enjoy it, unlike art, which lasts over time. Therefore, it is incorrect to think of food as a true object of beauty.

There are also many ethical questions related to food. We can ask what we should eat: organic, free-range, locally grown, vegetarian, or non-genetically modified foods? The answers often reflect our ethical beliefs, and philosophers will always question why we choose what we do. This kind of academic discussion about food is important.

Another topic is the difference between cooking at home and in restaurants. Home cooks have a special responsibility to their guests because of their personal relationships. In a home kitchen, everyone shares food and companionship. In contrast, professional cooks have responsibilities to their employers and the food itself. Their kitchens are not open to everyone, and their relationships are more about colleagues than friends.

A recent essay called ""Diplomacy of the Dish"" looks at how food and dining can help connect different cultures. This happens in two ways: first, we learn to appreciate others by enjoying their food, and second, we build personal connections with people from other cultures by sharing meals. This practice has a long history in international relations. The essay includes many interesting examples and stories that make this part of food philosophy engaging for readers."
15,"Rob Daviau, from the US, creates ‘legacy’ board games. He felt that the traditional board games he played as a child were not fun or challenging enough anymore, so he started to think about how board games could change. He wondered if they could have a story and if choices made in one game could affect future games. He took a classic board game called Risk and made a new version called Risk Legacy. In this game, decisions made during play have lasting effects. Players might have to tear up cards, change the board, or open packets with new rules at important moments. The game is played over several sessions, and players’ past actions become part of the game’s story. Daviau said, “You could point to the board and say: ‘Right here! You did this!’”

Later, he was asked to work on a legacy version of Pandemic, a very popular cooperative board game where players try to cure diseases. His next project was a game called SeaFall. While Pandemic Legacy was very well received, SeaFall was seen as a true test of the legacy format because it was the first game that did not follow an earlier version. Set in the age of sailing (16th to mid-19th century), players become sailors exploring a new world. Designers of legacy board games must think about all possible player choices to keep the story from falling apart. To do this, they use testers to see how the games will play out. Jaime Barriga was a tester for SeaFall. He said, “It takes a lot of time. The first few games might be great, but then after a few more games, it can start to break. Then you have to go back and fix everything.”

Legacy board games were not expected to become very popular. When Daviau was developing the idea, he thought it would appeal to only a small group of people. He said, “I thought it was different and pretty good, but it’s weird and breaks many rules. I thought I would be known as the guy who did this strange project.” However, many players, like Russell Chapman, loved the idea. He believes it is one of the biggest improvements in game design in years. He said, “It’s a new level of commitment, intensity, and excitement. There’s nothing more thrilling for a board gamer than learning a new game, and you get that constantly with legacy games.”

Another fan, Ben Hogg, said that the excitement of a developing story was more important than worries about the game lasting a long time. He mentioned that people don’t usually watch the same movie twice in the cinema. “You’re buying into an experience,” he said. “It adds a storytelling aspect like in video games.” The legacy format is inspired not only by video games but also by the popularity of TV series that tell stories in episodes. While in college, Daviau wanted to be a television writer but later moved into advertising and game design. Still, he loved telling stories.

Matt Leacock, the creator of Pandemic, compared the legacy design process to writing a novel. He said, “You need to know how you want it to end and have a good idea of where to start, but it’s not enough to just have a general plan.” Daviau feels proud of his work but is curious to see how others will use the idea. He also thinks that gamers will soon want something new. Colby Dauch, the studio manager for the publisher of SeaFall, is not so sure. He believes the legacy format has changed how people think about board games."
16,"One night not long ago, an octopus named Inky escaped from his tank at New Zealand’s National Aquarium. He crawled across the floor and squeezed into a small drain that led to the Pacific Ocean. This story was exciting and was shared widely online. Many people enjoy stories of animals escaping, like those of rats and llamas, because they like to think of animals as being similar to humans. Octopuses are especially interesting because they are very intelligent and look very different from us. They can open jars, recognize faces, use coconut shells for protection, and even play in complex ways.

Some people think that comparing animals to humans is not scientific. However, Dr. Frans de Waal, who studies primates like gorillas and chimpanzees, believes that it is actually unscientific to ignore the human-like qualities of animals. He calls this idea ""anthropodenial."" After studying many years of research on animal intelligence, he shows that animals can do many things that we thought only humans could do, like remembering the past and future, showing empathy, and understanding what others want. This means that animals are smarter than we often believe.

Dr. de Waal thinks that anthropodenial is a recent idea. In medieval and early modern Europe, people believed that animals were smart enough to be put on trial for crimes. Even in the 1800s, many scientists looked for similarities between human and animal intelligence. Charles Darwin, who changed how we see our place in the world with his theory of evolution, said that the difference between human and animal minds is one of degree, not kind.

In the 20th century, a new way of thinking called behaviorism focused on training animals with rewards and punishments. During this time, many people saw animals as simple machines or robots, and those who thought animals had feelings were often dismissed. This change in thinking happened while humans were destroying animal habitats, polluting the environment, and treating livestock poorly.

Fortunately, Dr. de Waal believes we are starting to understand animal intelligence better. He says that we are learning to see animal thinking as similar to human thinking, even if they are not the same. He notes that there is a lot of new information about animal intelligence available online.

To test animal intelligence effectively, we need to consider each species' unique skills. For example, squirrels might not do well on human memory tests, but they can remember where they hid their nuts. In her book, The Soul of an Octopus, naturalist Sy Montgomery suggests that if an octopus were to test human intelligence, it might judge us by how well we can change the colors of our skin. If we failed, it might think we are not very smart.

Dr. de Waal is not completely convinced that Inky's escape had a happy ending. He believes that while some octopuses have escaped before, it might be too hopeful to think Inky knew how to find the drain to the ocean. However, he understands that stories like Inky's help people appreciate animal intelligence. He once conducted an experiment to see if capuchin monkeys could feel envy. When some monkeys received cucumbers (a food they liked) and others received grapes (which they liked even more), the monkeys with cucumbers became very upset when they saw their friends getting grapes. This study was published in a well-known scientific journal, but what really made people believe the results was a short video of the experiment released ten years later. This shows how our understanding of animal minds can be surprising."

Robotics, once just a part of science fiction, is now becoming a major change in technology, similar to what happened during industrialization. Robots have been used in car and factory production for many years, but experts believe we are about to see a big increase in the use of robots in many other areas. Many people think that robots will take over most jobs done by humans in the next 50 years. However, about 80% of people also believe their current jobs will still exist in the same way during that time. This shows a common belief that our jobs are safe, but they are not. Every industry will be affected by robots in the coming years.

For example, an Australian company called Fastbrick Robotics has created a robot named Hadrian X that can lay 1,000 bricks in one hour. This job would take two human workers a whole day or more. Another example is a robot called Tally, developed by a startup in San Francisco. Tally moves around supermarkets to check that products are in stock and correctly priced, rather than cleaning the aisles.

Supporters of robotic automation say that robots cannot fix or program themselves yet, which means new jobs will be created for skilled workers like technicians and programmers. However, critics warn that we should not forget the importance of human skills in the workplace. They believe society is not ready for the changes that will come from reducing human interaction.

Dr. Jing Bing Zhang, an expert in robotics, studies how robots are changing the workforce. His recent report predicts that in two years, nearly one-third of robots will be smarter and able to work safely with humans. In three years, many top companies will have a chief robotics officer, and some governments will create laws about robots. In five years, salaries in the robotics field will rise by at least 60%, but many jobs will still be unfilled because there aren’t enough skilled workers.

Zhang says that automation will affect lower-skilled workers, which is unfortunate. He believes these workers need to retrain themselves instead of waiting for the government to protect their jobs. People can no longer expect to do the same job for their entire lives.

New technologies in motion control, sensors, and artificial intelligence will lead to new types of robots for consumers, including robots that can live and interact with us in our homes. This presents a great opportunity for companies, but it also brings challenges, such as the need for new rules to keep us safe and protect our privacy.

With many jobs at risk and a global employment crisis approaching, it is important to focus on education to prepare for the future workforce that will include robots. Developed countries need more graduates in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) to stay competitive."
18,"Text: George Mallory, a famous mountaineer, is often quoted as saying he wanted to climb Mount Everest ""because it’s there."" This answer reflects a common question people have: why would anyone want to take such a dangerous risk? Some may find inspiration in his words, as they encourage people to pursue their dreams and face the unknown. However, the main point is that climbing can simply be about adventure and enjoyment.

In 1967, Bolivian writer Tejada-Flores wrote an important essay called ""Games that Climbers Play."" He described seven different types of climbing activities, from playing on small rocks to climbing high mountains, each with its own rules. He argued that the way climbers approach a climb, such as how much equipment they use, should depend on the rules of that specific activity. Over the years, this idea has become popular in climbing discussions, appearing in magazines and conversations.

Many climbers love the feeling of freedom that climbing gives them. However, climbing can also be very limiting. For example, being stuck in a tent during a storm is not what most people think of as freedom. This creates a contradiction in climbing. Yet, some argue that having fewer choices can actually simplify a climber's life, which can feel like a different kind of freedom.

When asked ""Why climb?"", US rock climber Joe Fitschen suggests a better question: ""Why do people climb?"" He believes that climbing is part of our nature; humans are built to take on challenges and test their limits, even if it involves risks. Therefore, the joy of climbing is more about our biology than logical thinking.

Another important perspective comes from US academic Brian Treanor, who says that climbing can help develop important qualities like courage, humility, and respect for nature. While he recognizes that not all climbers show these traits, he believes they are especially important in today's world, which often avoids risks. Climbing, then, can help people grow and thrive in life outside of climbing.

Additionally, some climbers believe that those who climb without help from others or technology must be fully dedicated to succeed. Experts Ebert and Robinson stirred some debate by claiming that independent climbs are harder and deserve more recognition than those done with teams or extra support, like bottled oxygen at high altitudes. This view raised concerns that it might encourage climbers to take unnecessary risks.

We can also look at climbing from a different cultural perspective. Many climbers report experiences of being fully present, or ""in the zone."" The physical effort, the focused mindset during a climb, and the intuitive problem-solving are all key aspects of climbing. Some argue that climbing techniques are similar to those in Zen philosophy, which aims to achieve a peaceful state of mind. This idea adds another layer to understanding why people are drawn to climbing."
19,"Over the past sixty years, pianist Alfred Brendel became a leading figure in classical music. He was known for being serious and intellectual, focusing on important European piano works. Although he wrote and performed a lot, he did not teach many students. Those who knew him saw a fun side to his personality, but this was rarely shown during his concerts. His life was a strict routine of studying, traveling, and performing.

About four or five years ago, a young boy named Kit Armstrong came to one of Brendel’s concerts and asked for lessons. At first, Brendel did not take this request seriously. He had very few students and did not see a reason to start teaching now. He quoted another famous pianist, saying, “You don’t hire a mountain guide to teach a child how to walk.” However, he was impressed by Kit, who was around 14 years old. Brendel listened to him play and said, “He played very well and from memory. Then he gave me a CD of a recital he had done, and it was so beautiful that I thought, ‘I have to make time for him.’ It’s rare to find a musician with such a good understanding of music.”

As Brendel steps back from the public eye, Kit is starting to make a name for himself. Brendel is careful, worried that Kit might burn out too quickly. Now 19, Kit is always busy, learning new languages, studying math, writing computer code, or playing tennis, all while his mother keeps an eye on him. He also composes music. Brendel says, “This is very important. Learning to read music is easier when you try to write your own. I noticed that Kit has an amazing memory and can read music very well. He listens to his own playing and understands what I explain to him. When I tell him something to do in one part of a piece, he can apply it everywhere else in that piece.”

Brendel is careful not to raise expectations. He gets upset when newspapers call Kit the next great pianist of the 21st century, saying, “That’s the worst thing. It can cause a lot of harm. Gifted young players can play some things very well, but they still need time and experience. It would be harmful if a critic expects perfection.”

Now at 80 years old, Brendel shows a softer side in his retirement. He explains, “When I was young, I didn’t want to be famous quickly, but I wanted to achieve certain things by the age of 50. When I turned 50, I felt I had done most of those things, but I still wanted to do more, so I continued. Even though I don’t have the physical strength now, my mind is always busy with pieces I’ve never played. I don’t perform anymore, but I enjoy this new phase of my career.”"
20,"When I was a child, I thought gardens were beautiful places. My grandad’s garden was by a river and sloped gently down to the water. Although you couldn’t reach the river, you could hear the water and the birds singing in the trees. I believed all gardens were like this – peaceful and a place to escape. 

Grandad’s garden was simple. He didn’t have a fancy greenhouse like some neighbors. Their greenhouses were made from old window frames, with plastic covering broken glass. At home, my father was often quiet. He had a sense of humor and enjoyed silly things. He liked to say, “It’s immaterial to me,” instead of just saying, “I don’t mind.” Deep down, he might have felt disappointed with his life. He left school without qualifications and became a plumber, which he didn’t love. He wasn’t very ambitious, although he and my mother once thought about moving to Canada, but it never happened. 

My father was good at fixing things around the house. He could build bookshelves or cupboards very well. My parents only moved house once during their marriage. However, my mother loved changing the furniture. Just when you got used to one chair, another would appear. The biggest change was when a piano came into the house. I wanted to like it, but it made me nervous. I only liked the two brass candlesticks on it, but my mother thought they were too fancy, and they disappeared while I was at school. I was never allowed to play the piano; my sister took lessons instead. When I asked my mother why I didn’t get lessons, she simply said, “You’d never have practiced.”

Of the three places to explore – moors, woods, or the river – I always chose the river. I could let my imagination run wild there. With a fishing net over my shoulder and old sandals on my feet, I would walk along the riverbank looking for a good spot. I would take off my sandals and leave them with my picnic while I carefully looked for fish to catch. After some failed attempts to keep the fish alive in the backyard, I returned them to the water.

I wanted to leave school as soon as possible, but it seemed unlikely until one day my father said, “There’s a job for an apprentice gardener in the Parks Department. I thought you might be interested.” In that moment, he surprised me. He might have preferred if I became a carpenter, but I like to think he believed that I could succeed as a gardener. Even though he didn’t like gardening himself, I believe he saw my enthusiasm for plants and flowers and hoped for the best for me."
21,"Lawrence MacEwen is crouching down on his Scottish island, the Isle of Muck, and I am doing the same. A strong wind from the Atlantic threatens to blow us off the steep cliff at our feet and into the ocean below. MacEwen’s sheepdog, Tie, comes close, and his owner gently strokes him. Despite the howling wind, MacEwen feels comfortable on his island, where he belongs. 

He shows me around his neighborhood. Pointing to the north, he shouts, “That island is Eigg. The one to the west is the Isle of Rum, which gets twice as much rain as we do.” I see dark clouds pouring rain on Rum’s tall mountains. “Just beyond Rum is the island of Soay.” 

Suddenly, MacEwen says, “I have sheep to move,” as rain starts to come our way. We walk down the slopes, and he shares some facts about the island: Volcanic Muck is three kilometers long and one and a half kilometers wide; its geese eat a lot of grass; and the MacEwen family has lived here for 3,000 years. 

While herding the sheep, Tie, the sheepdog, is not doing a good job. “Away to me, Tie. Away to me,” MacEwen calls, meaning the dog should go to the right. Instead, Tie runs straight through the flock, causing confusion. “Tie,” MacEwen says, sounding disappointed. The dog looks ashamed. 

The Isle of Muck is mostly run by the MacEwen family. Lawrence and his wife, Jenny, run the farm; their son Colin manages the island cottages; and their daughter Mary runs the island hotel, Port Mor, with her husband, Toby. Mary and Toby enjoy that their two boys can explore the island and sail small boats during the summer. “They go out the door and come back only when they’re hungry.” 

However, life on the island has its challenges. For example, electricity is only available part of the time. On my first evening, I wait for the lights to come on. The next morning, I find Mary preparing breakfast by flashlight. I also have to deal with no mobile phone service. “You can get reception on the hill,” Mary tells me. “Most people last a couple of days, then just put their phone away.” So, I do the same. 

Everything on Muck feels surprising. A boat arrives today with groceries and three musicians who come off carrying instruments. Their concert in the island’s tearoom is a big success, with the islanders tapping their feet to the music. 

That night, sitting by a warm fire while it rains outside, Lawrence tells me how he met his wife, Jenny. “Her father saw a small farm on the Isle of Soay in a newspaper and bought it without even visiting. He had never been to Scotland. Jenny was sent to manage it.” Did Jenny know how to run a farm? “She had good typing skills.” 

I go to bed listening to the rain and wake up to more rain. But I eat well, as almost all my food comes from the island. Mary sends me to fisherman Sandy Mathers for fresh fish. I carry it back through the village and deliver it to Mary at the kitchen door. By 7 pm, our fish is on the table, and it is delicious. 

The next morning, I worry about my ferry ride to the next island. Many ferries had been canceled in the past two months because of rough seas. If my ferry doesn’t come, I would be stuck on Muck for two more days, which, secretly, I would not mind at all."

The game design industry used to be mostly made up of computer scientists and self-taught individuals. It did not offer many ways for people to enter the field. Many people unfairly saw video games as just a hobby for young fans, but now the industry is taken seriously. This change may surprise some, but experts in the field are not surprised. 

Getting into the video game industry is not easy. Creating video games based on new movies requires many team members and months of hard work and skill. Like many industries, it can be difficult to enter, but it is growing. Jim Donelly, a spokesperson for an online games magazine, says, “It is very hard to make progress in big companies or to influence major games. However, the industry needs game designers now more than ever. They need not only top-level directors but also lower-level designers who create systems and individual parts of the game.”

So, how can you enter this competitive field? Many companies prefer candidates with a degree in computer science, but Jim has a different opinion. He says, “The only way to get in is to make games. The tools are available. You won’t get a job if you haven’t created something, and you won’t succeed on your own if you are not making things. Game design is more than just a job; it is a way of life. Like any creative work, it must be done to be real.”

Another expert, John Field, agrees but adds that it is more complicated. “While just doing it is important, many people want to work in games, but few meet the industry’s requirements. Even fewer have the creativity, technical skills, vision, and business sense needed to succeed in this changing field.” 

Can you succeed on your own? John says, “Maybe, but it is difficult. A good postgraduate course in games can help and provide support and guidance for a year or two. Most game designers start as programmers or artists and work their way up. They are interested in all types of entertainment and have a strong interest in the arts and modern culture. They may have worked for a few years after graduation but have realized that games are their passion. They are not just fans; they are excited about the future of games and understand the growing variety in the industry. 

Connections can also help. This is often ignored, but to succeed in games, as in many fields, you need to network. The old stereotype of a young boy playing video games has changed. Now, video games attract a wider audience, including families who play on interactive consoles. Smartphones also offer many new games through apps and social media. John believes there is a lot of room for growth. “Games have become popular for larger audiences. They are also a great way to learn, and I see this area as full of new possibilities and opportunities.”"
23,"Since I was a child, I have always wanted to play football. My dad encouraged me to play, but he never forced me, and I appreciate that. I had a friend whose dad was very strict about football. He would always say, ""You can't do this, you can't do that."" Because of this, my friend lost interest in playing and has not played football since. I am glad that I did not have the same experience, but I know it could have been different.

When I score an amazing goal from far away, people often say it is just luck, but it is not. I have practiced taking long shots since I was young. You can only score great goals by practicing. The best players in the world have natural talent, but they also practice for many years. Sometimes, I see young players colliding with each other, but I was taught the right techniques. When I teach kids, I always tell them to enjoy learning new skills.

At school, I played many sports, from rounders and baseball to athletics and basketball. I know now that a good education is important, but back then, football was all I thought about. The teachers were doing a good job, but I didn’t realize it at the time. I want my son to have a different experience. We are already trying to read him books, even though he is too young to sit still for long. I hope that his habit of kicking the books around does not mean he will be like me in that way.

At the start of my professional football career, the manager made sacrifices so that younger players like us could join the first team, but he never made a big deal about it. He didn’t say, ""This is your big chance,"" but we all knew we had to prove ourselves. I scored in the first game of the season, but we lost. A well-known TV presenter said, ""You can’t win anything with kids,"" which made us realize how much we needed to improve. We had some doubts, but we believed in ourselves as a team.

I depend a lot on my close friends and family. However, having a lot of money can sometimes create problems. For example, people often ask me why I let my mother keep working. I have helped my parents financially by paying off their house loan and buying them a car last Christmas. My family is strong, and they would not like the idea of being supported by me. My mom does not earn much as a hairdresser, but she loves her job. I enjoy using my money to help those around me.

I have more money than people think, but it does not solve all my problems. After I stop playing football, I plan to take a year off or even longer to do things I have not been able to do. I want to go skiing the day after I stop playing. I cannot do that now because if I were to break a leg while skiing and could not play football again, I would not be insured."
24,"It was because of Sam Carter that we lived at Reef Point. Sam was my father’s agent in Los Angeles. He offered to find us a cheap place to live because my father was having a hard time writing there. They did not get along at all, and my father couldn’t write anything sellable while we were in Los Angeles. Sam was worried about losing clients and money.

During the summer, the beach was empty because the sun was often covered by sea fog. Reef Point was not a popular spot for day visitors. The road to it was not very inviting, and a nicer resort called La Carmella was nearby. Most people chose to stay there instead. Only those who were broke or really loved surfing would come to Reef Point. But now, with the hot weather, the beach was full of people and activities.

My father was busy every day trying to finish a script by a deadline, and he was very stressed. While he worked, I often went to the beach with a book and my dog, Rusty. When we first moved to Reef Point, we didn’t have a dog, but Rusty started hanging around. I tried to chase him away, but he kept coming back. One morning, I felt sorry for him and gave him some water. My father threw a boot at him, but he didn’t really mean it. Rusty knew this and got closer.

I asked my father, “Who do you think he belongs to? He acts like he belongs to us.” My father replied, “You’re wrong, Jane. He thinks we belong to him.” Rusty loved the beach and liked to dig things up and bring them to me. Sometimes he found things that didn’t belong to him, like a new sneaker or a bright beach towel, and I had to return them to their owners. He also loved to swim and always wanted to join me, even though I could swim much faster than he could. Luckily, he never got discouraged.

That day, after swimming, my father had finished his script and drove to Los Angeles to deliver it. Rusty and I spent the afternoon together in and out of the sea. As the sun began to set, it got cooler, and we sat watching the surfers. They had been surfing all day and didn’t seem to get tired. They would choose a wave and balance perfectly as they rode it to the shore. One surfer caught my attention. She was so skilled that the others looked clumsy compared to her. When she decided to finish for the day, she rode in on a final wave.

“Hi,” she said, “why didn’t you join us?” 
“I don’t have a surfboard.” 
“You could get one.” 
“I don’t have any money.” 
“You’re British, right? Are you visiting?” 
“No, I live here.” 
“Is your father American?” 
“No. He came here to write a film script based on a novel he wrote.” 
“Really? Have I heard of him? What’s his name?” 
“Rufus Marsh.” 
“You mean, *Tall as the Morning*?” I nodded. 
“I read that book from start to finish.” 

She looked at me with new interest, and I realized that people were friendly but only showed real interest when I mentioned *Tall as the Morning*."
25,"Violet Hetherington stood in a long line at the dock in Southampton, feeling confused. She remembered her friend Annie's advice: ""It's best to get to the docks late. If you arrive too early, you’ll just be waiting around."" Annie, who was married to a diplomat and traveled a lot, usually gave good advice. But this time, it was wrong. 

After a while, an announcement came over the loudspeakers: there was a problem with the computer system. The mood among the waiting passengers became tense. Some tried to stay patient, while others joked to lighten the mood, but most people were unhappy. They had paid a lot of money for this cruise, and it was supposed to be a special experience. The delays made Violet feel like she had made a mistake by coming on this trip.

As she searched her bag for her phone, she realized it was missing. This was more frustrating than the long wait. Without her phone, she couldn’t call the taxi company to see if she had left it in the cab. All her important numbers were saved on that phone, which was something her older son, Harry, always warned her about.

In the queue behind her, a friendly couple stood. Violet asked them, ""I’m sorry, but I think I left my mobile phone behind. Could I borrow yours to make a quick call?"" She called Harry and left a message asking him to ask their neighbor, Kristina, to check if her phone was at home. If it wasn’t, she would be in trouble because she had no other way to find important numbers in New York. Part of her felt relieved, but she didn’t tell Harry that. He often thought he was wiser than her, while her younger son, Daniel, was more understanding of her mistakes.

Finally, the line started to move, and Violet handed over her travel documents at the window. But when she entered the ship, her heart sank. The foyer looked like a cheap hotel, with shiny fake wood, fancy chandeliers, and carpets that reminded her of airports. She followed the signs to the elevators, which were crowded with tired passengers. As the lift moved up, it stopped at each floor, letting people out until Violet finally reached the twelfth floor. 

When she stepped out, she was relieved to find that her room had the balcony she had requested. She had worried about what to say if it didn’t. Ignoring Annie’s advice to wait for a better deal, she had decided to pay the highest price she could afford to ensure she had a nice view of the sea."
26,"When John Maloof bought a box of old photo negatives at an estate auction, he had no idea he was about to discover the mystery of Vivian Maier. Maloof was looking for pictures to include in a book about the Portage Park neighborhood in Chicago, USA. Instead, he found 30,000 images taken by Maier, a street photographer known for her amazing ability to capture interesting moments. Since then, Maloof has built a collection of Maier’s life and work. In his home attic, he keeps her cameras, 2,000 rolls of film, 3,000 prints, and 100,000 negatives, along with many 8mm movies and audiotapes.

One morning, Maloof looked around at all this and realized he was on the edge of something special, all by chance. “When I bought this, I had no idea what it was,” he said. “I’m a third-generation flea market seller and could have easily sold it all to someone else.” For a while now, Maloof and his friend Anthony Rydzon have been piecing together details of Maier’s life. They reached out to local families who had hired her as a nanny and spoke with people from the shop where she developed her film.

Maier was born in 1926 in New York and spent much of her childhood in France. In 1951, she returned to New York and moved to Chicago in 1956 to work as a nanny. Maier was a private person who often dressed in large coats, wide-brimmed hats, and sturdy shoes. “On her day off, she would have her camera around her neck and we wouldn’t see her again until late at night,” said Maren Baylaender, whose husband employed Maier to care for his daughter. “She was private but had strong opinions about movies and politics.” 

Maier knew a lot about theater and films. Although she was not very social, she would walk the streets with her camera and talk to people, some of whom she interviewed on audiotape. She seemed to be very dedicated to her “second job” of documenting the world around her. “She was a true artist who followed her dreams,” said Rydzon. “Nothing stopped her.”

Maier’s work is a pure form of art; she did not create it for money. Her photos often focus on women, children, the elderly, the poor, and abstract subjects. “What is fascinating about Vivian is that she has so many interesting pictures,” said photography expert Larry Silverman. He sees influences from other photographers in her work and wonders if she developed her own style or borrowed ideas from others. 

Maloof often thinks about whether he will ever go through all the negatives, which he keeps in three tall, fireproof cabinets. Interestingly, he had no real interest in photography until he found Maier’s work. Inspired by her architectural photos, Maloof started taking his own pictures. “As I improved as a photographer and revisited her work, I realized that the cityscapes were not what mattered to her. It’s the people, the street scenes, and the overall composition,” he said. “There was so much more to her work than I thought, and I realized I was holding something more important than I ever imagined. Now our goal is to share her name and get Vivian Maier into the history books.”"
27,"When a novel is called ambitious, it often means it has not completely succeeded. However, this is not the case with Eleanor Catton’s book, The Luminaries. I interviewed her in the UK when her book was very successful, and she was at the center of a lot of attention. Despite being in her twenties, she seemed calm. She had just arrived from Germany and was flying back to New Zealand the next day. 

She shared a story about being stopped at passport control and asked to prove she was a writer. She pressed her novel against the glass. The official looked at it and asked, “What’s it about?” This is not an easy question for an author. 

The Luminaries takes place in New Zealand during the 1860s, where a series of crimes have happened, and a group of 12 men has come together to solve them. The story becomes very complex. Catton said she wanted to write a murder mystery, not a historical novel, but she found that the past allowed for more complications and misunderstandings for her characters. The book is over 800 pages long because she wanted to give each of the 20 main characters a fair chance to shine.

When I asked her how it feels to be so successful at a young age, she responded in a thoughtful way. “It’s nice coming from a small country because everyone feels like they share in the success. There’s a family-like feeling at home, and I received a lot of support from other people’s grandmas.” She also mentioned that it bothers her when people think her book is not serious or philosophical.

Catton explained that she wanted to write the book in the shape of a spiral, where each part is half the length of the one before it. This means the story speeds up as it goes along. I asked if it matters whether readers notice these patterns. She said she wanted to create a book with interesting structures that readers could discover if they wanted to.

Despite its unique structure, The Luminaries is still an exciting murder mystery with a captivating plot. Surprisingly, Catton said she did not plan the story in advance. “I would write myself into a corner and then see how creative I could be to get out of that situation.” One of her goals was to make the book enjoyable for readers.

We also talked about her love for television dramas, which often have cliff-hangers, different viewpoints, and dialogue. I asked if she would be interested in writing for TV. “That could be pretty cool,” she replied. She spoke with excitement and laughter about her work and New Zealand. 

“I notice that when I come to Britain, my imagination changes just by being in a different place. I understand why writers leave New Zealand for more populated areas to be around more people.” For now, New Zealand will remain her home, and I hope it continues to inspire her for many more novels."
28,"As a boy, Jonny Kinkead spent his time either making things in his dad’s garage or playing the guitar. For the last forty years, he has been building steel-string acoustic guitars by hand. He says, “I’m still amazed by the guitar. How can two pieces of wood create such beautiful sounds? Different types of wood make different sounds, and it still surprises me.”

Jonny learned to play his brother’s guitar when he was eleven. At sixteen, he wanted to learn the bass guitar. Instead of getting a job to save money for one, he decided to make it himself. He studied how different shapes and types of wood affect sound and how to put them together. The bass guitar was the first instrument he built from scratch, but he and his brothers had been making model boats and planes for a long time. Their father taught them how to use tools like saws and chisels. Jonny had also been customizing and repairing instruments for his friends.

Although Jonny’s bass guitar turned out well, he didn’t think about a career in guitar-making at that time. He was also interested in painting and sculpture. After finishing school, he chose to study architecture at university because it involved design. However, halfway through the course, he dropped out. He felt too different for that path. But he left with a clearer idea of what he wanted to do. He realized that building guitars is a form of sculpture that creates sound, and it seemed more practical than pure art because people actually use the things he makes.

Since then, Jonny has made guitars for a living. For the first ten years, he also cleaned windows part-time to earn extra money. His first guitars were sold for just the cost of materials, but as he became known as one of the best guitar-makers, he could charge more. Even now, almost forty years later, he says he is “still scratching a living.” He can only make about ten guitars a year, which limits his income.

In the early years, Jonny focused on getting known. He attended music festivals most weekends, letting musicians try his guitars and encouraging them to talk about him. He also had to learn how to price his instruments, which was difficult for him.

Jonny believes it is easier for new guitar-makers in the UK today. When he started, many people thought only American-made acoustic guitars were good. UK-made guitars were not seen as valuable, even though there have always been good instrument-making courses in the UK. Now, however, the quality of handmade guitars from the UK is recognized.

Jonny thinks new instrument-makers should take courses to learn valuable techniques. However, he also believes that learning through trial and error is important. He advises looking at other instruments to see what works and what doesn’t. “If you make the back too thin or too thick, it won’t sound good. If you learn from someone else, you might only learn one way, but if you teach yourself, like I did, you learn everything.”"
29,"Any discussion about English conversation usually starts with the weather. Following this tradition, I will mention the famous saying by the 18th-century writer Dr. Johnson: ""When two Englishmen meet, their first talk is of the weather."" This saying is still true today, just as it was over two hundred years ago. However, many people who write about this topic either stop here or try to explain why the English are so interested in the weather, but they often fail. They make a mistake by thinking that when English people talk about the weather, they are genuinely interested in it. 

For example, the American writer Bill Bryson points out that English weather is not very interesting. He says that in England, we do not have exciting weather events like tornadoes or big storms, which are common in other places. This makes it hard to understand why the English are so focused on the weather. On the other hand, the English broadcaster Jeremy Paxman disagrees with Bryson. He believes that English weather is interesting because it is unpredictable. He says that while we may not have tropical storms, living near the ocean means we can never be completely sure about the weather.

From my research, I believe that both Bryson and Paxman are missing the main point. Our conversations about the weather are not really about the weather itself. Instead, talking about the weather is a way for English people to connect with each other. For example, phrases like ""Nice day, isn’t it?"" or ""Ooh, isn’t it cold?"" are not really questions about the weather; they are simple greetings or ways to start a conversation. 

This type of weather talk is similar to how monkeys and apes groom each other to bond socially. There are specific situations where weather talk is used. Some people think that the English talk about the weather all the time, but that is not true. There are three main situations for weather talk: as a greeting, as a way to start a conversation, or as a topic to fill awkward silences. 

Because of this, it may seem like English people talk about the weather a lot. A conversation might start with a weather greeting, then move to more weather talk to break the ice, and return to weather talk when there is a pause. This is why people from other countries, and even some English writers, think that the English are obsessed with the weather."
30,"Alice Leader was standing in front of Hadrian’s Wall in Britain, trying to explain to her class of 12- and 13-year-olds how amazing it was that the Romans built something 120 km long and 5 meters high about 1900 years ago. The students were interested in this trip, choosing it over more popular tours to Spain, Greece, or France. However, they wanted to know why the wall was built, and Alice felt her answers were not good enough. 

When she could not find a suitable historical novel to help her students understand life at the Wall during Roman times, she decided to write one herself. After teaching for 31 years, Alice started her new career as an author in 2001. She felt that moving from teaching to writing was a big change. “Teaching is like acting; it’s a performance every day and very demanding. Writing is exciting and a bit scary, but it’s not as tiring. My former colleagues envy me because I still connect with children through my stories,” she said.

Alice wants her novels to fill a gap in children’s fiction today. “Many young adult books focus on negative experiences. They are well written, but often dark, or they are total fantasy, like Harry Potter. My books are different.” Alice always tried to teach English and History together, using lessons about ancient Greece alongside the novel Tale of Troy. She loves seeing the moment when a child goes from being bored to interested and then from not understanding to understanding. “I enjoy having bored children because it challenges me to make them engaged,” she explained.

Alice was inspired to write her first novel because she saw a need for it, but she also felt the change coming as her two sons were leaving home. Her head teacher suggested she take a creative writing course, which surprised her. “I had been teaching for 25 years, and she thought it would be good for me. But I didn’t want to spend my summer on a course I didn’t think I needed.” Before she could join the course, she had to send in her best piece of writing, which she only learned about a few days before the deadline. “I sat down and quickly created a story about a Roman couple and their baby. Three hours and 30 pages later, I sent it in and was accepted right away.”

During the course, other students reviewed her work and encouraged her to publish it. With only 8,000 report cards as proof of her writing skills, she asked her head teacher for a year off to write her first novel. Alice’s husband, Zachary Leader, is a critic and editor, and his help was very important in editing her book. Alice said, “My mother-in-law thinks we are rival authors, but I believe we work well together. He helps with the structure of my writing, while I tend to add more scenes. That’s the difference between a fiction writer and an editor.”"
31,"To raise money for charity, a newspaper and a TV company challenged brothers Jonny and Alistair Brownlee, who are champion triathletes, to take part in a special race. This race would have Jonny in a car and Alistair on a mountain bike, racing against each other in the beautiful but cold Yorkshire Dales in northern England. 

“I’m looking forward to it,” Jonny said at the start line. “I’ve never done anything like this before; it’s exciting! The views are beautiful, and it’s very cold, so I’ll be warm in the car.” Alistair, dressed in warm cycling clothes, was also excited. “Honestly,” he said, “I’ve seen Jonny drive before, so I’m not sure he will make it. I might stop for a cup of tea halfway!”

The race began at Semerwater lake in Wensleydale and would finish at Fleet Moss, Yorkshire’s highest road, which is about 350 meters up. This would be easy for the car, but Alistair had to climb a steep hill right from the start. After a quick handshake, they were off. Alistair quickly rode away on his bike, while Jonny got into his car and started driving. The big question was: who would reach the finish line first?

Jonny’s confidence quickly faded. Just 15 seconds into his drive, he faced a giant tractor blocking the road. “Welcome to Yorkshire,” he complained to the cameraman in his car. After getting past the tractor, Jonny continued driving, while Alistair struggled with the steep hill. He had to get off his bike and carry it up the hill, passing walls and fences. Sheep watched curiously as he kept moving forward.

Finally, Alistair reached the top of the hill. With the sun shining and open land ahead, he started to pick up speed. Meanwhile, Jonny faced another challenge. The narrow roads in the villages of Yorkshire were not made for fast driving. He had to slow down to get around a tight corner and then drove through a stream on the road. Once he was clear of the last village, he raced straight towards the finish line.

Neither brother knew how close the other was. As Jonny sped down the final stretch to Fleet Moss, Alistair was racing across his last field and back onto the road. He pushed hard, and then suddenly had to brake as he reached the finish line. Looking up, he asked the crowd, “Is he here?” When they said no, he raised his arms in celebration, shouting, “Yes!”

A few minutes later, Jonny arrived in his car and stepped out. “Well done,” he said, feeling disappointed. “I’m gutted.”"
32,"The silence is what you notice when you play on Centre Court at Wimbledon. You bounce the ball quietly on the soft grass, toss it up to serve, and hit it, hearing only the echo of your own shots. The well-kept grass, the rich history, the old stadium, the players in white, and the respectful crowds all create a calm atmosphere that helps you focus. The quiet of Centre Court is good for my game. What I find most challenging in a tennis match is to block out everything except the game and the point I am playing. When a point ends, the silence is broken by loud applause, cheers, and people shouting my name. I hear them, but it feels distant. I don’t think about the fifteen thousand people watching me closely or the millions watching around the world as I play Roger Federer in the 2008 Wimbledon final – the biggest match of my life.

I had always dreamed of playing at Wimbledon. My uncle Toni, who has been my coach since I was young, taught me that this is the most important tournament. By the time I was 14, I was sharing my dream with friends that I would play there one day and win. Before 2008, I had played and lost to Federer twice – in the final the year before and the year before that. The loss in 2006 was not too hard. I was just happy to have made it that far after turning twenty. Federer won easily, but my defeat in 2007 was much harder. I knew I could have played better; it was not my skills that failed me, but my mindset. I cried for half an hour in the dressing room after that loss. Losing always hurts, but it hurts more when you have a chance and lose it.

Toni, who is usually very tough on me, surprised me by saying there was no reason to cry and that there would be more chances at Wimbledon. I told him he didn’t understand; I felt this might be my last chance to win. I know how short a professional athlete's career is, and I want to make the most of it. Every moment is important, but some moments are more important than others, and I had let a big one slip away in 2007. There was nothing Toni could do to make me feel better. But he turned out to be right. Another chance came in 2008, just one year later. I was confident I had learned from my defeat; this time, my mindset would be strong. 

The night before the final, at dinner with family, friends, and my team, we didn’t talk about the match. I didn’t tell them not to, but they understood that I was already focused on the game in my mind. From that moment until the match started, that focus was mine alone."
33,"In early April 1957, a young and idealistic Englishwoman named Jane Goodall arrived in Africa. In her first letter home, she wrote, “I am living in the Africa I have always longed for.” Jane would spend most of her life in Africa, working as a citizen, journalist, scientist, activist, and environmentalist. 

In 1963, the National Geographic Society in Britain helped make Jane Goodall famous by publishing articles and making television documentaries about her research on chimpanzees. Her fame grew even more through her own writing, including popular children’s books and the bestselling book ""In the Shadow of Man,"" published in 1971. This book has been translated into 47 languages and is still available today. Jane Goodall is one of the most celebrated female scientists of the 20th century, second only to Marie Curie, a Nobel Prize winner. However, her fame sometimes overshadows her real achievements.

Many articles and interviews tell her life story, but they often focus on her as a young girl seeking adventure or as a privileged woman who wanted to live with wild animals. These images do not fully represent her important work. Jane Goodall should be recognized as a leading zoologist and a pioneer in her field because of her extensive research and the influence of her students in biological sciences. 

Her main achievement is that she helped us understand the social and emotional lives of chimpanzees. Before her research, people thought wild chimpanzees were very dangerous, and many misunderstandings existed about them. For example, no one knew that chimpanzees ate meat or used tools, and we did not realize that they share similar emotions with humans or have complex social systems. Jane discovered that chimpanzee communities in Africa have their own cultural traditions.

Her book, ""The Chimpanzees of Gombe,"" published in 1986, is considered the most important work in chimpanzee research. Her long-term study of wild chimpanzees in Gombe State, Nigeria, is seen as one of the great scientific achievements of the Western world. Jane Goodall changed how we study animals and how we think about ourselves as humans.

Even as a child, there were signs of the scientist she would become. One clear example happened in the autumn of 1939 when she was just five years old. One day, Jane disappeared, and her family and the police searched for her. After a long search, she returned, covered in straw. When her mother asked where she had been, Jane explained that she wanted to know how hens lay eggs. To find out, she had hidden in a henhouse for five hours until a hen laid an egg. This moment can be seen as the start of her journey as a biologist."
34,"During our first hour-long conversation, Shirley Ford talks to me using the voices of a cheeky 8-year-old boy, a tired mother, a funny elderly Scottish woman, and a very fast-talking alien. Her voices are familiar to people who watch children’s TV shows and cartoons, as well as those who have seen health and safety training videos. “I just did a voiceover about back injuries,” she says, “so I had to learn how to say many medical terms quickly.” 

Shirley explains what it takes to do voiceovers. “Many actors, even famous ones, think they can do funny voices, and many probably can,” she says. “But there is more to it. You need to bring the script to life for an audience that can’t see you. You wouldn’t believe how many well-known people want to do voiceover work. Producers invite them to auditions because of their fame, but often they don’t get the roles because they are used to acting with their whole bodies.”

After school, Shirley joined a drama course, hoping for a traditional acting career. During the course, she occasionally sang jingles for TV ads. “One day,” she says, “the man who ran the recording studio suggested I try out for the voice of a rabbit in a cartoon. It seemed silly – I didn’t study drama to play rabbits – but I tried it for fun and surprisingly got a major role.” Shirley discovered she could do voices and that voiceover work might be her path. “Things just happened for me,” she says. “In my second film, I was lucky to play the main character, her brother, and her mother.”

Adult female actors often provide the voices for young boys and girls because their voices are lighter than those of male actors. Hiring child performers involves complicated procedures and many forms, which production companies prefer to avoid. Shirley has learned to create different sounds and collects new voices by watching children’s TV. Cartoons are the best part of her job, which also includes educational videos and vacuum cleaner ads. “Those are tough because you have to sound excited about something you don’t care about, but my experience helps,” she says. “I’ve learned that the trick is to smile while you talk – it makes your voice sound bright and cheerful. When I have days doing animation work, it feels like a holiday; interacting with other actors makes a big difference.”

The competition for voiceover work is strong, and having a good showreel – a recording that shows what the artist can do – is very important. “It’s worth investing in a strong showreel,” Shirley says. “There are agencies that help voiceover artists create them.” She believes she has reached the top of her profession through hard work as much as talent. “Whether it’s making your showreel and taking it to film and TV companies, advertising agencies, and recording studios, or just practicing your voices, it’s all about setting goals and not giving up.”

For anyone thinking about a career in voiceovers, Shirley suggests attending “specialist workshops – they cover all types of voiceover.” She also thinks a love for human sound is essential, describing herself as obsessed with voices and becoming the characters she plays. “If I’ve been in the studio doing a specific American voice, for example, it can take over me, and I’ll be speaking like that for hours or even days afterwards,” she says. “My children have grown up hearing their mom talk in completely different voices.”"
35,"People often ask me how I became a cartoonist. This is understandable because cartooning is a job many children dream about, like being a race car driver. However, most people eventually give up these childhood dreams and think about more practical jobs, like being a tax lawyer or making car parts. The idea that you can make a living by drawing simple pictures, like those in high school notebooks, seems silly. Yet, some people do it.

Not everyone becomes a cartoonist in the same way, but most have wanted to do it for a long time. For me, I had a typical childhood for a cartoonist. I loved comic strips, contributed to school publications, and was known as ""the kid who draws."" I studied graphic design in college and, after graduating, I showed my illustrations to different companies. I was lucky to find someone at a newspaper who needed political cartoons about local issues. I created some ideas, and they bought them. In a few months, I was making enough money to support myself.

You don’t need much to become a cartoonist. You don’t need a university degree, a lot of money, or even to be a great artist. You just need your brain, your hand, and something to draw with. However, if it were that easy, there would be as many cartoonists as there are teachers. The barriers to becoming a cartoonist are low, but it is still a tough job. You should only try to be a cartoonist if you feel you cannot do anything else. It is much easier to get a regular job that pays the bills and gives you time for family, home repairs, and hobbies.

The more skills you have, the better chance you have of making a living with your art. I have created political cartoons, comic strips, and comic books. I have also worked as a writer, caricaturist, and designer. I take on all kinds of work because you can learn a lot, even from jobs you don’t really want to do. It helps to be smart, well-read, and curious about the world.

What about the business side of being a cartoonist? There was a time when many cartoonists could find regular jobs with different newspapers and magazines. But those days are fading. Today, cartooning is often an entrepreneurial activity, which means you not only have to create the work but also sell it. The more comfortable you are with selling, the more successful you will be. I have seen cartoonists with average creativity but excellent business skills do much better than those who are very talented but lack business sense.

It surprises me how often I meet people who have never sold a cartoon but are afraid someone will steal their ideas. Some are so worried that they won’t even let others see their work! Legally, to protect your work, you just need to draw a small ‘c’ for ‘copyright,’ put a circle around it, and write your name and the date next to it. But honestly, it is more likely that no one will be interested in your work. If someone does steal a cartoon and it becomes popular online, it is not a disaster – it could actually be a lucky break!"
36,"Twenty years ago, I was moving to a new house and cleaning out my things. I decided to throw away an electric guitar that my dad had given me for my 16th birthday. It was a nice, black guitar made in Japan. I usually hate getting rid of things, so I wondered why I wanted to throw this guitar away. I took it to the dump and was about to leave it there when a young man approached me, looking confused. He asked, “You’re not going to throw that away, are you?” I told him I was, and I started to feel regret. He asked if he could have it, and I said yes. We went our separate ways.

In the following days and years, I felt sad about what I had done. Then, a few months ago, I opened an email that changed everything. I remembered a story about a man who lost his wedding ring in the ocean and found it ten years later in a fish he was eating. That’s how I felt when I read an email from someone I didn’t know, a guitar dealer named Keith Rushton. He told me, “I’ve got your electric guitar.” It had been sold many times since the young man at the dump took it. Keith found a name-and-address label on the back of the guitar. He realized it was probably old, but he used my name to find me online. He contacted me through the newspaper I work for and offered to sell it back to me. I was so emotional; I almost cried. I would have given him anything, but his price was very fair.

I had forgotten that my dad always put name-and-address stickers on my things, including my guitar. My parents wanted me to learn classical guitar because it was popular in the 1970s. I loved how it sounded: calming and gentle. Unlike the violin, it didn’t sound bad when a beginner played it. But I struggled to improve, so I switched to the electric guitar and played easier songs. This was also the time of punk music, when people who couldn’t play well could still be rock stars.

When I took my old guitar out of the box that Keith sent me, I suddenly remembered my birthday in 1978 when my happy parents gave it to me. Holding it again felt smooth and smaller than I remembered. I sat down to play, but then I wanted to stand up and put a strap over my shoulder because electric guitars are played that way. My fingers remembered where to go. I couldn’t draw the chords, but my hands just knew what to do. My middle-aged fingers felt the familiar pain of pressing down the strings to play a chord. 

The electric guitar is not really meant for solo playing. Now that I’m learning it again, I think I should form a band. My son is learning the saxophone; maybe we can play together. Or maybe I can find other people my age who have had a similar experience. We could call ourselves “The Regainers!”"
37,"Text: 

There has been a lot of discussion about sleep recently. When I wrote my book, Insomniac, about people who cannot sleep, I felt like I was one of the few warning about the dangers of not getting enough sleep. Lack of sleep affects our minds, bodies, and moods. Anyone who has trouble sleeping knows how important sleep is for our mental, physical, and social health. It is good that sleep is finally getting the attention it deserves. However, I wonder about dreams. I haven’t heard much about them in these discussions. We are losing our dreams all the time. When you wake up early because of an alarm, you miss the last hour or two of sleep, which is mostly REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep. This is the stage of sleep where we have the most vivid and emotional dreams. A good sleeper spends about a quarter of their sleep time in REM. So, if someone lives to be 90 years old, they will spend about six or seven years in REM sleep. When researchers prevent people from having REM sleep, they find that the next night, people have more REM sleep to make up for it. This shows that dreams are important.

When researchers discovered REM sleep in 1953, many agreed with psychologist Sigmund Freud, who believed that understanding dreams was the best way to understand our minds. However, later research did not support this idea. The focus of dream studies changed to look at the physical reasons for dreams instead of the psychological ones. Currently, there is not much agreement among dream researchers, according to Harvard sleep scientist Robert Stickgold. 

Dreams are significant. At a meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Society, P.F. Pagel from the University of Colorado Medical School shared a study showing that actors, writers, and directors remember and use their dreams better than others. He concluded that the use of dreams increases with a person’s interest in creativity. It makes sense that filmmakers have a strong connection to their dreams because films are very dream-like. However, I wondered if only creative people benefit from their dreams. Don’t teachers, software designers, and politicians also need to think creatively?

Stickgold explains that dreams help us connect ideas in new and surprising ways, using knowledge from our past and present. Dreams may help us find new patterns and create combinations that break our usual ways of thinking. For example, Stickgold found that when people are woken from REM sleep and asked to respond to a word, their answers are more original than when they are woken from other sleep stages. They come up with unexpected ideas that make sense in a unique way. This is what creativity is, according to Stickgold. 

I find that I write better after having intense dreams. Even a difficult dream, or one I can barely remember, seems to help me think more clearly. On those days, words and images come to me quickly, and I can hardly keep up with my typing. I don’t know how it works, but it does seem to help. 

Creativity is not just for writers or artists. We live in a complex world, and we all need our brains to work well. We need to think creatively and flexibly as we interact with colleagues, family, and friends. This is why dreaming is important."
38,"Twenty years ago, Susie Ray left London to live in a small coastal town in south-west England. When you enter her studio, you see a beautiful view of the sea and many empty frames on the walls, along with happy photos of her two daughters. As a leading artist in the copyist art movement, Susie can easily recreate famous paintings from the early 20th century or the 16th century. However, she does not keep any of her own work. “As soon as I finish them, they go,” she says with a shrug. 

Susie is very popular. In her 30 years as a copyist artist, she has painted works by many great artists, including Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh. Her copies are so accurate that art experts sometimes mistake them for the originals. While the original paintings can sell for millions of pounds, her copies sell for a few hundred to £12,000, depending on how much time she spends on them. Susie does not reveal the names of most of her clients, but they include galleries and private collectors. Some collectors are true art lovers, but others care more about status. One famous buyer likes to show off his “Van Gogh” painting, which is actually a copy by Susie. “Many famous people pass off my copies as originals,” she says. “That’s up to them.” Some collectors keep the original painting in a bank safe and display Susie’s copy instead.

Susie is honest about her work. When she copies an old masterpiece, she tries to make it look as real as possible because she believes it is important to respect the original artist. However, she always signs her name on the back of the canvas. Selling a copy as the real thing is illegal, and even though she knows people who have done this, she has never been tempted. Those who make fakes often get into trouble. Susie admits she is not rich and has faced challenges, but her situation is better now, and she does not want to risk her reputation.

Before becoming a copyist, Susie worked as an illustrator for a botanical garden after earning her art degree. She earned very little money at that job, but it helped her develop her skills and love for plants. She had to be very precise and get everything right the first time. Although she has no regrets about that time, she is happy to have found a more financially rewarding career.

When younger artists ask Susie for advice, she tells them to learn to draw accurately. She emphasizes how much she has studied to reach her level of skill. Her training allows her to create everything from plant drawings to perfect copies of 15th-century paintings and modern abstract art, but she now focuses on French impressionists, especially Manet, Cezanne, and Degas. 

Susie believes many people think modern art is easy, but she explains that impressionists painted quickly and freely while also being very careful. This combination is harder to achieve than it seems. Given her talent, it is surprising that Susie does not create her own original art. Isn’t art about self-expression? Could a Susie Ray original be worth more than her copies? She explains that her work comes from years of training, and she makes a good living from it. She has tried creating her own art, like oil paintings of fishing nets, but they looked too much like photographs. 

In a way, it’s like living on simple food after enjoying meals from a top chef. Susie is a perfectionist, and that drives her work."
39,"During her racing days, Ellen MacArthur cared most about the sea and being the fastest on it. Since she was a child, sailing had been her great passion. She felt a strong connection with the boats that took her around the world; they worked together as one. When she returned to land, everyday life felt unimportant. People would ask her about the race, and she quickly wanted to be back on the ocean, challenging nature, even in places that had almost defeated her.

After finishing second in the Vendée Globe, a solo round-the-world race, she showed me the small, stuffy cabin of her boat, Kingfisher. This was her home, workplace, and survival space for 94 days. She explained how carefully she planned everything, even counting the exact number of kitchen paper rolls she would need. Preparation was crucial for her. She proudly displayed her unappetizing stock of freeze-dried food, a small gas stove, and neatly organized medical supplies. Her ability to keep the boat clean was as impressive as her sailing skills. The boat was her world, and she took care of it because her life depended on it.

Now, Ellen sees the world as a boat: a small, beautiful, and fragile thing with limited resources. Her perspective changed during a trip to South Georgia, a remote island in the South Atlantic, where she helped with a bird survey on albatrosses. This experience made her reflect and see things differently. The many abandoned whaling stations served as a warning to her. She felt that humans often take what they want and move on without thinking.

When I arrived at Ellen’s office, she was finishing a heated conference call. She explained why we need to act now to save the planet. “We are not making coal, oil, or gas anymore. They are precious resources that we have only once. We need to find ways to use them wisely.” At first, her message was negative—use less—but she later realized there was a more positive way to think about it. Now, she focuses on reusing materials, like reusable industrial carpet tiles.

For the past three years, she has been visiting factories, mines, and power stations, talking to governments and businesses about our dependence on non-renewable resources. “I will never be an expert,” she says. “But I am like a sponge, soaking up information. I couldn’t ignore the current situation. Compared to this, sailing felt selfish. This is about finding how my voice can be most helpful. It really matters.”

She also started the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a charity that helps young people rethink and design a sustainable future through business and education. “I do miss the adventure of being at sea,” she admits. “It’s part of who I am. You feel connected to everything around you. You don’t have time to feel lonely. You focus on records, practical matters, and survival. My new message is not as simple as saying, ‘I want to be the fastest around the world.’ I may have been the fastest, but this work is more important than anything I’ve ever done.”"
40,"Jordan Romero is 13 years old and wants to be the youngest person to climb Mount Everest. If he succeeds, he could become very famous. He hopes to inspire other kids to go outside and explore, instead of just playing on computers and video games. Jordan's climbing team includes his father, Paul, and mother, Karen. They call themselves ""Team Romero."" Climbing Everest is just one part of their goal. If Jordan climbs Everest and Vinson Massif in Antarctica, he will be the youngest person to climb the Seven Summits, which are the highest mountains on each continent. Very few people achieve this before they turn thirty. Jordan has already climbed five of them and might finish before he becomes a teenager.

I spoke to several experienced Everest climbers, and none of them thought it was a good idea to take a 13-year-old up the highest mountain in the world. They believe that while a young climber might be strong enough physically, they might not be emotionally ready. They also doubt that a young person has enough experience to make safe decisions while climbing.

The Romero family has heard these opinions before. Paul says, ""I know there is criticism, but I can’t focus on it – we have a lot to do. We think about the risks, but we believe our experience as climbers will help us. Watching Jordan grow gives me confidence. He is getting stronger and more mature.""

I also wonder about Jordan’s reasons for wanting to climb. Is his father pushing him too hard? Paul insists, ""This project isn’t about me wanting to be famous through my son. At first, Jordan thought it was something to do later in life, but we decided, ‘Why not now?’ We talk to him often to make sure he still wants to do it.""

When I ask Jordan what he enjoys about the challenge, he says, ""I just focus on reaching my goal."" In the past, not many people cared about being the youngest or fastest to climb a mountain or sail an ocean. Today, every adventure is shared online, and every climb is seen as a chance to break records. The more exciting the record, the more attention it gets. This creates a problem for Jordan. While some people think that focusing on achievements takes away from the enjoyment of climbing, if Jordan wants to inspire others, he needs to engage with the media. This means blogging, taking photos, and giving interviews. He needs to do something impressive, like climbing Everest.

Paul adds, ""If Jordan comes home tomorrow and says he wants to stop climbing and play basketball instead, we will end this project and go to the gym."""
41,"When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, it’s likely they are not listening to classical music. Most people can name many pop groups, but if you ask my friends about Brahms, they usually don’t know who he is. I just started studying music, but my classmates know as little about classical music as other teenagers do. If you don’t know who created the music, you probably don’t have any of their recordings. This is sad for fans of classical music. Last year, only 3% of concert tickets sold were for classical music events, and the average classical album sells only 300 copies. I find this hard to believe. 

So, why is interest in classical music declining? Older people often blame our love for TV and video games, but I don’t think that’s the reason. The truth is that classical music doesn’t attract most people, especially teenagers, who are the ones most likely to buy music and concert tickets. I know some teenagers who enjoy classical concerts, but they are few. Even though I play in an orchestra, I’m not a big fan of classical music. I like many styles, but my classical music collection is probably close to that 3% figure.

Why don’t teenagers like classical music? First, the pace and rhythm of classical music, with its many mood changes, can be hard for us. We prefer fast talking, fast playing, and fast thinking. Experts say we can only pay attention for about three minutes, which is too short for most classical pieces but perfect for pop songs. Pop music is simple and easy to listen to, while understanding classical music takes time and focus. Also, pop music often talks about issues that matter to teenagers, while classical music usually does not.

The way we listen to music has changed too. In the past, families would play music together at home, and playing an instrument was important. Now, you can find any music online, but classical music is rarely part of our daily lives. When was the last time you heard classical music in a store? One of my teachers says that more people are attending classical concerts now, but I doubt many of them are teenagers. In my orchestra, we play classical music in many places, but when I look at the audience, I mostly see older people. I don’t know why more middle-aged people enjoy classical concerts, but I do know that if your parents love something, you might want to avoid it.

Some people say schools are to blame for teenagers’ lack of interest in classical music, but many kids are excited to play classical music in their school orchestras. They come early to practice and stay late to rehearse. They enjoy classical music when they perform, but it’s not their favorite music otherwise. The two activities have become separate. When we want to relax, we always choose pop music."
42,"Bonnie Wyndham got out of her mother’s car and looked at Almonside School. “I’ll make you sorry I’ve come here,” she said with a smile. Her mother was getting out of the other side, so she didn’t hear Bonnie, but Bonnie didn’t mind. Her mother already knew how she felt. Mrs. Wyndham looked around. Almonside was a strange school, with buildings hidden among the trees on a hillside; it looked confusing at first. Then she saw signs: Science block, gymnasium, riding centre… “Riding centre,” Bonnie said, suddenly interested. “Headmaster’s study,” her mother replied. “This way.” Bonnie followed her mother along a wide path between the trees. “I wish you’d walk beside me instead of following me like a dog,” Mrs. Wyndham said tiredly, but she didn’t expect Bonnie to do that. A few minutes later, her mother was talking to Bonnie’s new headmaster in his study, while Bonnie waited outside the door. Suddenly, Bonnie stood up. “Why should I just sit here?” she thought. “I’ll be thrown out soon anyway, so why not get it over with?” She left the building and went to the riding centre, following the sign. 

There was a nice old building for the horses and a large indoor riding area. Bonnie looked around, but there was no one there. She approached the horses with respect. They were well cared for, and she could see that right away. Almost every stall was occupied, and she walked along, carefully looking at each horse. “I know what you’re doing here,” she said to a small pony, gently touching its nose. Then she saw the next horse and stopped. “But aren’t you the best of the lot!” she exclaimed. He was brown with a bit of white. He looked lively, which Bonnie liked. “I feel like we’ve met before,” she said, stroking his neck. “In my dreams, I was riding you to victory in a big competition…” The horse’s name was Maverick. Suddenly, she wanted to ride him. “I wonder where I can find a bridle and a saddle. It can’t be far.” 

Bonnie was happy to find that the room with the riding equipment was unlocked. While she was busy putting a saddle on Maverick, she forgot all about her mother and the headmaster. When she finally sat on the big horse outside, she felt like a queen, in charge of everything she could see. Her old school nickname had been Queen Bee, and she laughed as she remembered it. “You’re the best horse I’ve ever ridden, Maverick,” she said with admiration. “I really mean it because I know about horses, even if I don’t know much else.” She nudged him to walk, then to trot. “If I stay here, I think you and I could be great friends,” she said. She rode around the paddock, feeling the exciting rhythm and the breeze on her cheek. She could tell Maverick trusted her, and she felt sure he would jump well."
43,"I have met Cody Simpson before, and I have always been impressed by his quiet confidence. The 15-year-old Australian has already released many successful songs. So how did a relaxed surfer end up on stage in front of thousands of fans? 

“I first picked up a guitar when I was six years old and started writing songs when I was seven,” Cody says, remembering how it all began. “But I was swimming and surfing every day. Those activities were more important to me back then; I had a busy life. When I was 13 and in high school, I posted a few videos online.” 

These videos changed everything. He started by posting a video of himself and a friend singing at a school concert. Fans commented online, asking for more videos. So, Cody, who had recorded more songs at home, was happy to share them. The response was amazing. 

Cody was also a talented swimmer. He trained hard with great coaches and focused on improving his skills. But then record labels contacted him, and he had a tough choice: stay in Australia and keep swimming, or take a big risk by signing a deal and moving with his family to the US. Cody decided to take the chance. 

“It was very hard for me – especially at such a young age – to choose a career. Can you imagine being 12 or 13 years old and trying to decide what you want to do for the rest of your life?” He had to tell his swimming coach and friends that he was moving to the States. “It surprised most people. I’m kind of the quiet kid,” he says, remembering their shocked faces. “I’m very modest, and I think it’s important to stay that way in this crazy world.” 

So, Cody packed his bags and moved with his family halfway around the world, giving up one dream to try to make another one come true. Although his family stays out of the spotlight and is not directly involved in his career, they support him from behind the scenes. Cody believes it’s important to have a close group of good people around you to stay grounded. 

Of course, everyone has days of doubt. “Sometimes when I’m alone, I think, ‘How did my decision affect my little brother and sister?’ My little brother is eight years old, and he travels the world, doing school on the road; he doesn’t have a normal life,” Cody admits. “I worry about how this affects him, but my family always reassures me that they support me in everything I do.” 

Success in any career comes from being willing to say ‘yes’ to your big break, even when it’s a little scary. “It all happened so fast and unexpectedly,” Cody says. “Now, I’m going to countries I never thought I would visit and playing in front of hundreds of thousands of fans – it’s something many people dream of. But I know it won’t last forever.”"
44,"I jumped out of bed, pulled back a corner of the bedroom curtain, and looked down at the river. A new crack in the ice sparkled in the morning sun. I squinted and looked upstream at the sandbags that were there to stop the buildings from flooding as the ice melted. My back still hurt from lifting the sandbags last week. I had worked long hours with most of the adults in town to help. But my grandfather didn’t seem to notice. 

With one hand on the curtain, I looked at the stretch of dark water created by the release pipe from the wood factory in Milltown. There were fragile ice shelves on both sides, and solid ice further down the river. As I took off my pajamas and put on my kayaking wetsuit, I saw a boy on the other side of the river. I didn’t know him. He was trying to balance on an ice shelf near the warm water from the factory. I zipped up my wetsuit and grabbed my kayaking jacket. I checked the pocket for my lucky chain – a silver chain my famous grandfather brought back from South America. It means more to me than his fame, and only he, my mom, and I know about it. I also have his diary from that trip, which I keep under my pillow and read before I sleep. I touched the chain again and went to the kitchen.

“Good morning, Rex,” my mom said with a smile as I took a banana from the counter. “You’re up early for a Saturday. I’ll make brunch after your training. Be careful.” 

“Thanks, Mom.” I walked down the hallway and almost bumped into my tall grandfather as he came out of his room. 

“Can’t you watch where you’re going?” he shouted. “Where are you going?” 

“Sorry, Grandpa. I’m going kayaking.” It was obvious from my wetsuit, but he always acted like he didn’t see me in my kayak every morning. I tried to ignore his anger, but it was getting harder. 

“What’s the point of training? You didn’t win the competition,” he said. His words hit me hard, but I took a deep breath and counted to three. He walked away and slammed the bathroom door. My mom came over with a sympathetic smile. 

“Don’t mind him. He’s…” 

“...not himself right now,” I finished for her. I didn’t say that he had always been like this. But like my mom, I tried to be understanding. When I was younger, he was my hero. He showed me photos of himself in National Geographic magazine, and those old photos still hang on his wall, along with his dusty medals and trophies. But I don’t go into his room anymore. I have my own trophies to look at, and maybe one day, my own picture in National Geographic. Still, a part of me wants to stay loyal to him, even though he is grumpy.

My mom smiled. “At least he’s coming out of his room more. Have a good training session, Rex. I admire your determination to keep going, even in this cold weather!” 

I smiled back as I peeled my banana. “It’ll be warmer in South America if I find sponsors for my expedition.” She laughed and went back to the kitchen. I finished my banana and went downstairs. Stepping into the backyard, I hurried to the boathouse."
45,"Mum grabbed Jess by the arm. ""Come with me,"" she said. Jess followed her into the study. On the table, leaning against the wall, was an unframed painting. It was clearly one of Grandpa’s works, but it looked different from his usual style and was obviously not finished. ""Do you know anything about this?"" Mum asked. Jess shook her head. ""I’ve never seen it before. I didn’t know he was working on anything.""

Jess looked closely at the painting. It showed a river that took up most of the picture. It was not a river she recognized, and it might not even be real; it looked like a fantasy river. The painting was strange and beautiful in a mysterious way. The riverbank was very small, with just a hint of green that was easy to miss. The viewer's eyes were drawn to the pale water, leading to a hidden sea. There were no animals, birds, or people in the painting, and it felt right that way. It seemed like there was no place for living things in this distant scene. Still, Jess felt a connection to it, thinking about autumn coming after a long summer.

Mum spoke again. ""It has a name."" There was something in her voice that showed her excitement, even though she tried to sound casual. Jess understood why. Grandpa never named his paintings. He just painted them and let others figure them out. Mum turned the painting over and pointed to the words Grandpa had written. Jess read them aloud: ""River Boy."" The words felt important to her, but she didn’t know why.

There was another mystery. She looked at Mum. ""There is no boy."" ""Exactly. It’s strange, isn’t it? For him to be so specific. But maybe he will add the boy later since he hasn’t finished it yet. I made the mistake of asking him about it."" ""Mum! You should have known better."" ""I know, but I couldn’t help it. It’s such an unusual painting, especially with a name. You can guess what he said."" Jess didn’t need to guess. She knew Grandpa would have said, ""It’s not the artist's job to explain a painting. Each picture has its own life and language, like a poem. We either understand it or we don’t. Painting is hard work, and I can’t waste time explaining it to everyone.""

Mum laughed and interrupted her. ""Something like that. Anyway, I was hoping you might know something about this painting since you seem to inspire him."" ""Inspire?"" Jess asked. ""Yes, a muse is someone who inspires an artist."" Jess understood the word. Grandpa often used it when she watched him paint, but he usually meant that the muse was not helping him that day or that he needed to be nice to the muse because he had a tough part to work on. He never suggested that the muse was her. She always thought he meant a kind of goddess, not a real person. It was hard to imagine anyone, even a goddess, influencing someone as strong-willed as Grandpa. ""He doesn’t need me to inspire him,"" she said. ""He’s been painting all his life."""
46,"When I woke up this morning, I didn’t plan to cut a hole in my bedroom carpet. I’m not saying it was an accident, but it could have been. For example, if I had tripped over the bed with Dad’s Stanley knife in my hand, the blade might have gone into the carpet and made a big hole. That could have happened, but I’m not saying it did. I just want to say that I didn’t mean to damage the carpet. I didn’t wake up thinking, “Today I will cut a hole in my carpet.” It just seemed like a good idea at the time, as things often do. Later, I wondered why I thought that, but by then it was too late. This happens to me quite often. I’m a bit unlucky in that way.

What I was really doing was trying to find a way to fit my corner cabinet into a corner. Gran gave me the cabinet when she moved from her house to a flat. It’s very cute! It’s small, painted white, with pink and blue flowers around the edge, and it has tiny glass doors. Gran used to keep china ornaments in it, like shepherdesses and old-fashioned ladies selling balloons. Now, I keep my collection of shells, fossils, and interesting stones there. Gran knew I loved her corner cabinet, so I was very excited when she gave it to me!

The problem is, it is a corner cabinet, which means it has to fit in a corner. I only have two corners in my bedroom because it’s the smallest room in the house, shaped like a wedge of cheese. The big front bedroom is for Mum and Dad, the back one is for my sister Angela, the little one over the garage is for my brother Tom, and my room is the size of a broom cupboard. Mum says that when Angela goes to university, Tom can have her room, and I can have his. Then, when Tom goes to university, I can choose any room. But since Angela is only fifteen, I think I will be stuck in my broom cupboard for a long time. 

I don’t really mind; I like my little bedroom. It’s cozy, like a nest. I love the sloping roof and the window at floor level. The only problem is the lack of corners! My bed is in one corner, and my wardrobe is in the other. I tried to fit Gran’s cabinet into the space between the roof and the floor, but it was just a little too tall. I thought, if I can’t cut anything off Gran’s cabinet, how about cutting a hole in the carpet? It seemed like the obvious solution. Dad calls this “lateral thinking.” I thought he would be pleased with me because he always tells us to “think outside the box.” And that’s exactly what I was doing!"
47,"The novel ""The Borrowers"" tells the story of a family of tiny people who live secretly in the walls and floors of a house. They ""borrow"" things from normal-sized people to survive. When I was asked to direct a TV version of the book, I knew it would be difficult to meet people's expectations. Fans of the book have strong opinions about how it should be done. I used the original drawings from the book a lot because I wanted to avoid criticism from fans.

The author wanted the series to show the story from the Borrowers' point of view, not from the humans'. This made filming more complicated. The most important thing was to get the size right. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans, so when we filmed them walking across a room or going on a borrowing mission, we had to be ten times further away than usual. To film their surroundings, the crew had to crawl on the ground and shoot from no higher than 15 centimeters. They went through many pairs of jeans!

We only raised the cameras for aerial shots. One big challenge was to create the right shadows when combining the tiny Borrowers with the normal-sized background. We developed a special technique for this. After the series aired, famous director George Lucas called to ask how we did it.

The only permanent set we built was the Borrowers' home under the floorboards, filled with large objects to make the actors look small. It was very surreal. I remember asking them to carry giant scissors, and they really got into it. The coins we used were bigger than dinner plates and hard to lift, which made the crew laugh a lot. 

In the story, there is a scene where the Borrowers are swept down a drain. To film this, the actors had to go down a tunnel with hoses, and they found it so scary that they didn’t need to act. 

Getting the costumes right was very important to me, and it was a challenge for other directors in different versions. I had the costumes made from heavy canvas so they would look like doll clothes. This made it hard for the lead actress to move; she couldn’t sit down during breaks and had to be sewn into her dress every morning. The lead actor's trousers were made from a rug because normal fabric would have looked too smooth. Unfortunately, it was very hot during filming, and I don’t think they appreciated my attention to detail!

Most of the action away from the Borrowers' home was filmed with the actors in front of a blue screen on an empty set. It was hard for them to react to things that weren’t really there. I had to draw pictures of every scene to show how they should look, and by the end, I had done 2,000 drawings. They weren’t perfect, but they worked. 

We didn’t have enough budget for special effects studios during the day, so I worked nights for three months. We had to work quickly. Once, I filmed a whole scene before realizing there was no film in the camera! But in the end, everything came together, and I think the series successfully captured the magic of the books."
48,"Mom stops the car at the corner of my new school, Palm Grove High School. She looks around nervously, expecting to see journalists, but there are none. I wonder how long it will take for the chaos to start. It always does. The fake smiles, the people who want to be my friends, and the ones who ask for free tickets to my dad’s concerts. “Everything will be fine,” I tell her. She kisses her fingertip and touches my cheek before I get out of the car. Then she drives away, leaving me alone in this new school and situation. But this is what I wanted. I wanted to escape my old life of traveling and tutors. While the rest of the band is here for recording, we are staying for good. I insisted on coming to this school because I want to meet real kids. I want to meet kids with normal parents, like a mom who works in an office or a dad who mows lawns. That would be so cool and normal.

I walk into the school’s main office. “Hi, I need my schedule, please,” I say to the school secretary. “Name?” she asks, looking unfriendly. “Desert McGraw.” “Desirée?” she asks, leaning closer. “Desert,” I repeat. The secretary looks confused. “Oh,” she says and types “McGraw” on her keyboard. That’s good because not many people recognize my last name since my dad uses a stage name. “What grade?” she asks. “Eleventh.” “One second, it’s printing,” she replies. Then she tears the paper and hands it to me. My first class is English Literature. Great! I like English. But I will be late. English is in Room 214 on the second floor. I studied the map last night so I wouldn’t look silly trying to find my classes.

When I reach the door, I hear the teacher calling names. “Aurelio Gonzalez.” “Here.” I slip in quietly and sit at the last desk in the second row. The girl next to me smiles and looks at my normal outfit—jeans and a T-shirt. “Nice shoes,” she whispers. I look down at my expensive shoes with flowers on them. Oh no, I shouldn’t have worn these. “Thanks,” I say. The teacher pauses and says, “Desert... McGraw?” hesitantly. “Here.” The teacher smiles and introduces herself as Ms. Smigla. She talks a lot and gives us our course outlines. After explaining the books we will read this year, she lets us socialize! All teachers should understand how important this is.

“So why did you move here?” my new friend asks. I have a few options. Should I say it’s because I wanted a normal life away from cameras and reporters? Or should I tell the real reason my dad gave? “We need a change, Desert,” he said, “and this is the perfect place to record the new album. Energy, color, culture... just what our last album needed.” Essence? I think he just wants to relax on the beach. Why else would they choose South Beach Sounds, a recording studio so close to the sand? “My dad had to relocate,” I tell her. Yes, lies are easier. “What does he do?” she asks. Whatever. Everyone will find out eventually. But at least I can pretend to be normal for a while. “He’s an artist,” I say, playing with my backpack zipper. “Cool. I’m Becca, by the way.” And she doesn’t seem to care. Great!"
49,"Not only is the average American teenage girl expected to be the president of the Student Council, but she also needs to have a part-time job, volunteer, and do well in all these areas. This is what it means to be a teenager in America today. Boys and girls cannot just go to school and be average; that is no longer enough. Being mediocre is not acceptable, and not having strong ambitions is seen as laziness. 

Kristen Loose, a teenager, says, “People, often adults, forget how much pressure we have these days. We have a lot of homework, tests, after-school activities, jobs, chores, and responsibilities at home, all while trying to have a social life.” Even though these stresses are normal for teenagers today, negative stereotypes still exist, often spread by the media. These stereotypes include being lazy, disrespectful, rebellious, loud, reckless, and self-centered. While some teenagers may fit these descriptions, many believe it is unfair to label the entire generation this way. 

Kristen Loose thinks that many people assume teenagers spend most of their time watching TV or using their phones. She admits to having her cellphone nearby most of the time, but she uses it for important things, not just for fun. For teenagers, their phones are tools that help them manage their lives. Today, students are expected to have quick access to information and to be reachable at all times, which can make it seem like they are addicted to their phones. With smartphones, tablets, and social media, students can do their homework anywhere. Instead of just listening to music on the way to school, they might be listening to language lessons. This means that schoolwork and other activities now require attention all day and night, adding to the stress for already busy teens.

Many teenagers start their days around 6 a.m. or 7 a.m. and often finish their activities after midnight. Their days are filled with school, after-school activities, family responsibilities, and homework. Then, they have to wake up and do it all again the next day, often getting less than the recommended nine hours of sleep. A survey by the US National Sleep Foundation found that only about 20 percent of American teenagers get the recommended amount of sleep. Additionally, 28 percent of teens said they fall asleep in school about once a week because they are too tired.

Teenager Lindamarie Olsen believes that after all her activities, she has about 18 hours of free time each week. With 168 hours in a week, 18 hours is not much. Olsen rarely spends her free time on social media or watching TV. Instead, she puts a lot of her energy into volunteering. She says, “People think teenagers only care about themselves and their own interests.” However, Olsen enjoys volunteering and looks forward to making a positive impact in her school and community.

In 20 years, the stereotype of teenagers may change, but they will continue to challenge these ideas and make a difference in the world. There will always be new generations of students who are making their mark before they even finish school."
50,"The teenage members of the Earth to Sky Calculus Club live in Bishop, a mountain town in the US, surrounded by wilderness east of the Sierra Nevada mountains. In recent years, this group has launched over fifty balloons to the edge of space, about 35 km above the Earth. This project combines science and adventure, which is likely why teenagers want to join. I visited them one weekend in late spring as they prepared to release a high-altitude balloon to record shooting stars. Shooting stars happen when a rock or piece of metal from space enters the Earth's atmosphere and creates a bright trail of light.

As it got dark, the teenagers attached a soft insulated $5 lunch box to the bottom of the balloon. Inside the box were a camera, an instrument to measure altitude, and a thermometer to check temperature changes as the balloon rose. Two GPS trackers were placed on the outside of the lunch box to help them find it later. They used a gas tank, donated by a supporter from another state, to inflate the balloon, which grew to the size of a small car. An older boy made a seven-hour trip to get the gas tank, but he didn’t mind. For the kids in this club, that’s just part of the experience.

Finally, it was time for lift-off. They counted down, “Five, four, three, two, one,” and the balloon started to rise. Some of the teenagers ran after it, shining powerful flashlights to track its path in the dark sky. There was a quiet moment filled with wonder as the balloon disappeared into the night. After the launch, most students went home, but a few stayed to watch the shooting stars. They lay on blankets on the mountainside, looking at a sky so clear that it was hard to believe they were only four hours from Los Angeles, a busy city with around 4 million people. I saw a boy climb into a sleeping bag and quickly fall asleep. One girl whispered, “We’re the only ones talking.” Another girl replied, “I know.” Suddenly, a meteor shot across the sky.

As the balloon rose, the air pressure decreased, causing it to expand until it was almost the size of a house. Then it popped with a loud bang. A parachute helped the lunch box land safely back on Earth. The students would find it the next day using the GPS trackers. Retrieving it was not easy, but that was part of the fun. There is little inhabited land around Bishop, so the lunch box usually lands in remote areas. The group’s leader said, “Recoveries are a big part of the program.” They had only lost two lunch boxes in 53 launches. He added, “Part of the journey is getting to know this landscape in a way you normally wouldn’t.”

On this occasion, the lunch box landed 84 km west of Bishop. To reach it, the recovery team had to drive south of the Sierra and then back up the western side of the mountains. They had to decide whether to drive or walk, as it could be dangerous if the lunch box was on a high peak or in a tall tree. The leader mentioned, “These students are from the Eastern Sierra. What seems wild to some is just a way of life for others.” In the end, it took them 11 hours to find the lunch box. It was in a canyon, on a flat rock, near a waterfall. Unfortunately, the camera did not capture any shooting stars. While this was disappointing, it gave them a chance to discuss atmospheric waves and how they might behave above mountains. It also became another adventure story to share with anyone who asked."
51,"Chloe Morgan admits that she was not very interested in science, especially Palaeontology, until she was fifteen. This change happened by chance. Her younger brother was fascinated by dinosaurs, a phase many children go through, but she had not experienced it herself. She thought it was silly at first. However, when she helped him with a science project and read an article about new discoveries in Palaeontology, she was amazed and realized she wanted to pursue this field.

I asked Chloe what support she received, as Palaeontology was not a common career choice for young people back then. She remembers meeting her first professional palaeontologist, Matt Cornelius, who was already well-known despite being young. At first, she was very nervous, even though he was known to be friendly. She worried he would think she was just an annoying kid asking too many questions. However, she felt more comfortable when he showed patience and listened to her.

I brought up how palaeontologists are shown in movies and TV shows. Chloe frowned for a moment. She acknowledged that films like Jurassic Park, which feature dinosaurs created with special effects, have increased public interest in dinosaurs, but not necessarily in Palaeontology itself. She finds it frustrating that palaeontologists are often portrayed as either strange geniuses or socially awkward people. These films do not accurately show what their daily work is like.

Chloe explained that her job is very varied. She spends a lot of time digging up dinosaur bones, but she also works long hours in laboratories, analyzing fossils and writing scientific papers. Although it is not always part of her job, she believes it is important to communicate scientific findings to the public, especially young people. She wants to help them understand science better. Talking about dinosaurs can inspire children to learn more about the natural world and other areas of science.

The recent TV documentary Walking with Dinosaurs gave Chloe a chance to influence how dinosaurs are shown on screen. She noted that the creators of the program knew what they were doing, and she was there to offer advice if needed. She found it easy to help because there were not many mistakes to correct, mostly ensuring that the dinosaurs shown lived during the same time period. The program attracted viewers of all ages because it presented dinosaurs in a way that was very different from movies like Jurassic Park. The dinosaurs in this documentary were the most realistic ever shown.

I asked Chloe why she thinks dinosaurs continue to fascinate us and why research on them is ongoing. She believes that dinosaurs appeal to our natural curiosity and desire to explore. They capture our imagination and remind us that there is still much to discover in the world. Palaeontology, in her view, is a form of time travel."
52,"When you travel by car with your family, even if you are six years old, you probably know that you are not “there yet,” even if you keep asking, “Are we there yet?” The truth is, when you arrive, it’s not “there” anymore; it’s “here.” So if you think you might be “there,” you should really be asking, “Are we here yet?” 

I’m sure no one wants to hear that question more than parents who have to answer it over and over on long car trips. Think about it: wouldn’t you rather relax in the back seat, with no responsibilities? You could watch DVDs, listen to music, or do puzzles while enjoying the beautiful views outside the window. Meanwhile, your mom or dad is in the front seat, giving out juice boxes and cookies, changing the radio station, and making sure everything goes smoothly.

But then, something can happen that changes everything. In my case, it’s usually my younger brother, Tim. He might put his foot on my side of the seat. I can’t let that happen, so I put my foot on his side. Soon, he’s leaning over into my space, and a fight starts. Our parents have to reach back to separate us while driving, telling Tim to stay in his own seat. This calms things down for a bit, and we can enjoy the beautiful scenery again.

Later, when I’m trying to read, I suddenly feel a draft on my arm. The window isn’t open, so where is it coming from? Tim is next to me, breathing on me without touching me. He’s not breaking any rules, but it makes me angry. The situation gets tense again, and our parents have to step in once more.

Over the years, Dad has come up with ways to handle us in the back seat. When we ask, “Are we there yet?” he often replies, “Yes, we’re here. Get out of the car.” But when we point out that we are still on the highway, he says, “Oh, then maybe we’re not there yet.” This usually keeps us quiet for a while.

You can tell when you finally arrive because the adults quickly get out of the car and move away from the kids who have bothered them for hours. So remember: if your parents are still close enough to answer your question, the answer is no, you are not there yet."
53,"John and Zuzi Morgan have opened a café in Oxford, UK, where people can enjoy coffee, cake, and play board games. The owners hope that customers will love the experience and want to come back. Zuzi explains their reason for starting this business: “There is so much technology today. Everyone is busy with their mobile phones and gadgets. We wanted to bring people together in a way that doesn’t involve staring at screens. It’s natural for people to be together and communicate.”

The games played in their café are called ‘Eurogames’. These games often have gentle themes, like farming and building landscapes. The first Eurogame was The Settlers of Catan, created by German designer Klaus Teuber. In this game, players build settlements on an island and trade resources with each other, keeping everyone engaged until the end, so no one feels left out. This idea was improved in ‘co-operative’ games, where all players either win or lose together, encouraging more social interaction. One popular co-operative game is Pandemic, created by North American designer Matt Leacock. In Pandemic, players work together to solve global problems. Leacock was inspired by a Eurogame called Lord of the Rings, which is based on the famous book. He remembers, “When I played that with friends, we felt scared and excited. In the end, everyone felt good, whether they won or lost. I wanted to create something like that.”

Leacock’s love for board games started when he was a child. He says, “Games were my favorite birthday gift, but I would get very excited, open the box, and then feel disappointed when we played.” With help from his uncle, who also loved games, young Leacock would change the games they played to make them better. Pandemic became very successful, and its follow-up version improved game design even more. Leacock explains, “It has a lot of storytelling. It’s like a video game where you develop characters, get new rules, and the story changes as you play.”

Interestingly, the growth of the video game industry has helped the success of modern board games. Many people now play games on their smartphones, making them more open to playing board games. Ben Hogg, who works for a leading games company, says, “Everyone is a mobile gamer now. Most people with smartphones have at least one game they enjoy.” 

For a while, video games allowed some social interaction, like playing together at arcades or on the couch. However, as multiplayer video games moved online, players became more distant from each other. This led some people to seek ways to play games with others in person again. As seen in John and Zuzi's busy café, tabletop gaming has become more than just entertainment. In our increasingly online world, games are now something to be shared directly and physically, and this trend is likely to continue."
54,"Jamie Scott has written and produced some of the biggest hits in the UK in recent years. His story shows that endurance and persistence are very important in the music business, even if your career starts with many failures. He says his mother was an amazing singer who helped him learn to play the guitar. The only radio station he listened to at home was for middle-aged people, which influenced his music taste as he grew up. He was 12 years old when he first heard a modern song. Around the same time, he had to choose between playing tennis, which he played at a national level, and music. He spent his lunchtimes in the school music room learning songs on the piano. He said, “I was doing well in tennis, but it was not what I wanted to do for my whole life. It was just too much hard work.”

At 17, he left school to become a performer. He formed a duo with a friend who was a good guitarist but did not share his passion for performing. Jamie remembers going to his parents and telling them he wanted to pursue music. He had been writing lyrics during economics lessons and playing the piano every day while others were outside playing. His father gave him 18 months to succeed in music; if he didn’t, he would have to find a job. After some close calls with record labels, he was signed to a music publisher at 19 because of one song. However, the record labels wanted him to be a solo artist, so he had to part ways with his friend.

Eventually, he found success behind the scenes rather than on stage. After a tough time with a UK record label, he asked to leave and joined another label to release a new album. However, fame and fortune did not come easily. He said, “I feel like I’ve been in the wrong place at the wrong time for most of my career, but as a writer, I’ve been in the right place at the right time.” Writing for other artists is where he truly found success. He believes he is one of the main writers in the UK that labels turn to for new artists. He helps launch their careers and sometimes has to explain that aiming for chart success is not something to be ashamed of. He asks them, “Don’t you want 10 million people streaming your music next month?” He believes they should create something amazing that can also sell well.

It is refreshing to hear someone in pop music speak openly about wanting to write big hits. Jamie is not arrogant; he simply knows he wants to write number one songs and has the talent to do it. Instead of worrying about what others think, he focuses on his goals. He says, “When I go into the studio with someone, we need to aim for the best music of next year. It’s not just about what’s cool; we want to write classic modern pop songs.”"
55,"Tony Connor is a new kind of celebrity. He is very popular online, but many people, like me, may not know him because we don’t watch videos of people doing bike stunts. He is known as a ‘street trials cyclist.’ This means he jumps from difficult places, like roofs or walls, to land safely in other tricky spots. These stunts are recorded and shared online.

On the day I interview him, we meet at a BMX park on a Saturday morning. The local kids all know who he is, and some older people come to greet him, calling him ‘an absolute legend.’ After watching him perform, I agree with them. Even though I came with some doubts, I am impressed by his bravery, creativity, and willingness to take risks. Before each stunt, he explains what he plans to do, and sometimes I can’t believe he will succeed. When I compliment him after his stunts, he seems uninterested and a bit sad. Despite his online fame, Tony says he doesn’t like being a celebrity. He finds it hard to connect with fans. He understands the importance of talking to them, but he prefers to focus on doing his stunts.

This is interesting because his fame comes from social media and the small cameras that help create this content. He says, “This technology allows people like me to earn a living.” However, he sometimes feels that everyone is always recording themselves or looking at screens, and he doesn’t fully agree with that.

Tony makes a good living from his videos, which is different from the past when similar activities were just hobbies. After many years of interviewing top athletes, I have learned that two important things help a child become a great competitor: energy and the ability to handle disappointment. These qualities can be more important than talent and help someone keep going even after failures. In risky sports, it is especially important to have mental strength.

Even at the park, Tony fell a few times on what he thought were easy but new challenges. He just got back up and kept trying until he succeeded. Not everyone sees Tony as a hero. Some people think he is reckless and takes too many risks. He responds, “Those who criticize me may care, but they don’t understand. They probably have never tried riding a trials bike and don’t know much about the sport. They don’t realize I get advice from experts to reduce risks.”

Tony is careful about the risks he takes. He explains, “People are different. Some never feel scared, and they shouldn’t be doing these sports. It’s important to know the dangers. Others can’t overcome their fear, while some of us can. I feel fear but find a way to move past it. I’m not addicted to risk; I spend a lot of time planning and preparing. Sometimes, I ride around for a while to get ready before trying a new stunt. I know I must stay calm before I jump. If I fully commit, I’ll be fine.”"
56,"Television presenter Helen Skelton has taken on many dangerous challenges for charity. These include running a marathon in the desert and traveling down the Amazon river in a small boat. For her latest challenge, Helen walked on a high wire, which is a long thin piece of metal, 66 meters above the ground, between two towers of an empty power station. There was no safety net; she only had a belt around her waist that was attached to another wire above her. To help her balance and avoid falling, she carried a long stick that weighed eight kilograms. 

Helen trained with an expert high-wire walker. Even though she had some circus skills, she found that high-wire walking was very different. “The training was a shock,” Helen said. “I didn’t realize how strong I needed to be. Every day started at 8 am with a run up a steep hill, followed by an hour of exercises, and then another hour practicing on the wire. I also had to learn how to fall onto the wire so I could keep going if I slipped. Every time I fell, it hurt a lot. But I had to stay positive: if I got nervous and started shaking, the wire would shake too!”

On the day of the challenge, it was windy. Helen stayed calm by taking deep breaths as she moved step by step along the wire. The 150-meter walk took her 15 minutes. “That was the scariest thing I’ve done,” she said afterwards. “I’m glad it’s over!” Despite this experience, Helen is already planning her next charity project: to reach the South Pole by skiing, kiting, and biking."
57,"In 2006, Jeff Somers started a journey around the world on a penny farthing, which is an old-fashioned bicycle with one big wheel and one small wheel. He had already written a book about his travels in Canada using a 50-year-old car. Jeff loved motorsport and worked building racing car engines. To save money, he rode an old bicycle to work and also used it for a holiday in Amsterdam. He said, “That trip opened my eyes,” and decided to see the world by bike.

Jeff did not want a regular touring bike and wanted to build one himself. He thought the most interesting bike would be a penny farthing, so he visited a museum to learn how they were made. After two attempts in 2001 and 2003, when he had to stop because of a knee injury, he finally began his journey in 2006. He traveled for three years, visiting 23 countries on four continents. The best part of his trip was reaching Tibet and seeing Mount Everest. He met other cyclists who could ride up mountains, but he never regretted using his penny farthing. The further he traveled from home, the more amazed people were by his bike.

His worst experience was when he had to drink dirty water from a stream, which made him very sick. He spent ten days in a hostel without medicine. He had no money for a hospital or to get home. Despite these challenges, Jeff now says, “If I could afford it, I would start traveling again tomorrow on my penny farthing.”"
58,"I work at a university in the US with my team to learn more about water birds, especially the American black duck. We have just started using a new tool called a ‘night-vision scope’ that helps us see the ducks in the dark! We are concerned about black ducks because their numbers have decreased a lot, and we are not sure if there is enough food for them on the east coast. We have a lot of information about what they do during the day, but we know very little about their nighttime activities because we didn’t have the right equipment. This new scope will give us clear images, even on nights without a moon, so we can learn more and make better decisions to protect their habitat.

Our work is very challenging. There are four of us, and each of us works six hours a day. We have studied ducks in different places, and I have had to take a boat to some locations and write down notes about every duck I see. The weather has not been easy – some nights are warm, but most of the time it is rainy. It is so quiet that I have needed a lot of coffee to stay awake! We have only missed one workday because the snow was too deep for our special vehicles. Still, I enjoy the challenge, especially when I think about the summer, when we will spend hours in a laboratory looking at our results together. It will be hard to be inside, but it is very important to do this work. I wouldn’t change it for anything!"
59,"Whenever I tell people about my job, they can hardly believe it exists. But I’m serious! I spend my days at work eating chocolate! Tasting chocolate is very important to make sure that customers receive perfect, high-quality chocolate from my company. Every week, I get samples, which are small amounts of chocolate from our factory, and I have to check them for taste, texture, and smell. I also taste the raw materials we usually use, like nuts and fruit. I spend time choosing the best ones to include in the chocolate. 

Next to my office, I have a kitchen where I can test and taste the products I make, and I keep my colleagues happy by sharing samples! My kitchen is filled with machines and ingredients to experiment with. It’s great to have a private space to go to during the day. No two days are the same in this job. Sometimes I work in our food lab, and other times I travel to other countries to buy our raw materials. This can be challenging because I have a young family, but I love the variety and excitement of the job, even more than the chocolate itself!

People often ask me if I get bored of chocolate. I’ve worked with it for a long time, and I’ve never felt tired of eating it. In fact, I often go home and eat more chocolate in the evening!"
60,"Have you ever thought about what it’s like to perform in a circus? Sophia Grayson works at Circus Experience, a place that teaches young people circus skills. She says her course is popular because it teaches many skills, such as juggling, throwing and catching balls or even fire, and trapeze, which is about flying through the air in front of an amazed audience. 

In the year-long course, students slowly take more risks in each class, and parents can come to some classes to see how their children are doing. Sophia explains, “To have a career in the circus, performers need to avoid doing the same thing all the time. It’s important to keep performances exciting and full of action. If you want to be successful in the circus, you must keep practicing. Another great part of this job is making friends with other performers and learning from them. Being fit is also very important. Circus artists, like athletes, train every day to stay strong. Training is essential, but the best performers are those who want to succeed, have creativity, and always work on improving their skills. 

People often think that circus performers are likely to get injured or that they only work for a short time each year. However, the real challenge is planning for the future because you can only travel and perform while you are young, and then you need to think about other options.” The course also teaches business planning. Many former students have started their own businesses around the world and are happy to share their experiences. However, Sophia warns that it’s not a job for making a lot of money! “The work usually does not provide a regular salary. It’s also very competitive, but it’s a lot of fun!”"
61,"You may not know her name or face, but you have probably heard her many times. Mariam Hobson is a professional backing singer. This means she sings in the background to support the main singer. Many people think backing singers are not good enough to be lead singers, but that is not true – they often have to be even better. People like Mariam are the real stars of the music industry!

“What I love about my job is that when I enter the recording studio, I never know what I will be asked to sing,” she says. “It could be classical, jazz, hip-hop, or rock. Sometimes, it might even be a funny little song for a radio station or an advertisement. I am often surprised by what producers ask for. Once, I was asked to sing like a fish underwater! But I never complain; I just do my job!”

“Excellent musical skills are very important for my work, along with the ability to learn quickly. There is often no written music to follow. I will never forget my first time recording background music for a film. It was very complicated because there were eight of us, each singing a different part, along with an orchestra. I was scared because if I made a mistake, we would have to record everything again, which nobody likes. Recording sessions are already long enough!”

“One of my favorite jobs is recording for songwriters. Less experienced writers sometimes do not know which musical range is best for a female voice. By listening to me sing their song, they can figure out how to improve it.”"
62,"Julie Deane started with only basic knowledge of fashion, but she built a successful business selling ‘satchels,’ which are traditional bags used by schoolchildren. These satchels are now sold in famous shops and are popular with many celebrities. Before deciding to sell satchels, Julie made a list of different business ideas, like cake decorating and party planning, and thought carefully about her options instead of just going with her first idea.

When she chose to sell satchels, not everyone agreed with her. Julie recalls, “Many said there was no demand for them – but I was convinced.” She involved her family from the beginning, working with her mother, who had never had a job but had a natural talent for business. The design of the satchels was inspired by children’s storybooks.

Although Julie didn’t know much about fashion blogs, they became important for her success. At first, she sold about one satchel a week. To create interest, Julie sent satchels to fashion writers, hoping they would write about them in their blogs. They did, and interest in her satchels grew, along with the speed at which her company produced them. Now, Julie enjoys waiting to see which celebrity will be seen with a satchel!

While other companies spend money on online ads, Julie uses the internet community for ideas on new styles, keeping her products fresh and exciting. There was a difficult time when another company copied her satchel design to sell similar products. Because of this, she now makes sure she trusts her production team as much as her own staff.

Visitors often comment on the positive atmosphere in her offices – people enjoy working there. There is now a new factory, and while the buildings are important, it is the team that makes it a special place."
63,"When Vicky Harmiston was a child, her parents allowed her and her brother Jamie to choose how they spent their free time. Vicky enjoyed doing many different sports. She was a good swimmer, and her coach believed she could become a champion. However, the swimming club was far from her home, making it hard for her to balance training with her schoolwork.

As teenagers, Jamie, who loved cycling, bought a special racing bike and started competing. Vicky thought this looked exciting and decided to try cycling too. She says it was the best decision she ever made. Soon, she was cycling every day and doing very well. The track was close to her school, so it was easy for her to attend training sessions after school.

Vicky had a successful career in track cycling and won several competitions. When she was 28, she retired from competitive cycling. Vicky explained, “For years, I loved winning, but I started to feel tired of it all. When the excitement goes away, it’s not worth it anymore. Luckily, I found a new career.”

Vicky got a job with a charity called CycleZone. “We work with young people who have never enjoyed sports,” she says. “The first thing we do is teach them to ride a bike. We want them to believe in themselves and their abilities. CycleZone does a great job of bringing young people together so they feel part of a larger group.”

The charity uses celebrities to promote their work. Vicky says, “Some people are not sure if celebrity support is always good for a charity. They think celebrities might just want attention, which can distract from the charity’s real work. But if famous singers and actors can help, I believe they should.”"
64,"Singer-songwriter Ana Ronson grew up in Ireland. Even though her parents were not musicians, there was always music in their home. Her grandfather played the guitar and taught Ana and her brother how to play. The first time Ana sang in front of an audience was at school, and she was so nervous that her teacher had to take her off the stage. The teacher suggested that Ana join the school theatre club to help her gain confidence. After being in the club for a while, she happily sang with 50 other students at a concert at the end of the term.

A year later, her brother, who was in a band, asked her to write a song for them. She wrote her first song, called Falling Stars, in just three days. She enjoyed it so much that she signed up for a songwriting course with a professional songwriter. Even though she was the youngest student, she knew more about music than many of the others. However, Ana felt that the teacher did not listen to her, which made her upset. She wrote a song called Something to Say about this experience. When she posted the song online, it became very popular. She was thrilled to see comments from people who loved it and found new meanings in the lyrics.

Joss Alton, who owns a recording company called Isotope Music, flew from the other side of Ireland to ask Ana to join his company. At first, she was unsure because she did not know much about Isotope and did not want anyone telling her what to sing. However, Joss convinced her that this would not happen. Soon after, she performed at a concert in Dublin organized by Isotope. The tickets sold out quickly, and it was an amazing night.

Ana says she is less interested in writing songs about happy times; she prefers to write about difficult experiences because they give her more to express. One of her favorite songs is Decision, which is about why her brother stopped singing for a while and how unhappy it made him. While she hopes her fans will enjoy her songs, her goal is to write about personal experiences that are important to her."
65,"Last year, I went on an amazing trip. I traveled by boat on a guided group tour along the west coast of Canada. It was my brother Harry’s idea. He is a journalist, like me, and he wanted to write articles about the trip. He loves boats, but I do not share that interest. However, I had always wanted to visit this area since I saw it on TV as a child. I knew it was where our great-grandparents lived before moving to Europe. So, I kept asking Harry if I could join him until he finally agreed!

A few days before we left, there were storms in the area we were going to. Luckily, the weather forecast for our trip was good, with calm seas. I was busy at work and didn’t have much time to prepare, but Harry promised he would take care of everything, so I stopped worrying.

After we arrived in Canada, we joined the group, packed our supplies into small boats, and set off. The guide told us that very few people live along that coast now. On our first morning, the only living creatures we saw were dolphins and birds. We could see islands in the distance, but the early-morning fog made it hard to see far. I focused on the beautiful patterns our boat made in the water.

We often stopped for hours to explore the rock pools on the beaches. They were full of colorful fish, many of which I didn’t recognize. It was nice to forget about time and just enjoy the moment. We always remembered to have lunch and dinner, which we cooked together over campfires. At night, when we fell asleep on the boats, even though the beds were hard, it felt like a stress-free life!

When it was time to leave, I felt sad. How could I go back to normal life? But I knew I would miss my family and friends if I stayed. I was also excited to tell everyone at home about our adventures!"
66,"My dad was a professional basketball player in Germany, just like his father before him. When I was a kid, I went to watch many of his games. You might think that watching so many matches would make me love basketball, but it actually did the opposite. I enjoyed telling my friends how good my dad was, especially when he won, but I often took a book to read instead of watching the games.

When I started secondary school, I was still two years away from being a teenager, but I was already two meters tall. Because of my height, my sports teacher asked if I wanted to train with the basketball team. I liked the training, but I thought I needed to improve my skills before playing in a real match. However, the teacher believed in me more than I believed in myself. After some time, I agreed to play, and a few weeks later, I found myself in a game against another school. My parents watching made me more nervous, but it turned out fine!

For the next four years, I practiced every day and did really well. I even joined an adult team before moving to a special sports academy in the USA when I was fifteen. The coach there trained Olympic basketball players, and it was amazing to work with him. However, I didn’t enjoy living far from my parents at first. At home, I hadn’t spent much time with friends because of all the training, so that part wasn’t a big change for me. Eventually, I got used to my new life, and my English improved quickly too!

I became a professional player at eighteen, three years after arriving in the USA. I had been taller than most players in the professional league since I was fifteen, but I needed to gain weight to match my height. My coach knew a team that would take me while I was still in college, so I joined them and have never regretted it."
67,"Seven years ago, I was studying Tourism at college, but I needed a part-time job because my course was expensive. After thinking about different options, I decided to train as a weekend tour guide in my home city, Chicago, USA. I took visitors around the city and was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. I saw the city I had lived in my whole life from the perspective of tourists, and it felt like a new experience every time!

After I finished my studies, I chose to become a full-time tour guide. I thought it would be easy, but when I looked into it, I learned that I needed to know much more than I had learned in college to get a license as a full-time tour guide. All Chicago guides must answer many questions about the city, including its architecture, history, and public transport rules. After several challenging but interesting months, I earned my tour guide qualification and registered as an independent tour guide.

Being a tour guide is not just about knowing historical facts or keeping track of your group in crowds. There are many other important skills. You need to be entertaining and tell interesting stories. Most importantly, you must be able to handle unexpected situations, like if a place you planned to visit is closed or if the route changes. Tourists do not want to hear about problems; they just want to enjoy a well-organized tour.

I need to ensure that visitors are happy with my tours, or they might leave a negative review online. Like most tour guides, I know that these reviews are very important because good reviews attract more customers. That’s why it is essential to make tours fun and stress-free. I believe that the enthusiasm and energy I put into my job help me get very good reviews, and my tours are often recommended to other visitors coming to Chicago."
68,"My name is Ella, and I am 22 years old. Last year, I went to Thailand for two weeks with my sister Josie. Even though she is five years younger than me, we have a good relationship. We went to volunteer at an elephant sanctuary, which is a place where people take care of sick and rescued elephants. At first, I was unsure if we would get along with the other volunteers because they were all older than us. We were also nervous because it was our first time doing something like this. However, we ended up having a great time.

One of our main jobs at the sanctuary was to collect food for the elephants. Elephants eat a lot of grass and banana plants, so this took most of the day. Josie found it very hard work, but I thought it was worth it to see the elephants enjoy their meals. We also helped wash the elephants in the river with big brushes and soap. I had a lot of fun, even though I got wetter than the elephants!

The part of the day I looked forward to the most was the evening. By moonlight, we led the elephants into the forest where they spent the night. All the volunteers stayed in the same house. Josie and I shared a bedroom, which was a bit small, but we chose to do that because Josie didn’t want to be alone. It was hot and humid, especially at night, but we expected that. The meals were delicious and did not include meat, which we both don’t like.

After dinner, all the volunteers and staff spent the evenings talking and playing games. Now that we are back in the UK, Josie doesn’t often talk about Thailand. But if someone asks her if she enjoyed her time at the sanctuary, she says she loved it. However, I think she might be a little upset with herself for not enjoying it fully because she missed her friends too much. But when she thinks back, she realizes how lucky she was to go there. Maybe she will go back one day – I definitely will!"
69,"I’m Gina D’Costa, and I own a flower shop in the UK. We sell flowers not just to people for their homes or friends, but to many different customers. Hotels and offices often use flowers in their reception areas, and sometimes we provide flowers for businesses to use in their advertising photos. Once, I even decorated a castle with flowers for a wedding. It was a lot of work, but I was very proud of what we accomplished.

My day starts at 4 a.m. when I go to the market to buy fresh flowers. Most people are still asleep at that time, and my friends think I’m crazy, but I love what I do. It can be cold and dark, but I don’t let that bother me. The flower market is amazing, with flowers from all over the world. The sights and smells make it hard to choose. If I were picking flowers for myself, I would probably choose only pink ones because it’s my favorite color. But I have to remember that what I like may not be what my customers want. Not all flowers are available all year, so I can’t always find what they want.

I don’t enjoy arguing about prices with the flower sellers, but it’s part of the job. Flowers can be expensive, so I try to get the best price I can. Back at the shop, we look at customer orders and prepare vases with the flowers I bought. Then we create flower arrangements and calculate the costs. Customers are often surprised by the prices, and I sometimes have to ask them to reconsider their choices. Some people might think this is too much trouble, but I enjoy finding the best flowers for the budget someone has. That’s what you have to do when you’re selling things – I wouldn’t want any other job!"
70,"My city has a modern cinema that shows the latest films and many kids' movies on weekends. It is close to my home, but a year ago, I realized I wanted something more – the chance to talk about a film in detail with others after watching it. So, I started a film club with two friends! 

We decided not to rent a cinema for our films. Instead, we choose a different place in the city each month. For example, we rented an old factory to show a film set in Antarctica. It was very cold, which made the atmosphere perfect for the movie, and it was fantastic! Some places we use are free because the owners sell snacks during the film, allowing us to keep our prices low. We are happy to cover our costs and not make a profit.

Each time we show a film, it gets easier, especially now that we have our own reliable equipment. We can also see how many tickets we’ve sold online, so we don’t worry about empty seats anymore! There is still a lot to do, but it feels great when people of all ages tell us how much they enjoyed the experience at the end. 

Our website has been very helpful, and we are now in touch with other film clubs across the country. We have visited them to learn how they do things, but it’s always nice to return to our own club! We also started a blog because we know most people look online for film information instead of reading local newspapers. We have tried putting up posters in cafés, but nothing is as effective as people telling their friends about us. The audience loves the special activities we organize with each film – last month, we had a movie quiz that everyone enjoyed."
71,"Taking photographs was always my favorite activity as a child. When I turned 15, I wanted to take my hobby to the next level, so I decided to start a special project: I would take one photograph every day for a whole year. Many other young photographers had done this before, but I thought it was a great idea, so I began.

After a few weeks, I decided to share my photos on a website for young photographers. I wanted to create a photo diary and show my work to others. I was surprised to find that many people liked my way of seeing and photographing things. I also enjoyed taking pictures of different subjects. Then someone suggested that if my photos had a common theme, my project would be even better. I agreed and started focusing more on nature, especially birds and the sky.

Most of my photos were in black and white, which was different from what many other young photographers were doing, as they were taking color photos. Because of this, I sometimes doubted my project and almost gave up. However, I learned to trust my feelings and became more confident in my style and choices.

One day, I showed my project to my art teacher. She told me about a national photography competition for people my age, so I entered some of my photos just for fun. I will never forget the moment when the judges told me I had won first prize. I was so happy because my project meant a lot to me. It was the first time I realized that my photography might be good, and that I could work as a professional photographer. Now, I have my own photography studio, and I have never regretted my career choice."
72,"I joined the National Youth Challenge (NYC) last year because I wanted to try new activities like camping and sailing, and learn skills such as public speaking. In the NYC, you can take part in different activities that challenge you, and you are always learning something new. There are levels from beginner to advanced, and adult volunteers called ‘leaders’ run the programs. When you finish each level, you receive a certificate.

When I first joined, my leader suggested that I help organize activities at a local children’s club for two hours a week. I was unsure about this because I had joined that same club when I was eight and found it hard to make friends. I was shy, and the other children already had their own friends, so I stopped going after a few weeks. However, I decided to take on the challenge because I wanted to earn my first NYC certificate. 

Soon, I found myself wanting to spend all my free time at the children’s club. It became much more important to me than just getting the certificate. After I completed the challenge, the NYC leader allowed me to continue volunteering at the club because I had built good relationships with the children. Now, I go there for about four hours a week, and I always look forward to it.

Because of what I learned at the children’s club, I have decided that when I finish school in three years, I want to go to college to become a qualified youth worker, which means working with children. I had never thought about this career before joining the club. This has been my favorite part of the NYC, and I have improved my communication skills while helping others. I now have several NYC certificates, and one of them is for camping!"
73,"I was born in Denver, USA, and I started snowboarding when I was eight years old. My dad took me to a mountain resort about two hours from Denver. The hill looked very steep, so my dad had to convince me to try snowboarding. I was too young to ask him if I could start, but he loved snowboarding and wanted me to enjoy it too. He made it look easy, and eventually, I did well. After that first experience, I quickly fell in love with the sport and got better at it. I began competing when I was ten years old. Some people enter many competitions and get bored, but my love for competing and winning has grown as I’ve gotten older. This motivates me to work harder.

I like not having a strict plan, and sometimes this works out well. For example, I became the first female to score a perfect 100 at a local competition. I wasn’t sure I could do the jumps that earned me that score until I actually tried. That achievement made me trust my abilities more. In the summer, I focus on training and studying since there’s no snow. I train every day, but I don’t have to follow a strict diet like I do in winter. I also spend a lot of time with my friends, which helps me cope with not being able to do what I love.

I need to think about my future. Snowboarding is a big part of my life, but I know it’s important to have another plan in case I don’t become a professional snowboarder or if I get injured. I’m considering becoming a doctor if I can find time for college while staying active. I can’t imagine getting tired of snowboarding, but I know I can’t do it forever."
74,"When I was fifteen, I wanted everything my friends had, and I never thought about the future. For example, I didn’t know what I wanted to do after school. One day, my best friend got a new phone for her birthday, and I wanted one too. My parents said I could only have it if I paid for it myself, so I decided to work part-time and save money. I am very thankful to my parents for making me do that because it taught me an important lesson.

I worked every Saturday in a café, but I didn’t enjoy it much. My parents suggested I start my own small business instead. I had seen my mum making necklaces, so I asked if I could try it too. I never thought I would find it easy, as it looked complicated when I watched my mum. My friends thought it sounded boring, but I was excited about it. My mum showed me that I could create something nice at home with simple tools and materials.

I sold my first pieces of jewellery to my friends and family as soon as I finished making them. They said they loved them, but I thought they were just being nice. Even though I was happy they bought them, I still needed to know if they would be popular with other people. The only way to find out was to rent a market stall with my mum. There are many tourists where I live, and they bought a lot of my jewellery to take home to their families and friends. Soon, we started getting calls from all over the country from people wanting to buy more. They thought we were a big company with many workers, but we were just two people at a market stall!

That was when I realized my business could work, and it was time to take the next step – creating a website. Since then, I have made thousands of pounds from my business, mostly online, but we still have our stall too. It has been a lot of fun so far."
75,"When Janine Stuart was just 13 years old, she wrote a novel called Being Amelia, which became very popular. The book is partly based on Janine’s own life. In an interview, Janine explained, “Because my father’s job made us move around a lot, I learned how to make new friends easily. I know what it feels like to be the new student in a class, and that helped me write about Amelia’s experiences in a new school. Some of the funniest parts of the book are about Amelia’s home life, especially her relationship with her older brother. Since I am an only child, I had to use my imagination to describe that.”

Janine started writing her novel one summer when she was bored at home. Her mother had always wanted to be a published author, and her teachers encouraged her to write, so it felt natural for Janine to spend her time this way. The year before, she had entered a short story competition on a website for young writers and won first prize. This is why, when Janine finished Being Amelia and sent it to a publishing company, they were eager to read it. They loved the book, and a year later, it was available in bookstores.

One review of Being Amelia notes that even though the cover shows happy teenagers, the characters face real challenges, which makes them believable. The reviewer said that even though Janine is still very young and her novel is not very long, she has shown that she is a better writer than many other bestselling authors.

Janine is still getting used to being a famous writer. She said, “At first, I would hide when people recognized me in the street, but now it’s fine. I want to give advice to other young writers, but they need to find what works for them. For me, I just need to spend time with my friends, and I will soon have something interesting to write about!”"
76,"My name is Tom, and I am fifteen years old. Three years ago, my family and I moved into a castle on a small island. This happened because my father was invited to be the manager of the castle. He works for a group that takes care of historical buildings and keeps them open for visitors. He was happy to get this opportunity, but it took some time for the rest of us to agree that he should take the job. We were worried about what life on the island would be like. We knew the castle might not be as comfortable as our warm home across the water, and there was no school nearby.

However, after we moved, we quickly adjusted to life on the island. The castle is not very beautiful, but our apartment in it is comfortable. In the summer, the island is lively because many visitors come, and there are often beach parties. In winter, we mostly see the other families who live on the island, but there are not many teenagers, which I had hoped for. The adults help each other and work hard to keep the island in good shape.

The biggest change for me was taking a boat every day to my old school. I looked forward to going on stormy days when there are big waves, but the ferries do not run then! I also learned that if I miss the bus to the harbor after school, I will miss the last ferry home, which is stressful. So, when my friends come to visit, I always tell them to hurry! 

We often see amazing views, especially when the sun sets over the sea. Some days, it is so foggy that you cannot see anything, but then it can become sunny again within hours, which still surprises me even after living here for a while. Of course, we do have terrible storms, and I sometimes wonder if the castle is strong enough to stay safe. But then I remember it has been here for hundreds of years, and it is still standing!"
77,"I live in a house in the beautiful countryside of Scotland. I have always loved nature and wild animals. Six years ago, I started a new hobby: birdwatching! I went to the mountains in northern Scotland with my family, where we saw many birds in their natural homes. I spent hours watching them with my parents, who taught me how to recognize different bird species and find the best places to see them. It was amazing! After we returned home, I joined a local birdwatchers’ club for young people. My goal is to see 200 different bird species, and I am almost there. During family holidays abroad, I have seen birds from other countries too. We always look for places with group birdwatching activities so I can add new birds to my list! 

I have been to Egypt, and last summer we went to South America, where I thought I would see my 200th species. I was not too disappointed when it didn’t happen because I learned that you need to be patient with this hobby. I posted a video online about my challenge, and many teenagers liked it and said it looked like a fascinating hobby. When my teachers saw it, they asked me to give a presentation about birdwatching at school. I didn’t feel nervous until just before I walked onto the stage. I knew what to say and had some notes to help me, but the whole school and all my friends were watching! I only relaxed when it was over, and the teachers said I had prepared well and they really enjoyed it. I might even do another presentation next year!

I am lucky to live in the countryside. I understand why many teenagers in cities might not think about becoming birdwatchers, but there are many birds to see, especially in places with lots of green areas. I also think birdwatching clubs should try to get more young people interested in this hobby. Everyone needs to connect with nature, no matter their age, and it doesn’t have to cost much money."
78,"I started playing football when I was 7 years old. I would hurry home from school to play with other kids. I loved it, and after some time, I became a good player. My family knew that I often got excited about new hobbies and then lost interest, so they thought I would do the same with football. But that never happened. I even dreamed of playing football professionally when I grew up. 

The chance came sooner than I expected. I played in local tournaments, and one of the referees saw that I was a talented player. He asked the manager of a professional women’s club to watch me play. After that, she invited me to join her club. At first, I couldn’t believe it – I didn’t know that young girls could join women’s clubs. But the manager was impressed, and I started training regularly with a big club when I was just 13 years old. After that, I improved a lot.

Even so, some people were not sure I would ever be a star player, which made me a little sad. But my coach encouraged me to be myself and to believe in myself. He even let me play in one of the club’s championship matches earlier than I expected! I ran harder than ever because I didn’t want to let my teammates down. Then, by chance, I scored the winning goal. Even with a large crowd, I could hear my coach cheering for me, and after the match, my team carried me around the pitch. It was amazing! Since then, I have scored many more winning goals.

Next month, my coach and I are organizing a football tournament in my area. The goal is to get teenagers interested in football and to give them a chance to meet other players from my club. It will show them what a professional environment is like and encourage them to believe they could play for a top team if they work hard. My advice to them will be the same as my coach gave me – there will be good times, but also some bad times. I’ve had very few bad times, though, so I feel lucky!"
79,"One of the most interesting changes in education in the UK and around the world in recent years is the push for new students to get involved in research as early as possible. This change shows that research is not just for famous scholars at old universities or scientists who are discovering new things in fields like medicine. Instead, research is a natural and important way to build knowledge and skills. 

Research skills will help you not only in your studies but also in your future job. They teach you how to think about the world and how to approach your own work. As a student, you contribute to knowledge. You do not just learn and repeat what others say; you create new knowledge. Creating knowledge starts with asking questions instead of just accepting things as they are. You might wonder: Why? How? When? What does this mean? What if things were different? How does it work in this situation? What should we think about the facts, opinions, or beliefs we are given? Why is this important? These questions are at the heart of what we call research.

Research can be seen as a range of activities. On one end, there is complex and groundbreaking research done by highly trained experts, which leads to major changes and new knowledge. However, research can also start from simple questions and everyday inquiries. This type of research involves careful work, asking thoughtful questions about issues, and making practical suggestions.

Most students have always been researchers in some way. You have likely done research for school projects or answered questions at work since you started. You have asked questions that led you to investigate things, whether it was about planning a holiday, growing plants, fixing things at home, training a pet, or finding the right products online.

In college and higher education, you are expected to have a curious mind, identify problems, critically explore information, and create your own responses and knowledge. Some students may find this challenging because, in some cultures, knowledge is seen as fixed, and learning comes from listening to teachers and texts. It might feel disrespectful to question established knowledge, and you may think you should be told what is important to learn. 

However, in higher education in the UK, US, much of Europe, and Australia, questioning established knowledge and authorities is encouraged. This process of inquiry and knowledge creation can seem overwhelming. Critical thinking is especially important in research. The research done by others is valuable for students and professionals, but we need to engage with it, think critically, and test it. We should not just accept everything we read as true; instead, we should analyze it to see if it is logical and supported by evidence. We must avoid blindly trusting the facts and information we receive from others."
80,"Cities have always been important places for ideas and creativity. In the 18th century, coffee houses in London were popular spots where people discussed science and politics. In modern Paris, cafés on the Left Bank were where artists like Pablo Picasso talked about new art. However, living in a city can be challenging. The same cafés that encouraged discussions also helped spread diseases like cholera, and even Picasso eventually moved to the countryside. 

Today, cities are known for their creativity, but they can also feel overwhelming and unnatural. Scientists are now studying how city life affects our brains, and the findings are concerning. While it has been known that city life can be tiring, new research shows that living in a city can actually make us think less clearly. One major reason for this is the lack of nature in urban environments. Studies have shown that hospital patients recover faster when they can see trees from their windows. Even small views of nature can help our brains because they give us a break from the busy city life.

For the first time in history, more people live in cities than in rural areas. Instead of being in open spaces, we are surrounded by many strangers in concrete environments. This unnatural setting can have serious effects on our mental and physical health and can change how we think. For example, when walking down a busy street, our brains have to pay attention to many things: people walking, traffic, and confusing street layouts. These small tasks can drain our mental energy because cities are full of distractions that require us to constantly shift our focus. 

The brain is like a powerful computer, but paying attention uses a lot of its energy. In nature, we don’t have to work as hard to focus. This idea is called attention restoration theory, created by psychologist Stephen Kaplan. He suggested that being in nature can help restore our attention. Natural environments have things that naturally attract our focus without causing stress, unlike loud city noises. This allows our minds to relax and recharge.

Long before scientists studied this, philosophers and landscape designers warned about the negative effects of city life and sought ways to bring nature into urban areas. Parks, like Central Park in New York, provide a break from city life. A well-designed park can quickly improve brain function. While people have tried many ways to boost mental performance, such as energy drinks or office redesigns, nothing seems to work as well as simply walking in nature.

Given the many mental challenges of city living, we must ask: Why do cities keep growing? Even in our digital age, cities remain centers of creativity. Research from the Santa Fe Institute shows that the same crowded features of cities that can hurt our attention and memory—like busy streets and close contact with many people—are also linked to innovation. The concentration of social interactions in cities is a key factor in their creativity. Just as the crowded streets of 18th-century London led to new ideas, the busy environment of 21st-century Cambridge, Massachusetts, helps it thrive as a technology hub. 

However, less crowded areas may produce fewer new ideas over time. The challenge is to find ways to reduce the negative effects of city life while keeping its unique advantages. After all, there will always be times when people feel tired of nature and want to return to the city."
81,"**Where Should We Look for the Mind?**

This question might seem strange: we usually think that thinking happens inside our heads. Today, we have advanced brain imaging techniques that support this idea. However, I believe we should not limit the study of the mind to just what is inside our bodies. There is a lot of evidence, from ancient times to now, showing that objects and tools also play a role in how we think. 

From an archaeological perspective, items like stone tools, jewelry, carvings, clay tokens, and writing systems have been important in human evolution and the development of our minds. Therefore, what is outside our heads might also be part of our minds. 

It is easy to connect the mind with the brain because most of what we know about the mind comes from studying people in isolation from their surroundings. This makes sense for neuroscientists who use brain scans, but it often overlooks the fact that much of our thinking happens outside our heads. I do not want to deny the importance of the brain, but I want to emphasize that the mind is more than just the brain. 

Instead, we should explore the idea that human intelligence extends beyond our bodies into culture and the material world. This is where my new theory, called Material Engagement Theory (MET), comes in. MET looks at how objects can help us think and how they become part of our bodies. For example, when we make numbers from clay or use a stone to create a tool, these actions show how objects can extend our thinking. 

MET also examines how these interactions have changed over time and what these changes mean for our thinking. This approach helps us understand what minds are and how they are shaped by the things around us. 

Consider a blind person using a stick. Where does this person’s self begin? The connection between the blind person and the stick shows how minds and objects can be linked. The stick helps the blind person turn touch into a form of sight, and the brain treats the stick as part of the body. 

The stick reminds us that human intelligence can adapt and change by using new technologies. I see the human mind as a work in progress, always evolving. No matter what form the “stick” takes in our history—whether it’s a simple stone tool or a modern smartphone—its main purpose is to connect us to the world, helping us understand and navigate our environment.

For humans, tools are used to satisfy our curiosity. This unique ability to engage with material culture explains why we create things and how those things shape our minds. I call this metaplasticity—our minds are flexible and change as we interact with the material world. 

I want to emphasize the importance of material objects in understanding the mind. MET provides a new way to see how different forms of material culture, from ancient tools to modern devices, have influenced who we are and how we think. While the idea of technology changing our minds may sound futuristic, humans have been using such tools since the beginning of our existence."
82,"Few inventions have changed our way of understanding the world as much as photography. This is especially true in the United States, where photography quickly became part of culture at all levels – from practical and scientific uses to industrial and artistic ones, as well as a new form of entertainment that came with the camera. Historians believe that photography is one of the greatest contributions of the US to the visual arts. No other art form has had such a significant impact from the US.

This claim is strong, but it shows how photography has become central to US culture and thought. To fully appreciate its impact, we need to look at its beginnings in the mid-19th century. Why was this new art so attractive? 

First, photography was a mechanical process that matched the growing interest in technology. This was part of a national attitude that accepted change as normal. Just like steam power, railroads, and electricity made communication and travel easier, photography brought the wonders of the world into people's homes in an exciting way.

Second, the camera became the preferred tool for showing one’s identity. It allowed people to create images for public viewing in a country where personal and national identities were always being formed and reformed. Third, the camera was important for families, providing a way to keep a record of their lives, even if that record was somewhat idealized. 

Finally, the realistic nature of photographs matched the trend towards realism in US art, which focused on everyday life. Every photograph draws attention to something specific, showing what the photographer wants us to see. Because photographs are made by a machine, they are records of events, people, and things, which gives them a sense of objectivity. However, since each photograph is taken by a specific person, it also carries a personal point of view.

When we look at a photograph, we might think we understand its meaning, especially if we recognize the subject. This is why photography has often been called a ""universal language."" But the meaning of a photograph is more complicated. Few things in front of us express their own meaning, and no image is shown without some context that affects how we understand it, like a caption in a newspaper or its placement in a gallery.

To understand a photograph historically, we need to consider its purpose and role in its culture: Why did the photographer take the picture? How did people first see it? The same image can be viewed in different places and times, and its meaning can change accordingly.

For a long time, the importance of the camera to artists was not widely known, but today it is clear. In recent decades, starting with artist Andy Warhol’s use of photographs in his work, many artists have included photographs in various ways. In summary, photography has become an essential part of art, closely linked to painting and our ideas of representation before the camera was invented."
83,"In 1890, William James, an American philosopher and one of the founders of modern psychology, defined psychology as the ""science of mental life."" This definition is still useful today. We all have a mental life, which means we have some understanding of our thoughts and feelings. Although we can study mental life in animals like rats and monkeys, it is still a complex idea. James focused on human psychology, which he believed included basic elements: thoughts, feelings, the physical world, and a way to understand these things. Our knowledge about our mental life is mostly personal and comes from our own experiences, which may or may not match scientific facts.

Because of this, we often make judgments about psychological issues based on our own experiences. We act like amateur psychologists when we share our opinions on complicated topics, such as whether brainwashing works or why people behave in certain ways, like feeling insulted or unhappy. Problems can arise when two people understand things differently. Formal psychology tries to provide methods to determine which explanations are most likely correct in different situations. Psychologists help us separate subjective thoughts, which can be biased, from objective facts.

Psychology, as defined by William James, is about the mind and brain. While psychologists study the brain, they do not yet fully understand how it works in relation to our hopes, fears, and behaviors. It is often difficult to study the brain directly, so psychologists learn more by observing behavior and making educated guesses about what happens inside us. A challenge in psychology is that scientific facts should be objective, but the mind's workings are not easily observed. We can only see them indirectly through behavior.

Studying psychology is similar to solving a crossword puzzle. It requires evaluating and interpreting clues, which must come from careful observation and accurate measurement. These clues are analyzed with scientific rigor and logical reasoning. Psychology often involves complex interactions, and understanding them requires advanced techniques and theories. Like any science, psychology aims to describe, understand, predict, and learn how to influence the processes it studies. When these goals are met, psychology can help us understand our experiences and apply findings to real life.

Psychological research has been beneficial in many areas, such as improving teaching methods, designing safer machines, and helping people express their feelings better. Although psychological questions have been discussed for centuries, scientific investigation of these questions has only happened in the last 150 years. Early psychologists used introspection, or self-reflection, to find answers. They aimed to identify mental structures, which is still important today, but introspection has limitations. As Sir Francis Galton noted, it only allows us to see a small part of what the brain does automatically. William James compared trying to understand the mind through introspection to ""turning up the gas quickly enough to see how the darkness looks."" Therefore, modern psychologists prefer to base their theories on careful observations of others' behavior rather than on their own experiences."
84,"In a storehouse in a regular business park in Michigan, USA, there is a unique collection known as the Museum of Failed Products. This museum, owned by a company called GfK, displays products that were taken off the market because very few people wanted to buy them. The owner, Carol Sherry, believes that each product has its own sad story related to the designers, marketers, and salespeople involved. 

What is surprising is that this museum exists as a successful business. Many companies do not keep samples of their failed products, showing how uncomfortable they are with failure. The museum was started by Robert McMath, who originally wanted to create a library of consumer products, not just failed ones. He began collecting new items in the 1960s, not realizing that most products fail. As a result, his collection ended up being mostly unsuccessful products.

Today’s culture of optimism may contribute to the products in the museum. Many products likely went through meetings where no one recognized they would fail. Even if they did, marketers might invest more money into a failing product to try to save face. There is often little effort to understand why the products failed, and people involved may choose to forget about it.

This focus on positivity is also common in the self-help industry, where the idea of ""positive visualization"" is popular. This means that if you imagine good outcomes, they are more likely to happen. Some researchers, like neuroscientist Tali Sharot, suggest that our brains may be wired to see things more positively than they really are. Her research shows that well-balanced people often have an overly optimistic view of their ability to influence events compared to those who are depressed.

However, psychologist Gabriele Oettingen has studied how effective these positive thoughts really are. Her findings show that thinking too much about how well things could go can actually reduce people's motivation to reach their goals. For example, people who imagined having a very successful week at work ended up achieving less.

Psychologist Carol Dweck explains that our experiences with failure depend on our beliefs about ability. People with a ""fixed mindset"" believe that ability is something you are born with, while those with a ""growth mindset"" think that ability can develop through effort and challenges. Fixed mindset individuals often find failure very frightening because it shows they did not meet expectations. For instance, a talented athlete might think of themselves as a natural but fail to practice enough to succeed. On the other hand, people with a growth mindset see failure as a sign that they are pushing their limits. Dweck compares this to weight training, where muscles grow stronger by being challenged. Overall, having a growth mindset is a healthier way to approach life, regardless of whether it leads to success."
85,"Everyone knows that sports teams have an advantage when they play at home. But why is that? Many people think they understand it, but professional sports are changing quickly, and what we used to believe is now being questioned. Two main factors are challenging the idea of home advantage: science and money. Sports scientists want to find out what helps players perform their best, and they have come up with many theories about home advantage. At the same time, those who invest money in sports want to know why home advantage is still important. If players are paid well, shouldn’t they feel comfortable playing anywhere?

What does this mean for fans? For example, would it matter if Manchester United played some of their home games in the Far East to reach more fans there? It would matter to British fans who believe their team needs their support and loyalty. Fans often think that the order of events explains what happens. When a team plays well, the home fans cheer loudly, and sometimes this leads to a goal. Fans remember the times they cheered and a goal was scored, but they forget the many times they cheered and nothing happened.

However, there is one common belief among fans that science supports. Home fans not only cheer for their team but also direct a lot of their noise at the referee. In a well-known study, referees watched a match with crowd noise and another group watched it in silence. The referees who heard the crowd were less likely to call fouls against the home team. Interestingly, the crowd noise did not make them more likely to call fouls against the away team. The researchers found that referees try to avoid extra stress from making calls against the home team. They do not just do what the crowd wants; they try to avoid making the crowd angry.

Recent studies show that home advantage has decreased in all major sports, but not as much as expected. For example, in the early years of the Football League in the 1890s in England, home teams won about 70% of the points, while today they win about 60%. One reason for this change could be travel. In the past, travel was difficult, but now players travel in comfort, and if their hotel is not good enough, the club will find them a better one. Stadiums used to be very different from each other, but now many top stadiums look similar and efficient.

Despite these explanations, none fully explains the data. The mystery remains why home advantage varies by sport. Basketball has the most home advantage, followed by football, while baseball has the least. One reason could be that home advantage is more about teamwork, and baseball focuses more on individual matchups between the batter and pitcher. Team sports require players to work together, and in basketball, success depends on teamwork, which builds confidence when playing at home.

Another possibility relates to a more aggressive side of sports. Researchers found that players’ testosterone levels were normal before away games but increased by up to 67% before home games. This increase may be linked to a natural instinct to protect their home ground. In recent Rugby World Cup games, underdog teams playing at home won against stronger opponents, showing determination and a refusal to be intimidated—this is a sign of home advantage. As one referee said, “It’s the law of the jungle out there.”"
86,"Text: ""‘The more I practice, the luckier I get,’ said golfer Gary Player about fifty years ago. This saying is famous among athletes and their coaches. It is easy to understand why. First, many people argue about who really said it first, as other golfers from that time are also mentioned. Second, the meaning of the quote is not straightforward. Player did not mean 'lucky' in a real sense; he was being ironic. His true message was: ‘The more I practice, the better I get.’ But there is a limit to this idea. The question of where that limit is, or if it even exists, is part of the nature-nurture debate. This debate is about whether talent is something we are born with or something we develop through practice, especially in sports.

However, it is not really a balanced debate; it seems that practice (nurture) wins most of the time. The idea that practice is more important than natural talent comes from psychologist Anders Ericsson. He is known for the theory that anyone can become an expert in any field with 10,000 hours of practice. This theory has inspired many popular books, like Malcolm Gladwell’s Outliers, and others like Talent Is Overrated and Bounce: The Myth of Talent and the Power of Practice. These books generally agree that practice is the most important factor, suggesting that ‘10,000 hours is both necessary and enough to make anyone an expert in anything.’

But, as Epstein discusses in his interesting book, this is often not the case. He points out a major problem in much of the research on what makes people excellent: it usually looks only at successful people. He asks if there are better ways to understand why some people have certain abilities while others do not, and how to separate what is natural talent from what comes from environment, support, opportunity, and hard work.

Epstein travels around the world, from Kenya to Sweden, and from the Caribbean to the Arctic, to find answers. In Alaska, he learns that the drive and desire of sled dogs in a tough race might be influenced by their genes, suggesting a link between genetics and traits we think are voluntary. This raises the question: can commitment and determination be chosen, or are they partly genetic?

Epstein makes a distinction between 'hardware' (nature) and 'software' (nurture), and he believes that both are important for elite athletes. He does not ignore the role of training or environment. For example, he suggests that if Usain Bolt had grown up in the US, he might have become a good basketball player instead of the fastest man in history. However, he also looks at cases where genetics play a significant role that cannot be overlooked. He also discusses race and gender in sports, asking: ‘If only practice matters, why do we separate men and women in competitions?’ Sometimes, the best questions are the most obvious."""
87,"A recent international report shows that many children living in rich, developed countries feel lonely and unhappy. Jay Griffiths asks a simple question: why are today’s children so unhappy? In her new book, Kith, Griffiths explains that these children spend too much time indoors, stuck in front of screens like televisions and computers, and have lost touch with nature – the woods, mountains, rivers, and streams. She believes this is the main problem. 

A follow-up study interviewed some children to understand their feelings better. The children did not express a strong desire for new technology; many said they would be happier if they could just go outside more. Many adults over 40 often talk about how they enjoyed their childhoods, spending long summer days exploring, swimming, or building forts. They believe this was much better and healthier than the lives of today’s children. However, they often forget that they are the ones who have created a safer environment for their kids, which limits their freedom.

Griffiths’ book includes strong arguments about the fear of dangers in the outside world and how it connects to consumerism aimed at children. Parents’ fears lead them to keep their kids at home, which benefits the toy and gadget industry that sells entertainment for indoor kids. She also discusses trends like giving medication to restless children or requiring safety goggles for playground games. While I am not sure how common these rules are, Griffiths expresses her frustration clearly and passionately about childhood freedoms and restrictions.

However, Griffiths sometimes goes too far with her ideas and ignores important counter-arguments. At one point, she even compares the treatment of children today to a form of racism, which seems extreme. She tends to have a romantic view of children, believing they are naturally good and creative. While she acknowledges that children can be mischievous, she mostly presents an idealized view that may not match reality.

One of the main ideas in the book is that children should have the freedom to explore and take risks. Griffiths argues that children need to experience small accidents to learn how to handle bigger dangers later. However, she does not explain how to create these safe accidents. Also, not all children want to explore the wild as she suggests. What about the shy, quiet, or cautious children? Perhaps the real issue is that we try to make all children fit into the same mold, whether by keeping them too safe or pushing them too hard to explore."
88,"I am a research bio-psychologist with a PhD, which means I have studied a lot. I am good at solving problems in my work and life, but this skill does not come only from my education. Many problems in life cannot be solved with complicated formulas or memorized answers from school. They need judgment, wisdom, and creativity that come from real-life experiences. For children, these experiences often happen through play. 

My recent research focuses on how important play is for children's development. All mammals, including humans, play when they are young, and those who have the most to learn tend to play the most. Carnivores, like lions, play more than herbivores, like cows, because hunting is harder to learn than grazing. Primates, like monkeys, play more than other mammals because they rely more on learning than on instincts. Children, who have a lot to learn, play more than any other young primates when they are allowed to.

Play is a natural way for both adults and mammals to learn. The most important skills children need to live happy and productive lives cannot be taught in school. These skills are learned and practiced through play. They include thinking creatively, getting along with others, cooperating, and controlling their emotions. Creativity is essential for success in today’s world. We no longer need people who just follow instructions or do simple calculations. We need people who can ask new questions and solve new problems. If we can encourage creative thinkers, we will have a strong workforce.

However, we cannot teach creativity directly. School can sometimes take away creativity by focusing on fixed questions and answers instead of encouraging children to ask their own questions. More importantly, children need to learn how to get along with others, care for them, and cooperate. Children naturally want to play with each other, and through play, they learn social skills, fairness, and morality, which are important for their future.

Play is voluntary, meaning players can choose to stop at any time. If they cannot quit, it is not really play. Players understand that to keep the game fun, they must make sure everyone is happy. This ability to quit makes play a very democratic activity.

Unfortunately, school has become more stressful. There are fewer breaks, more homework, and greater pressure for high grades. Outside of school, organized sports have taken the place of spontaneous games. Supervised playdates have replaced unsupervised neighborhood play, and adults often feel they need to step in instead of letting children solve their own problems. These changes have happened slowly but have had a big impact over time. They are caused by various social factors, including parents' fears, warnings from experts about dangers, less connected neighborhoods, and the belief that children learn more from adults than from each other.

Our children do not need more school; they need more play. If we care about our children and future generations, we must change the negative trend that has developed over the past fifty years. We need to give childhood back to children. They should be allowed to play and explore freely so they can grow into strong adults ready for an unpredictable future."
89,"In many countries, more young people in their twenties are using social media to find jobs. Websites like Twitter and LinkedIn allow them to connect directly with potential employers, which is easier than the old way of standing outside an office with a sign saying ""hire me."" However, this increased access also means there is a higher chance of making mistakes.

For example, a young job seeker in the US reached out to a senior marketing executive on LinkedIn. This executive had many important contacts, and the job seeker thought she could help him. But the executive was upset by his request. She felt it was wrong to share her contacts with someone she didn’t know. Instead of just rejecting his request, she sent a harsh and sarcastic message that became very popular online. Many people were shocked by her response, and she might regret how she expressed herself. However, if this incident makes young people think more carefully about using social media for work, it could be a good thing.

Social media can be risky for job seekers who do not know how to use it properly. Many young people are making mistakes. It is ironic because social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter have been a big part of young people's social lives for years. When older generations were teenagers, social media was a way to escape from parents and teachers. It was a place to show off and be creative, often in a fantasy world. You could have long conversations online and then ignore those people in real life. You could create a different image of yourself on Facebook with the right pictures and songs.

However, using social media for professional networking is very different. Some young people do not see this difference clearly. They learned to be bold and confident online, which might lead them to think this is still a good approach. Just because many people liked your posts on Facebook does not mean you can impress employers on LinkedIn. Young people need to understand that the rules of social networking have changed, and they must meet employers' expectations to succeed in the job market.

One common complaint from employers about young job seekers on professional networking sites is that they are too casual and seem arrogant. This reinforces the idea that young people feel entitled. In reality, many young people are struggling to find jobs, which is why they are using social media. This impression of arrogance can hurt their chances, even if they have the skills and motivation to be valuable employees.

So, how should you contact someone on a professional networking site? First, clearly explain who you are and what you can offer them, like doing some research or helping in another way. This approach increases your chances of getting a helpful response. Avoid sending generic messages, and keep your tone respectful to make a good impression. Remember, social media can be a great way to make important connections, but it needs to be used carefully to avoid closing doors."
90,"Text: ""Anyone who claims they can accurately predict the future of newspapers is either lying or mistaken. The numbers show that newspapers are in trouble. Since 2000, the circulation of most UK national daily newspapers has dropped by 30 to 50 percent. The Pew Research Centre in the USA reports that only 26 percent of US citizens now get their news from newspapers, down from 45 percent in 2001. Many people confidently say that the last printed newspaper will be gone within 15 years. However, history shows that old forms of media often survive. For example, in 1835, a journalist in New York claimed that books and theatre were finished and that newspapers would become the most important source of news. Yet, theatre survived not only newspapers but also cinema and television. Radio has continued to thrive even with the rise of TV, and cinema has remained popular despite videos and DVDs. Even vinyl records have made a comeback, with online sales increasing by 745 percent since 2008. 

Newspapers were once a new form of media, but it took centuries for them to become the main source of news. This change happened because producing timely news for a large audience became possible and affordable in the mid-19th century, thanks to the steam press, railways, and the telegraph. It was also important that people began to understand that the world is always changing and that they need regular updates. In medieval times, people did not think this way; they only noticed the changing seasons and major disasters like famine or disease, which they could not predict. Life was seen as a cycle, and the most important events were those that repeated over time. 

Before the 19th century, journalism was not a full-time job that could support a living. Even then, there was no clear reason why most people needed news every day or week. In some ways, the regular publication of newspapers can be a limitation. Online news allows readers to choose when to read based on what they find urgent. Advanced search engines and algorithms help us customize the news to fit our interests. When important news happens, online news sources can provide updates every minute. Mistakes and misunderstandings can be corrected quickly, and readers can access full documents or events mentioned in the news. This is very different from the limitations of newspapers. 

However, many news providers do not seem to understand how the internet can help spread knowledge and understanding. Instead, they focus on being the first to report news, getting more reader comments, and creating excitement, which can lead to confusion. In medieval times, news was often shared in busy marketplaces or taverns, where truth mixed with rumors and misunderstandings. In some ways, we seem to be going back to that situation. Newspapers have not always been very good at explaining how the world works. They might be facing extinction. Or perhaps, as the internet adds to our feeling that we live in a chaotic world, newspapers will find that they can still help us understand and gain wisdom."""
91,"If humans truly felt at home under the moon and stars, we would walk happily in the dark, just like many animals that thrive at night. However, we are daytime creatures, with eyes that are made for sunlight. This fact is deeply rooted in our genes, even if we don’t often think about being daytime beings, just like we don’t think about being primates or mammals. This is the only way to understand what we have done to the night. We have changed the night by filling it with artificial light. This control is similar to building a dam on a river. While there are benefits to this, it also leads to problems known as light pollution, which scientists are just starting to study. 

Light pollution mainly comes from poor lighting design that allows artificial light to shine into the sky instead of focusing it down where it is needed. Bad lighting brightens the night, changing the light levels that many living things, including us, have adapted to. Wherever artificial light spreads into nature, it affects important life activities like migration, reproduction, and feeding. 

For most of human history, the term ‘light pollution’ would not have made sense. Imagine walking towards London on a moonlit night around 1800, when it was the most populated city in the world. Nearly a million people lived there, using candles, torches, and lanterns. Only a few homes had gas lights, and there were no public gas lights in the streets for another seven years. From a distance, you would have been more likely to smell London than to see its faint glow. 

We have brightened the night as if it were empty, but that is far from the truth. There are many nocturnal species among mammals. Light is a strong biological force that attracts many animals. Scientists say that songbirds and seabirds can be ‘captured’ by bright lights, circling around them until they fall. Birds that migrate at night often crash into brightly lit tall buildings, and young birds on their first journey are especially affected. Some birds, like blackbirds and nightingales, sing at strange hours because of artificial light.

It was once believed that light pollution only bothered astronomers, who need to see the night sky clearly. While most of us may not need a perfect view of the stars for our work, we still need darkness. Rejecting darkness is pointless. It is just as important for our health as light is. Changing our natural sleep and wake cycles can lead to health problems. The regular pattern of waking and sleeping is a biological response to the natural light changes on Earth. These rhythms are so important to our existence that disrupting them is like changing our center of balance.

In the end, humans are just as affected by light pollution as frogs living near a bright highway. By living in our own bright world, we have disconnected ourselves from our natural and cultural roots – the light of the stars and the natural rhythms of day and night. Light pollution makes us forget our true place in the universe and the vastness of our existence, which is best understood under a dark sky filled with the Milky Way, the edge of our galaxy, shining above us."
92,"The founder of a large international company recently said that his business will stop tracking how much paid holiday time employees take. This decision seems to be inspired by a similar policy from an internet company. The founder mentioned that he got the idea from a cheerful email from his daughter, which many newspapers have shared. However, this way of announcing the change feels like an attempt to make a serious policy seem friendlier.

But is this idea practical? The internet company has 2,000 employees and offers one service, while the multinational corporation has 50,000 employees and many different services, like finance, transport, and healthcare. The idea of ""take as much time off as you want"" might work better in a smaller company where employees know each other's work schedules. In a big company, it can be hard to know if taking time off will hurt the business or their careers.

The founder said employees can take as much leave as they want, as long as they feel sure that their work and their team are up to date. But is it really possible to be that sure? No matter how much work you finish before a holiday, there will always be more waiting when you return. This means that employees might feel guilty about taking time off, which can lead to stress and lower productivity over time. 

There can also be pressure from coworkers and office gossip about who is taking time off and for how long. In many companies, especially in the corporate world, there is a culture of working late, which could lead to a situation where employees feel they cannot take holidays, even if they have unlimited leave. If the security of having a legal right to take leave is removed, workers might feel they cannot take the time they need for fear of being seen as lazy.

This policy could create a situation where employees do not feel they can take their entitled leave, or they might still rely on their legal rights, making the new policy useless. Modern technology allows us to receive work messages anytime and anywhere, which makes it hard to separate work from personal time. The internet company started their unlimited leave policy because employees wanted to know how to balance this new way of working with the old rules about time off.

However, having no set working hours can mean that employees feel they are always working. They might worry that their hours are being watched, which can lead to stress and unhealthy work habits. Employment laws exist to protect workers. They are entitled to a minimum amount of paid leave because rest is important for their mental and physical health. The benefits of unlimited leave, like better morale and creativity, can happen without sacrificing worker well-being. Therefore, I am not sure if allowing employees to take as much holiday as they want is really the goal or the likely result of this policy."
93,"**Simplified Text:**

Journal-based peer review is the process where experts in a field check a scientific research paper before it is published. This process is seen as a way to ensure the quality of research. It is believed to help prevent the publication of poor-quality or nonsensical papers. However, reviewing a paper can delay its publication by up to a year. Is this delay worth it to ensure the trustworthiness of published research? The answer is both yes and no. 

I still believe in journal-based peer review, but I see changes happening. The increasing use of preprints, which are drafts of papers shared online without peer review, is an important part of this change. Preprints allow researchers to quickly share new findings so that others can read, discuss, and build on them. Publishing in journals has become more about gaining recognition and advancing careers, which can affect the motivations of authors and reviewers. 

Competition for publication in top journals encourages scientists to produce high-quality work, and these journals do publish excellent research. However, the rewards for publishing in these journals can lead to shortcuts, where important data is left out to make the research look better. Reviewers often focus on whether a paper is good enough for a specific journal rather than its overall quality. For top journals, this can depend more on how interesting or newsworthy the research is rather than its scientific value.

These issues are well-known, but many people are hesitant to change the current system. However, as biologist Ron Vale recently suggested in a preprint, preprints could help solve these problems without completely changing the system. Although preprint archives have existed for twenty years, they are not widely used. This slow acceptance is partly due to scientists being cautious and the belief that journals will not accept papers that have been shared as preprints. There is also a concern that publishing papers without peer review could lead to poor-quality research, but this has not happened so far.

Preprints may not be peer-reviewed, but authors know that their work will be open to feedback and discussion from a global community of reviewers. Tanya Elks, a psychology professor, shared her experience: “My paper critiqued another published paper, which is not well handled by traditional journals. In their anonymous review system, the original authors might block a critical paper, or if they are not chosen as reviewers, they might complain about misrepresentation. By posting a preprint, the original authors could respond, and we could consider their feedback. All comments are public, so readers can judge the quality of the arguments. The risk of rejection by journals is less concerning because we still have the preprint and the comments available, so our work is not wasted.”

Preprint archives allow informal scientific discussions that used to happen only between individuals. They can also be a good way to share negative results, which are often ignored by journals that focus too much on new discoveries. Additionally, being on preprint archives increases the number of times papers are read and cited, showing how effective preprints can be for sharing research. By using the internet's culture of openness and collaboration, preprints can help shift the focus back to the quality of the work itself, rather than where it is published."
94,"When I ask my literature students what a poem is, they often say things like ""a painting in words."" Their answers usually do not satisfy me or them. One day, I asked a group of students to pick an object and write two paragraphs about it. The first paragraph was a scientific description, and the second was from the object's point of view, titled ""Poem."" One student wrote: 

""Poem: I may look strange or scary, but I am a device that helps people breathe. I am only used in emergencies and for a short time. Most people will never need to use me."" 

The object was an oxygen mask, which helped the class understand how poetry works in a unique way. This exercise led to laughter and good discussions. 

When I was in school, I found poetry confusing. I thought every poem was a silly puzzle that made it hard to understand feelings. After school, most people pay less attention to poetry. Sometimes, you see a poem, and it stands out because it is not continuous prose. It challenges you to read it, but often you feel let down by its simplicity or because you don’t understand it at first. Still, you feel good for trying. 

What do we want to find in poems? We might expect deep feelings, beautiful images, thoughtful reflections, or sharp humor. The answer seems to be yes. But if we want tears, we watch movies; for information, we read articles. Novels let us escape, paintings please our eyes, and music is hard to beat with its mix of lyrics and melody. 

However, one thing that poems can offer is ambiguity, which is common in everyday life. But this still does not explain what a poem really is. If you look up ""poem"" online, it leads you to ""poetry,"" defined as a form of literary art that uses the beauty and rhythm of language. This is fine for English professors, but it misses the word's origins. ""Poem"" comes from the Greek word ""poí?ma,"" meaning ""a thing made,"" and a poet is someone who makes things. 

So, if a poem is a thing made, what kind of thing is it? Poets sometimes compare poems to wild animals—uncontrollable and unpredictable—or to machines—carefully designed and exact—depending on their views. But these comparisons often break down when examined closely. The most valuable part of trying to define a poem through comparison is the discussion it creates. Whether you see a poem as a machine or a wild animal, this process can change how you think about both. It can help us see ordinary things in a new way. 

Thinking of a poem as a mental object is not hard, especially since song lyrics often stick in our heads. The mix of words and melody has power, just like schoolyard rhymes such as ""Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt me."" But aren’t words sometimes like sticks and stones? 

Think about a poem in a newspaper or magazine, right in front of you. A poem can touch you like nothing else, even though it is just ink on paper, like the prose around it. What about the empty space around the poem—space that could have been used for a longer article or an ad? A poem is written and rewritten like any article or story, but it does not become a product for sale. Publishers send out press releases and review copies of poetry collections, but few expect them to make money. A poem is not meant to be a product; it exists for its own sake. Because of its unique place in a magazine or book, a poem can still surprise us, even if just for a moment."
95,"I bought my first metal detector soon after I got married. At that time, £70 was a lot of money, and I could have spent it on something useful for our home. However, my wife, Marion, was very impressed when I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first trip. Over the years, every brooch and coin I found made me happy because it connected me to the past. But after the gold ring, it took 40 years before I found something that impressed Marion again.

One dull February afternoon, I had a couple of hours free and a place in mind to search. It was raining, so I chose a closer spot that I knew had old farming tools. When my detector first beeped, I found a piece of a metal wheel. Then it beeped again. I tried to ignore it, but I couldn’t walk away without checking. I dug down half a meter and lay in the mud when I saw a rounded, golden ball. I had found brass curtain rails before, so I tried not to get my hopes up. But as I cleaned it off, I realized it was a thick, beautifully designed loop. I stopped and stared, remembering to breathe. I had seen something like this before—the Great Torc, which is in the British Museum. It is a famous piece from Iron Age Britain, over 2,000 years old. A torc is a beautiful necklace made of gold and silver, with gold rings at each end.

I took it to my car and kept looking at it on the passenger seat during the drive home. I rinsed it in my kitchen sink, which was probably the only cleaning it had since ancient times. “Marion!” I shouted, “I have something for you.” As I admired my find, I heard my wife come into the room and stop. “What is it?” she asked after a moment. I told her it was a very old and rare piece of jewelry. We didn’t try it on because we were afraid of damaging it. At bedtime, I hid it in our wardrobe. We had never been robbed, but I felt anxious. Eventually, I got up, unscrewed a floorboard in my office, and hid it underneath.

The law says that such finds must be reported to the authorities within 14 days. I wanted to enjoy the torc as much as I could before giving it up. I even took it in a plastic bag to show a friend in the hospital. Finally, I brought it to the council office in the same bag. The registrar was talking to someone when I placed the torc on his desk. He turned around, stopped talking, and stared. The torc was confirmed as authentic and later sold to my local council. It is now in the British Museum in London. The £350,000 from the sale was shared between the owner of the field and me. 

But the torc means more to me than just money. I feel like I have saved it for the nation. People often say to me, “Now that you’ve found something so amazing, will you stop detecting?” But I still find brooches and coins interesting. Besides, if a fisherman catches a big fish, he doesn’t stop fishing—there’s always a chance of catching a bigger one tomorrow."
96,"Sleeping is one of my favorite things about traveling, but I don’t talk about it much because I feel a bit guilty. When my friends share their carefully planned trips, filled with activities like visiting museums and hiking, I just smile and don’t say much. What would they think if they knew that my travel plans often include long naps during afternoon rainstorms and lazy mornings in comfortable beds? Better sleep is one of the nice benefits of traveling. 

When I visited Mexico's Yucatán coast in my early 20s, I was surprised by how many hours—more than 12—I spent sleeping each day. There were many loud birds nearby, but it didn’t bother me. Away from home and my own bed, surrounded by new smells and sounds, I could sleep deeply and enjoyably. Without alarm clocks and responsibilities, sleep comes more easily. 

I believe that sleep is not just a break from traveling; it is part of the travel experience. When we travel, we open ourselves to new sights, sounds, smells, and ways of living. All these new experiences fill us up, and when we sleep, we process them. This is why sleep feels so much more intense when we are traveling. 

Sleep also changes from place to place. People often worry about jet lag, but I think the challenges I face after long trips are more about adjusting to local cultures than just time differences. For example, on the Caribbean island of Trinidad, people wake up early to avoid the heat, slow down around 10 a.m. when the sun is strong, and then become active again in the cool evening. Even though Trinidad is only one hour ahead of New York, it takes me days to get used to the island's different sleep patterns. When I finally adjust, I feel like I have truly arrived.

I remember one afternoon in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic, when I had a big lunch with new friends in an apartment overlooking the beautiful Caribbean Sea. After eating, we all felt sleepy, and one by one, my friends left the table to lie down on hammocks and sofas. I realized why my hosts had so many pillows on the floor. I took some for myself and joined them. I had heard about the Latin American tradition of the siesta, but that day I really experienced it. I shared not just sleep, but a piece of Dominican life.

Travel sleep has another great quality: I remember it. Being away from my usual routine, I enjoy the new smells, textures, and sounds that fill my mind while I sleep. If the idea of ‘slow travel’—enjoying every moment instead of rushing—is what makes a modern traveler aware, then what is slower than sleep? Maybe I should stop feeling embarrassed about my love for sleep and tell my ambitious friends that travel sleep is an important part of the journey too."
97,"The woman turned away from the mirror. “What do you think? Be honest.” Mia picked up a medium-sized hat with a soft layer of gauze and a silk bow. “I still think this one looks best on you,” she said politely. The woman wrinkled her nose and made a face that made her look like a bulldog. “But it’s so boring,” she said. “Every other woman will wear a hat like that at my daughter’s wedding. This beautiful little hat will make me stand out.” She sighed and touched the red and black mini top hat on her head. “Yes,” she said firmly, “this is the one I want.” 

Mia knew she couldn’t change the woman’s mind. With a smile, she agreed that the woman would stand out at the wedding. Mia then thought about her own daughter, Jen. Today was Jen’s thirtieth birthday, and they were having a family gathering. It had been a while since everyone was together, and Mia was excited to see Jen, Dan, and Luke. She was also looking forward to meeting Jen’s friend, Tattie, whom they didn’t know much about. When Jen called last week to ask if she could bring Tattie, Mia’s husband, Jeff, quickly questioned the name. “Tattie? What kind of name is that?” he had said. “It’s short for Tatiana,” Mia replied. “I think it’s nice.” “More like something very pretentious,” Jeff responded. He didn’t like anything showy and often criticized Mia for being too polite. He would have told the woman in the shop that she was choosing the wrong hat and that a dustbin lid would look better on her. “The trouble with you, Mia,” he often said, “is that you’re too polite for your own good.”

An hour later, Mia closed her shop and entered Medlar House through the back door. Her commute from work took only forty seconds. Four years ago, when Luke, their youngest child, left home, Mia decided to turn the unused barn next to their house into a bright space for her business. Jeff was doubtful. “Do you really think people want to buy hats?” he asked. But Mia knew from her friends that many women struggled to find the perfect hat for special occasions. She was right. From the first day, after Jen helped her create a website, Mia’s Hats became successful. Women traveled from far away to her shop in Little Pelham, where she provided a relaxed atmosphere for them to try on as many hats as they needed. She encouraged customers to bring their outfits to make sure everything matched. Recently, she also started selling handbags and costume jewelry."
98,"It’s a long journey from London to Atlanta, and at his new home in America, Lawrence Okoye reflects on his incredible sports journey. He is confident but also surprised by how far he has come, from competing in the Olympic discus final to possibly starting a new career. Even though he has never played American football before, Lawrence is likely to be chosen for one of the major teams in the USA.

In Atlanta, he is still learning about his new position in football. The idea that a 21-year-old beginner from London could be selected for one of the biggest teams in American sports seems unbelievable. However, Lawrence is known for proving people wrong. He was offered a place at Oxford University to study law but decided to focus on training for the discus instead, after previously playing rugby. Within 20 months of starting discus training, he became the fourth-best discus thrower in the world.

Lawrence originally went to Atlanta for warm-weather training for the discus, preparing for the world championships. When asked about his sudden interest in American football, he says, “It was in the back of my mind, but I only decided to try it when I got to the USA.” He had thought about it while in school in London, but it seemed like a crazy idea at the time. After arriving in America, he learned about the NFL trials in Atlanta. Even though he had never played football, he felt confident enough to apply for the trials. 

When asked if he was nervous about competing against experienced players, he replied, “No, not at all. I don’t get nervous for many things.” Although he doesn’t talk a lot, he is sure of his abilities. His performance in various tests showed that he was the most impressive player. “I was very happy to hear that,” he said, showing a rare moment of pride.

However, he is also cautious. He has no experience in football, so how can he make it onto an NFL team? He says, “Coaches have told me I have the right skills. It’s all about how hard I work.” When asked if he will be relaxed while waiting to hear if he has been selected, he said, “I will be. There’s no pressure on me. Many people say I will definitely be chosen, but I’m not too worried.”

This calmness may come from his disappointing experience in the Olympic discus final, where he finished last. He seems to have moved on from that moment and is proud that he qualified for the final with a great last throw. “That was an amazing day,” he says. “The final didn’t go as I wanted, but that’s part of sports. I can always return to it.”

After his Olympic disappointment, some people thought he had let that experience affect him. Lawrence does not want to comment on that. The minimum salary for an NFL player is over $400,000 a year, which is a strong reason to switch sports. Lawrence has moved from rugby to athletics and now to American football. With all his physical talent, wouldn’t it be better to focus on just one sport? “I understand why someone would say that,” he replies. “I’m trying to achieve something I’ve dreamed about since I was a kid. If it doesn’t work out, I can go back to the discus, the sport I love. Every decision I’ve made has been thought out.”"
99,"We had been flying east all night, and I woke up to see that it was already daylight. Looking out of the window at the empty land below, I noticed the dark shades of brown and green. Even though it was mid-September, it had not yet changed in Siberia. I could see no signs of people, just a strange view of mountains, streams, and forests stretching to the horizon. I shook my head. My neighbor woke up and smiled sleepily at me. “Good morning, Robert,” he said, saying my name with a slow Russian accent. Sergei was a salesman from Moscow, flying to the far reaches of civilization to sell safety clothing to local mining companies. His English was almost as poor as my Russian, but with a dictionary, I explained that I was going to the far-eastern Siberian city of Magadan with a one-way ticket because I planned to return home to England by bicycle. 

“But, Robert,” he said, “there is no road from Magadan; you cannot ride a bicycle.” I told him I believed there was a road, but not many people used it anymore. “Alone?” he asked, pointing at me. “No, I will be riding with a friend named Al.” “Just one friend?” “Yes, just one,” I nodded. Sergei still looked unsure and pointed outside, saying “Holodna” (cold). I tried to convince him by using hand gestures to show that I had a lot of warm clothes, but I didn’t mention that I was on a tight budget. Most of my clothes and equipment were bought at low prices. In reality, I wasn’t sure if they would be good enough, especially my large postman’s over-trousers that I bought for £10.

It all started in a lecture hall in Scotland. That morning, the hall was full of students slumped in their seats. Some were taking notes without much energy. The lecturer was speaking on and on. I was thinking hard about a dilemma. Should I ask him or not? “Well, why not?” I tore a fresh sheet from my pad and wrote, “Hi Al, Do you want to cycle across the Karakorum Highway between Pakistan and China this summer? Rob.” In the row in front of me was Al, my old school friend. I tapped him on the shoulder and passed the note. He tried to read my handwriting, scratched his head, wrote something, and passed it back. I unfolded it and held my breath while I read. “OK,” it said. 

It was six years later that I was going to meet Al in Siberia. I had been working as a geography teacher. Although I was still learning to control my classes, the job was fulfilling and challenging, with long holidays to chase adventures. Twice since I started teaching, I had used these holidays to meet Al. He had caught the adventure bug after our bike ride through Pakistan and decided to cycle around the world instead of teaching. Since our first ride together, Al had taken on bigger challenges. This round-the-world bike trip was his biggest yet. Sometimes he thought the ride would break him. Even though it sounded tough, I envied him. He was having an amazing adventure, facing new challenges every day, proving wrong those who said he could not do it. He was doing something that scared him almost every day, and it made him feel alive."
100,"In The Red Bull Air Race, twelve pilots take turns racing through tall pylons that are between 15 and 25 meters high. They make sharp turns, barrel rolls, and loops while flying at speeds of up to 370 km per hour. I was invited to experience what it feels like to participate in this race. 

An hour before my flight, I had to sign two forms. The first form confirmed that I was healthy, and the second said I would empty my pockets because small objects can be dangerous during the flight. I learned that I needed to stay aware of my surroundings. I was told, “The horizon is your best friend,” and the pilot would guide me on where to look. I also promised to relax and enjoy the view when flying upside down.

Half an hour before the flight, I attended a safety briefing where I was warned not to touch anything. As we were getting ready to take off, I was nervous. My legs were up, my feet were trying not to touch the important steering pedals, and my hands were avoiding the many switches nearby. I decided I would not relax and enjoy the flight, even though I knew I needed to stay calm and focused to survive the high-speed acrobatic flying.

When we started moving down the runway, I felt anxious. Dario, the pilot, and I were in the Zivko Edge 540, one of the fastest acrobatic planes in the world. The plane took off, and just two seconds later, we turned sharply to the right. I felt the air push out of my lungs. I looked at the horizon, tensed my body, and gasped as I sank into my seat. For a moment, I felt like I weighed 6.2 times my normal weight. Then we leveled out and made another sharp left turn, diving down. 

We were now just 10 meters above the ground, aiming for a small space between two pylons. We passed them at 400 km per hour, and I felt a rush of excitement, but then we made a sharp right turn. I was allowed to fly the plane for two minutes, but my hand was shaking so much that the plane shook too. Dario spoke to me, but I couldn’t hear him. Instead of answering, he did a barrel roll, spinning the plane completely. 

“Are you okay?” he asked. “Yes,” I replied. “Have you had enough?” “No,” I lied. Then he did a loop, flying up and over in a full circle. I know many people would find this thrilling, like those who enjoy roller coasters, but I thought it was too much. At the top of the loop, while we were upside down, I heard a voice saying, “Relax, relax, look up.” I looked up and saw some fields below us.

The flight lasted only 10 minutes, but it felt much softer compared to what the pilots experience during races. As soon as we landed, Dario took out some sandwiches and started eating. I didn’t eat for hours, and that night, I kept dreaming about the loop over and over again."
101,"Doug Allan films wild animals in cold places. If you have ever been impressed by videos of polar bears in a nature documentary, it is likely that he filmed them. He says his ideal temperature is -18°C. Allan trained as a marine biologist and commercial diver. Diving was his first love, where he learned how to survive in cold environments. His big opportunity came when a TV crew arrived in Antarctica, where Allan was working, to make a wildlife documentary. He ended up taking the crew to different locations, and after 48 hours, he realized that being a wildlife cameraman was perfect for him: it included travel, adventure, and underwater experiences. Now, he is a top cameraman and has worked on many important TV wildlife series.

Allan started his career 35 years ago when the camera and communication technology were very basic. He says, ""It is much easier to film today. Back then, if you filmed something, you had to remember it. Now, with digital technology, you can film a lot and see it right away. You had to think about what shots you needed next and what you missed. You filmed less because film was very expensive. Today, you can have too much material.""

He believes his experience in cold conditions is valuable. He feels comfortable on sea ice, which now feels as easy as crossing the street for him. He does get cold toes, but he says the poles are healthy places with no leeches, diseases, or mosquitoes. Wildlife filming, according to Allan, has many successes but also failures and embarrassing moments. Once, he was in the Orkneys to film kittiwakes but could not identify the birds.

Recently, Allan got permission to film in Kong Karls Land, a group of islands in the Arctic Ocean. He knew it would not be easy. This area is home to polar bears and is only for the bravest or most foolish people. In April, it is usually -32°C, the wind is strong, and carrying cameras through deep snow is very difficult. After walking for five or more hours a day and watching polar bear dens for 23 days, Allan had only seen one mother bear and her cub. However, on day 24, he felt like he was part of the bear world, moving and sensing like a bear. 

He describes a moment when he was watching a hole in the snow. After waiting for five hours, he caught a quick glimpse of a bear. The camera was focused, and he saw a black nose appear, which soon became a full bear. The bear rested on the snow, looking at him without concern. Just as he thought it couldn’t get better, the bear slid down the slope, seemingly enjoying herself. Then, two cubs appeared at the den entrance, clearly seeing the world for the first time. Allan felt like he had front-row seats to a wonderful show.

Now, Allan wants to make his own film about climate change in the Arctic, speaking to the people who live there and see its effects firsthand. He believes he could create an extraordinary documentary."
102,"In 2004, Pen Hadow became the first person to walk alone to the North Pole without getting supplies along the way. This journey involved swimming in extremely cold water, dealing with frostbite, and facing polar bears. Just eight months later, he reached the South Pole too. Now, he is back in the Arctic, getting ready for an even bigger adventure. Explorers like Pen are confident and determined. This time, however, there is a lot more at stake. Pen and two colleagues will go on a three-month, 1,000-kilometer trek to the North Pole to measure the thickness and density of the ice. No one has done this before, and Pen knows the results will be very important for scientists. This will give a clearer picture of how global warming is affecting the ice in the polar regions.

Pen was prepared for this kind of work from a young age. His father’s old nanny, who had worked for the famous polar explorer Scott of the Antarctic, took care of him. She toughened him up by sending him out into the Scottish mountains during storms with very few clothes. His father also inspired his love for adventures in cold places, and Pen developed great physical strength. 

Pen is married to Mary, who loves horses and the outdoors. She helps run his polar guide business and worries more about him when he is at home. She once raced against him in a mountain event, and she and her horse finished an hour ahead of him. Pen and Mary live in the countryside with their two children. He finds it harder to be away from them this time. When he last left, his children were very young, and he made a mistake by telling his son to take care of his mother and sister. This put too much pressure on his son. For this trip, Pen plans to have little contact with his family because he believes that calling them will remind them of how far away he is.

In the days before he leaves, Pen is carefully preparing his equipment. He knows that once he is on the ice, it will be very difficult to fix things or do anything complicated. He will be joined by Ann Daniels, a leading polar explorer, and Martin Hartley, the expedition photographer. They will have a support crew of six people who will fly in supplies. Pen finds being part of a team stressful, and he is also worried about his age. He will turn 47 soon and feels he hasn’t trained enough. He often gets caught up in organizing things instead of training.

Pen believes that his mission connects exploration with the search for knowledge, just like explorers in the past. He admits that reaching the North Pole was mainly a personal goal and didn’t help many people. This time, however, scientists will benefit from the data they collect, and they want to involve as many people as possible in understanding what is happening in the Arctic Ocean. Pen feels that their skills, which might seem strange or useless in everyday life, are now very important. “Suddenly, we’re socially useful again,” he says."
103,"Text: 'I took a year off. What was I going to do? Being a successful Olympian is amazing. I had the chance to do more writing, TV work, and speak to businesses and schools. Even though I enjoyed these activities, I missed the competition. I wanted to stay in shape so I could try for another Olympic spot if I felt inspired again. So, I signed up for marathons and triathlons. That should have been enough, but I kept thinking about Ben Fogle’s invitation: ‘Do you want to row across the Atlantic with me?’ I have always loved rowing and the feeling of the boat moving through the water. I started to miss that feeling, but I wasn’t ready to train every day. Still, I wanted some kind of competition. I asked some of my rowing friends if they wanted to join the race, but they weren’t very excited. I knew that if I entered the race, even though it was called an adventure, I would want to win. Would rowing with Ben give me the best chance to win? No. But being an underdog without pressure was appealing. I contacted Ben. He was going to join the race anyway and had managed to pay the big entry fee and deposit for a boat, which made the race feel real. We talked about the other costs; the boat and equipment would cost £70,000, which is a lot of money. We thought we had a good chance, but it would still take work to get the money. I also had to think about losing income while I was away. Speaking at business conferences is one of the best ways to earn money as a retired athlete. It feels good that people are interested, but I find it hard to talk about my past without a new goal. Joining the race would mean I wouldn’t just talk about what I did before; I would actually be doing something again: rowing across the Atlantic. I learned a lot while planning this adventure, but one of the biggest lessons was to appreciate the easy life of a full-time athlete. My training for the Olympics was tough, but it was straightforward. I trained almost every day, but I had a set program, doctors, and dieticians. I was worried about what people would think of me racing with a TV presenter. I thought it might look like I just wanted to be on TV, and I could have chosen a better partner to win the race. But my worries faded as we prepared. The Atlantic Rowing Race is about more than just rowing; it’s also about mental strength. Ben had completed the difficult Marathon des Sables, spent a lot of time at sea, and lived on a deserted island for a year. However, he didn’t know how to row. I was surprised by how little he understood about rowing, and he was shocked by my lack of patience. I could have been more understanding, but I felt it was important to tell Ben how much he needed to improve. I should have realized that this would be his level when I agreed to race with him.'"
104,"Text: 

Just over a year ago, I left my job to work with huskies in the Arctic Circle in northern Finland. At 26, I felt restless and dreamed of cold, empty landscapes, maybe because I was tired of the busy life in London. I found a small company run by Anna McCormack and her husband, Pasi Ikonen, in Finnish Lapland. They offered me a job as a husky dog handler for the busy winter season. From December to February, they take many tourists on sled rides pulled by huskies across the ice and snow, for trips that can last from one hour to five days. They started with six dogs, but now they have more than 100. Recently, they took over a second place called the 'wilderness farm,' which they described as a beautiful but basic location with unreliable electricity and no running water. They told me I could join the team for three months if I understood what I was getting into. ""The hours are long, the conditions are tough, and the work is very physical,"" they said. I started packing right away.

November 6, London: On my flight, I stared at a page with over 100 pictures of huskies. I was supposed to memorize their names before I arrived, but I felt distracted and nervous. I put the page down and looked out the window instead. It is said that spring moves north at about 26 km per day, bringing flowers and leaves. However, I felt like winter was moving south, and the rivers were freezing.

November 7, Helsinki and Hetta: The bus ride north was just what I hoped for. We drove through endless dark forests with thin trees covered in snow, stopping sometimes to let reindeer pass. I arrived at the farm after dark, and as soon as I walked in, I was given a pair of boots and sent out into the cold. ""Do you want to be thrown in at the deep end?"" Anna asked. I followed the sound of barking, which grew louder as I reached the dog sheds. Three people were running back and forth, pulling the huskies out and getting them ready for sleds. The dogs were very excited, pulling against their ropes to get going. I could barely introduce myself because everyone was too busy. I stood to the side and petted one of the quieter dogs. Someone told me to ""Get in!"" and I almost fell into the nearest sled. A command was shouted, and suddenly we were off into the dark, with only a headlamp for light.

November 15, Hetta: It didn’t take long to become part of the husky guides, but first, I had to answer some tough questions about what I could do. ""Are you useful?"" Anna asked. I was confused. I didn’t know if I was. After more questions, I realized I wasn’t very useful: I had never driven a snowmobile, hadn’t done woodwork since school, and had never chopped anything with an axe. ""Do you have a driving license?"" someone asked finally. I nodded, feeling relieved. 

I learned the basics of dog-sledding quickly: lean into the corners, use both feet on the brake to stop, and never let go of the handlebar. But many other things were complicated. Simple tasks like feeding and watering the dogs became hard in freezing temperatures. A bowl of water would freeze quickly, so we had to make a 'soup' of meat in hot water for the dogs. By the end of my first week, I was overwhelmed with instructions, and my muscles hurt from pulling heavy sleds and being pulled around by excited huskies. But I felt proud. ""I can chop with an axe, hammer a nail, and use a circular saw,"" I emailed my friends. ""In the snow."""
105,"On that day, as Radcliffe ran past the finish line, reporters gathered to understand her amazing performance. They noted that her time was fast enough to qualify her for the men's marathon at the world championships in Paris. Curious journalists asked her about a special natural treatment called emu oil, which Olympic gold medalist Cathy Freeman had suggested to help Radcliffe heal from an injury caused by an accident when she ran into a bike while training. Radcliffe said that the achievement didn’t fully hit her at the time. Looking back, she realizes it was a big deal, but she felt it was just what she was meant to do that day.

She and her support team had decided not to set any limits on their goals. Their motto was ""no limits."" During the race, Gary Lough, Radcliffe's husband and coach, was in a car with her support team, listening to the radio coverage. Gerard Hartmann, her physiotherapist, was also with him. After 16 kilometers, Radcliffe's agent wondered if she could keep up her fast pace, worried it might make her drop out of the race. Hartmann was angry at this concern, but he understood that anyone who didn’t know how fit she was might think it was risky to start so quickly.

With 800 meters left, Radcliffe started to think about her time. She realized she could finish in under 2 hours and 16 minutes if she ran the last part in less than three minutes. She had already run 41 kilometers very quickly but still managed to sprint the final distance in 2 minutes and 25 seconds. At the finish, she thought, ""I can run faster than that."" She remembered the race director, Dave Bedford, saying he never thought anyone would come close to that time for a long time. Radcliffe thought, ""I will come back and do it next year,"" and she really believed she could.

Unfortunately, that did not happen. After the race, everyone wanted to know how an athlete with such an unusual running style had beaten the skilled East African runners. Hartmann had worked with Radcliffe for weeks, giving her daily training sessions to help her manage the 250-300 kilometers she ran each week. He said, ""I've worked with 63 Olympic medalists, and no one could handle the level of pain she could. She would tire me out because I had to work so deep into her muscles that I would have to ice my thumbs afterward because I was in so much pain.""

Hartmann described traveling 13 hours from his home in Ireland to Radcliffe's training base in France, only to be greeted by her husband saying, ""Gerard, you're 15 minutes late, Paula's waiting."" There was no ""Hello, do you want a cup of tea?"" She was ready for a two-hour training session as soon as he arrived. ""Paula would push you to your limits. That's what made her so good."" During this time, Hartmann dedicated so much of his time to Radcliffe that his other athletes became upset.

Can Radcliffe explain why no one has come close to her record? ""Not really. I trained very hard, but there are more talented people out there. I thought Mary Keitany (a two-time London marathon winner) would do it. Maybe it's because people are racing against each other instead of racing against themselves."" What does she mean? ""That mental attitude of never slowing down, even when you are winning, probably helped me because I never thought, 'I can relax now.' It was always about pushing as hard as I could.""

Radcliffe did not know it at the time, but that marathon was the peak of her career. She would never run that fast again. However, she inspired many women to take up long-distance running."
106,"When my first cooking show, In Search of Perfection, was released, I was unsure how viewers and critics would react. There was a lot of talk about a food ‘revolution’ happening in Britain, and I believed we had created a series that truly contributed to this change. However, I worried whether people would enjoy a cooking show that included not just techniques but also history, memories, and science. I watched the first episode feeling both happy and anxious. I didn’t need to worry. The show became very successful, leading to many exciting projects, including a book about my experiences at my restaurant.

In each project, I felt like I was on a journey, whether into the past, into my thoughts, or into cooking techniques. I wrote several books in a series called ‘Perfection’, each one linked to its own TV show. In these books, the journey was often physical, involving passports, suitcases, and travel plans. The latest book, In Search of Total Perfection, takes you around the world to meet amazing artisans, like a man who creates golden pasta that tastes better than any other. These artisans have spent many years trying to achieve their own ideas of perfection.

Perfection is very personal. Even choosing which dishes to include in the series was difficult, and I knew I would disappoint some people by not including their favorites. I could imagine people asking, “Where’s steak and kidney pie and bread and butter pudding?” However, after a long meeting with the TV production team, we finally created a list that would satisfy everyone. This experience confirmed my belief that everyone has their own idea of perfection, shaped by their emotions, memories, and experiences.

Despite the book’s title, I knew I wouldn’t claim that the recipes were the best or final versions. I believed that by using my cooking skills and scientific knowledge, and by talking to food producers, artisans, chefs, and their customers, I could identify what made these dishes special. The dictionary defines ‘perfection’ as being perfect, but it also means improving through constant experimentation. This means trying out ideas and changing them until you create something unique.

The TV series allowed me to explore many foods, people, and places I had never seen in restaurants before. I was excited to discover memories and nostalgia in food because I started my career in the same way. Finding the best ingredients took me around the world. I had many adventures, like visiting a canning factory that was processing the wrong type of tomato and going to a dairy farm that did not meet our standards for perfection, which made us stop filming there! While perfecting each recipe, I ended up hand-milking a cow, using dry ice to make ice cream, cooking chicken in a hospital scanning machine, and almost burning my house down trying to get the oven hot enough for a real Neapolitan-style pizza."
107,"We were still a long way from Marrakech when the van made a loud noise, swerved off the road into a field, and stopped. John got out and opened the hood. He looked at the engine for a long time with his hands in his pockets, looking serious. “Actually, I have no idea what I’m doing,” he finally said, and he and Mum started to laugh. Bea was worried, “We can’t stay here forever,” she said. The field went on for miles, with just grass and many flowers, like poppies and daisies. “No, we can’t stay here forever,” I agreed, because it was best to support Bea. We got back into the van and waited for Mum and John to stop laughing. We watched John get smaller as he walked away to find someone who could help with the van. Mum lay down on the grass. “Tell us a story,” she said. Bea lay down next to her. “Go on, tell us a story.” So I told them about how the day before we left London, I heard two birds talking. I shared everything they talked about: breadcrumbs, other birds, the weather, and an argument over a worm. “That’s silly, no one understands bird language,” Bea said. My eyes felt wet. “I do.” But I didn’t sound very sure. “Liar.” I felt embarrassed. How could I be lying if I remembered everything? The more I thought about it, the less sure I became. “Mum…?” But she had fallen asleep in the sun. John came back with three Moroccan boys who helped us push the van down the road to the hotel. Bea didn’t want to get out. The boys didn’t mind at all. They waved and smiled at her through the back windows. We followed John into a café that was not far from where our van was parked. “It’s a hotel,” John whispered. “I think it might be a bit expensive.” “We’ll just have some tea,” Mum said, and we sat in the shade. The tea they brought was made from mint leaves and was very sweet. Mum looked into the pot. “It’s like syrup in there,” she said. We stayed at the café all day while John looked sadly at the engine. “I guess it’s a miracle it got us this far,” he said as it started to get dark. Mum took out blankets and made a bed for us in the hotel garden. It felt nice to sleep on the ground. “I’ll have to get us towed into Marrakech,” John said from the other side of Mum. Half an hour later, we were in a truck watching our van being pulled behind with John driving. At first, Bea didn’t want to move, so John picked her up and put her in the truck. Now she sat in the front with the driver. I kept wondering how we would get home now that our van had to be towed everywhere. I thought it might be easier to take a boat straight to London. Then I must have fallen asleep."
108,"Lucy was at a welcome party in a hotel ballroom, talking to two other pianists who were also at the Prague Classical Music Festival. One was a guy from Tokyo, and the other was a girl from a European city named Liesel or Louisa. They were both about ten years older than Lucy and spoke good English. They discussed the music they were playing and their recent travels. 

“I think I'm doing Tanglewood this summer,” Lucy said, trying to sound impressive. However, she didn’t really want to go to the Tanglewood festival. She often felt overwhelmed by the concerts and competitions that took her around the world, making her miss so much school that she was no longer officially enrolled. Instead, she worked with tutors from the University of San Francisco. 

Lucy hadn’t even wanted to come to the Prague Festival, which only accepted fifteen pianists her age from around the world. She was one of the lucky few chosen from thousands of applicants. At the celebration, her dad gave her a white-gold necklace with an L pendant to congratulate her, and her little brother Gus dreamed about being at the same festival one day. Her teacher, Grace Chang, took her out for a special dinner to plan her music pieces. The truth was, Lucy hadn’t applied herself; her mother had filled out the form and sent in a CD. “I didn’t want you to be disappointed if you didn’t get in,” her mom had said. Lucy thought her mom just didn’t want to let her say no. Back then, she believed that making waves was the worst thing to do, so she didn’t think about trying to back out.

The guy from Tokyo leaned in, seeming surprised. “Tanglewood?” he asked. “Yeah,” Lucy replied. “How old are you?” he asked. “Fifteen,” she said. He looked at Liesel/Louisa, who said, “Wow.” Lucy hadn’t meant to brag; it was hard to know when she was just sharing her experiences or showing off. 

“It’s just part of this new youth-spotlight thing they’re trying,” she explained. Just then, Liesel/Louisa looked across the room and said she had to go talk to someone. The guy from Tokyo stayed and asked, “Have you ever been to Japan?” He had long, messy hair, like many musicians, to show he was a cool music nerd. “Once, when I was about eight,” Lucy replied. He started to say something when Lucy's grandfather appeared beside her. 

“Lucy, let me introduce you to someone,” he said, pulling her away. “And don’t get too friendly with the competition.” “They’re not the competition,” Lucy replied. “Everyone is the competition,” her grandfather insisted. He took her around the room, making her talk to important people. Lucy smiled and nodded, understanding only part of what was said.

Later, in the elevator to their suite, her grandfather told her, “You did well in there, Lucy. I’m proud of you. This is an important festival, and people are talking about you. They all know who you are.” Lucy liked that. Being recognized felt good, even if some people were jealous or thought she was too young for the attention. Being a concert pianist didn’t earn her respect from the kids at her old school. Even her best friend, Reyna, didn’t know or care that she could play a difficult Rachmaninov piece. But in places like this, Lucy felt she mattered."
109,"Text: ""‘It’s not good for you to spend so much time online. You need to get out into the real world,’ said Dad. It’s hard to argue with him, so I decided to see what experts say about this topic – and it’s quite interesting. Research shows that most teenagers who use social media have many real-life friends, a strong sense of identity, and are learning important technical skills for the digital world. Simon Miles, an e-safety expert, says ‘social networking is now a big part of growing up. Teenagers don’t just use media like adults do – they live in it. This isn’t necessarily good or bad – it depends on how you use it.’ 

How does our social networking compare to what our parents did when they were young? Jim Matthews, a social media analyst, says it’s like the modern version of hanging out at a youth club, where parents used to share jokes and gossip. He believes it helps teenagers build their identity away from their parents and learn to handle teenage issues with their friends. 

Psychologist Professor Keith Davidson says: ‘Adolescence is a time when you ask, who am I? Social networking can help you find your identity: you can share your favorite music or sports, discover what you like, and see that others have different opinions. Research shows that active social networkers are not as self-centered as those who don’t use social media.’ He adds that social media can help shy people: ‘Talking online can be easier than in person, and it allows you to practice social skills in a less stressful way.’ 

Professor Andrew Phillips is studying how young people use social networking sites. He believes they can help quiet people with special interests connect with others who share those interests. ‘If you’re one of only a few people in your school who likes a certain type of music, you might feel alone. But if you find a social networking group of people like you, you can feel more connected and popular in a different way,’ he says. 

Pauline White, a digital education expert, shared something interesting: ‘It’s young people who find new interests online, join groups of like-minded individuals, and create their own content who are really using social networks well.’ She thinks social networking is becoming a creative tool: teenagers are making videos, podcasts, and blogs about what interests them. Photo-sharing sites are helping photographers connect, learn skills, share images, and grow their passion. ‘This all helps with job opportunities and will be useful in the workplace,’ she says. ‘Every business uses social media to sell and build their brand – and you need to know how it works to attract customers. For example, if you create a product and have 1000 friends on different social networks, they could all be potential customers. If you connect all those networks, you have your customer base.’ 

Teenagers who use social networking creatively will benefit when they become adults and enter the job market, agrees Matthews. ‘One great thing about many sites is the chance to work with others to create content and share it. Collaboration is an important skill in the 21st century and is key to being employable in a digital world.’"""
110,"When most people think of a relaxing family vacation, they might not imagine a long trip across nine western states in the US and a Canadian province. However, my parents were not looking for a quiet getaway when they planned our summer vacation this year. My dad seemed determined to create what he called the ultimate family bonding trip, which my twin brother and I found terrifying. “Not enough people do this anymore,” my parents said repeatedly before our vacation, while we exchanged worried looks.

In mid-June, we packed our car with suitcases, coolers, and a mix of clothes for any weather. I was excited but knew I would miss my privacy for the next two weeks. With barely enough space left in the car, we began “The Family Great American Road Trip.” Leaving our big home for smaller places for the next five thousand miles made me wonder what we had gotten ourselves into.

We drove west through the Oklahoma panhandle. Even though we were still close to home, we had our share of adventures. We stopped for the night in Oklahoma, under a sky full of stars, after almost being blown off the road by a dust storm. We quickly learned that cattle have the right-of-way on the road!

The next day, we woke up early and continued our journey. The desert changed to mountains, and the days started to blend together, but each adventure was still unique. We left our footprints in the Great Sand Dunes and then went to Pagosa Springs, Colorado, where we noticed a strong smell of sulfur. As we climbed to our next stop, we realized that the roads marked for Jeeps were best for Jeep drivers.

Every place we visited showed a mix of old and new. Dealing with construction traffic became normal. We laughed when we saw the big “CLOSED” signs at the Four Corners Monument. On our way to Yellowstone National Park, we saw many wind farms and watched the sunset over bear habitats near the roads. We experienced “bear jams,” where traffic would stop to let bears cross, and we had a close encounter with one bear and an anxious park ranger, which created unforgettable memories.

As we continued our trip, life back home felt far away. Even the hotel we stayed in, which was old and had no internet or cell phone service, couldn’t dampen our excitement. In exchange for these inconveniences, I enjoyed the most beautiful views I had ever seen. After watching a rainstorm from our hotel in Canada, my family and I headed back south. My parents were right: you don’t need to travel to a faraway place to find something amazing.

Returning home was a mix of happiness and sadness, but at least I hadn’t fought with my brother during our one hundred hours on the road! We had three thousand photos from our journey to look through and remember. I knew that the best memories would be the unexpected and spontaneous moments we shared."
111,"Rose Frost was sixteen years old and was going to live with her grandmother, Daisy. Rose's family was separating for two years. Her father, Jeff, had a job overseas, and her mother, Dahlia, would join him. Rose and her older sister, Amy, would stay in England. Amy needed to finish her last year of school, so it was better for her to stay. She was happy because she got the best room at her college, which had its own kitchen and study area. She also had free access to the Internet and phone. Jeff and Dahlia would keep an eye on Amy, whether she liked it or not. 

So, Rose was moving to her grandmother’s house. She only had vague memories of her grandmother from past holidays and had never met her grandfather. When Daisy offered Rose a place to stay, her parents were not excited about it, but Daisy was happy to have Rose with her. Rose didn’t fully understand why her parents didn’t get along with her grandma, but there had been a disagreement in the past. Because of this, Rose had spent her summers away from Daisy, even though she had happy memories of her. 

Dahlia told Rose that living with Daisy would be interesting. Daisy was very social and loved to bring people together. Rose could expect dinner invitations, coffee mornings, and shopping trips soon. This thought made her smile. Daisy was not a typical old lady; she seemed to go to more social events than anyone else. 

Before the move, Dahlia and Rose had a serious talk. Rose was sensible and mature for her age. She knew about healthy eating, staying fit, and getting enough sleep. But she wanted one thing: her independence. Living with Daisy would meet her needs, but Rose wanted to play music loudly, invite friends over, and go out without asking for permission every time. She didn’t want to be reminded about homework or staying out late, and she didn’t want to be taken around by her grandmother. Daisy understood. 

Dahlia gave Rose a new touch-screen mobile phone with a video camera for emergencies only. Rose was very happy about this. They all agreed that it would be about trust. Daisy would trust Rose to make good decisions, and Rose would trust Daisy not to be too strict. If either of them crossed a line, they would talk about it again. 

Rose was not a wild child. Her few school friends were similar, so her school reports were always good, and her exam results were excellent. This helped her a lot. In five weeks, Rose would start at a new school, meet new friends, and begin her life again. This would be her fourth senior school in five years, so she felt experienced. At least she knew this would be the last time, as she would be starting her final two years of school. For Rose, it was a new moment in her life, a new piece in the puzzle of her experiences."
112,"Charlotte Grainger shares that her primary school teacher was the first person to think she might write a novel. She says, “I believed that writing a book would be a great achievement because it seemed very challenging. I didn’t know what other teenagers were doing, like competing in the Olympics. When I turned 13, I thought, ‘I should try this now.’” The novel she started at that age is now about to be published. She recently told her former teacher about it, and the teacher was surprised. The teacher had thought Charlotte would write a book when she was 30 or 40, but Charlotte never considered waiting that long. 

It is a winter afternoon in the offices of Charlotte’s publishers. Even though I knew I was going to interview a 15-year-old girl about her book, I was surprised to see a teenager sitting there. The book is a significant achievement: it has a strong and exciting story. Nothing about it, except for the age of its main character, suggests it was written by a teenager. A public relations representative is with us in case Charlotte needs help, but she doesn’t. She is confident, smart, and steady, which keeps her from being overly confident.

Charlotte understands that she is still young. When I ask her about the complex moral questions in her book, she says, “I was trying to ask big questions, not answer them. I don’t have many life lessons to share with my readers.” She laughs and adds, “I don’t think my age limits my understanding of the world, but I also don’t think I’m very wise. I just wanted to explore the idea of taking responsibility.”

Charlotte has a theory about how teenagers are often misrepresented in books aimed at them. She believes there are three types of teenage characters in novels: the outsider who becomes accepted, the naïve teenager who knows little about the world, and the awkward teenager who struggles socially. She finds it frustrating to read about these types. “What if you’re basically fine? There aren’t many stories about teenagers who aren’t struggling in some way. Some writers give the impression that teenagers can’t know who they are because they lack experience, and that can hurt their self-confidence.”

Charlotte has always loved reading famous fantasy authors, but their work almost discouraged her from writing. “My favorite fantasy books explore deep topics about psychology and life. I wondered if I needed to write like that to create a good book and if I was capable of it.” However, she appreciates a book called How Not to Write a Novel, which taught her that if readers can guess what will happen next, the suspense is lost.

Some might say that having parents who are journalists helped her get her novel published. In fact, her father knew someone in publishing who read her book first. Charlotte recognizes her good luck because it is hard for anyone to get a first novel read, no matter their age. “Every aspiring writer needs support and a bit of luck, but after that, you are on your own. Ultimately, writers succeed or fail based on their talent, so I don’t take anything for granted,” Charlotte concludes."
113,"""‘Remember, speed is your friend, not your enemy,’ said Gareth, our instructor, as we looked down the ski slope. ‘Now, who wants to go first?’ The group looked nervous. Then a guy named David, who had some experience with freestyle ski-jumping, stepped forward and skied down the slope towards the jump. He went up the ramp quickly and flew into the air, but something seemed wrong. We held our breath. He landed hard, lost both skis, and flipped into the snow. ‘Remember,’ Gareth said kindly, ‘speed can be unpredictable.’ 

I started to think that maybe freestyle skiing wasn’t for me. On previous ski trips, I had enjoyed practicing turns in the snow, but I wasn’t like the teenagers who did tricks on ramps and half pipes. I thought it looked fun, but I was afraid that if I tried to join them, I would embarrass myself. Then my parents decided we would have a winter holiday at a freestyle skiing training center in the US. The center had a big indoor area with trampolines and ski jumps covered in artificial snow. Students practiced their tricks and landed in foam pits, which was not a realistic way to prepare for the real slopes.

After practicing indoors, students went outside to try their moves for real. ‘Progression is inevitable!’ the center’s slogan said. ‘Before places like this trained people, inexperienced ski jumpers would just throw themselves down the slopes and hope for the best,’ Gareth explained. ‘But remember – if you land on the knuckle, you’ll be in trouble.’ The ‘knuckle’ is the flat area behind the jump before the slope gets steep again. If you land in the right zone, you keep moving forward, which is safer. If you land on the flat, you stop suddenly, which can hurt. So, speed is important.

At first, it was hard to convince my body to ignore my fears and go straight towards the jump. My legs seemed to want to go backward as I got close, and I often landed on the knuckle. I didn’t fall, but by midday, I felt exhausted. ‘You need to control the jump, not let it control you,’ Gareth said. 

On the second day, we started on the trampolines. I thought I would hate being indoors while looking at the snowy mountains, but bouncing on the trampolines was fun. Some exercises copied the moves we would make while ski-jumping, and others helped us learn ‘aerial awareness’ – understanding what our bodies were doing while spinning in the air. Gareth gave us tips. My ‘aerial awareness’ needed improvement because every time I tried, I only remembered the moment before take-off and then found myself in the foam cubes next to the trampoline.

We returned to the mountain to try again. There were more mistakes, but eventually, I landed properly. Gareth was as happy as I was, and for a moment, I felt proud of achieving my goal. But that feeling didn’t last long. On my last run of the day, I made myself keep my speed up as I approached the jump, flew into the air, and landed correctly. Then I saw both of my skis sliding down the slope, no longer attached to my feet."""
114,"Imagine you are on a rollercoaster at an amusement park. Your hands are sweaty from fear, and you grip the harness tightly. Suddenly, the ride stops, and you take a deep breath as the carriage slowly climbs up. There is a pause, then a sudden drop that makes your stomach feel like it’s in the air. You rush forward, turn sharply to the left, and go upside down. Everything around you is a blur, and you scream in fear. But you chose to be here, just like millions of others who pay to enter theme parks.

What surprises me is that amusement parks, with their thrilling rides, are a huge business. To create the excitement and escape from reality that visitors want, there are large teams of creative engineers and designers working behind the scenes. The idea of being a ""rollercoaster designer"" might sound like a child's dream job, but it is actually very challenging. Designers must find the right mix of fun and fear while keeping riders safe. They also need to come up with new ideas to keep people coming back.

While many people think rollercoasters are getting more intense, most of the techniques used today were actually invented by a US designer named John Miller in the early 1900s. During his time, there were fewer safety rules, and some rides were very extreme, which made many passengers uncomfortable. Now, designers have to follow the track designs made by special ride manufacturers.

I talked to three experts about rollercoasters. Professor Brendan Walker, a ""thrill engineer,"" explained that the skill lies in putting all the parts together. Dr. John Roberts, a member of the Royal Academy of Engineering, added that it’s important to quickly switch between feelings of excitement and safety so that riders feel thrilled but not scared. 

To create an amazing ride, the teams must develop a strong story, like a space adventure or a jungle chase, that fits with new features like the tallest drops or the most twists. However, Professor Walker noted that, like in many creative fields, experience and instinct are crucial. Jeff Hornick, a senior director of theme park development, agreed that it helps to be passionate about thrills to understand what riders want and to test the rides before they open.

I asked the experts if rollercoaster designers would use new technology like virtual reality. Walker said we shouldn’t expect too much from it. He explained that while virtual reality can enhance the experience, the real excitement comes from the physical ride itself, which will continue to be the main attraction for many years."
115,"At 25, Miranda Ellington has already done a lot as a choreographer, creating performances for many theatres and dance companies. She also dances occasionally. I wonder why she manages to do both activities in her busy life. She explains, “Dancing again reminds me of what it’s like to be in the studio, following the orders of strict choreographers, and how stressful that can be. Choreographers can forget what it feels like to rehearse all day.”

As a choreographer, she teaches and enjoys working with young students. “A new dancer is often open to trying new ideas. Sometimes, working with students is easier than with professionals because they are willing to take risks. They want to succeed but don’t yet fully understand their strengths and weaknesses. This lack of understanding helps them accept even tough criticism. However, they might still question what I say, and I appreciate their honest feedback.”

When Miranda starts with a new group, she focuses on the dance steps, and the music guides her. “There might be music I don’t like, but I still try to create the best dance routine for it. If dancers don’t respond well to a certain piece of music, it can be frustrating, but I need to find solutions. I can’t just choose a new piece of music. I wish I could be more experimental and switch to different pieces, as it would help improve the mood during tough rehearsals. Unfortunately, I often work on large productions where the music is already decided by the composer.”

Miranda believes in making connections with new people. “It’s important to meet new people, but I have to remember that each theatre and school has different methods and styles. I need to adapt my way of working each time I go somewhere new, instead of doing the same thing everywhere. This helps me avoid becoming too set in my ways.”

We discuss a recent documentary about professional ballet dancers and choreographers. “There have been glamorous documentaries in the past that were misleading,” Miranda says. “This one tries to show the real life inside a dance company. There’s a scene where a young dancer receives many corrections, and I smiled because I recognized that feeling. She knows she’s not getting it right but can’t make her body do what’s needed. It’s hard to watch, but it’s real. People often underestimate the hard work and dedication needed in ballet.”

I ask Miranda what makes a great dance production. “It’s when everything the company has worked on – the music, costumes, lighting, and dancers – comes together. Perfection might be too much to expect, but aiming high is appreciated by audiences and can help cover up some mistakes. I’ve been part of productions where the dance steps were great, but something about the costumes or props was distracting, and that’s disappointing.”

Miranda has done many different types of work, so I ask how she sees herself: is she a modern dance choreographer or a ballet specialist? “People want to label you, and I don’t understand that. There’s also a trend to focus on becoming an expert in a narrow area. I don’t follow that, but maybe one day I will be known for one thing. For now, I just want to explore more.”"
116,"A friend once asked me why I travel when I can see everything on television. I agreed that there are amazing things on TV, but why stay at home when there is so much to experience outside? This conversation inspired my crazy four-day trip and a film that encourages people to turn off their TVs. 

A friend was getting rid of his old sofa, which became the main part of my film. I added three wheels and some cables to it and connected them to old seatbelts over my shoulders. I put my luggage on the sofa and slept on it each night, even one night on the beach. Some friends joined me, helping to pull the sofa and encouraging me to keep going. 

I have done many walking trips in recent years, but this was something completely different. It was the longest distance I have ever walked, and I walked on main roads. This allowed me to stop at roadside cafés and relax on the sofa with a cappuccino instead of sitting on a rock with my sandwiches blowing away in the wind. 

I often had to tell people, “No, I’m not doing this for charity, and I’m not training for a marathon.” When someone at work asks about my weekend, I prefer to explain how I dragged a sofa 100 miles across southern England rather than talk about the latest TV show. You can watch the film on my website."
117,"When I read about guided swimming trips in the sea around some small Greek islands, I felt excited. I had never tried organized group trips before. My brother, who I had traveled with before, was busy, so I thought a group holiday would be good for me. The man at the Greek port looked surprised when I asked for a single ferry ticket because the islands are popular with families. I explained that I wouldn’t be alone for long; I would be joining ten others to swim around the small islands. Although he still looked confused, he smiled and let me on the boat.

Our group had exchanged emails before we left, but there was little time to talk before our first group swim. Our guides told us that a support boat would follow us the whole time and made sure we knew how to communicate with it. We did a short swim to divide us into speed groups, and then it was time for our first real swim of 1.5 km. I was nervous. I had trained in my local pool and done some river swimming, but I had never swum long distances in the open sea. Soon, the waves got bigger, and I found myself at the back of the slow group, which was not where I wanted to be. I watched the faster swimmers move ahead like dolphins. However, I wanted to finish this first distance, and I was very happy when I finally did it on my own.

The next days followed a routine: jumping in, finding a comfortable speed, and stopping to enjoy the beautiful views. As the swims became longer, my speed and enjoyment also increased. I felt like I didn’t need the support boat anymore. I can’t wait to come back again next year."
118,"Being a flight attendant is not easy, but it has many rewards. Since I started this job, I have traveled to many places, from the US to Australia. I work with amazing people, have plenty of time off, and my life is always interesting. This makes it a great job for someone young like me!

When I was a child, I went to a boarding school far from my family. I often flew alone when school started and ended. Sometimes I felt lonely, so I asked the flight attendants if I could help serve meals to passengers, and some of them let me. This experience stayed in my mind when I wanted to leave my banking job and find a new path.

At the interview for the flight attendant position, there were many young people, and many of us were hired. Most of us had good qualifications and were changing careers. Before the interview, I practiced what to say. I didn’t just say I loved to travel, like everyone else. Instead, I talked about my skills and past work experience, and I got the job!

I would recommend this job to anyone because there are many reasons to enjoy it, but the free flights are not the best part. Most airline staff work very hard, and there is a saying: “No one is finished until everyone is finished.” It feels like a big family. Even if we don’t see each other all the time, we are still close.

When I am not working, I don’t have to take my work home. If I do have difficult passengers, which is rare, I know the flight will end soon, and I probably won’t see them again!"
119,"At the summer camp where I work, I really enjoy watching the children succeed at things they never thought they could do. Most of the children already know how to swim and play table tennis before they arrive, but rock climbing is a new experience for many of them. Some children feel very nervous, but after some encouragement, they agree to try, and in the end, they all reach the top. This makes them feel great.

At the beginning of the week, some children miss home. It is not the younger ones who feel this way the most; it is usually the ten- to thirteen-year-olds. We do not allow them to use their mobile phones all the time. First, we tell them they can call home after lunch. When they ask again, usually after dinner, we say it is too late to call now and suggest they do it tomorrow. Most children feel better in a couple of days, and by the end of their week, they all come to us and thank us because they have had a great time.

It is not only the children who feel lonely. Sometimes, parents call us all the time to ask how their child is doing, which is not necessary. Often, their son or daughter is busy playing games or doing other activities, so we have to tell the parents to call back later.

We also see a certain type of child who comes to camp, usually dressed in expensive new clothes. These children often argue when we ask them to change into something more suitable, but soon they understand why it is important."
120,"Text: 'Rock the Planet is a musical show where the actors also need to be good musicians. It opened in London last year after being in the USA for five years, where it won the title of ‘Best Musical’ four times! However, putting on the show with an all-British cast was not easy. The UK has more rules about how many performances young actors can do each week compared to the USA, where they can perform more often. Because of this, they needed twice as many actors in the UK. Fortunately, the director found many talented actors from the UK, and they have just won their first ‘Best Musical’ award. 

The theatre in London is bigger than the one in the USA, and it has been full every night, with many people wanting to hear the songs that became popular in America. I met Jamie, an 11-year-old actor in the show. He said, ‘It’s amazing that I get paid to play, especially with a beautiful and expensive Gibson guitar.’ He shared how busy the young actors are. ‘We have regular school lessons at the theatre every day. The teacher is great, but I miss my old school friends.’ 

I asked Jamie what his classmates thought of the show. He replied, ‘My whole class came! The theatre offers special ticket deals for schools. They loved it, and that made me feel really confident. My parents come when they can, but it’s expensive for them.’ When I mentioned that I also play guitar, Jamie found a spare one and invited me to play with him and the other young actors. We played a song called Days, which I didn’t know. Jamie helped me learn it, and I felt proud when I finally got it right. I was impressed by Jamie’s talent and wished I had similar skills. I was just trying to keep up and was glad the show’s director wasn’t there to hear my mistakes!

Although the young actors were already musicians, some playing several instruments, none had played in a band before. Luckily, they found it quite easy. Jamie said the hardest part was looking natural when they first performed together. They were so focused that they forgot to smile! The show will be in London for another year, and it is definitely worth seeing.'"
