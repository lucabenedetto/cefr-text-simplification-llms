1,"Some time ago, a website warned about the dangers of public check-ins, which are online announcements of where you are. The website's message was clear: while you might think you are simply saying, ""I’m at this place,"" you are also letting many people know your location, including those you might not want to meet. This reflects a growing understanding that sharing everything online can have negative consequences. The internet offers many exciting opportunities to share our lives with a global audience, which can lead to wealth and fame. However, as we share personal stories and photos, we may find ourselves in a crowded and risky environment.

This situation may seem discouraging, but there is hope. The future has been mapped out for us by early internet pioneers. In the beginning, these individuals explored the internet and identified its dangers. They faced job losses, changes in friendships, and the challenges of fame long before social media existed. These early bloggers have experienced what many of us are now facing, and it is valuable to learn from their experiences. As the saying goes, those who do not learn from history are likely to repeat it.

In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started posting on the World Wide Web, which was mainly used by graduate students and scientists. The web was created at CERN, a physics lab in Switzerland, to help researchers share their work. Hall saw a different opportunity: to share his life. He created a complex online autobiography filled with his thoughts, photos, and art. In January 1996, he began a daily blog, attracting many readers who were fascinated by his bold exploration of this new medium. Hall was open about everything; no topic was off-limits. While some might see this as attention-seeking behavior, there was also a unique beauty to his work that many would consider art.

However, one day, visitors to Hall’s site found it replaced by a single, emotional video titled ""Dark Night."" He revealed that he had fallen deeply in love, but when he wrote about it online, he was told, ""either the blog goes, or I do."" Hall felt that sharing his life online made people distrust him. The blog ended, but the issue remains. Sharing online can be wonderful, but if you think that sharing your life will make people want to be around you, you might be disappointed.

In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a young woman in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job at a software company. One day, an anonymous coworker shared her blog's address with the company's vice presidents, including some she had criticized, which led to her losing her job. Researchers studying online behavior have a term for this: the ""online distribution effect,"" which describes how people often feel they can say things online that they would never say in person. However, the internet is not a separate reality where we can speak freely without consequences. Our online lives are connected to our real lives, and ignoring this can lead to serious mistakes.

Armstrong's story had a positive outcome. Although she was upset and stopped blogging for a while, she eventually got married and restarted her blog, focusing on her new family. Today, she is a well-known ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing supports her family. Once a symbol of the risks of online sharing, she has become skilled at revealing just enough about herself. Armstrong's experience teaches us an important lesson: while the internet allows us to say anything, that doesn’t mean we should."
2,"Some scientists recently started a campaign to warn people about a low-budget film called *What the Bleep Do We Know?* This film mixes documentary and drama to suggest that there is much we do not understand about our universe. While scientists can sometimes be arrogant, even the most confident physicist would not claim to know everything about the cosmos. However, some scientists felt it was necessary to publicly criticize the film, calling it everything from ""atrocious"" to ""very dangerous."" This made me curious to see the movie.

At first, I did not understand the controversy. Various scientists made harmless statements about how new discoveries are showing that the universe is stranger than we thought. It was only when the film discussed specific discoveries that I began to understand the concern—like the claim that water molecules can be influenced by thoughts. I had heard about a Japanese researcher who suggested that the shape of a water molecule could change based on the thoughts of people nearby. However, the film only provided images of ice crystals that looked beautiful after being spoken to positively and ugly after being exposed to negative emotions. Many people find this kind of evidence convincing because it is simple and easy to understand. However, scientists typically respond with skepticism.

I understand their reaction. The idea that thoughts can affect water is fascinating and suggests new forces in the universe. But before we accept such claims, we need solid evidence. Beautiful pictures of crystals are not enough. The real issue is that the movie's claims were not strange enough. For example, water molecules might have properties linked to a mysterious energy that could be driving the expansion of the universe. This idea is supported by decades of research from laboratories and observatories worldwide.

In reality, discoveries are being made that confirm the film's claim that the universe is stranger than we ever imagined. Astronomers have discovered that the universe contains an unknown type of matter and is expanding due to a mysterious force called ""dark energy."" Additionally, neuroscientists have found that our awareness of events is delayed by about half a second, a delay we do not notice because our brains edit it out. Anthropologists believe they have identified where modern humans originated and how they spread across the globe. Some theorists even suggest connections between life on Earth and the fundamental structure of the universe.

Despite what some may think, science is far from complete. In fact, we seem to be further from knowing everything than ever before. Many natural phenomena may never be fully understood. The ideas of chaos and quantum uncertainty have shown that there are limits to what we can know. This has led some of the world's top theoretical physicists to work on a ""Theory of Everything,"" which aims to explain all the forces and particles in the universe with a single equation. Ultimately, many of us believe that the universe can be described in one word: incredible."
3,"To put it simply, I find writing novels challenging, while writing short stories is a joy. If writing novels is like planting a forest, then writing short stories is more like planting a garden. Both processes work together to create a beautiful landscape that I cherish. The trees provide shade, and the wind rustles their leaves, which can turn a bright gold. In the garden, flowers bloom, and their colorful petals attract bees and butterflies, showing the gentle change of seasons.

Since I started my career as a fiction writer, I have often switched between writing novels and short stories. My routine is this: after finishing a novel, I want to write short stories; after completing a set of short stories, I feel ready to focus on a novel. I never write short stories while working on a novel, and I don’t write a novel while working on short stories. The two types of writing likely use different parts of my brain, and it takes time to switch from one to the other.

I began my career with two short novels in 1975, and from 1984 to 1985, I started writing short stories. I knew little about writing short stories then, so it was challenging, but I found the experience very memorable. I felt my fictional world expand, and readers seemed to enjoy this different side of my writing. One of my early works, “Breaking Waves,” was included in my first short-story collection, Tales from Abroad. This marked my beginning as a short-story writer.

One of the joys of writing short stories is that they don’t take long to complete. Usually, it takes me about a week to shape a short story (though revisions can take longer). It’s not the same level of commitment as writing a novel, which can take a year or two. I can go into a room, finish my work, and leave. Writing a novel can feel endless, and I sometimes wonder if I will make it through. Therefore, writing short stories provides a necessary change of pace.

Another nice thing about short stories is that you can create a story from the smallest ideas—like a thought, a word, or an image. Often, it feels like jazz improvisation, where the story leads me where it wants to go. Plus, with short stories, you don’t have to worry about failing. If an idea doesn’t work out, you can simply accept it and move on. Even great writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver didn’t write a masterpiece every time. This thought comforts me. You can learn from your mistakes and use that knowledge in your next story.

When I write novels, I try to learn from both the successes and failures I experience in writing short stories. In this way, short stories serve as a kind of experimental space for me as a novelist. It is hard to experiment in the same way within a novel, so without short stories, writing novels would be even more difficult.

My short stories are like soft shadows I have left in the world, faint traces of my thoughts. I remember exactly where I placed each one and how I felt at that moment. Short stories are like guideposts to my heart, and it makes me happy as a writer to share these personal feelings with my readers."
4,"At its core, science is closely related to philosophy, but it also has practical applications, such as curing diseases. Science has improved our lives but also poses risks. It seeks to understand everything from tiny atoms to the vast universe, yet it often struggles to do so. Science influences poets, politicians, philosophers, and even frauds. Its beauty is often recognized only by those who study it deeply, while its dangers are frequently misunderstood. People have both overestimated and underestimated its significance, and the mistakes made by scientists are sometimes overlooked or exaggerated.

The history of science is marked by constant conflict. Established theories are often revised or completely replaced, similar to how new music styles are initially mocked before becoming accepted. This struggle between old and new ideas is rarely respectful. Scientists can be driven by jealousy and anger. The history of science is essentially a history of conflict.

This book will explore scientific ideas that have significantly impacted not just science, but also broader human thought. While science has practical uses, our focus will be on its ideas—appreciating their beauty and being ready to question them. We must recognize both the creativity and the limitations of human understanding. Science is inherently changeable; there is always a scientist challenging previous explanations. Most of the time, these changes do not disrupt society, but sometimes they can challenge our established beliefs.

For example, in the seventeenth century, science introduced the idea of a mechanical universe, like a giant clock. Three hundred years later, physics began to question fundamental ideas, leading us to a complex understanding where our observations can influence the universe, and we struggle to grasp the true meaning of basic concepts. Some view the instability of scientific theories as a sign that science cannot explain the universe. However, scientific changes often enhance our ability to understand and predict natural phenomena. Isaac Newton, a seventeenth-century scientist, explained much more than the ancient Greek thinker Aristotle, and Albert Einstein, the founder of modern physics, built on Newton's work.

Science may falter, but it continues to progress. It is important to remember that at the end of the nineteenth century, many physicists believed there was little left to discover. Then came breakthroughs like radioactivity, X-rays, the electron, and many new particles, along with concepts like quantum mechanics and relativity. Biology has also made significant advancements. Currently, some claim we are close to a ""theory of everything,"" a complete understanding of the universe's origins and workings.

Science is not just an academic exercise. Over the last two centuries, we have shifted from merely observing nature to influencing it, sometimes disrupting its balance in ways we do not fully understand. It is crucial for non-scientists to engage with scientific developments, as these will shape the world their children will live in. Science is now a key part of how humanity envisions and shapes its future. The implications of scientific advancements can impact everything from government budgets to the health of future generations and the long-term survival of life on Earth."
5,"From around 2015, after many years of growth, major publishers began to notice that ebook sales had leveled off or even declined in some cases. This raised new doubts about the long-term future of ebooks in the publishing industry. One anonymous publishing executive recently admitted that the excitement around ebooks may have led to poor investments, causing his company to lose faith in the value of printed books. Despite the clear idea that digital and print books can coexist, the question of whether ebooks will replace print books continues to arise. Whether people are trying to predict or dismiss this possibility, the idea of books disappearing still sparks our imagination and leads to intense discussions. 

Why is this idea so compelling? Why do we see the relationship between ebooks and print books as a battle, even when evidence suggests otherwise? The answers to these questions go beyond ebooks and reveal much about our mixed feelings of excitement and fear regarding innovation and change. In my research, I have explored how the notion of one medium replacing another often follows the introduction of new technologies. Even before digital technologies emerged, critics predicted the end of existing media. For example, after television was invented, many believed radio would vanish. However, radio adapted and found new ways to be used, such as in cars and factories. 

The idea of books disappearing is not new either. As early as 1894, people speculated that the phonograph would replace books with what we now call audiobooks. This pattern has repeated itself with movies, radio, television, hyperlinks, and smartphones, all of which have been thought to threaten print books as cultural sources. Some argued that the end of books would lead to cultural decline, while others, imagining a perfect digital future, exaggerated the benefits of ebooks. 

The idea of the death of the book often arises during times of technological change. This narrative reflects our mixed feelings about such changes. To understand why these feelings are so common, we must recognize that we form emotional connections with different media as they become part of our lives. Many studies show that we develop strong attachments to objects like books, televisions, and computers, even naming our cars or expressing frustration at our laptops. Therefore, when new technologies like e-readers emerge, they not only signal economic and social change but also force us to rethink our relationship with things that have become essential to our daily lives. 

As technology evolves, we often yearn for what we once knew but no longer have. This longing is why industries develop around retro products and older technologies. For instance, the spread of the printing press in 15th-century Europe led people to seek original manuscripts. The transition from silent to sound movies in the 1920s created nostalgia for the earlier format. The same occurred with the shift from analog to digital photography and from vinyl records to CDs. Unsurprisingly, e-readers have sparked a renewed appreciation for the physical qualities of traditional books, even their distinct smell. 

This should reassure those who worry about the decline of print books. However, the idea of disappearing media will continue to be an attractive story about the power of technology and our resistance to change. One way we cope with change is by using familiar narrative patterns, such as stories of tragedy and endings. These narratives are easy to remember and share, reflecting both our excitement for the future and our fear of losing parts of our familiar world—and ultimately, ourselves."
6,"For a year and a half, I woke up every weekday at 5:30 AM. I brushed my teeth, made coffee, and wrote about how some of the greatest thinkers of the last four hundred years managed their time to do their best work. I focused on the everyday details of their lives—when they slept, ate, worked, and worried—to offer a fresh perspective on their personalities and careers. I wanted to show that these creative individuals were just like us, with their own habits.

The French writer Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin once said, “Tell me what you eat, and I shall tell you what you are.” I would say, “Tell me what time you eat and if you take a nap afterward.” This book may seem superficial because it looks at the conditions for creativity rather than the creative works themselves. However, it is also personal. The novelist John Cheever believed that even a simple business letter reveals something about the writer. I share similar concerns: How can you do meaningful creative work while making a living? Is it better to focus entirely on one project or to work a little each day? When time is limited, do you have to give up things like sleep or a clean house, or can you learn to do more in less time?

I do not claim to answer these questions definitively; some may only be resolved through personal compromise. Instead, I provide examples of how many successful people have faced similar challenges. I wanted to illustrate how big creative ideas can be broken down into small daily actions and how one’s habits can affect their work.

The title of the book is Daily Rituals, but I really focused on people’s routines. Routines can seem ordinary and thoughtless, like being on autopilot. However, a good routine can help you use limited resources like time, willpower, and optimism effectively. A solid routine creates a path for your mental energy and helps manage your moods. The psychologist William James believed that putting parts of your life on autopilot through good habits allows us to focus on more interesting activities. Ironically, he struggled with procrastination and could not stick to a regular schedule.

Interestingly, it was a moment of procrastination that inspired this book. One Sunday afternoon, while working at a small architecture magazine, I was supposed to write a story due the next day. Instead of working, I found myself tidying my workspace and making coffee. As a morning person, I could focus well in the early hours but struggled after lunch. To feel better about this, I started looking online for information about other writers’ schedules. I found many entertaining stories and thought it would be great to collect them, which led to the Daily Routines blog I started that day and now this book.

The blog was informal; I shared descriptions of people’s routines from biographies and articles. For the book, I gathered a much larger and better-researched collection while trying to keep the variety of voices that made the blog enjoyable. I let my subjects speak for themselves through quotes from their letters, diaries, and interviews. In some cases, I summarized their routines from other sources. I must acknowledge that this book would not have been possible without the research of many biographers, journalists, and scholars. I have listed all my sources in the Notes section, which I hope will guide further reading."
7,"Howard became a palaeontologist because of a change in interest rates when he was six years old. His father, who was careful with money and had a big mortgage, said that their planned holiday to Spain was no longer possible. Instead, they rented a chalet on the English coast. One rainy August afternoon, Howard found an ammonite on the beach. He had always wanted to be a palaeontologist, and by the end of university, he knew what kind he wanted to be. He was particularly interested in the very beginnings of life, rather than the more famous periods like the Jurassic or dinosaurs. He studied small, delicate creatures found in grey rocks.

As he finished his doctoral thesis, he wondered if he would get a job, especially in the kind of institution he wanted. He was confident in his abilities, but he knew that deserving a job does not always guarantee getting one. When a position for an Assistant Lectureship at Tavistock College in London opened up, he applied, though he did not expect much.

On the day of Howard’s interview, the professor who was supposed to lead the panel had a fight with his wife. He left home upset, crashed his car into a gatepost, and ended up in the hospital. The interview went ahead without him, and a colleague who did not like Howard’s original professor took his place. This colleague was able to help Howard get the job, even though Howard was surprised by this unexpected support. He was grateful but later learned that it was not purely his qualifications that won him the position. 

Despite this, what mattered most to Howard was that he had the job and could do the work he loved. He often compared the organized nature of his professional life, where he could plan and pursue scientific truth, with the chaos of personal life. He realized that many people could influence his life, sometimes in unexpected ways. For example, when his briefcase, containing notes for a lecture, was stolen at an Underground station, he was very upset. He returned to college, called to postpone the lecture, reported the theft, and then went for a coffee.

While there, he met a colleague who was hosting a curator from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. Howard learned about a new collection of fossils that had not yet been studied, which would become his biggest challenge and secure his future in his profession. If it weren’t for the theft and that kind stranger, he might not have discovered this opportunity. Within half an hour, he changed his plans. He decided not to attend a conference in Stockholm or take students on a field trip to Scotland. Instead, he would find a way to visit the museum in Nairobi."
8,"Charles Spence is willing to try almost any food. He mentions that he has ice cream made from bee larvae at home, which may look like maggots but supposedly taste ""slightly nutty and floral."" One of Spence's goals is to make eating insects more acceptable. As a Professor of Experimental Psychology at Oxford University, he studies how our senses work together to shape our experience of taste. His research influences what we eat and drink, from large food companies to high-end restaurant menus.

Spence and his colleagues study how various factors affect our perception of food. For example, who we eat with, how food is presented, the colors and textures of plates and utensils, and even background noise can change how we taste food. In his book, *The Perfect Meal*, co-authored with Betina Piqueras-Fiszman, Spence shares interesting findings about dining. For instance, the first person to order in a group tends to enjoy their meal more, and we eat about 35% more food when dining with one other person, and 75% more with three others.

Spence's lab in Oxford is quite simple, filled with basic equipment. He has soundproof booths and older audio-visual tools. By keeping costs low, he can collaborate with chefs who may not have the funds for research. Much of his work is supported by a large food company. He notes that in the past, research funded by the industry was often looked down upon in universities. However, since the government now requires universities to show their work has real-world impact, this type of research has become more valued.

Currently, Spence is helping well-known brands reduce salt and sugar in their products, which is important for keeping customers healthy. Interestingly, many companies make these changes slowly so that consumers do not notice the difference. Spence explains that when people are informed about these changes, they tend to focus more on the taste and often dislike it.

Spence first met the famous experimental chef Heston Blumenthal while working on a project for a food company. At that time, people thought combining science and food was unappealing, even though food is inherently scientific. Blumenthal's collaboration with Spence led to the creation of the ""Sound of the Sea"" dish in his restaurant. Spence points out that similar ideas were explored by early 20th-century Italian futurists, but they did not become popular.

Now, the food industry is applying Spence's research on sensory experiences to many products. For example, he has found that higher-pitched music can make food taste sweeter, while lower-pitched sounds can make it taste bitter. An airline is planning to match music with the meals served to passengers, and a well-known brand recently launched an app that plays music while ice cream melts, although they did not match the music to the taste.

What are dinner parties like at Spence's home? One time, they had rabbit served with the fur still on the cutlery. Another time, they experimented with remote-controlled, colorful light bulbs. They have even hosted dinner parties with tone generators, headphones, and various drinks to see how different pitches affect taste. For Spence, home, sweet shops, food conventions, and international gastronomy conferences are all extensions of his research lab."
9,"Our brains are more active than ever. We are overwhelmed with facts, false information, chatter, and rumors, all pretending to be useful information. We must sort through this to find what we need and what we can ignore. At the same time, we are doing more tasks ourselves. Thirty years ago, travel agents booked our flights and salespeople helped us find items in stores. Now, we handle most of these tasks on our own. We are trying to manage the responsibilities of many people while also keeping up with our lives, families, careers, hobbies, and favorite TV shows. Our smartphones help us fit as much as possible into every free moment. 

However, there is a problem. Although we believe we are multitasking—doing several things at once—this is a misleading idea. Earl Miller, a neuroscientist at MIT, explains that our brains are not designed to multitask effectively. When we think we are multitasking, we are actually switching quickly between tasks. Each time we switch, it costs us mental energy. Instead of being expert jugglers, we are more like amateur plate spinners, hurriedly moving from one task to another, worried that we will drop something important. 

Even though we think we are accomplishing a lot, multitasking actually makes us less efficient. It has been shown to increase stress hormones, which can lead to mental confusion. Multitasking creates a desire for constant stimulation, rewarding our brains for losing focus. Additionally, the prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain we need to concentrate, is easily distracted by new things, like shiny objects that attract children. 

This is ironic because the very part of our brain we rely on to stay focused is easily sidetracked. Just the chance to multitask can harm our ability to think clearly. Glenn Wilson, a former psychology professor, calls this problem ""info-mania."" His research found that trying to focus on a task while seeing an unread email can lower our effective IQ by almost 10 points. The cognitive losses from multitasking are even worse than those caused by tiredness. 

Russ Poldrack, a neuroscientist at Stanford, discovered that learning new information while multitasking can lead to that information being stored incorrectly in the brain. For example, if students do homework while watching TV, the information from their studies goes to a part of the brain meant for skills, rather than the part that organizes facts. Without distractions, the information is stored properly, making it easier to remember later. 

Moreover, multitasking often involves making decisions, like whether to reply to a text or ignore it. Decision-making is also taxing for our brains, and small decisions use the same mental resources as big ones. After making many small choices, we can become mentally exhausted and make poor decisions about important matters. 

In discussions about information overload with business leaders and scientists, email is frequently mentioned as a problem. It is not that email itself is bad, but rather the overwhelming amount of communication we receive. When a 10-year-old boy was asked what his father does for work, he said, ""He answers emails."" His father admitted that this was quite accurate. We feel we must respond to emails, but it often seems impossible to do so while completing other tasks."
10,"In a zoo in Sweden, a chimpanzee named Santino spent his nights breaking concrete into pieces to throw at visitors during the day. Was he acting out of spite? In caves in the US, female bats help unrelated fruit bat mothers if they struggle to give birth. Are they being caring? Fifty years ago, these questions were often ignored. Animals displayed behaviors that led to measurable results, and scientists focused on those results. The idea that animals have thoughts, feelings, and moral systems was considered sentimental and unscientific. However, this view has started to change. Research on the behavior of bats, chimpanzees, rats, dolphins, and chickens has begun to explore animal emotions, a topic that was once avoided. This shift has influenced popular science books like Mark Bekoff’s ""Wild Justice"" and Victoria Braithwaite’s ""Do Fish Feel Pain?"". This change has sparked a debate that may never be resolved: do animals have consciousness? This leads to another important question about conscience, which is a person's sense of right and wrong that influences their actions. 

In a recent experiment with cows, those that opened a locked gate to get food showed more joy—by jumping and kicking—than those that had the gate opened for them. If this research suggests that cows enjoy solving problems, what does that mean for how we produce and consume beef? While the observations are clear, their meanings are debated. Dr. Jonathan Balcombe, author of ""Second Nature,"" argues that the logical response to this research is to stop eating meat. He believes humanity is on the brink of a major ethical change, similar to the abolition of slavery. Aubrey Manning, a professor at Edinburgh University, thinks we should reconsider our understanding of animal intelligence, suggesting that animals have a simpler version of a theory of mind. Professor Euan MacPhail believes we should avoid attributing human-like thoughts to animals. These three perspectives may never agree because the core issue is not just scientific or moral, but philosophical. Since defining consciousness is very difficult, can we ever truly understand what it is like to be a bat, as philosopher Thomas Nagel asks?

Balcombe describes a significant experiment he conducted that suggests starlings, a type of bird, can experience depression. In a study at Newcastle University, starlings were divided into two groups. One group lived in spacious, comfortable cages, while the other lived in small, bare cages. Initially, both groups learned to eat only from a box with tasty worms. However, when only unpleasant worms were offered, only the starlings in the comfortable cages would eat. Balcombe concluded that living in a poor environment made the starlings pessimistic about life. Balcombe, who has worked with animal rights organizations, has a clear bias. He states, “We look back with horror at a time of racism. Our views on animals will eventually be the same. We cannot support animal rights while eating a cheeseburger.” If he were the only one with this view on animal consciousness, it might be easy to dismiss him as extreme. However, Professor Aubrey Manning shares similar views. Manning has written a textbook called ""An Introduction to Animal Behaviour."" He notes, “What we are witnessing is a shift in perspective. At the start of the 20th century, some believed animals thought like us, leading to a backlash. Now, we are moving back toward recognizing animal thoughts. But this is a contentious topic, and it’s important to listen carefully to academics with strong opinions.”"
11,"Critical thinking, also known as analytical thinking, is how we engage with what we read or hear to gain a deeper understanding. Adrian West, a research director at the Edward de Bono Foundation in the U.K., notes that many believe arguing is a way to discover the truth. While technology helps us store and process vast amounts of information, there are growing worries that it is changing how we tackle complex problems and making it harder to think deeply. West points out that we are often exposed to poor but appealing ideas, trends, and opinions, which can overwhelm our ability to reason. Ironically, having more data does not necessarily lead to better knowledge or decision-making. West highlights that the quality of our thinking has not improved much despite the increase in information.

According to the National Endowment for the Arts, literary reading has dropped by 10 percentage points, and this decline is speeding up. Patricia Greenfield, a psychology professor in Los Angeles, believes that the rise of visual media has a cost. She suggests that the decrease in reading may be linked to a decline in critical thinking, as people focus more on real-time media and multitasking instead of concentrating on one task.

However, there is no clear answer on how technology impacts critical thinking. The presence of technology has complicated the situation, making it hard for scholars to rely on previous beliefs. It is tempting to see computers, video games, and the internet as either entirely good or bad, but the truth is they can be both, and different technologies can lead to different outcomes. For instance, a video game might encourage critical thinking or hinder it. Reading online can improve analytical skills, but constantly clicking on links may prevent deeper thinking.

Greenfield, who has studied over 50 research papers on learning and technology, states that technology changes how people think. She observes that reading fosters imagination and critical thinking in ways that visual media, like video games and television, do not. Reading helps develop imagination, reflection, and vocabulary. However, she also notes that visual media can enhance certain types of information processing. Unfortunately, most visual media are fast-paced and do not allow time for reflection or deep thought. As a result, many, especially younger individuals, may not reach their full potential.

Society's views on technology significantly influence how it perceives critical thinking. This is especially evident in the debate over video games and cognitive development. James Paul Gee, an educational psychology professor, argues that video games are often misunderstood. While many believe they are harmful to children, he claims they can be valuable learning tools. Evidence suggests that video games can help develop better reasoning skills. Games like Sim City and Civilization teach decision-making and analytical skills in engaging, realistic environments. These games also allow players to explore ideas that might otherwise be difficult to access.

In the digital age, as reading and math scores decline, it is essential to examine technology closely and understand its complex effects on thinking and analysis."
12,"When Matthew Crawford is not thinking and writing about how we should live, he works as a motorcycle mechanic. He chose this job after becoming unhappy with office work and his role in social policy. His first book praised the value of manual trades, while his latest book discusses how to deal with modern life. He was inspired to write it when he noticed advertisements appearing on a credit card machine during a brief moment of waiting. Crawford realized that these distractions are becoming harder to escape. What we choose to focus on at any moment is very personal, but we are often unaware of how outside influences affect our choices. It is increasingly difficult to think clearly or remember conversations. To avoid constant interruptions, people tend to isolate themselves and may even stop engaging in simple interactions, like talking to strangers. Crawford points out that we often experience the world through various media, such as video games and apps, which can manipulate our desires and take control of our attention.

Crawford is not alone in his concerns. Many office workers complain about being overwhelmed by emails, yet they often spend their free time checking them. Research shows that our attention can easily drift if a phone is visible nearby. Although there is no scientific proof yet that our attention spans have changed, people have worried about this since the invention of the telegraph in 1837. It is clear, however, that we are more aware of other activities we could be doing. While it might seem that technology is the main issue, Crawford believes it has simply provided a way for us to focus on ourselves. With so many choices available, our self-control is challenged, which affects our social interactions. For example, we might prefer to text a friend instead of having a conversation. By interacting with representations of people rather than real individuals, Crawford warns that we risk losing something essential in our society.

He also notes that screens are not the only problem. For instance, in his gym, there used to be one shared music player, which could lead to disagreements over music choices. Now, people listen to their own music through earbuds, and the gym has lost its social atmosphere. Genuine connections often arise from conflicts, such as discussing different tastes in music.

Crawford suggests a two-part solution. First, we need to manage noise and distractions in public spaces. More importantly, he believes we should engage in skilled activities that connect us to the real world. He cites cooks, ice hockey players, and motorcycle racers as examples of people whose jobs require them to interact with physical reality. No virtual experience can match the sensation of a hockey puck on ice or the feel of gravel under motorcycle tires. These roles demand good judgment and the ability to share space with others. Crawford argues that when we engage with the world in this way, we see manufactured experiences for what they are: poor substitutes for real involvement. This does not mean everyone should become a chef, but it highlights the importance of using our judgment in daily life. There are many benefits to this approach, including professional satisfaction. Constantly fighting distractions can be tiring and make it harder to focus on what truly matters. In contrast, practicing attention on one thing can help us pay better attention to everything else."

""What do you do for a living?"" This is a common question in small talk, and we often define ourselves by our jobs. However, as a philosopher, I find it a bit more complicated. Saying I am a philosopher can sound pretentious. It feels more acceptable to say I study or teach philosophy, but claiming to be a philosopher might suggest I have special knowledge or insight that others do not. This idea is misleading; philosophers are just like everyone else, but this stereotype makes me cautious.

So, why do people have this view of philosophers? One reason is that philosophers are seen as people who evaluate the actions of others and value intellectual life. The Greek philosopher Aristotle believed that a life focused on contemplation, or philosophical thinking, was the best kind of life. While few modern philosophers fully agree with this, philosophy is still associated with deep thinking.

Another Greek philosopher, Socrates, said that ""the unexamined life is not worth living,"" meaning that simply accepting societal norms without questioning them leads to an unsatisfying life. Our ability to reflect on the world gives us control over our lives and helps us make our own choices. However, living an examined life does not require extensive reading of philosophical texts or a life dedicated solely to intellectual pursuits. It simply means paying closer attention to our everyday experiences to ensure they are meaningful. 

Living an examined life does not mean being isolated from society. In fact, for this kind of life to guide individuals, it should be practical and knowledge should be shared, as it is vital for a good life. This brings me to another reason why people misunderstand philosophers: academic philosophy has become more disconnected from real-life experiences, especially for those without formal training. This is not entirely the philosophers' fault; university funding and evaluations are linked to expensive academic journals, making it hard for philosophers to share their ideas with anyone outside their small group of experts. As a result, philosophy can seem distant from everyday life.

While some philosophers have tried to challenge this view, many have accepted it. The academic environment has created a sense of isolation, and as philosophy has become more focused on specific technical debates, it has become difficult for those outside the field to understand. In some cases, philosophy has even withdrawn from society. This trend needs to change.

I often call myself an ""ethicist"" because most of my work is in ethics, which is the area of philosophy that examines human actions. Recently, I have felt that this title does not fully capture my work, as ethics is often linked to formal rules and values. There is a new development in philosophical thinking: ethics is now often seen as applied ethics, which looks at the fairness of specific social practices. The role of an ethicist today is to determine if certain actions are ethical or acceptable. These are important questions that I explore regularly.

However, philosophy is more than just this. A typical discussion might start by asking if illegally downloading movies is unethical (it is) and then move on to deeper questions about responsibility, our views on art, and the impact of consumerism. In this way, philosophy encourages people to examine the practices and behaviors that shape their lives. Sometimes this examination confirms what we already know; other times, it reveals that our beliefs are difficult to justify. Regardless, by exploring these ideas, we contribute to the benefit of everyone."
14,"Food lovers, chefs, and anyone who enjoys food might think that thinking deeply about what and how we eat can enhance our enjoyment of food. However, throughout history, discussions about food in philosophy have often been secondary to other philosophical topics. When philosophers discuss eating, it often serves as a metaphor for something else, like gaining knowledge. Sometimes, there are philosophical discussions that seem to be about food, but a closer look shows they are exploring different, loosely related ideas.

One interesting example is the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus, who promoted the idea of seeking pleasure and avoiding pain in various aspects of life. Despite this, Epicurus is often associated with a love for food and drink, as seen in restaurant names and food websites. Businesses likely hope to benefit from this connection to a famous philosopher.

Food is inherently social and cultural. The food we eat comes from historical backgrounds and is shared within our communities. These communities provide us with dining partners and the systems that grow and distribute food. We interact with food more often and in more essential ways than with any other product, making it a clear subject for philosophical exploration.

Once food is prepared, critics begin to discuss and write about it. But why do these critics hold such a special status? One philosopher pointed out that tasting food is not a unique skill; rather, influential food critics are simply better at describing flavors. This area has been overlooked in philosophy, as most studies on perception focus on vision, which should change.

Another important aspect of food is its aesthetics. We often describe paintings or music as beautiful, but we rarely talk about the taste of food in the same way. Some philosophers argue that, with the growth of modern gastronomy, food deserves a place in discussions about beauty alongside art forms like sculpture or poetry. However, food is consumed and disappears when enjoyed, unlike art, which remains. Aesthetic objects need to last over time, so it is incorrect to think of food as having aesthetic value.

There are also many ethical questions related to food. We can ask what we should eat: organic, free-range, locally grown, vegetarian, or non-genetically modified foods? Our answers often reflect our ethical beliefs, and philosophers will question why we hold these beliefs, making such discussions about food worthwhile.

Another topic is the difference between cooking at home and in restaurants. Home cooks have a special responsibility to their guests, based on love and friendship. In a home kitchen, everyone is included as we share food and companionship. In contrast, professional cooks have responsibilities to their employers and the food itself. Their kitchens are not open to everyone, but only to those who are qualified, and their relationships are more about colleagues than friends.

A recent essay called ""Diplomacy of the Dish"" explores how food and dining can help bridge cultural divides. This happens in two ways: first, by learning to appreciate other cultures through their food, and second, by building personal connections with people from different cultures through shared meals—a practice with a long history in international diplomacy. The essay is filled with delightful examples and stories that make this aspect of food philosophy engaging for readers."
15,"Rob Daviau, from the United States, creates ‘legacy’ board games. He felt that the traditional board games he enjoyed as a child were no longer fun or challenging, so he began to think about how board games could change. He wondered if they could have a storyline and if choices made in one game could affect future games. He took a classic game called Risk and made a new version called Risk Legacy. For the first time, decisions made during the game had lasting effects. Players might have to tear up cards, mark the board, or open packets with new rules at important moments. The games are played over a set number of sessions, and long-standing rivalries become part of the game. Daviau explained, “You could point to the board and say: ‘Right here! You did this!’”

Daviau was later invited to work on a legacy version of Pandemic, a very popular cooperative board game where players try to cure diseases that threaten humanity. His next project was a game called SeaFall. While Pandemic Legacy received great praise, SeaFall was seen as a true test of the legacy format because it was the first game that did not build on an earlier version. Set in the age of sailing (16th to mid-19th century), players become sailors exploring a new world. Designers of legacy board games must think about all possible player choices to keep the story coherent. To do this, they use testers to see how the games play out. Jaime Barriga, a play-tester for SeaFall, said, “It takes a huge amount of time. The first few games might go perfectly, but then after four or five games, it can start to fall apart, and by game six, it might be broken. Then you have to go back and fix everything.”

Legacy board games were not expected to become very popular. When he was developing the idea, Daviau thought it would appeal to a small group of people. He said, “I thought it was really different and pretty good, but it’s unusual and breaks many rules. I expected it to be successful with just a few people. I thought I would be known as the guy who did this strange project.” However, many players, like Russell Chapman, loved the idea. He believes it is one of the biggest advancements in game design in recent years. He said, “It brings a new level of commitment, intensity, and excitement. There’s nothing more thrilling for a board gamer than learning a new game or a new way to play, and you get that constantly with legacy games.”

Another fan, Ben Hogg, said that the excitement of an unfolding story outweighed any worries about the game’s longevity. He mentioned, “At first, I was worried about making changes and possibly ruining my board, but that concern was eased by Pandemic Legacy. Most people don’t go to the cinema to watch the same movie twice, do they? You’re buying into an experience. It adds a storytelling aspect similar to video games.” The legacy format is influenced not only by video games but also by the demand for episodic entertainment from popular TV shows. While in college, Daviau wanted to be a television writer but later moved into advertising and game design. Still, he loved telling stories.

Matt Leacock, the creator of Pandemic, compares the legacy design process to writing a novel. He said, “You need to know how you want it to end and have a good idea of where to start, but just having an outline is not enough.” While Daviau feels a sense of ownership over the idea, he is curious to see how others will develop it. However, he also tries to downplay its importance, thinking that gamers will soon ask, “What’s next?” Colby Dauch, the studio manager for the publisher of SeaFall, is less certain. He believes the legacy format has changed how people think about board games."
16,"One night not long ago, an octopus named Inky escaped from his tank at New Zealand’s National Aquarium. He crawled across the floor and squeezed into a narrow drain that led to the Pacific Ocean. This story, which sounds like something from a children’s movie, became popular online. Part of the enjoyment of such escape stories, which also include animals like rats and llamas, is the idea that animals are similar to us. This is especially true for octopuses, whose intelligence is surprising given their very different bodies. 

Octopuses can do amazing things: they can open jars, recognize faces, use coconut shells for protection, and even play in complex ways. While some people think that comparing animals to humans is unscientific, Dr. Frans de Waal, who studies primates like gorillas and chimpanzees, believes that failing to see the human-like qualities in animals is the real problem. He calls this ""anthropodenial."" 

Dr. de Waal has analyzed many years of research on animal intelligence and found that, except for fully developed language, animals show many behaviors once thought to be unique to humans. These include the ability to think about the past and future, show empathy, be self-aware, and understand the intentions of others. In other words, animals are much smarter than we often believe.

Historically, people viewed animal minds as quite complex. In medieval Europe, animals could even be put on trial for crimes. In the 19th century, many scientists explored the similarities between human and animal intelligence. Charles Darwin, who changed our understanding of evolution, wrote that the difference between human and higher animals is one of degree, not kind.

However, in the 20th century, the rise of behaviorism changed how people viewed animal intelligence. Many believed animals were just machines responding to stimuli, and those who thought animals had inner lives were seen as unrealistic. This shift happened during a time when humans were destroying animal habitats and neglecting animal welfare.

Fortunately, Dr. de Waal believes we are starting to recognize that animal intelligence exists on a similar spectrum to human intelligence. He notes that there has been a surge of knowledge about animal cognition in recent years, especially shared online. He argues that the best tests of animal intelligence consider the unique traits of each species. For example, squirrels may not do well on human memory tests, but they can remember where they hid their nuts.

In her book, The Soul of an Octopus, naturalist Sy Montgomery suggests that if an octopus were to test human intelligence, it might focus on how well we can change the colors of our skin. If we failed, the octopus might think we are not very smart.

Dr. de Waal is cautious about Inky’s escape. He notes that while octopuses have escaped before, it might be too hopeful to think Inky knew how to reach the ocean. However, he understands how powerful stories like this can help people appreciate animal intelligence. 

He once conducted an experiment to see if capuchin monkeys could feel envy. When some monkeys received cucumbers (which they liked) while others got grapes (which they liked even more), the monkeys with cucumbers became upset. The study was published in a scientific journal, but what really made people believe the findings was a short video of the experiment released ten years later. This shows how our understanding of animal minds continues to evolve."
17,"Text: 'Robotics, once just a topic in science fiction, is now set to cause major changes in technology, similar to what happened during industrialization. Robots have been used in car manufacturing and other industries for many years, but experts believe we are about to see a significant increase in their use across various fields. Many people see robotic automation as a disruptive force. Interestingly, while about two-thirds of people think robots will take over most jobs done by humans in the next 50 years, around 80% believe their own jobs will still exist in the same way during that time. This shows a common belief that our jobs are safe, but they are not: every industry will be impacted by robotic automation soon.

For instance, an Australian company called Fastbrick Robotics has created a robot named Hadrian X, which can lay 1,000 bricks in one hour, a task that would take two human workers a whole day or more. Another example is Tally, a robot from a San Francisco startup, which checks supermarket shelves to ensure products are stocked and priced correctly, rather than cleaning the aisles.

Supporters of robotic automation argue that robots currently cannot maintain or program themselves, which could lead to new, skilled jobs for technicians and programmers. However, critics warn that we should not underestimate the importance of human interaction in the workplace. Dr. Jing Bing Zhang, an expert in robotics applications, studies how robotics is changing the workforce. His recent report indicates that in two years, nearly one-third of robots will be smarter and able to work alongside humans. In three years, many top companies will have a chief robotics officer, and some governments will create laws about robots. In five years, salaries in the robotics field are expected to rise by at least 60%, but many jobs will remain unfilled due to a lack of skilled workers.

Zhang emphasizes that automation will affect lower-skilled workers, and they should not rely on the government to protect their jobs. Instead, they need to find ways to retrain themselves, as job security is no longer guaranteed. Additionally, advancements in technology will lead to new types of robots for consumers, such as humanoid robots that live in our homes and interact with us in complex ways. This presents a unique opportunity for companies, but it also brings challenges, including the need for new regulations to ensure safety and privacy.

With millions of jobs at risk and a potential global employment crisis, it is crucial to focus on education to prepare for the future workforce. Developed countries need more graduates in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) to stay competitive.'"
18,"Text: George Mallory, a famous mountaineer, reportedly answered a reporter's question about why he wanted to climb Mount Everest with, ""Because it’s there."" This response reflects a common curiosity: why do people engage in such dangerous and seemingly pointless activities? Mallory's answer might encourage some to pursue their dreams and face the unknown. However, it also suggests that the main reason for climbing could simply be for adventure and enjoyment.

In 1967, Bolivian writer Tejada-Flores wrote an important essay called ""Games that Climbers Play."" He identified seven different climbing activities, or ""games,"" ranging from playing on boulders to climbing high mountains, each with its own rules. He argued that the approach to any climb, such as the amount of equipment used, should depend on the rules of that specific game. Over the years, this perspective has become popular in climbing discussions in the West, appearing in climbing magazines and casual conversations.

Many climbers love the sense of freedom that climbing provides. However, climbing can also feel restrictive. For instance, being stuck in a tent during a storm is not what most people think of as freedom. This creates a paradox in climbing. Yet, some argue that the limited choices in climbing can simplify life, which can also feel freeing.

When asked ""Why climb?"", US rock climber Joe Fitschen suggests a different question: ""Why do people climb?"" This shifts the focus to human nature and offers an evolutionary explanation. Climbing is part of our genetic makeup; we are naturally inclined to take on challenges and test our limits, even if it involves risks. Therefore, the joy of climbing may be more about our biology than logical reasoning.

US academic Brian Treanor also contributed to this discussion, suggesting that climbing can help develop important virtues like courage, humility, and respect for nature. While he acknowledges that not all climbers show these qualities, he believes that cultivating them is especially important in today's risk-averse society. Climbing, then, can have practical benefits by helping people develop traits that enable them to thrive in everyday life.

Another interesting idea is that climbers who do not depend on others or technology must be fully committed to succeed. Expert climbers Ebert and Robinson stirred some debate by claiming that climbs done independently are more challenging and deserve more recognition than those completed with large teams or artificial aids, like bottled oxygen at high altitudes. This view raised concerns that it might encourage climbers to take unnecessary risks.

We can also explore climbing outside the Western perspective. Many climbers report experiences of being fully present, or ""in the zone."" The physical effort of climbing, the meditative state while climbing, and the intuitive problem-solving involved are all essential aspects of the activity. Some argue that climbing techniques are similar to those in Zen philosophy, which aims to achieve a state of inner peace. This offers another perspective on why people are drawn to climbing."
19,"Over the past sixty years, pianist Alfred Brendel became a leading figure in classical music. He was known for his serious and thoughtful approach, focusing on important European piano works. Although he composed and performed a lot, he taught very few students. Those close to him saw a fun side to his personality, but this was rarely shown during his performances. His life was a constant routine of studying, traveling, and playing music.

About four or five years ago, a young boy named Kit Armstrong approached Brendel after one of his concerts and asked for lessons. At first, Brendel did not take this request seriously. He had very few students and did not see a reason to change that. He quoted another famous pianist, saying, “You don’t hire a mountain guide to teach a child how to walk.” However, he was impressed by Kit, who was around 14 years old at the time. Brendel listened to him play and said, “He played incredibly well and from memory. He even gave me a CD of a recital where he played so beautifully that I thought, ‘I must make time for him.’ It’s rare to find a musician with such a complete understanding and subtlety.”

As Brendel steps back from the spotlight, Kit is starting to shine, although Brendel worries about him burning out too quickly. Now 19, Kit is always busy, learning new languages, studying math, writing computer code, or playing tennis, all while his mother keeps a close watch on him. He also composes music. Brendel emphasizes the importance of learning to read music by trying to write it yourself. He noticed that Kit has an incredible memory and is excellent at reading music. More importantly, Kit listens carefully to his own playing and understands Brendel’s instructions well. When Brendel teaches him something in a piece, Kit applies it throughout the entire piece.

Brendel is cautious about raising expectations for Kit. He dislikes when newspapers label Kit as the next great pianist of the 21st century, saying it can be harmful. He points out that while Kit can play some pieces exceptionally well, others will take more time and practice. It would be unfair for critics to expect perfection from him.

Now at 80 years old, Brendel shows a softer side in his retirement. He reflects, “When I was young, I didn’t aim to be famous quickly, but I wanted to achieve certain goals by the age of 50. When I reached 50, I felt I had accomplished most of those goals, but I still wanted to do more, so I continued. Although I may not have the physical strength I once had, my mind is always active with new pieces I’ve never played. I don’t perform now, but I enjoy this new phase of my career.”"
20,"When I was a child, I thought gardens were beautiful places. My grandfather’s garden was by a river, sloping gently down to the water. Although we couldn’t reach the river, we could hear the water flowing and the birds singing in the trees. I believed all gardens were like this – peaceful and a place to escape. 

Grandad’s garden was simple. He didn’t have a fancy greenhouse like some neighbors, who used old window frames and patched them with plastic where glass was broken. At home, my father was often quiet and reserved. He had a sense of humor and enjoyed using phrases like “It’s immaterial to me,” even though “I don’t mind” would have worked just as well. Deep down, he might have felt disappointed about his life. He left school without qualifications and became a plumber, which he didn’t love. He wasn’t very ambitious, although he and my mother once thought about moving to Canada, but it never happened. 

My father was skilled at home projects, whether it was building bookshelves or cupboards. My parents only moved house once during their marriage, but my mother was adventurous with furniture. Just when you got used to one chair, another would appear. The biggest change was when a piano arrived. I wanted to like it, but it intimidated me. The only part I liked were the two brass candlesticks on it, but my mother said they were too fancy and they disappeared while I was at school. I was never allowed to play the piano; my sister took lessons instead. When I later asked my mother why I wasn’t given the chance, she simply said, “You’d never have practiced.”

Of the three places to explore – moors, woods, or the river – I always chose the river. I could let my imagination run wild there. With a fishing net over my shoulder and old sandals that barely fit, I would walk along the riverbank, looking for a good spot to take off my sandals and leave them with my picnic. I would then carefully look for fish in the water to catch and take home. After failing to keep them alive in the backyard, I returned them to the river.

I wanted to leave school as soon as possible, but that seemed unlikely until one day my father said, “There’s a job opening for an apprentice gardener in the Parks Department. I thought you might be interested.” In that moment, he went against his usual judgment. He might have preferred if I became a carpenter, but I like to think that deep down, he hoped things would turn out well if I pursued gardening. Even though he didn’t enjoy gardening himself, he had seen my enthusiasm for plants and flowers, and I believe he recognized my passion."
21,"Lawrence MacEwen is crouching on his Scottish island, the Isle of Muck, and I am doing the same. A strong wind from the Atlantic threatens to blow us off the steep cliff in front of us and into the ocean below. MacEwen’s sheepdog, Tie, approaches, and his owner gently pets him. Despite the fierce wind, MacEwen feels completely at home on his island. 

He shows me around, pointing to the north and shouting, “That island is Eigg. The one to the west is the Isle of Rum, which gets twice as much rain as we do.” I see dark clouds pouring rain on Rum’s tall mountains. “Just beyond Rum is Soay,” he adds. 

Suddenly, MacEwen says he needs to move his sheep, and we start walking down the slopes. As we go, he shares interesting facts about the island: Muck is three kilometers long and one and a half kilometers wide; its geese eat a lot of grass; and the MacEwen family has lived here for 3,000 years. 

While herding the sheep, Tie struggles to do his job. “Away to me, Tie. Away to me,” MacEwen commands, meaning the dog should go to the right. Instead, Tie runs straight through the flock, causing confusion. “Tie,” MacEwen says, disappointed. The dog looks ashamed. 

The Isle of Muck is mainly run by the MacEwen family. Lawrence and his wife, Jenny, manage the farm; their son Colin takes care of the island cottages; and their daughter Mary runs the island hotel, Port Mor, with her husband, Toby. Mary and Toby enjoy that their two sons can explore the island freely and sail small boats in the summer. “They go out the door and come back only when they’re hungry,” Mary says. 

However, life on the island has its challenges. For example, electricity is not always available. On my first evening, I anxiously wait for the lights to come on. The next morning, I find Mary preparing breakfast by flashlight. I also have to deal with no mobile phone service. “You can get reception on the hill,” Mary explains. “Most people last a couple of days before putting their phone away.” So, I do the same. 

Everything on Muck feels wonderfully surprising. A boat arrives today with groceries and three musicians who come off carrying their instruments. Their concert in the island’s tearoom is a great success, with the locals tapping their feet to the music. 

That night, sitting by a warm fire while it rains outside, Lawrence tells me how he met Jenny. “Her father saw a small farm on Soay advertised in a newspaper and bought it without even visiting. He had never been to Scotland. Jenny was sent to manage it.” Did Jenny know how to run a farm? “She had good typing skills,” he replies. 

I go to bed listening to the rain and wake up to more rain. But I eat well, as almost all my food comes from the island. Mary sends me to fisherman Sandy Mathers for fresh fish. I carry it back through the village and deliver it to Mary at the kitchen door. By 7 pm, our fish is on the table, incredibly delicious. 

The next morning, I worry about my ferry ride to the next island. Many ferries had been canceled in the past two months due to rough seas. If my ferry doesn’t come, I would be stuck on Muck for two more days, which, secretly, I would not mind at all."
22,"The game design industry was once mainly made up of computer scientists and self-taught individuals, and it did not have many ways for people to enter. It was often seen as just a hobby for young fans, but now the video games industry is taken seriously. This change may surprise some, but industry experts are not surprised. However, entering this field is challenging. Creating video games based on new movies requires many team members and months of hard work and skill.

Like many industries, getting into game design is difficult, but it is growing. Jim Donelly, a spokesperson for an online games magazine, states, ""It is very hard to make progress in large companies or to influence major games. However, the industry needs game designers now more than ever. This includes not just top-level directors but also those who design systems and individual elements.""

So, how can you enter this competitive field? Many companies prefer candidates with a degree in computer science, but Jim believes that the best way is to simply make games. ""The tools are available. You won’t get hired if you haven’t created something, and you won’t succeed on your own if you are not producing work. Game design is more than a job; it is a way of life. Like any creative pursuit, it must be practiced to be real.""

Another expert, John Field, acknowledges that while ""just doing it"" is important, it is more complex than that. Many people want to work in games, but few meet the industry's current demands. Even fewer possess the creativity, technical skills, vision, and entrepreneurial spirit needed to contribute to this evolving field.

Can you succeed on your own? ""Maybe, but it is quite difficult,"" says John. ""A good postgraduate course in games can help and provide valuable support and guidance. Most game designers start as programmers or artists and work their way up. They are interested in various forms of entertainment and have a strong passion for the arts and contemporary culture. They may have spent some time working after graduation but have realized that games are their true calling. They are not just fans; they are excited about the future of games and understand the growing variety in this medium. 

Networking is also important. This is often overlooked, but to advance in games, as in many fields, you need to make connections."" The stereotype of a young boy playing video games has changed to a more accurate view of games as a mature medium that captures our attention. Families often engage with interactive consoles, and smartphones offer many new games through apps and social media. John believes there is much room for growth. ""Games have become popular among larger audiences. They are also a great way to learn, and I see this already significant area as full of expanding possibilities and opportunities."""
23,"Since I was a child, I have always wanted to play football. My dad encouraged me to play, but he never forced me, and I appreciate that. I had a friend whose dad was very demanding. He often said, ""You can't do this, you can't do that."" My friend could have been a good player, but he lost interest and stopped playing football altogether. I’m thankful that my experience was different, but I know it could have easily gone the other way.

When I score an amazing goal from far away, people often say it’s just luck, but it’s not. I have practiced taking long shots since I was young. Scoring spectacular goals comes from hard work. The best players in the world, who have great natural talent, also spend many years practicing to achieve their success. Sometimes, I see young players colliding with each other, but I was taught the right techniques. When I teach kids, I emphasize the importance of enjoying learning new skills.

At school, I participated in many sports, from rounders and baseball to athletics and basketball. I now understand the value of a good education, but back then, football was my main focus. The teachers were doing a good job, but I didn’t realize it at the time. I want my son to have a different experience. We are already trying to read him books, even though he is too young to sit still for long. I hope that his tendency to kick the books around doesn’t mean he will be like me in that way.

At the start of my professional football career, the manager made sacrifices so that younger players like us could join the first team, but he never made a big fuss about it. He didn’t gather us and say, ""This is your chance to prove yourselves,"" but we all understood the importance of it. I scored in the first game of the season, but we lost, and a well-known TV presenter famously said, ""You can’t win anything with kids."" This made us realize how much we needed to improve. We had some doubts, but we believed in ourselves as a team despite his comments.

I rely heavily on my close friends and family. However, having a lot of money can sometimes create issues. For instance, people often ask me why I let my mother continue working. I have helped my parents financially; I paid off their house loan and bought them a car last Christmas. My family is strong and independent, and they would be upset if they felt they should rely on me for support. My mum doesn’t earn much as a hairdresser, but she loves her job. At the same time, I enjoy using my money to make life easier for those around me.

I have more money than people think, but it doesn’t solve all my problems. After I stop playing football, I plan to take a year off or even longer to do things I haven’t been able to do for years. I want to go skiing the day after I retire. I can’t do that now because if I were to break a leg while skiing and couldn’t play football again, I wouldn’t be insured."
24,"It was Sam Carter who helped us move to Reef Point. He was my father's agent in Los Angeles. My father struggled to write there because he disliked the city so much, and Sam was worried about losing clients and money. During the summer, the beach was empty because sea fogs often covered the sun. Reef Point was not a popular spot for day visitors. The road to it was not appealing, and the nearby resort of La Carmella attracted those with money. Only people who were broke or really loved surfing would come to Reef Point. 

However, with the hot weather, many people started to visit. After being almost alone for months, we were now surrounded by activity. My father was busy trying to finish a script, feeling stressed. I often went to the beach with a book and my dog, Rusty. When we first arrived at Reef Point, we didn’t have a dog, but Rusty decided to join us. I tried to send him away, but he kept coming back. One morning, I felt sorry for him and gave him some water. My father threw a boot at him, but it was just a weak attempt to scare him off. Rusty understood this and got closer. I asked my father, “Who does he belong to?” My father replied, “You’re wrong, Jane. He thinks we belong to him.”

Rusty loved the beach and often dug up things to bring to me. Sometimes he found items that didn’t belong to him, like a new sneaker or a bright beach towel, which I had to return to their owners. He also loved to swim and always wanted to join me, even though I could swim much faster. Surprisingly, he never got discouraged. 

That day, after swimming, my father went to Los Angeles to deliver his script, leaving Rusty and me to enjoy the beach. As the sun began to set, it got cooler, and we watched the surfers. They had been surfing all day and seemed to never get tired. One surfer stood out to me; she was very skilled. Eventually, she decided to finish for the day and rode in on a final wave. 

“Hi,” she said, “why didn’t you join us?” 
“I don’t have a surfboard.” 
“You could get one.” 
“I don’t have any money.” 
“You’re British, right? Are you visiting?” 
“No, I live here.” 
“Is your father American?” 
“No, he came here to write a film script based on a novel he wrote.” 
“Really? Have I heard of him? What’s his name?” 
“Rufus Marsh.” 
“You mean, *Tall as the Morning*?” I nodded. 
“I read that book from start to finish.” 

She looked at me with new interest, and I realized that people were friendly but only showed real interest when I mentioned *Tall as the Morning*."
25,"Violet Hetherington stood in a long line at the Southampton docks, waiting to board the Queen Caroline. The line was spilling out of a building labeled ‘Departures’. Her friend Annie, who was experienced in travel, had told her it was better to arrive late to avoid waiting too long. However, this time, Annie's advice was wrong. 

After some time, an announcement came over the loudspeakers: there was a problem with the computer system. This news made the atmosphere tense among the passengers. Some tried to stay calm, while others became frustrated. They had paid a lot of money for this trip, and many felt it might be their last chance for a luxurious experience. The delays did not give them confidence.

Violet felt uneasy and wanted to leave. She reached into her bag for her phone but realized it was missing. This was more frustrating than the long wait. It made her doubt her decision to go on a cruise. Without her phone, she couldn’t call the taxi company to see if she had left it there, as all her important numbers were stored in it. This was the very mistake her older son, Harry, always warned her about.

Behind her in line was a friendly couple. Violet asked if she could borrow their phone to call Harry. She left a message for him to ask their neighbor, Kristina, to check if her phone was at home. If it wasn’t, she would be in trouble because she had no other way to find important numbers in New York. Part of her felt relieved, but she didn’t share this with Harry. He often thought he was more knowledgeable than his mother, while her younger son, Daniel, was more understanding of her mistakes, as he often made them too.

Eventually, the line moved, and Violet reached the window to hand over her travel documents. However, her spirits dropped when she entered the ship’s foyer, which looked like a cheap hotel trying too hard to impress. It had shiny fake wood panels, fancy chandeliers, and carpets that reminded her of airports.

She followed the signs to the elevators, which were crowded with tired passengers. As the lift moved up, it stopped at each floor, letting people out who were relieved to escape. Finally, on the twelfth floor, Violet stepped out and was happy to find her room had the balcony she had requested. She had worried about what to say if it hadn’t. Ignoring Annie’s advice to wait for a better deal, she had decided to pay the highest price she could afford to ensure she had a view of the sea."
26,"When John Maloof bought a box of old photo negatives at an estate auction, he had no idea he was about to uncover the mystery of Vivian Maier. Maloof was searching for images for a book about the Portage Park neighborhood in Chicago, but instead, he discovered 30,000 photographs taken by Maier, a talented street photographer. Since then, Maloof has built a collection of Maier’s life and work. In his home attic, he keeps her cameras, 2,000 rolls of film, 3,000 prints, and 100,000 negatives, along with many 8mm films and audiotapes.

One morning, Maloof looked around at his collection, realizing he was on the brink of something significant, all due to luck. “When I bought this, I had no idea what it was,” he said. “I could have easily sold it all to someone else.” For a while, Maloof and his friend Anthony Rydzon have been piecing together details of Maier’s life. They reached out to families who had hired her as a nanny and spoke with staff from the shop where she developed her film.

Maier was born in 1926 in New York and spent much of her childhood in France. She returned to New York in 1951 and moved to Chicago in 1956 to work as a nanny. Maier was known to be a private person with a unique personality, always carrying a camera. She wore large coats, wide-brimmed hats, and sturdy shoes. “On her day off, she would have her camera around her neck and wouldn’t be seen again until late at night,” said Maren Baylaender, whose husband employed Maier to care for his daughter. “She was private but had strong opinions about movies and politics.”

Maier was knowledgeable about theater and film. Although she was not very social, she often walked the streets with her camera and engaged with people, some of whom she interviewed on tape. She seemed to be dedicated to her “second job” of documenting the world around her. “She was a true artist who followed her dreams,” said Rydzon. “Nothing stopped her.”

Maier’s work is pure art; she did not create it for commercial purposes. Her photographs often focus on women, children, the elderly, the poor, and abstract subjects. “What is fascinating about Vivian is the number of interesting pictures,” said photography expert Larry Silverman. He sees influences from other photographers in her work and wonders if she developed her own style independently. “Was Vivian sophisticated enough to do this, or did she borrow ideas from others?”

Maloof often thinks about whether he will ever sort through all the negatives, which he keeps in three tall, fireproof cabinets. Interestingly, he had no real interest in photography until he found Maier’s work. Inspired by her architectural photos, Maloof began taking his own pictures. “As I grew as a photographer and revisited her work, I realized that the cityscapes were not what mattered to her. It was the people, the street scenes, the overall composition,” he said. “There was so much more to her work than I thought, and I realized I was holding something more important than I ever imagined. Now our goal is to make her name known and ensure Vivian Maier is remembered in history.”"
27,"When a novel is called ambitious, it often suggests that it has not fully succeeded. However, this is not the case with Eleanor Catton’s book, The Luminaries. I interviewed her in the UK when her book was very successful, and she remained calm, especially for someone in her twenties. She had just arrived from Germany and was flying back to New Zealand the next day. She shared a story about being stopped at passport control and asked to prove she was a writer. She pressed her novel against the glass, and the official asked, “What’s it about?” This is not an easy question for an author. 

The Luminaries takes place in New Zealand during the 1860s, where a series of crimes have occurred, leading a council of 12 men to come together to solve them. The plot becomes very complex. Catton intended to write a murder mystery, not a historical novel, but she found that the past allowed for more complications and misunderstandings for her characters. At over 800 pages, the book is “big by necessity” because she wanted to give each of the 20 main characters a fair chance to shine.

When I asked her how it feels to be so successful at a young age, she responded thoughtfully. “It’s nice coming from a small country because everyone feels part of the success. There’s a family-like feeling at home; I received a lot of support from other people’s grandmothers.” She also mentioned that it bothers her when people assume her book is not a philosophical work.

Catton explained that she wanted to write the book in the shape of a spiral, with each part being half the length of the previous one. This structure makes the story speed up as it progresses. I asked if it matters whether readers notice these patterns. She said she aimed to create a book with structural patterns that readers could explore if they wanted to, but that they were not essential to enjoy the story.

Despite its unique structure, The Luminaries remains an exciting murder mystery with a captivating plot. Surprisingly, Catton did not plan the story in advance. “I would write myself into a corner and then see how creatively I could get out of the situation I had created.” One of her goals was to make the book enjoyable for readers.

We also discussed her love for television dramas, noting how The Luminaries uses cliff-hangers, different viewpoints, and dialogue. I asked if she would be interested in screenwriting. “That could be pretty cool,” she replied, her enthusiasm evident.

She becomes animated when discussing her writing and New Zealand. “I notice how much my imagination changes when I’m in a different place. I understand why writers leave New Zealand for more populated areas to be surrounded by more people.” For now, New Zealand will remain her home, and I hope it continues to inspire her for many more novels."
28,"As a child, Jonny Kinkead spent his time either building things in his father's garage or playing the guitar. For the last forty years, he has made a living by handcrafting steel-string acoustic guitars. He expresses his fascination with the guitar, wondering how two pieces of wood can create such beautiful sounds and how different types of wood can produce different tones.

Jonny learned to play his brother's guitar at the age of eleven and wanted to learn the bass guitar when he turned sixteen. Instead of getting a job to save money for one, he decided to build it himself. He studied how different shapes and types of wood affect sound and learned how to assemble them. Although the bass was his first complete instrument, he had been building model boats and airplanes with his brothers, so he was familiar with the process. His father taught them how to use tools, and he had also repaired instruments for friends.

Jonny's bass guitar turned out well, but he had not yet considered a career in guitar-making. He was also interested in painting and sculpture. After finishing school, he chose to study architecture at university because it involved design, which he liked. However, halfway through the course, he dropped out, feeling that he was too independent for it. He realized that guitar-making was a form of sculpture that involved creating sound, and he thought it might be a more practical career than pure art since it produced items people could use.

Since then, Jonny has made guitars for a living. For the first ten years, he worked part-time cleaning windows to support himself. His early guitars were sold at the cost of materials, but as he gained a reputation as a skilled guitar-maker, he was able to charge more. Even now, nearly forty years later, he describes his work as ""still scratching a living,"" as he can only make about ten guitars a year, limiting his income.

In the beginning, Jonny focused on getting his name out there. He attended music festivals on weekends, encouraging musicians to try his guitars and spread the word. He also had to learn how to price his instruments, as he initially struggled with this aspect of the business.

Jonny believes that it is easier for new guitar-makers in the UK today. When he started, many people thought only American-made acoustic guitars were valuable, even though the UK has always had excellent instrument-making courses. Now, British-made guitars have gained the recognition they deserve.

He thinks that valuable skills can be learned in classrooms, and he encourages new makers to take available courses. However, he also believes that there is no substitute for learning through experience. He advises looking at other instruments to see what works and what doesn’t. He explains that if the back of a guitar is too thin or too thick, it won't sound good. He feels that being self-taught allows for a broader understanding, while learning from someone else may limit you to just one method."
29,"Any discussion about English conversation, like any English conversation, usually starts with the weather. In this traditional way, I will quote the well-known comment from the eighteenth-century writer Dr. Johnson: ""When two Englishmen meet, their first talk is of the weather."" This statement is still true today, just as it was over two hundred years ago. However, many commentators either stop here or struggle to explain why the English seem so focused on the weather. They often make a mistake by thinking that when we talk about the weather, we are genuinely interested in it. 

For example, the American writer Bill Bryson points out that English weather is not particularly interesting. He notes that in England, we do not experience extreme weather events like tornadoes or blizzards, which are common in other places. Therefore, he finds it hard to understand why the English are so preoccupied with it. On the other hand, the English broadcaster Jeremy Paxman disagrees with Bryson. He believes that the English fascination with the weather is not about strong feelings; rather, it is about its unpredictability. He argues that while we may not have dramatic weather, living on the edge of an ocean means we can never be completely sure what the weather will be like.

From my research, I believe that both Bryson and Paxman miss the main point: our conversations about the weather are not really about the weather itself. Instead, talking about the weather serves as a way for English people to connect with each other. For instance, phrases like ""Nice day, isn’t it?"" or ""Ooh, isn’t it cold?"" are not genuine questions about the weather; they are common greetings or ways to start a conversation. In this sense, English weather talk is similar to ""social grooming"" among monkeys, who spend time grooming each other to bond socially.

There are specific situations where weather talk is used. Some writers claim that the English talk about the weather all the time, but this is not accurate. In reality, there are three main contexts for weather talk: as a simple greeting, as a way to break the ice before discussing other topics, or as a fallback topic when conversations stall and there is an awkward silence. This frequent use of weather talk can give outsiders the impression that English people talk about little else. An English conversation might start with a weather-related greeting, move to some light weather discussion, and then return to weather talk during pauses. This is why many people, including some English commentators, think that the English are obsessed with the weather."
30,"Alice Leader stood in front of Hadrian’s Wall in Britain, explaining to her class of 12- and 13-year-olds what an amazing engineering achievement it was for the Romans to build a structure that is 120 km long and 5 meters high nearly 1900 years ago. The students were excited about this trip, choosing it over more glamorous tours to Spain, Greece, or France. However, they were curious about why the wall was built, and Alice felt her answers were not enough. Unable to find a suitable historical novel to provide context about life at the Wall during Roman times, she decided to write one herself. After retiring from teaching for 31 years, Alice began her new career as an author in 2001. 

Having had a successful teaching career, Alice felt she was stepping into the unknown. She compared teaching to acting, saying it was physically demanding, while writing was exciting but less exhausting. Her former colleagues envied her because she still connected with children through her stories. Alice aims to fill a gap in children's fiction. She noted that much of today’s adolescent fiction focuses on negative experiences, which, while well-written, often presents dark realities or total fantasy, like Harry Potter. Her books are different.

Alice always taught English and History together, using lessons about ancient Greece alongside the novel ""Tale of Troy."" She is motivated by her love for children and is fascinated by the moment when a child goes from boredom to interest and from confusion to understanding. She enjoys the challenge of engaging bored children. 

Her decision to write her first novel was inspired by the realization that her two sons were leaving home, creating an ""empty nest,"" and a suggestion from her head teacher to take a creative writing course. Initially, Alice was hesitant to spend her summer on a course she thought unnecessary. However, she had to submit her best piece of fiction to be accepted, which she only learned a few days before the course started. She quickly created a story about a Roman couple and their unborn child. After three hours and 30 pages, she submitted it and was accepted.

During the course, her classmates reviewed her work positively and encouraged her to publish it. With only 8,000 report cards as proof of her writing skills, she requested a year off from her school to write her first novel. Alice's husband, Zachary Leader, is a critic and editor, and his help was crucial in editing her novel. Alice believes they complement each other; he improves her writing by changing sentence structures and suggesting word changes, while her instinct is to add more scenes. This difference highlights the roles of a fiction writer and an editor."
31,"To raise money for charity, a newspaper and a TV company challenged brothers Jonny and Alistair Brownlee, who are champion triathletes, to participate in a special race. This race would have Jonny in a car on the roads and Alistair riding a mountain bike across the countryside. The race took place in the beautiful and rugged Yorkshire Dales in northern England, with both brothers racing to the same finish point. 

“I’m looking forward to it,” Jonny said at the start line. “I’ve never done anything like this before; it’s exciting! The views here are beautiful, and it’s very cold, so I’ll be warm in the car.” Alistair, dressed in full winter cycling gear, was also eager. “Honestly,” he said, “I’ve seen Jonny drive before, so I’m not sure he’ll make it. I might stop for a cup of tea halfway up.”

The race began at Semerwater lake in Wensleydale and ended at Fleet Moss, Yorkshire’s highest road, which is about 350 meters high. While the car could handle the climb, Alistair faced a steep 25 percent incline right from the start. After a quick handshake, they were off. Alistair sped away on his bike, taking a path straight up the hill, while Jonny got into his car and hit the road. The big question was: who would reach the finish line first?

Jonny’s confidence quickly faced a challenge. Just 15 seconds into his drive, he encountered a large tractor blocking the road. “Welcome to Yorkshire,” he joked to the cameraman in his car. After getting past the tractor, Jonny continued driving, while Alistair struggled with the steep hill. A few miles in, he had to get off his bike and carry it up the slope, passing walls and fences. Sheep watched curiously as the Olympic champion made his way up the hill with his bike on his shoulders. Finally, he reached the top, where he could see the open ground ahead. With the sun shining, he pushed himself to go faster.

Meanwhile, Jonny faced another challenge. The narrow roads in the villages of Yorkshire were not built for speed. He had to carefully navigate a tight corner and drive through a stream that had formed on the road. Once past the last village, he was on a straight path to the finish line. Neither brother knew how close the other was. As Jonny accelerated down the final stretch to Fleet Moss, Alistair was racing across his last field and back onto the road, approaching the finish from the opposite side. 

With determination, Alistair pushed hard and then suddenly hit the brakes as he reached the finish line. He looked up and asked the crowd, “Is he here?” When they replied no, he raised his arms in celebration, shouting, “Yes!” Moments later, Jonny arrived in his car and stepped out. “Well done,” he said, feeling disappointed. “I’m gutted.”"
32,"The silence is what you notice when you play on Centre Court at Wimbledon. You bounce the ball quietly on the soft grass, toss it up to serve, and hit it, hearing only the echo of your own shots. The well-kept grass, the rich history, the old stadium, the players in white, and the respectful crowds all create a peaceful atmosphere that separates you from the outside world. This quiet is good for my game. The biggest challenge in a tennis match is to focus only on the game and the point I am playing. When a point ends, the silence is broken by applause, cheers, and people shouting my name. I hear them, but it feels distant. I don’t realize there are fifteen thousand people watching every move I make, nor that millions are watching me play Roger Federer in the 2008 Wimbledon final, the most important match of my life.

I had always dreamed of playing at Wimbledon. My uncle Toni, my coach, taught me from a young age that this was the most important tournament. By the time I was 14, I shared with my friends my dream of playing there and winning. Before 2008, I had played and lost to Federer twice in the finals. The loss in 2006 was not too hard; I was just happy to have made it that far. Federer won easily, but my defeat in 2007 was devastating. I knew I could have played better; it was not my skill that failed me, but my mindset. I cried for half an hour in the dressing room after that loss. Losing is always painful, but it hurts more when you have a chance and let it slip away.

Toni, who is usually tough on me, surprisingly told me not to cry and that there would be more chances at Wimbledon. I felt he didn’t understand; I thought that might have been my last chance to win. I know how short a professional athlete's career is, and I want to make the most of it. Every moment matters, but some moments are more important than others, and I had missed a big one in 2007. There was nothing Toni could do to comfort me, but he turned out to be right. Another chance came in 2008, just a year later. I was confident I had learned from my previous defeat; this time, my mindset would be strong. 

The night before the final, at dinner with family and friends, we avoided talking about the match. I didn’t have to tell them not to mention it; they understood that I was already mentally preparing for the game. From that moment until the match started, that mental space was mine alone."
33,"In early April 1957, a young and idealistic Englishwoman arrived in Africa. In her first letter home, she wrote, “I am living in the Africa I have always longed for.” This woman was Jane Goodall, and she would spend most of her life in Africa as a citizen, journalist, scientist, activist, and environmentalist. 

In 1963, Jane Goodall became famous when Britain’s National Geographical Society published articles and made documentaries about her research on chimpanzees. Her fame grew with her own writings, including popular children’s books and the 1971 bestseller *In the Shadow of Man*, which has been translated into 47 languages and is still available today. Jane Goodall is one of the most celebrated female scientists of the 20th century, second only to Marie Curie. However, her fame sometimes overshadows her real accomplishments. Many articles and interviews tell her story, but they often focus on sentimental aspects rather than her scientific work. 

People have portrayed her in various ways: as an adventurous girl, a privileged woman who wanted to live with wild animals, and a determined feminist. These portrayals can diminish her true contributions. Based on the number of academic references to her research, the success of her students in biology, and the extensive data from her forty-year study, Jane Goodall should be recognized as a leading zoologist and a pioneer in her field. 

Her main achievement is that she greatly improved our understanding of the social and emotional lives of chimpanzees. Before her work, people misunderstood the dangers of wild chimpanzees. No one knew that chimpanzees ate meat or that they used tools, like humans. We also did not realize that chimpanzees share similar emotions with us or that their social structures are surprisingly similar to ours. Goodall discovered that chimpanzee communities in Africa have unique cultural traditions. Her book, *The Chimpanzees of Gombe* (1986), is the most important work in chimpanzee research and serves as an encyclopedia on the subject. Her long-term study of wild chimpanzees in Gombe State, Nigeria, is considered one of the great scientific achievements of the Western world.

Jane Goodall changed how we study animals, and since chimpanzees are our closest relatives, she also changed how we view ourselves. Even as a child, there were signs of the biologist she would become. One clear example happened in the autumn of 1939 when she was just five years old. One day, she disappeared, prompting a search by the police, neighbors, and family. After a frantic search, she reappeared alone, with straw in her hair and clothes. When her mother asked where she had been, Jane explained that she wanted to know how hens lay eggs. To find out, she had crawled into a henhouse, hidden in the straw, and stayed still for five hours until a hen laid an egg. This moment can be seen as the start of her journey as a biologist."
34,"During our first hour-long conversation, Shirley Ford talks to me using the voices of a playful 8-year-old boy, the boy’s tired mother, a funny elderly Scottish woman, and a very fast-talking alien. Her voices are familiar to fans of children’s TV shows and cartoons, as well as people who have seen computer programs about health and safety. “I just did a voiceover about back injuries,” she explains, “so I had to quickly learn how to pronounce many medical terms.” 

Shirley discusses what it takes to do voiceovers. “Many actors, even very famous ones, think they can do funny voices, and many probably can,” she says. “But there’s more to it. You need to bring the script to life for an audience that can’t see you. You wouldn’t believe how many well-known names want to do voiceover work. Producers invite them to auditions because of their fame, but often they don’t get the roles because they are too used to acting with their whole bodies.”

After school, Shirley joined a drama course, hoping for a traditional acting career. During the course, she occasionally sang jingles for TV ads. “One day,” she recalls, “the studio manager suggested I try out for the voice of a rabbit in a cartoon. It seemed silly – I hadn’t studied drama to play rabbits – but I tried it for fun and, surprisingly, got a major role.” Shirley discovered she could do voices and that voiceover work might be her path. “Things just happened for me,” she says. “In my second film, I was lucky to play the main character, her brother, and her mother.”

Adult female actors are often asked to voice small boys and girls because their voices are lighter than those of male actors. Hiring child performers involves complicated procedures and lots of paperwork, which production companies prefer to avoid. Shirley has learned to create the right sounds from her throat and to avoid always sounding like the same child. She collects new voices by watching children’s TV. 

Cartoons are the best part of her job, which also includes educational videos and vacuum cleaner ads. “Those are tough because you have to sound excited about something you don’t care about, but my years in this field help,” she says. “I’ve learned that the trick is to smile while you talk – it makes your voice sound bright and cheerful. When I have days doing animation work, it feels like a holiday; interacting with other actors makes a big difference.”

The competition for work is intense, and a good showreel – a recording that shows what the artist can do – is very important. “It’s definitely worth investing in a strong showreel,” Shirley advises. “There are agencies that help voiceover artists create them.” She believes she has reached her current success – near the top of her field – through determination as much as talent. “Whether it’s making your showreel and taking it to film and TV companies, advertising agencies, and recording studios, or just practicing your voices, it’s all about setting goals and not giving up.”

For anyone thinking about a career in voiceovers, Shirley suggests attending “specialist workshops – they cover all types of voiceover.” She also believes a love for human sound is essential, describing herself as obsessed with voices and, in a way, becoming the characters she plays. “If I’ve been in the studio doing a specific American voice, for example, it can take over me, and I’ll be speaking like that for hours, maybe even days afterwards,” she says. “My children have grown up hearing their mom talk in completely different voices.”"
35,"People often ask me how I became a cartoonist. This is understandable because cartooning is a job many dream about as children, like being a race car driver. However, most people eventually give up these childhood dreams and choose more practical careers, such as tax lawyer or auto parts manufacturer. The idea of making a living by drawing simple doodles, like those in high school notebooks, seems silly at first. Yet, some people do just that. 

Becoming a cartoonist is not the same for everyone, but most who succeed have wanted to do it for a long time. For me, I had a typical childhood for a cartoonist, loving comic strips, contributing to school publications, and being known as ""the kid who draws."" I studied graphic design in college and, after graduating, I showed my illustrations to various companies. I was fortunate to find someone at a newspaper looking for political cartoons about local issues. I created a few ideas, and they bought them. Within a few months, I was earning enough to support myself.

You don’t need much to become a cartoonist. You don’t need a university degree, a lot of money, or even to be a great artist. You just need your mind, your hand, and something to make marks with. However, if it were that easy, there would be as many cartoonists as there are teachers. While the technical requirements are low, it is still a challenging job. You should only pursue this career if you feel you cannot do anything else. It is much easier to find a regular job that pays the bills and allows time for family, home repairs, and hobbies.

The more skills you have, the better your chances of making a living from your art. I have created political cartoons, comic strips, and comic books. I have also worked as a writer, caricaturist, and designer. I accept all kinds of work because you can learn a lot, even from jobs you don’t enjoy. It helps to be intelligent, well-read, and curious about the world.

What about the business side of cartooning? In the past, many cartoonists could find steady jobs with different newspapers and magazines. However, those days are fading. Today, cartooning is often an entrepreneurial activity, meaning you must not only create your work but also sell it. The more comfortable you are with this process, the more successful you will be. I have seen many cartoonists with average creativity but strong business skills do much better than those who are artistic geniuses but lack other skills.

It surprises me how often I meet people who have never sold a cartoon but are afraid someone will steal their ideas. Some are so worried that they won’t even let others see their work! Legally, to protect your work, you just need to draw a small ‘c’ for ‘copyright,’ circle it, and write your name and the date next to it. However, the truth is that it is more likely no one will be interested in your work. If someone does steal a cartoon and it becomes popular online, it is not a disaster; it could actually be a lucky opportunity!"
36,"Twenty years ago, I was moving to a new house and cleaning out my things. Among other items, I decided to throw away an electric guitar that my dad had given me for my 16th birthday. It was a sleek, black guitar made in Japan. I usually hate getting rid of even useless items, so why did I want to throw this one away? I took it to the dump and was about to leave it on a pile of trash when a young man approached me, looking confused. “You’re not going to throw that away, are you?” he asked. I told him I was, and I started to feel regret. He asked if he could have it, and I said yes. We parted ways, but in the following days and years, I felt deep sadness for what I had done.

A few months ago, I received an email that changed everything. I remembered a story about a man who lost his wedding ring in the ocean and found it ten years later in a fish he was eating. That’s how I felt when I opened an email from someone I didn’t know, a guitar dealer and restorer named Keith Rushton. He wrote, “I’ve got your electric guitar.” It had been sold several times since the young man at the dump took it. Keith found a name-and-address label on the back of the guitar. He realized it might be outdated but used my name to find me online. He eventually contacted me through the newspaper I work for and offered to sell it back to me. I was overwhelmed with emotion. I would have given him anything, but his price was very fair. I had forgotten that my dad always put name-and-address stickers on my belongings, including my guitar. My dad would have laughed at this strange situation!

My parents wanted me to learn classical guitar because it was popular in the 1970s. I loved the calming sound of the instrument, which was gentle and flattering for beginners. Unlike the violin, it didn’t sound terrible when played by someone just starting out. However, I struggled to improve, so I switched to the electric guitar and played simpler music. This was also the time of punk music, where people who couldn’t play well could still become rock stars.

When I opened the box that Keith sent me and took out my old guitar, I suddenly remembered my birthday in 1978 when my smiling parents gave it to me. Holding it again felt smooth and smaller than I remembered. I sat down to play but quickly stood up, putting a strap over my shoulder because electric guitars are meant to be played standing. My fingers instinctively knew where to go. I couldn’t have drawn a diagram for the chords I wanted to play, but my hands just moved into position. My middle-aged fingers felt the familiar pain of pressing down the strings to form a chord. The electric guitar is not really meant for solo playing. Now that I’m learning it again, I think I’ll need to form a band. My son is learning the saxophone; maybe we can play together. Or perhaps there are others my age who have had a similar experience. We could call ourselves “The Regainers!”"
37,"There has been much discussion about sleep recently. When I wrote the book *Insomniac*, which focuses on people who struggle with sleeplessness, I felt like I was one of the few warning about the dangers of not getting enough sleep and how it affects our minds, bodies, and emotions. Many insomniacs I interviewed emphasized that sleep is essential for our overall well-being. Interestingly, those who have the most trouble sleeping often understand its importance the best. It is encouraging that sleep is finally receiving the attention it deserves. However, I wonder about dreams. There has not been much conversation about them. We often lose our dreams. When you wake up early due to an alarm, you miss out on the last hour or two of sleep, which is mostly REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep, the stage where we have the most vivid dreams. A good sleeper spends about a quarter of their sleep time in REM, meaning that someone who lives to be 90 years old will spend around six or seven years dreaming. When researchers prevent people from experiencing REM sleep, they find that the next night, the amount and intensity of REM sleep increases to make up for it. This suggests that dreams serve a purpose.

When REM sleep was discovered in 1953, many agreed with psychologist Sigmund Freud, who believed that understanding dreams was key to understanding our minds. However, later research did not support this idea, and the focus shifted to the physical reasons behind dreams rather than the psychological ones. Currently, there is little agreement among dream researchers, according to Harvard sleep scientist Robert Stickgold. 

Dreams are significant. At a meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Society, P.F. Pagel from the University of Colorado Medical School shared a study showing that actors, writers, and directors remember and use their dreams much better than others. He concluded that the use of dreams increases with a person's interest in creativity. It makes sense that filmmakers have a strong connection to their dreams, as film is one of the most dream-like forms of art. However, I wondered if only creative people benefit from their dreams. Don’t teachers, software designers, and politicians also need to think creatively?

Stickgold explains that dreams help us connect ideas in new and often surprising ways, using knowledge from our past and present to create new associations. Dreams may allow us to discover new patterns and combinations that challenge our usual ways of thinking. For instance, Stickgold found that when people are awakened from REM sleep and asked to respond to a word, their answers are more original than when they are woken from other sleep stages. They tend to think outside the box and combine ideas in unexpected ways, which is a form of creativity. Personally, I find that I write better after experiencing intense dreams. Even a difficult dream, or one I can barely recall, seems to inspire my thoughts. On those days, words and images flow so quickly that I can hardly keep up with my typing. I am not sure how it works, but it does seem effective.

Creativity is not just for writers or artists. We live in a complex world, and everyone needs their brains to function well. We must think creatively and flexibly as we interact with colleagues, family, and friends. This is why dreaming is important."
38,"Twenty years ago, Susie Ray moved from London to a small coastal town in south-west England. When you enter her studio, which has a stunning view of the sea, you see several empty frames on the walls, along with cheerful photos of her two daughters. As a leading artist in the copyist art movement, Susie can recreate the beauty of early 20th-century impressionist paintings and the brilliance of 16th-century Caravaggio portraits with ease. It seems unusual that she doesn’t keep any of her own work. “I don’t have any around,” Susie says casually. “As soon as I finish them, they go.” 

The reason is that Susie is very popular. Over her 30 years as a copyist artist, she has painted many famous artists' works, including Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh. Her reproductions are so accurate that art experts sometimes mistake them for the originals. While the original paintings can sell for millions at auctions, her copies sell for a few hundred to £12,000, depending on how much time she spends on them. Susie does not reveal most of her clients, but they include galleries and private collectors. While many collectors genuinely love art, some are more interested in status. One celebrity likes to show off his “Van Gogh” painting, which is actually a “Susie Ray Van Gogh.” “Many famous people pass off my copies as originals,” she says. “That’s their choice.” Some collectors save on insurance by keeping the original in a bank and displaying Susie’s copy instead.

Susie is transparent about her work. When she copies an old masterpiece, she aims to make it look as authentic as possible because she believes that doing a poor job would disrespect the original artist. However, she always signs her name on the back of the canvas. It is illegal to sell a copy as the real thing, and although she knows people who have profited from that, she has never been tempted. Those who create fakes often face serious consequences. Susie admits she isn’t wealthy and has faced challenges, but her situation is more stable now, and it wouldn’t be wise to risk her reputation with collectors and artists.

Susie didn’t always work as a copyist. After earning her art degree, she worked as an illustrator for a botanical garden, earning very little money. Looking back, she sees that this experience helped her develop her skills and fostered her love for plants, even though it was hard to make ends meet. She had to be very precise and get things right on the first try. She has no regrets about that time but is glad to have found a more financially rewarding career.

When younger artists seek her advice, Susie emphasizes the importance of learning to draw accurately. She also highlights how much she has studied to master her craft. Her training allows her to create everything from plant drawings to perfect copies of 15th-century masterpieces and 20th-century abstract art, although she now focuses on French impressionists, particularly Manet, Cezanne, and Degas. Susie notes that many people think modern art is simple, almost like child’s play. However, she believes that while impressionists painted quickly and freely, they were also very careful, and achieving that balance is quite challenging.

Given her talent, it seems strange that Susie doesn’t create her own original works. Isn’t art about self-expression? Could a Susie Ray original be worth more than her copies? She explains that her work is the result of years of training and dedication, and she earns a good living from it. She has tried creating her own art, such as oil paintings of fishing nets, but they ended up looking like photographs—acceptable, but not exceptional. It’s like living on plain food after enjoying meals prepared by a top chef. Ultimately, Susie is a perfectionist."
39,"During her racing career, Ellen MacArthur was deeply passionate about the sea and being the fastest sailor. This obsession began in her childhood. She felt a unique connection with her boats, as if they were one entity. When she returned to land, daily life seemed unimportant, and she often longed to be back on the ocean, challenging nature, even in dangerous situations. After finishing second in the Vendée Globe, a solo, non-stop round-the-world race, she invited me to see the small, stuffy cabin of her boat, Kingfisher, where she lived and worked for 94 days. She explained how meticulously she planned her supplies, even counting the exact number of kitchen paper rolls she would need. Preparation was crucial for her. She proudly displayed her unappealing stock of freeze-dried food, a small gas stove, and organized medical supplies. Her attention to detail in maintaining the boat was as impressive as her sailing skills. To her, the boat was her entire world, and she cared for it because her life depended on it.

Now, Ellen views the world as a fragile boat with limited resources. A significant moment for her occurred during a trip to South Georgia, a remote island in the South Atlantic, where she participated in a bird survey for albatrosses. This experience made her reflect and see things in a new light. The many abandoned whaling stations served as a warning to her: it felt like humanity had taken what it wanted and moved on without care.

When I visited Ellen's office, she was finishing a passionate conference call about the urgent need to protect the planet. She explained that resources like coal, oil, and gas are finite and must be used wisely. Initially, her message was about reducing consumption, but she later realized there was a more positive approach. Now, she focuses on reusing materials, such as industrial carpet tiles. For the past three years, she has been visiting factories, mines, and power stations, discussing our dependence on non-renewable resources with government and business leaders. She admits she is not an expert but describes herself as a sponge, eager to learn. The current environmental crisis is something she cannot ignore. Compared to sailing, which felt selfish, her new mission is about finding ways to make her voice impactful.

Ellen also founded the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a charity that aims to inspire young people to create a sustainable future through business and education. She misses the adventure of being at sea, as it is a part of her identity. At sea, she felt connected to everything around her, focused on survival and her goals. She acknowledges that her new message is more complex than simply saying, ""I want to be the fastest around the world."" While she once achieved that, her current work is even more meaningful to her."
40,"Jordan Romero is 13 years old and wants to be the youngest person to climb Mount Everest. If he succeeds, he could become very famous among teenagers. He hopes to encourage other kids to explore the outdoors instead of just playing on computers and video games. Jordan's climbing team includes his father, Paul, and mother, Karen. They call themselves ""Team Romero."" Climbing Everest is just one part of their plan. If Jordan climbs Everest and Vinson Massif in Antarctica, he will be the youngest person to complete the Seven Summits, which are the highest mountains on each continent. Very few people achieve this before turning thirty. Jordan has already climbed five of these mountains and might finish before he turns 14.

I spoke with several experienced Everest climbers, and none thought it was a good idea to take a 13-year-old up the highest mountain in the world. They believed that while Jordan might be physically strong, they were unsure if he had the emotional strength needed. They also questioned whether a young person could have enough experience to make safe decisions while climbing.

The Romero family has heard these concerns before. Paul said, ""I know there is criticism, but I can't focus on it – we have a lot to do. We think about the risks, but we believe our experience as climbers will help us. Watching Jordan grow gives me confidence. He is getting stronger and more mature."" 

I also wonder about Jordan's reasons for wanting to climb. Is it just his father's ambition pushing him? Paul insists, ""This project is not about me becoming famous through my son. At first, Jordan thought it was something to do later in life, but we decided, 'Why not do it now?' We talk to him often to ensure he still wants to do it.""

When I asked Jordan what he enjoys about this challenge, he said, ""I just focus on reaching my goal."" In the past, few people cared about being the youngest or fastest to climb a mountain or sail an ocean. Today, every adventure is shared online, and every climb is seen as a chance to set a record. The more exciting the record, the more attention it gets. This creates a challenge for Jordan. While some may say that focusing on achievements takes away from enjoyment, if he wants to inspire others, he must engage with the media. This means blogging, taking photos, and giving interviews. He needs to do something impressive, like climbing Everest.

Paul adds, ""If Jordan comes home tomorrow and says he wants to stop climbing and play basketball instead, we will end this project and go to the gym."""
41,"When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, it’s likely they are not listening to classical music. Many people can name many pop groups, but if you ask my friends about Brahms, they usually don’t know who he is. I have just started a music degree, but my classmates know as little about classical music as most people our age. If you don’t know who composed the music, you probably don’t own any of their recordings. This situation is concerning for classical music lovers. Only 3% of concert tickets sold last year were for classical music, and the average classical album sells only 300 copies. This is hard to believe. 

So, why is interest in classical music declining? Older people often blame our love for TV and video games, but I don’t think that’s the reason. The truth is that classical music doesn’t attract most people, especially teenagers, who are the main buyers of music and concert tickets. I know some teenagers who enjoy classical concerts, but they are few. Even though I play in an orchestra, I’m not a big fan of classical music. I like many styles, but my classical music listening is probably close to that 3% figure.

Why don’t teenagers like classical music? First, the pace and rhythm of classical music, with its many mood changes, can be challenging for us. We prefer fast conversations, quick games, and rapid thoughts. Experts say we can only pay attention for about three minutes, which is too short for most classical pieces but just right for pop songs. Pop music is simple and easy to enjoy, while understanding classical music takes time and focus. Additionally, pop music often deals with topics that interest teenagers, while classical music usually does not.

The way we listen to music has changed too. In the past, families would gather to play music together, and playing an instrument was important. Now, we can find any music online, but classical music is rarely part of our daily lives. When was the last time you heard classical music in a store? One of my teachers says that audiences at classical concerts have grown recently. Maybe, but I doubt many of those new attendees are teenagers. In my orchestra, we perform classical music in various places, but when I look at the audience, I mostly see older people. I don’t know why more middle-aged people enjoy classical concerts, but I do know that if teenagers’ parents love something, they often try to avoid it.

Some people blame schools for teenagers’ lack of interest in classical music, but many students are eager to play classical music in their school orchestras. They come early to practice and stay late to rehearse. They enjoy classical music when they perform, but it’s not their preferred music otherwise. The two activities have become separate. When we want to relax, we always choose pop music."
42,"Bonnie Wyndham stepped out of her mother’s car and looked at Almonside School. “I’ll make you regret I came here,” she said with a smile. Her mother was getting out of the other side and didn’t hear her, but Bonnie didn’t mind. Her mother understood how she felt. Mrs. Wyndham looked around. Almonside was an unusual school, with buildings scattered among the trees on a hillside; it was quite confusing at first. Then she noticed signs: Science block, gymnasium, riding centre… “Riding centre,” Bonnie said, suddenly interested. “Headmaster’s study,” her mother replied. “This way.” Bonnie followed her mother along a wide path that curved through the trees. “I wish you’d walk next to me instead of trailing behind like a dog,” Mrs. Wyndham said tiredly, but she didn’t expect Bonnie to change. A few minutes later, her mother was talking to Bonnie’s new headmaster in his office, while Bonnie waited outside. Suddenly, Bonnie stood up. “Why should I just sit here?” she thought. “I’ll probably be kicked out soon anyway, so I might as well get it over with.” She left the building and went towards the riding centre, following the sign. There was a charming old building for the horses and a large indoor riding area. Bonnie looked around, but no one was there. She approached the horses with a sense of respect. The horses were well cared for, and she noticed that immediately. Almost every stall was occupied, and she walked along, carefully observing each horse. “I know what you’re doing here,” she said to a small pony, gently touching its nose. Then she saw the next horse and stopped. “But aren’t you the best one!” she exclaimed. He was brown with a bit of white. He looked lively, which Bonnie liked. “I feel like we’ve met before,” she said, stroking his neck. “In my dreams, I was riding you to victory in a big competition…” Above the stall was his name: Maverick. Suddenly, she couldn’t resist the urge to ride him. “I wonder where I can find a bridle and a saddle. They can’t be far.” She was thrilled to find that the room with the riding gear was unlocked. While she was busy putting a saddle on Maverick, she forgot all about her mother and the headmaster. When she climbed onto the big horse outside, she felt like a queen, in control of everything around her. Her old school nickname had been Queen Bee, and she laughed as she remembered it. “You’re the best horse I’ve ever ridden, Maverick,” she said with admiration. “I really mean it because I know about horses, even if I don’t know much else.” She nudged him to walk, then to trot. “If I stay here, I think we could become great friends,” she said. She rode around the paddock, feeling exhilarated as a gentle breeze brushed against her cheek. She sensed that Maverick trusted her, and she was sure he would jump well."
43,"I have met Cody Simpson before and have always admired his calm confidence. The 15-year-old Australian has already released many successful songs. So, how did a relaxed surfer end up performing in front of thousands of fans? Cody explains, “I first picked up a guitar when I was six and started writing songs at seven.” He remembers that swimming and surfing were his main interests back then. At 13, while in high school, he posted a few videos online.

These videos changed everything. He started by sharing a video of himself and a friend singing at a school concert. Fans began to comment online, asking for more videos. Cody, who had recorded more songs at home, was happy to share them. The response was incredible. 

Cody was also a talented swimmer, training hard with top coaches. However, record labels showed interest in him, and he faced a difficult decision: stay in Australia and continue swimming or take a big risk by signing a deal and moving to the US with his family. Cody decided to take the leap. “It was very hard for me, especially at such a young age, to choose a career. Can you imagine being 12 or 13 and trying to decide what you want to do for the rest of your life?” He had to tell his swimming coach and friends about his move to the States. “It surprised most people. I’m the quiet kid,” he recalls, remembering their shocked faces. “I’m very modest, and I think it’s important to stay that way in this crazy industry.”

So, Cody packed his bags and traveled halfway around the world, giving up one dream to pursue another. Although his family stays out of the spotlight and is not directly involved in his career, they support him from behind the scenes. Cody believes it’s important to have a close circle of good people around you to stay grounded. 

Of course, everyone has moments of doubt. “Sometimes when I’m alone, I think, ‘How does my decision affect my little brother and sister?’ My little brother is eight years old and travels the world, doing school on the road; he doesn’t have a normal life,” Cody admits. “I worry about how this affects him, but my family always reassures me that they support me in everything I do.”

Success in any career comes from being willing to say ‘yes’ to opportunities, even when it’s scary. “Everything happened so quickly and unexpectedly,” Cody says. “Now, I’m visiting countries I never thought I would see and performing in front of hundreds of thousands of fans. It’s something many people dream of achieving, but I know it won’t last forever.”"
44,"I jumped out of bed, pulled back a corner of the bedroom curtain, and looked down at the river bend. A new crack in the ice sparkled in the morning sun. I shaded my eyes and looked upstream at the sandbags, which were there to protect the buildings from flooding as the ice melted. My back still hurt from lifting the sandbags into place. Last week, I had worked long hours with most of the adults in town, showing that I could handle the job. My grandfather, however, didn’t seem to notice. 

With one hand still on the curtain, I scanned the half-mile stretch of dark water created by the release pipe from the wood processing factory in Milltown. On either side were fragile ice shelves, and downstream was solid ice. As I took off my pajamas and put on my kayaking wetsuit, I noticed a boy on the far side of the river. I didn’t recognize him. He was trying to balance on an ice shelf near the warm water from the factory. I zipped up my wetsuit and grabbed my kayaking jacket, checking the pocket for my lucky chain—a silver chain my famous grandfather brought back from an expedition in South America. This chain is more special to me than having a famous grandfather, as only he, my mom, and I know about it. I also have his diary from that journey, which I keep under my pillow and read before I sleep. 

I patted the chain and went to the kitchen. “Good morning, Rex,” my mom said with a smile as I took a banana from the counter. “You’re up early for a Saturday. I’ll make brunch after your training session. Be careful.” “Thanks, Mom,” I replied, heading down the hallway. I almost bumped into my tall grandfather as he stepped out of his room. “Can’t you watch where you’re going?” he shouted. “Where are you going?” 

“Sorry, Grandpa. I’m going kayaking,” I said, even though my wetsuit made it clear. He often gets angry, and lately, it has been harder for me to ignore it. “What’s the point of training? You didn’t win the competition,” he said. His harsh words hit me hard, but I took a deep breath and counted to three. He walked away and slammed the bathroom door. My mom came over with a sympathetic smile. “Don’t mind him. He’s…” “...not himself at the moment,” I finished for her. I held back from saying he has always been like this. Like my mom, I try to be understanding. 

When I was younger, he was my hero, especially when he showed me photos of himself in National Geographic magazine. Those old photos still hang on his bedroom wall, along with his dusty medals and trophies. But I don’t go into his room anymore. I have my own collection of trophies to look at, and maybe one day, my own face in National Geographic. Still, a part of me wants to stay loyal to him, this grumpy old man. 

My mom smiled. “At least he’s coming out of his room more. Have a good session, Rex. I admire your determination to keep going, even in this cold!” I smiled back as I peeled my banana. “It’ll be warmer in South America,” I said, “if I find sponsors for my expedition.” She laughed and went back to the kitchen. I finished my banana and went downstairs. Stepping into the backyard, I hurried towards the boathouse."
45,"Mum grabbed Jess by the arm. ""Come with me,"" she said. Jess followed her into the study, where she saw an unframed painting on the table, leaning against the wall. It was clearly one of Grandpa's works, but it looked different from his usual style and was obviously unfinished. ""Do you know anything about this?"" Mum asked. Jess shook her head. ""I've never seen it before. I didn't know he was working on anything."" 

Jess looked closely at the painting. A river took up most of the scene; it was not a river she recognized and might not even be real, just a fantasy. The painting was strange and beautiful in a haunting way. The riverbank was barely visible, with just a hint of green that the eye almost missed, drawing attention to the pale waters leading to a hidden sea. There were no animals, birds, or people, and it felt right that way. It seemed like there was no place for living things in this distant vision. Yet, for some reason, she found it captivating, thinking about autumn coming after a long summer.

Mum spoke again. ""It has a name."" There was something in her voice that showed her excitement, even though she tried to sound casual. Jess understood why. Grandpa never named his paintings; he just painted them and let others interpret them. Mum turned the painting over and pointed to the words Grandpa had written. Jess read them aloud: ""River Boy."" The words felt strangely significant to her, but she couldn't explain why. 

Then she noticed something else. She looked at Mum. ""There is no boy."" 

""Exactly. It's strange, isn't it? For him to be so specific. But since he hasn't finished it yet, maybe he plans to add the boy later. I made the mistake of asking him about it."" 

""Mum! You should have known better."" 

""I know, but I couldn't help it. It's such an unusual painting, especially with a name. You can guess his response."" 

Jess didn't need to guess. She knew Grandpa would have said, ""It's not the artist's job to explain a painting. Each picture has its own life and language, like a poem, and we either understand it or we don't. Painting is hard work without having to explain it to everyone."" 

Mum laughed and added, ""Something like that. Anyway, I was hoping you might know something about this painting since you seem to inspire him."" 

""Inspire?"" 

""Yes, someone who motivates an artist."" Jess understood the term. Grandpa often used it when she watched him paint, but he usually meant that the muse was not helping him that day or that he needed to be nice to the muse because he had a tough part to work on. He never suggested that the muse was her. In fact, she always thought he meant some kind of goddess, not a real person. It was hard to imagine anyone, even a goddess, influencing someone as stubborn as Grandpa. 

""He doesn't need me to inspire him,"" she said. ""He's been painting all his life."""
46,"When I woke up this morning, I didn’t plan to cut a hole in my bedroom carpet. I’m not saying it was an accident, but it could have been. For example, if I had tripped over the bed with Dad’s Stanley knife in my hand, the blade might have accidentally gone into the carpet and made a big hole. That’s something that could have happened. I’m not claiming it did, just that it was a possibility. I didn’t wake up thinking, “Today I will cut a hole in my carpet.” It just seemed like a good idea at the moment, as often happens. Later, I wondered why I thought that, but by then it was too late. This kind of thing happens to me quite often. I’m a bit unlucky in that way.

What I was really doing was trying to find a way to fit my corner cabinet into a corner. Gran gave me the cabinet when she moved from her house to a flat. It’s very cute! It’s small, painted white, with pink and blue flowers around the edge, and it has tiny glass doors. Gran used to keep china ornaments in it, like shepherdesses and old-fashioned ladies selling balloons. Now, I keep my collection of shells, fossils, and interesting stones there. Gran knew I loved her corner cabinet, so I was thrilled when she gave it to me!

The problem is, it’s a corner cabinet, which means it has to fit in a corner. I only have two corners in my bedroom because it’s the smallest room in the house, shaped like a wedge of cheese. The big front bedroom belongs to Mum and Dad; the back one is my sister Angela’s; the little one over the garage is my brother Tom’s; and the tiny one, like a broom cupboard, is mine. Mum says that when Angela goes to university, Tom can have her room, and I can have his. Then, when Tom goes to university, I can choose any room. But since Angela is only fifteen, I think I’ll be stuck in my small room for a long time. 

I don’t really mind; I like my little bedroom. It’s cozy, like a nest. I love the sloping roof and the window at floor level. The only issue is the lack of corners! My bed is in one corner, and my wardrobe is in the other. I tried to fit Gran’s cabinet into the space between the roof and the floor, but it was just a bit too tall. If I could only cut a couple of centimeters off the bottom of it... That’s when I had an idea. If I couldn’t cut the cabinet, why not cut a hole in the carpet? It seemed like the obvious solution. Dad calls this “lateral thinking.” I thought he would be pleased with me because he always tells us to “think outside the box.” And that’s exactly what I was doing!"
47,"The novel ""The Borrowers"" tells the story of a family of tiny people who live secretly in the walls and floors of a house. They ""borrow"" items from the regular-sized people to survive. When I was asked to direct a TV version of the book, I knew it would be challenging to meet people's expectations. Fans of the book have strong opinions about how it should be portrayed. I used the original illustrations from the book as a guide because I wanted to avoid criticism for getting it wrong. The author wanted the series to show the story from the Borrowers' point of view, which made filming more complicated.

A key aspect was getting the scale right. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans, so when we filmed them walking across a room or going on their borrowing adventures, we had to position the camera ten times further away than usual. To capture the Borrowers' perspective, the crew had to crawl on the ground and film from no higher than 15 centimeters. They went through many pairs of jeans! We only raised the cameras for aerial shots. 

One major challenge was creating realistic shadows when combining the tiny Borrowers with the normal-sized background. We developed a special technique for this. After the series aired, famous director George Lucas called to ask how we achieved it. The only permanent set we built was the Borrowers' home under the floor, filled with oversized objects to make the actors appear small. It was wonderfully surreal. I remember asking them to carry giant scissors, and they really embraced the idea. The coins we used were larger than dinner plates and hard to lift, which often made the crew laugh. 

In the story, there is a scene where the Borrowers are swept down a drain. To film this, the actors had to be pushed down a tunnel with hoses, and they found it so scary that they didn’t need to act. A crucial part of the production was getting the costumes right. I had them made from heavy canvas so they would look like doll clothes. This made it very difficult for the lead actress to move; she couldn’t sit down during breaks and had to be sewn into her dress every morning. The lead actor's trousers were made from a rug to avoid a smooth look. Unfortunately, it was very hot during filming, and I don’t think they appreciated my attention to detail!

Most of the scenes away from the Borrowers' home were filmed with the actors in front of a blue screen on an empty set. It was challenging for them to react to things that weren’t really there. I had to draw pictures of each scene to show how they should look, and by the end, I had created 2,000 sketches. They weren’t perfect, but they were helpful. The budget didn’t allow for daytime special effects work, so I spent three months working nights. We had to work quickly; I once filmed an entire scene before realizing there was no film in the camera. In the end, everything came together, and I believe the series successfully captured the magic of the books."
48,"Mom stops the car at the corner of my new school, Palm Grove High School. She looks around nervously, expecting to see journalists, but there are none. I wonder how long it will take for the chaos to start. It always does. The fake smiles, the people who want to be my friends, and the ones who ask for free tickets to my dad’s concerts. “Everything will be fine,” I tell her. She kisses her fingertip and touches my cheek before I get out of the car. Then she drives away, leaving me alone in this new school and situation. But this is what I wanted. I wanted to escape my old life of touring and tutors. While the rest of the band is here for recording, we are staying for good. I insisted on coming to this school because I want to meet regular kids. How about a kid whose mom works in an office or a dad who mows lawns? That would be so cool. 

I walk into the school office. “Hi, I need my schedule, please,” I say to the secretary. “Name?” she asks, looking unfriendly. “Desert McGraw.” “Desirée?” she asks, leaning closer. “Desert,” I repeat. The secretary seems confused. “Oh,” she says, typing my last name. That’s one good thing; few people recognize my last name because my dad uses a stage name. “What grade?” “Eleventh.” “One moment, it’s printing,” she says. Then she tears the sheet and hands it to me. English Literature is my first class. Great, I can handle that. English has always been my favorite subject. I’ll be late, though. English is in Room 214 on the second floor. I studied the map last night so I wouldn’t look foolish searching for my classes. 

When I reach the door, I hear the teacher taking attendance. “Aurelio Gonzalez.” “Here.” I slip in quietly and sit at the last desk in the second row. The girl next to me smiles. She looks at my normal but clever outfit—jeans and a T-shirt. No one will suspect me now! “Nice shoes,” she whispers. I look down at my expensive shoes with tan flowers. Oh no, I shouldn’t have worn these. “Thanks,” I say. The teacher pauses. “Desert... McGraw?” she says carefully. “Here.” The teacher smiles and introduces herself as Ms. Smigla. She talks a lot and gives us our course outlines. After discussing the books we need to read this year, she actually lets us socialize! All teachers should understand how important this is. 

“So why did you move here?” my new friend asks. I have many options. Should I say it’s because I wanted a normal life away from cameras and reporters? Or the real reason, according to Dad? “We need a change, Desert,” he said, “and this is the perfect place to record the new album. Energy, color, culture... just what our last album needed.” Essence? I think he just wants to relax on the beach. Why else would they choose South Beach Sounds, a studio right by the sand? “My dad had to relocate,” I tell her. Yes, lies work better. “What does he do?” she asks. Oh well, everyone will find out eventually. But at least I can pretend to be normal for a while. “He’s an artist,” I say, fiddling with my backpack zipper. “Cool. I’m Becca, by the way.” And she doesn’t seem to care much. Great."
49,"Not only is the average American teenage girl expected to be the president of the Student Council, but she also needs to have a part-time job, volunteer, and excel in all these areas. This is what it means to be a teenager in America today. Both boys and girls cannot just go to school and blend in; being average is no longer enough. Mediocrity is not acceptable, and lacking ambition is seen as laziness. 

Kristen Loose, a teenager, explains, “People, often adults, forget how much pressure teenagers face today. We have a lot of homework, tests, extracurricular activities, jobs, chores, and responsibilities at home, all while trying to maintain a social life.” Despite these pressures being common in teenage life today, negative stereotypes about teenagers still exist, often spread by the media. These stereotypes include being lazy, disrespectful, rebellious, loud, reckless, and self-centered. While some teenagers may fit these descriptions, many believe it is unfair to label the entire generation this way. 

Kristen Loose argues that many people think teenagers spend most of their time watching TV or using their phones. She acknowledges that she often has her phone nearby, but not for trivial reasons. It is not just for texting friends; it is a tool that helps teenagers manage their lives. Today, students are expected to have quick access to information and be reachable at all times, which can create the impression of a phone addiction. With smartphones, tablets, and social media, students can do their homework anywhere. Instead of just listening to music on the way to school, they might be listening to language lessons. Schoolwork and other activities now require constant attention from already busy teens.

Many teenagers start their days around 6 a.m. or 7 a.m. and often finish after midnight. Their schedules are filled with school, after-school activities, family responsibilities, and homework. They then have to wake up and do it all over again the next day, often getting less than the recommended nine hours of sleep each night. A survey by the US National Sleep Foundation found that only about 20 percent of American teenagers get the recommended nine hours of sleep. Additionally, 28 percent of teens admitted to falling asleep in school about once a week due to lack of sleep.

Teenager Lindamarie Olsen believes that after all her activities, she has about 18 hours of free time each week. With 168 hours in a week, 18 hours is not much. Olsen rarely spends this time on social media or watching TV; instead, she dedicates it to volunteer work. She says, “People often think teenagers only care about themselves and their own interests.” However, Olsen finds that her favorite part of the week is volunteering. “I love helping others and look forward to making a positive impact in my school and community.”

In 20 years, the stereotype of teenagers may change, but they will continue to challenge these views and push the world forward. There will always be a new generation of students making a difference before they even finish school."
50,"The teenage members of the Earth to Sky Calculus Club live in Bishop, a mountain town in the US, surrounded by wilderness east of the Sierra Nevada mountains. In recent years, this small group has launched over fifty balloons to the edge of space, about 35 km above the Earth. This ongoing science project combines astronomy and adventure, which is likely why teenagers participate. I joined them one weekend in late spring as they prepared to release a high-altitude balloon to capture images of shooting stars. Shooting stars happen when a rock or metal piece from space enters the Earth's atmosphere, creating a bright trail.

As night falls, the teenagers attach a soft insulated $5 lunch box to the balloon. Inside, there is a camera, an altitude measuring device, and a thermometer to track temperature changes during the ascent. Two GPS trackers are placed on the outside of the lunch box to help them find it later. They use a gas tank, donated by a supporter from a nearby state, to inflate the balloon, which gradually expands to the size of a small car. An older boy made a seven-hour round trip to get the tank, but he didn’t mind. For these kids, such efforts are normal.

Finally, it’s time for lift-off. They count down, “Five, four, three, two, one,” and the balloon starts to rise. Some of the teenagers run after it, shining powerful flashlights to track its path in the dark sky. There is a moment of silence and a shared sense of wonder as the balloon disappears into the night. After the launch, most students go home, but a few stay to watch the shooting stars. They lie on blankets on the mountainside, gazing at a sky so clear it’s hard to believe they are only four hours from Los Angeles, a busy city with around 4 million people. I see a boy climb into a sleeping bag and quickly fall asleep. “We’re the only ones talking,” one girl whispers. “I know,” replies another. Suddenly, a meteor streaks across the sky.

As the balloon rises, the air pressure decreases, causing it to expand until it is nearly the size of a house. Then it pops with a loud bang. A parachute ensures the equipment inside the lunch box lands safely back on Earth. The students will retrieve it the next day using the GPS trackers. Finding it is not easy, but that’s part of the fun. There is little inhabited land around Bishop, so the lunch box usually lands in a remote area. “Recoveries are a big part of the program,” says the group’s leader, noting they have only lost two lunch boxes in 53 launches. “This journey helps us become more familiar with the landscape in a way we normally wouldn’t.”

On this occasion, the lunch box landed 84 km west of Bishop. To reach it, the recovery team had to drive south of the Sierra and then back up the western side of the mountains. They had to decide whether to drive or walk, as it could be dangerous if the lunch box landed on a high peak or in a tall tree. “These students are familiar with the Eastern Sierra,” their leader explains. “What seems wild to some is just a normal part of life for others.” In the end, it took them 11 hours to find the lunch box, which was in a canyon on a flat rock near a waterfall. Unfortunately, the camera did not capture any shooting stars. While this was disappointing, it provided a chance to discuss atmospheric waves and their effects above mountains. It also became another exciting story to share with anyone who asks."
51,"Chloe Morgan admits that she was not very interested in science, especially Palaeontology, until she turned fifteen. Her interest began by chance when her younger brother was fascinated by dinosaurs, a phase many children go through. Although she had dismissed this interest before, she helped him with a science project and came across an article about recent discoveries in Palaeontology that amazed her. She realized she wanted to pursue this field.

I asked Chloe what support she received, as Palaeontology was not a common career choice for young people at that time. She recalled meeting her first professional palaeontologist, Matt Cornelius, who was already well-known despite his youth. Although she was nervous, he was friendly and patient, which made her feel more comfortable.

I brought up how palaeontologists are often portrayed in movies and TV shows. Chloe expressed her frustration, noting that films like Jurassic Park have increased public interest in dinosaurs but often misrepresent palaeontologists. She feels they are usually shown as either quirky geniuses or socially awkward individuals, which does not reflect the reality of their work.

Chloe explained that her job is very diverse. She spends time digging for dinosaur bones, working in laboratories to analyze fossils, and writing scientific papers. Although not always required, she also believes in the importance of communicating scientific findings to the public, especially to young people. She wants to inspire them to learn about science, using dinosaurs as a way to spark their interest in the natural world.

The recent TV documentary Walking with Dinosaurs gave Chloe a chance to influence how dinosaurs are shown on screen. She noted that the producers were knowledgeable, and her role was mainly to ensure accuracy, such as confirming that the dinosaurs depicted lived during the same time period. The program attracted viewers of all ages because it presented dinosaurs in a way that was much more realistic than in movies like Jurassic Park.

Chloe believes that dinosaurs continue to captivate us and remain a focus of research because they appeal to our natural curiosity and desire for discovery. In a world that feels smaller, prehistoric creatures remind us that there is still much to explore, and Palaeontology offers a unique way to travel back in time."
52,"When you travel by car with your family, even if you are just six years old, you probably know that you are not ""there yet,"" even if you keep asking, ""Are we there yet?"" The truth is, once you arrive, it’s not ""there"" anymore; it’s ""here."" So if you think you might be ""there,"" you should really be asking, ""Are we here yet?"" 

Parents often wish they were ""there"" more than anyone else, especially when they hear that question repeatedly during long car trips. Think about it: wouldn’t you rather relax in the back seat, with no responsibilities? You could watch DVDs, listen to music, or do puzzles while enjoying the beautiful views outside. Meanwhile, one of your parents is in the front seat, managing snacks and the radio, making sure everything goes smoothly.

But then, something unexpected happens—usually caused by my younger brother, Tim. He might put his foot on my side of the seat, which is not okay! I respond by putting my foot on his side, and soon we are both fighting for space. Our parents have to reach back to separate us while driving, telling Tim to stay in his own seat. This calms things down for a bit, and we can enjoy the scenery again.

Later, while I’m trying to read, I feel a draft on my arm. The window isn’t open, so where is it coming from? Tim is next to me, quietly blowing air in my direction. He’s not touching me, so he thinks he’s being clever. This makes me angry, and soon there’s more yelling and swerving as our parents try to keep control of the car.

Over the years, Dad has come up with ways to handle our questions. When we ask, ""Are we there yet?"" he often replies, ""Yes, we’re here. Get out of the car."" When we point out that we are still on the highway, he says, ""Oh, then maybe we’re not there yet."" This usually keeps us quiet for a while. 

You can tell when you finally arrive because the adults quickly get out of the car and move away from us kids. So remember: if your parents are still close enough to answer your question, the answer is no, you are not ""there"" yet."
53,"John and Zuzi Morgan have opened a café in Oxford, UK, where people can enjoy coffee, cake, and play board games. They hope that customers will love the experience and want to come back. Zuzi explains their motivation: “There is so much technology today. Everyone is busy with their phones and gadgets. We wanted to bring people together in a way that doesn’t involve staring at screens. It’s natural for people to connect and communicate with each other.”

The games played in their café are called ‘Eurogames’. These games often have gentle themes, like farming and building landscapes. The first Eurogame was The Settlers of Catan, created by German designer Klaus Teuber. In this game, players build settlements on an island and trade resources, keeping everyone engaged until the end, so no one feels left out. This idea was further developed in ‘co-operative’ games, where all players either win or lose together, encouraging more social interaction. One popular co-operative game is Pandemic, designed by North American Matt Leacock. In Pandemic, players work together to solve global problems. Leacock was inspired by a Eurogame called Lord of the Rings, which is based on the book. He recalls, “When I played that with friends, we felt scared and excited. In the end, everyone felt good, whether they won or lost. I wanted to create something like that.”

Leacock’s love for board games started when he was a child. He enjoyed receiving games as gifts but often felt disappointed when they didn’t meet his expectations. With help from his uncle, he began redesigning games to make them better. Pandemic became a huge success, and its follow-up introduced even more storytelling elements. Leacock explains, “It’s like an electronic game where you develop characters, learn new rules, and the story changes as you play.”

Interestingly, the rise of video games has helped the popularity of modern board games. Many people now play games on their smartphones, making them more open to playing board games. Ben Hogg, who works for a major games company, says, “Everyone plays mobile games now. Most people with smartphones have at least one game they enjoy.” 

For a while, video games allowed for social interaction in arcades or through multiplayer games played in the same room. However, as multiplayer games moved online, players became more distant from each other. This led some people to seek out ways to play games with others in person again. 

As seen in John and Zuzi's busy café, tabletop gaming has become more than just entertainment. In our increasingly online world, games are now something to be shared directly and physically, and this trend is likely to continue."
54,"Jamie Scott has written and produced some of the biggest hits in the UK in recent years. His story shows that endurance and persistence are crucial in the music industry, even if your career starts with many setbacks. He mentions that his mother was an incredible singer who introduced him to the guitar. The only radio station he listened to at home was one aimed at middle-aged listeners, which influenced his musical taste as he grew up. He was 12 years old when he first heard a modern song. Around the same time, he had to choose between playing tennis, which he did at a national level, and pursuing music. He often spent his lunch breaks in the school music room learning songs on the piano. He recalls, “I was quite good at tennis, but it wasn’t what I wanted to do for my life. It was just too much hard work.”

At 17, he left school to pursue a career as a performer. He formed a duo with a friend who was a decent guitarist but not as passionate about performing. Jamie remembers going to his parents and expressing his desire to pursue music, saying he had been writing lyrics during economics class and practicing the piano every day while others played outside. His father gave him 18 months to succeed; if he didn’t, he would need to find a job. After several close calls with record labels, he was signed by a music publisher at 19 based on one song. However, the labels wanted him to be a solo artist, so he had to part ways with his friend.

Ultimately, Jamie found success behind the scenes rather than on stage. After a tough time with a UK record label, he asked to be released and moved to another label to produce a new album. However, fame and success did not come easily. He reflects, “I feel like I’ve often been in the wrong place at the wrong time in my own artist career, but as a writer, I’ve been in the right place at the right time.” Writing for other artists is where he truly excelled. He believes he is one of the main writers in the UK that labels turn to for new artists, helping them launch their careers.

Sometimes, he has to reassure the artists he works with that aiming for chart success is not something to be embarrassed about. He asks them, “Why don’t you want to reach 10 million streams next month? I’m not saying they should write a bad song, but we should create something that both they and I think is amazing and likely to sell well.” It is refreshing to hear someone in pop music speak openly about wanting to write hit songs. Jamie is not arrogant; he simply understands that he wants to write number one hits and has the talent to do so. Instead of worrying about how others perceive him, he focuses on his goals. He states, “When I go into the studio with someone, we need to aim for global success and write the best music for next year. It’s not just about what’s trendy; we want to create classic modern pop songs.”"
55,"Tony Connor is a new kind of celebrity. He is very popular online, but many people, like me, may not know him because we don’t watch videos of people doing bike tricks. He is known as a ‘street trials cyclist.’ This means he jumps from difficult places, like roofs or walls, to land safely in other challenging spots. These stunts are recorded and shared online.

On the day I interview him, we meet at a BMX park on a Saturday morning. The local kids know who he is, and several older people come to greet him, calling him ‘an absolute legend.’ After watching him perform, I agree with them. I came with some doubts, but I am impressed by his bravery, creativity, and willingness to take risks. Before each stunt, he explains what he plans to do, and sometimes I can’t believe he will succeed. When I compliment him afterward, he seems uninterested and a bit down. Despite his online fame, Tony says he is not comfortable with being a celebrity. He finds the social aspect challenging. He understands the importance of connecting with fans, but he prefers to focus on doing his tricks rather than talking about them.

This is ironic because his fame comes from social media and the small cameras that capture his stunts. He says, “This technology allows people like me to earn a living.” He feels that many people are always recording themselves or looking at screens, and he doesn’t fully agree with that. However, he is not complaining. Through his videos, he makes a good income from what would have been just a hobby in the past.

After many years of interviewing top athletes, I have learned that two key factors help a passionate child become a top competitor: energy and the ability to handle emotional disappointment. These traits can be more important than talent and help someone keep going despite failures. In risky sports, it is even more important to have mental strength. Even in the park, Tony fell a few times on what he considered easy but new challenges. He simply got back up and kept trying until he succeeded.

Not everyone sees Tony as a hero. Some people think he is reckless and takes too many risks. He responds, “Those who criticize me may be worried, but they don’t understand. They probably have never ridden a trials bike and don’t know much about the sport. They don’t realize that I get advice from experts to reduce risks.” In reality, Tony is careful about the risks he takes. He explains, “People are different. Some never feel scared, and they shouldn’t be doing these sports. It’s important to recognize the dangers. Others can overcome their fear, and I am in that group. I feel fear but find a way to move past it. I am not addicted to risk; I spend a lot of time planning and preparing. Sometimes, I ride around for a while to get in the right mindset before trying a new stunt. I know I must stay calm just before I jump. If I fully commit, I will be fine.”"
56,"Television presenter Helen Skelton has taken on many dangerous challenges for charity, such as running a marathon in the desert and traveling down the Amazon River in a small boat. For her latest challenge, Helen walked on a high wire, which is a long, thin piece of metal, 66 meters above the ground, between two towers of an empty power station. There was no safety net; she only had a belt around her waist connected to another wire above her. To help her balance and avoid falling, she carried a long stick that weighed eight kilograms. 

Helen trained with an expert high-wire walker. Although she had some circus skills, she found that high-wire walking was very different. “The training was a shock,” Helen said. “I didn’t realize how strong I needed to be. Every day started at 8 am with a run up a steep hill, followed by an hour of exercises, and then another hour practicing on the wire. I also had to learn how to fall onto the wire so I could continue if I slipped. Every time I fell, it hurt a lot. But it was important to stay positive: if I got nervous and started shaking, the wire would shake too!”

On the day of the challenge, it was windy, and Helen calmed herself by taking deep breaths as she moved step by step along the wire. The 150-meter walk took 15 minutes. “That was the scariest thing I’ve done,” she said afterward. “I’m glad it’s over!” Despite this experience, Helen is already planning her next charity project: to reach the South Pole by skiing, kiting, and biking."
57,"In 2006, Jeff Somers started a journey around the world on a penny farthing, an old-style bicycle with one large wheel and one small wheel. He had previously written a book about his travels in Canada using a 50-year-old car. Jeff loved motorsport and worked building racing car engines. To save money, he rode an old bicycle to work and also used it for a holiday in Amsterdam. He said, “That trip opened my eyes,” and decided to explore the world by bike. 

Jeff wanted a unique touring bike and decided to build one himself. He thought the most unusual bike would be a penny farthing, so he visited a museum to learn how they were made. After two attempts in 2001 and 2003, which ended due to a knee injury, he finally began his journey in 2006. He traveled for three years, visiting 23 countries across four continents. The highlight of his trip was reaching Tibet and seeing Mount Everest. 

Although he met cyclists who could ride up mountains, which he could not do, he never regretted using his penny farthing. The further he traveled from home, the more people were amazed by his bike. His toughest experience was having to drink dirty water from a stream, which caused him a serious fever. He spent ten days in a hostel without medicine and had no money for a hospital or to return home. Despite these challenges, Jeff now says, “If I could afford it, I would start traveling again tomorrow on my penny farthing.”"
58,"I work at a university in the United States, where my team and I are studying water birds, especially the American black duck. We have recently started using a new tool called a ‘night-vision scope’ that helps us see the ducks in the dark. We are concerned about the black duck population because their numbers have decreased significantly, and we are unsure if there is enough food for them on the east coast. 

We have a lot of information about their activities during the day, but we know very little about what they do at night because we did not have the right equipment. This new scope will give us clear images, even on nights without a moon, allowing us to learn more and make better decisions about protecting their habitat.

Our work is challenging. There are four of us, and each of us works six hours a day. We have studied ducks in various locations, and I have had to take a boat to some sites to record every duck I see. The weather has been difficult; some nights are mild, but many are rainy. It is so quiet that I have needed a lot of coffee to stay awake! We have only missed one workday because the snow was too deep for our special vehicles. 

Despite the challenges, I enjoy this work, especially when I think about the summer ahead, which will involve long hours in a laboratory analyzing our findings together. Being indoors will be tough, but it is necessary. I wouldn’t change this experience for anything!"
59,"Whenever I tell people about my job, they often find it hard to believe it exists. But I’m serious! I spend my workdays tasting chocolate! Tasting is a crucial part of ensuring that customers receive perfect, high-quality chocolate from my company. Each week, I get samples, which are small amounts of chocolate from our factory, and I need to check them for taste, texture, and smell. I also taste the raw materials we use, like nuts and fruit, to select the best ones for our chocolate. 

Next to my office, I have a kitchen where I can test and taste the products I create, and I share samples with my colleagues to keep them happy! My kitchen is filled with machines and ingredients that I can experiment with. It’s great to have a private space to go to during the day. No two days are the same in this job. Sometimes I work in our food lab, and other times I travel abroad to buy raw materials, which can be challenging since I have a young family. However, I enjoy the variety and lack of routine in my work, although I think the chocolate itself is the best part! 

People often ask me if I ever get bored of chocolate. I’ve worked with it for a long time, and I’ve never felt tired of eating it. In fact, I often go home and enjoy more chocolate in the evening!"
60,"Have you ever thought about what it’s like to perform in a circus? Sophia Grayson works at Circus Experience, a place that teaches young people circus skills. She says her course is popular because it offers many different skills, such as juggling, throwing and catching objects like balls or even fire, and trapeze, which involves flying through the air in front of an amazed audience. 

During the year-long course, students gradually take more risks in each class, and parents can attend some classes to see their progress. Sophia explains, “To have a career in the circus, performers need to avoid doing the same thing repeatedly – it’s essential to keep performances exciting and dynamic. If you want to succeed in the circus, you must keep practicing. Another great aspect is the friendships formed with other performers and the opportunity to learn from them. Staying fit is also very important – circus artists, like athletes, train every day to stay strong. Training is crucial, but the best performers are those who are determined to succeed, have creativity, and continuously work on improving their skills. 

People often think that circus performers are likely to get injured or that they only work for a short time each year. However, the real challenge is planning for the future because you can only perform while you’re young, and then you need to think about other career options.” The course also includes lessons on business planning. Many former students have started their own businesses around the world and are happy to share their experiences. However, Sophia warns that it’s not a profession for making a lot of money! “The work usually does not provide a regular salary. It’s also very competitive – but it’s a lot of fun!”"
61,"You may not know her name or face, but you have likely heard her many times. Mariam Hobson is a professional backing singer, which means she sings in the background to support the main singer. Some people think backing singers are not good enough to be lead singers, but that is not true; they often have to be even better. People like Mariam are the true stars of the music industry!

“What I love about my job is that when I enter the recording studio, I never know what I will be asked to sing,” she says. “It could be classical, jazz, hip-hop, or rock. Sometimes, it might even be a silly tune for a radio station or an advertisement. I am often surprised by what producers ask for. Once, I was asked to sing like a fish underwater! But I never complain; I just do my job!”

“Excellent musical skills are very important for my work, along with the ability to learn quickly. There is often no sheet music to follow. I will always remember my first experience recording background music for a film. It was very complicated because there were eight of us, each singing a different part, along with an orchestra. I was scared because I knew that if I made a mistake, we would have to record everything again, which nobody likes. Recording sessions are already long enough.”

“One of my favorite jobs is recording for songwriters. Less experienced writers sometimes do not know which musical range works best for a female voice. By listening to me sing their song, they can figure out how to improve it.”"
62,"Julie Deane started with only basic knowledge of fashion but built a successful business selling ‘satchels,’ which are traditional bags used by schoolchildren. These satchels are now sold in famous stores and are popular among many celebrities. Before deciding to sell satchels, Julie considered various business ideas, such as cake decorating and party planning, instead of just going with her first thought. 

When she chose to focus on satchels, not everyone supported her idea. Julie recalls, “Many said there was no demand for them – but I was convinced.” She involved her family from the beginning, working with her mother, who had never had a job but had a natural talent for business. The design of the satchels was inspired by children’s storybooks. 

Although Julie was not familiar with fashion blogs, they played a key role in her success. Initially, she sold about one satchel a week. To generate interest, she sent satchels to fashion writers, hoping they would write about them in their blogs. They did, and interest in her products grew, along with the speed at which her company produced them. Now, Julie enjoys waiting to see which celebrity will be seen with a satchel next!

While other companies spend money on online ads, Julie uses the internet community to gather ideas for new styles, keeping her products fresh and exciting. She faced a tough time when another company copied her satchel design to sell similar items. Because of this, she now ensures she has confidence in her production team, just as she does in her own staff. Visitors often comment on the positive atmosphere in her offices, where people enjoy working. There is now a new factory, and while the buildings are important, it is the team that makes the workplace special."
63,"When Vicky Harmiston was a child, her parents allowed her and her brother Jamie to choose how they spent their free time. Vicky enjoyed playing many sports. She was a good swimmer, and her coach believed she could become a champion. However, the swimming club was far from her home, making it hard for her to balance training with schoolwork. 

As teenagers, Jamie, who loved cycling, bought a special racing bike and began competing. Vicky found this exciting and decided to try cycling too. She later said it was the best choice she ever made. Soon, she was cycling every day and doing very well. The track was close to her school, so attending training sessions after school was easy for her. Vicky had a successful career in track cycling and won several competitions. When she turned 28, she retired from competitive cycling. Vicky explained, “For years, I loved winning, but I started to feel tired of it all. When the excitement fades, it loses its meaning. Fortunately, I found a new career.”

Vicky began working for a charity called CycleZone. “We help young people who have never enjoyed sports,” she said. “The first thing we do is teach them to ride a bike. We want them to believe in themselves and their abilities. CycleZone does great work and brings young people together, making them feel part of a larger community.” The charity uses celebrities to promote its activities. Vicky mentioned, “Some people doubt that celebrity support is always good for a charity. They argue that celebrities may be more interested in their own image, which can distract from the charity's real work. But if famous singers and actors can help, I believe they should.”"
64,"Singer-songwriter Ana Ronson grew up in Ireland. Even though her parents were not musicians, music was always present in her home. Her grandfather played the guitar and taught Ana and her brother how to play. The first time Ana sang in front of an audience was at school, and she was so nervous that her teacher had to help her off the stage. This teacher suggested that she join the school theatre club to build her confidence. After participating in the club for some time, she happily sang with 50 other students at a concert at the end of the term.

A year later, her brother, who was in a band, asked her to write a song for them. She wrote her first song, ""Falling Stars,"" in just three days and enjoyed the process so much that she signed up for a songwriting course with a professional songwriter. Although she was the youngest student, she already knew more about music than many of her classmates. However, Ana felt that the teacher did not pay attention to her ideas, which inspired her to write the song ""Something to Say"" about her frustration. She shared this song online, and it became very popular. She was thrilled to receive comments from people who loved it and found new meanings in the lyrics each time they listened.

Joss Alton, the owner of a recording company called Isotope Music, traveled from the other side of Ireland to invite her to join his company. At first, Ana was uncertain because she did not know much about Isotope and did not want anyone to control her music. However, Joss assured her that this would not happen. Soon after, she performed at a concert in Dublin organized by Isotope, and all the tickets sold out quickly, making it a wonderful evening.

Ana prefers to write songs about difficult times rather than happy moments, as she feels there is more to express during tough times. One of her favorite songs is ""Decision,"" which reflects on why her brother stopped singing for a while and how it affected him. While she hopes her fans will enjoy her music, her goal is to write about personal experiences that are important to her."
65,"Last year, I went on an incredible trip – a guided boat tour along the west coast of Canada. It was my brother Harry’s idea. He is a journalist, like me, and wanted to write articles about the journey. He loves boats, which is not something I share with him. However, I had always dreamed of visiting this area since I saw it on TV as a child, especially because it was where our great-grandparents lived before moving to Europe. I kept asking Harry if I could join him until he finally said yes!

A few days before our departure, there were storms in the area we were visiting. Fortunately, the weather forecast for our trip was good, predicting calm seas. I was busy with work and didn’t have much time to prepare, but Harry assured me he would handle everything, so I stopped worrying.

After arriving in Canada, we met the group, packed our limited supplies into small boats, and set off. The guide told us that very few people live along that coast, and indeed, the only other creatures we saw that first morning were dolphins and birds. We could see islands in the distance, but the morning fog made it hard to see far, so I focused on the beautiful patterns our boat made in the water.

We often stopped for hours to explore the rock pools on the beaches. They were filled with colorful fish, many of which I didn’t recognize. It was wonderful to forget about how fast or slow time was passing. We never forgot to have lunch or dinner, which we all prepared together over campfires. Each evening, when we fell asleep on the boats, even though the beds were hard, it felt like a stress-free life!

When it was time to leave, I felt sad. How could I go back to normal life? But I knew that if I stayed, I would miss my family and friends. I was also excited to share our adventures with everyone back home!"
66,"My dad was a professional basketball player in Germany, just like his father before him. When I was a child, I watched many of his games. You might think that this would make me love basketball, but it actually did the opposite. I enjoyed telling my friends how good my dad was, especially when he won, but I often brought a book to read instead of watching the games.

When I started secondary school, I was still two years away from being a teenager, but I was already two meters tall. Because of my height, my sports teacher asked if I wanted to train with the basketball team. I liked the training sessions, but I thought I needed to improve my skills before playing in a real match. However, my teacher believed in me more than I believed in myself. After some time, I agreed to play, and a few weeks later, I found myself in a game against another school. My parents watching made me more nervous, but it turned out fine!

For the next four years, I practiced every day and did very well, even joining an adult team before moving to a special sports academy in the USA when I was fifteen. The coach there trained Olympic basketball players, and it was amazing to learn from him. However, I didn’t enjoy being away from my parents at first. At home, I hadn’t spent much time with friends because of all the training, so that part wasn’t too different for me. Eventually, I got used to my new life, and my English improved quickly!

I became a professional player at eighteen, three years after arriving in the USA. I had been taller than most players in the professional league since I was fifteen, but I needed to gain weight to match my height. My coach knew a team that would take me while I was still in college, so I joined them and have never regretted that decision."
67,"Seven years ago, I was studying Tourism at college, but I needed a part-time job because my course was quite expensive. After thinking about different options, I decided to train as a weekend tour guide in my hometown, Chicago, USA. This job involved showing visitors around the city, and I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. I got to see the city I had lived in all my life from the perspective of tourists, making it feel like a new experience each time!

After I finished my studies, I chose to become a full-time tour guide. I thought it would be easy, but when I looked into it, I realized I needed to learn a lot more to get a license as a full-time guide. All tour guides in Chicago must be able to answer many questions about the city, including its architecture, history, and public transport rules. After several months of hard but interesting work, I earned my tour guide qualification and registered as an independent guide.

Being a tour guide is not just about knowing historical facts or keeping track of your group in busy places. There are many other important skills. You need to be entertaining and tell engaging stories. Most importantly, you must be able to adapt to unexpected situations, like if a place you planned to visit is closed or if the route changes. Tourists do not want to hear about problems; they just want to enjoy a well-organized tour.

I have to ensure that visitors are satisfied with my tours, as unhappy customers might leave negative reviews online. Like many tour guides, I understand that these reviews are very important because good reviews attract more customers. That’s why it’s essential to make tours enjoyable and stress-free. I believe that the enthusiasm and energy I bring to my job help me receive excellent reviews, and my tours are often recommended to other visitors coming to Chicago."
68,"My name is Ella, and I am 22 years old. Last year, I traveled to Thailand for two weeks with my sister, Josie. Even though she is five years younger than me, we have a good relationship. We went to volunteer at an elephant sanctuary, a place where people care for sick and rescued elephants. At first, I was unsure if we would connect with the other volunteers because they were much older than us. We were also nervous since it was our first experience doing something like this. However, we ended up having a great time.

One of our main tasks at the sanctuary was to gather food for the elephants. Elephants eat a lot of grass and banana plants, so this took most of our day. Josie found it quite challenging, but seeing the elephants enjoy their meals made it worthwhile for me. We also helped wash the elephants in the river using large brushes and soap. I found this very enjoyable, even though I ended up wetter than the elephants!

The part of the day I looked forward to the most was the evening. By moonlight, we led the elephants into the forest where they would sleep. All the volunteers stayed in the same house. Josie and I shared a bedroom, which was a bit cramped, but we chose to do this because Josie didn’t want to be alone. It was hot and humid, especially at night, but we were prepared for that. The meals were delicious and did not include meat, which we both do not like.

After dinner, all the volunteers and staff would spend the evenings talking and playing games. Now that we are back in the UK, Josie doesn’t often mention Thailand. However, if someone asks her if she enjoyed her time at the sanctuary, she says she loved it. I think she might not be completely honest, as she seems a bit upset with herself for not fully enjoying her time there because she missed her friends. But when she reflects on the experience, she realizes how fortunate she was to go. Maybe she will return one day – I definitely will!"
69,"My name is Gina D’Costa, and I own a flower shop in the UK. We sell flowers not only to people who want them for gifts or their homes, but also to various businesses. Hotels and offices often use flowers in their reception areas, and we sometimes provide flowers for business photo shoots. Once, I even decorated a castle for a wedding, which was a lot of work, but I felt very proud of what we accomplished.

My day begins at 4 a.m. when I go to the market to buy fresh flowers. Most people are still asleep at that time, and my friends think I’m a bit crazy, but I love what I do. It can be quite cold and dark, but I don’t let that bother me. The flower market is amazing, filled with flowers from around the world. The beautiful sights and smells make it hard to choose. If I were picking flowers for myself, I would choose only pink ones because that’s my favorite color. However, I have to remember that my preferences may not match what my customers want. 

Sometimes, I can’t find the flowers that customers want because not all flowers are available year-round. I don’t enjoy negotiating prices with the flower sellers, but it’s part of my job. Flowers can be expensive, so I try to get the best price I can. 

When I return to the shop, we review customer orders and arrange the flowers in vases. Then, we create flower bouquets and calculate the costs of the orders. Customers are often surprised by the prices, and I sometimes have to ask them to reconsider their choices. Some people might think this is too much effort, but I enjoy figuring out how to create the best flower arrangements within a budget. That’s what selling is all about, and I wouldn’t want to do anything else!"
70,"My city has a modern cinema that shows the latest films and many children's movies on weekends. It is close to my home, but a year ago, I realized I wanted something more – the chance to discuss a film in detail with others after watching it. So, I started a film club with two friends! We decided not to rent a cinema for our screenings. Instead, we choose a different location in the city each month. For instance, we rented an old factory to show a film set in Antarctica. It was very cold, which created a great atmosphere for the film, and it was fantastic! Some places we use are even free because the owners sell snacks during the film, allowing us to keep our prices low. We are happy to cover our costs without aiming for profit. Each time we show a film, it gets easier, especially now that we have our own reliable equipment. We can track ticket sales online, so we no longer worry about empty seats! There is always a lot to do, but it is wonderful when people of all ages tell us how much they enjoyed the experience. Our website has been very helpful, and we are now connected with other film clubs across the country. We have visited them to learn how they operate, but it is always nice to return to our own club! We also started a blog because we know most people look online for film information instead of reading local reviews. We have tried putting up posters in cafés, but nothing is as effective as word of mouth – people telling their friends about us. The audience loves the special activities we organize with each film; last month, we had a movie quiz that everyone enjoyed."
71,"Taking photographs was always my favorite activity as a child. When I turned 15, I wanted to take my hobby further, so I started a special project: I would take one photograph every day for a whole year. Many young photographers had done this before, but I thought it was a great idea, so I began. After a few weeks, I decided to share my photos on a website for young photographers. I wanted to create a photo diary and show my work to others. I was surprised to find that people liked my perspective and style. I enjoyed photographing many different subjects. 

Then, someone suggested that if my photos had a common theme, my project would be even better. I agreed and decided to focus on nature, especially birds and the sky. Most of my photos were in black and white, which was different from what many other young photographers were doing, as they preferred color. This made me doubt my project at times, and I almost gave up. However, I learned to trust my feelings and became more confident in my style and choices.

One day, I showed my project to my art teacher. She told me about a national photography competition for my age group, so I entered some of my photos just for fun. I will never forget the moment the judges announced that I had won first prize. I was incredibly happy because my project meant a lot to me. It was the first time I realized that my photography might be good, and that I could possibly work as a professional photographer. Now, I have my own photography studio, and I have never regretted my career choice."
72,"I joined the National Youth Challenge (NYC) last year because I wanted to try new activities like camping, sailing, and public speaking. These were things I had never done before. In the NYC, you can participate in various activities that challenge you, and you are always learning. There are different levels, from beginner to advanced, led by adult volunteers called ‘leaders’. When you complete each level, you receive a certificate.

When I first joined, my leader suggested that my first challenge should be to help organize activities at a local children’s club for two hours a week. I was unsure about this because I had joined that same club when I was eight and found it hard to make friends. I was shy, and the other children already had their own groups, so I stopped going after a few weeks. However, I decided to accept the challenge because I wanted to earn my first NYC certificate. 

Soon, I found myself wanting to spend all my free time at the children’s club. It became much more important to me than just getting the certificate. After I completed the challenge, the NYC leader allowed me to continue volunteering at the club because I had formed great relationships with the children. Now, I spend about four hours a week there, and I always look forward to it.

Because of what I learned at the children’s club, I have decided that when I finish school in three years, I want to go to college to become a qualified youth worker, someone who works with children. I had never thought about this career before starting at the club. In fact, I had never considered my future job, and the idea of youth work had never crossed my mind. This has been my favorite part of the NYC so far, and I have improved my communication skills while helping others. I now have several NYC certificates, and one of them is for camping!"
73,"I was born in Denver, USA, and I started snowboarding when I was eight years old. My dad took me to a mountain resort about two hours from Denver. The slope looked very steep, so my dad had to convince me to try it. I was too young to ask him if I could snowboard, but he loved it and wanted me to enjoy it too. He made it seem easy, and eventually, I did well. After that first experience, I quickly grew to love the sport and improved my skills. I began competing when I was ten. Some people enter many competitions and get bored with snowboarding, but my passion for participating and winning has only grown stronger as I’ve aged. This motivates me to push myself harder. I like not having a strict plan, and sometimes this works out well, like when I became the first female to score a perfect 100 in a local competition. I didn’t think I would attempt the difficult jumps that earned me that score until I actually started. That achievement boosted my confidence in my abilities. 

In the summer, I focus on training and my studies since there’s no snow. I train every day, but it’s nice not to follow a strict diet like I do in winter. I also get to spend a lot of time with my friends, which helps me cope with not being able to do what I love most. I need to think carefully about my future. Snowboarding is a big part of my life now, but I believe it’s important to have another option in case I don’t succeed as a professional snowboarder or if I get injured. I’m considering whether becoming a doctor is possible if my active lifestyle allows me to attend college. I can’t imagine getting tired of snowboarding, but I know I can’t do it forever."
74,"When I was fifteen, I wanted everything my friends had, and I never thought about the future. For example, I didn’t know what I wanted to do after school. One day, my best friend got a new phone for her birthday, and I thought I should have one too. My parents said I could only get it if I paid for it myself, so I decided to work part-time and save money. I am very grateful to my parents for making me do this because it taught me an important lesson.

I worked every Saturday in a café, but I didn’t enjoy it much. My parents suggested I start my own small business instead. I had seen my mum making necklaces, so I asked if I could try it too. I never thought I would find it easy, as it looked complicated when I watched my mum. My friends thought it sounded boring, but I was excited about it. My mum showed me that I could create something beautiful at home with simple tools and materials.

I sold my first pieces of jewellery to my friends and family as soon as I finished making them. They said they loved them, but I thought they were just being nice. Even though I was happy they bought them, I needed to be sure they looked good enough for other people to want them. The only way to find out was to rent a market stall with my mum. There are many tourists where I live, and they bought a lot of my jewellery to take home to their families and friends. Soon, we started getting calls from all over the country from people wanting to buy more. They thought we were a big company with many employees, but we were just two people at a market stall!

That was when I realized my business could succeed, and it was time to create a website. Since then, I have made thousands of pounds from my business, mostly online, but we still have our stall too. It has been a lot of fun so far."
75,"When Janine Stuart was just 13 years old, she wrote a novel called Being Amelia, which became very popular. The story is partly inspired by Janine’s own experiences. In an interview, she explained, “Because my father’s job made us move around a lot, I learned to make new friends easily. I know what it feels like to be the new student in a class, which helped me write about Amelia’s experiences in a new school. Some of the funniest moments in the book are about Amelia’s home life, especially her relationship with her older brother. Since I’m an only child, I had to use my imagination to create that.” 

Janine began writing her novel one summer when she was bored at home. Her mother had always wanted to be a published author, and her teachers encouraged her to write, so it felt natural for Janine to start writing. The year before, she had won a short story competition on a website for young writers. This is why, when she finished Being Amelia and sent it to a publishing company, they were eager to read it. They loved the book, and a year later, it was available in stores.

One review of Being Amelia points out that, even though the cover shows happy teenagers, the characters face real challenges, which makes them believable. The reviewer noted that, despite Janine’s young age and the book’s short length, she has shown that she is a better writer than many bestselling authors. Janine is still adjusting to her fame: “At first, I would hide when people recognized me in the street, but now it’s fine. I want to help other young writers, but they need to discover what works for them. For me, I just need to spend time with my friends, and I’ll find something interesting to write about!”"
76,"My name is Tom, and I am fifteen years old. Three years ago, my family and I moved into a castle on a small island. This happened because my father was invited to manage the castle. He works for an organization that takes care of historical buildings and keeps them open for visitors. He was excited about this opportunity, but it took some time for the rest of us to agree that he should accept the job. We were worried about what life on the island would be like. We knew the castle might not be as comfortable as our cozy home nearby, and there was no school on the island.

However, after we moved, we quickly adapted to island life. The castle is not particularly beautiful, but our apartment there is comfortable. In the summer, the island is lively with many visitors, and there are often beach parties. In winter, we mostly see the other families who live on the island, but there are not as many teenagers as I had hoped. The adults support each other and help with repairs, which can be hard work.

The biggest change for me was taking a boat every day to my old school. I looked forward to the stormy days with big waves, but the ferries do not run then! I also learned that if I miss the bus to the harbor after school, I will miss the last ferry home, which is stressful. So, when my friends come to visit, I always tell them to hurry! 

The boat rides offer amazing views, especially at sunset over the sea. Some days, it is so foggy that you cannot see anything, but then it can suddenly become sunny again, which still surprises me even after living here for a while. We do experience terrible storms, and I sometimes wonder if the castle is strong enough to withstand them. But then I remind myself that the castle has been here for centuries and is still standing strong!"
77,"I live in a house in the beautiful countryside of Scotland. I have always loved nature and wild animals, and six years ago, I started a new hobby: birdwatching! I went to the mountains in northern Scotland with my family, where we saw many birds in their natural habitat. I spent hours observing them with my parents, who taught me how to identify different species and find the best spots to see them. It was incredible, and when we returned home, I joined a local birdwatchers’ club for young people. My goal is to see 200 different bird species, and I am close to achieving it. During family holidays abroad, I have had the chance to see birds from other countries as well. We always look for places with group birdwatching activities so I can add new birds to my list! I have visited Egypt, and last summer we went to South America, where I hoped to see my 200th species. I was not too disappointed when it didn’t happen, as I have learned that patience is important in this hobby. I shared a video online about this challenge, and many teenagers found it interesting and commented positively. When my teachers saw it, they asked me to give a presentation about birdwatching at school. I felt nervous just before I went on stage, knowing that the whole school and my friends were watching me. I had notes to help me, and I remembered what to say. I only relaxed after it was over, and the teachers praised my preparation and said they enjoyed it. I might even do another presentation next year! I feel fortunate to live in the countryside. I understand why many teenagers in cities might not consider birdwatching, but there are many birds to see, especially in green areas. I believe birdwatching clubs should encourage more young people to take up this hobby. Everyone should connect with nature, regardless of their age, and it doesn’t have to be expensive."
78,"I began playing football when I was 7 years old. I would hurry home from school to play with other kids. I loved it, and soon I became a decent player. My family knew I often got excited about new hobbies and then lost interest, so they probably thought I would do the same with football. But that never happened. I even started dreaming of playing football professionally when I grew up. 

The chance came sooner than I expected. I played in local tournaments, and one referee saw that I had talent. He asked the manager of a professional women’s club to watch me play. After that, she invited me to join her club. I was surprised at first because I didn’t know young girls could join women’s clubs. But the manager was impressed, and I began regular training with a big club when I was just 13. I improved a lot after that. 

Still, some people doubted I would become a star player, which made me a little sad. However, my coach encouraged me to be myself and to believe in my abilities. He even let me play in one of the club’s championship matches earlier than I expected! I ran harder than ever because I didn’t want to let my teammates down. By chance, I scored the winning goal. Even with a large crowd, I could hear my coach cheering for me, and after the match, my teammates carried me around the pitch. It was amazing! Since then, I have scored many more winning goals.

Next month, my coach and I are organizing a football tournament in my area. The goal is to get teenagers interested in football and give them a chance to meet other players from my club. It will show them what a professional environment is like and inspire them to believe they could play for a top team if they work hard. My advice to them will be the same as my coach gave me: there will be good times, but also some challenges. Fortunately, I have faced very few challenges, so I consider myself lucky!"
79,"One of the most interesting changes in education in the UK and around the world in recent years is the encouragement for new students to get involved in research early in their studies. This change acknowledges that research is not just for famous scholars at old universities or scientists making new discoveries, but is also a natural way to build knowledge and skills. Research skills are valuable not only for your studies but also for your future job, as they help you think critically about the world and approach your work effectively.

As a student, you contribute to knowledge. You do not just memorize and repeat information; you create it. Creating knowledge involves asking questions instead of accepting things as they are. You might wonder: Why? How? When? What does this mean? What if things were different? How does it work in this situation? What should we think about the facts, opinions, or beliefs we encounter? Why is this important? These questions are at the heart of what we call research.

Research can be seen as a range of activities. On one end, there is complex, groundbreaking research done by highly trained experts, which leads to significant changes in knowledge. However, research can also start from simple inquiries that involve careful work, thoughtful questions about issues, and practical suggestions. Most students have always been researchers in some way. You have likely done research for school projects or answered questions at work since you began your education. You have asked questions that required investigation, whether you were deciding where to go on holiday, how to grow plants, fix things at home, train your dog, find the right music system, or shop online.

In college and higher education, it is expected that you will have a curious mind, identify problems and questions, critically explore and evaluate information, and create your own responses and knowledge to contribute to discussions. Some students may find this challenging because, in some cultures, knowledge is seen as fixed, and learning comes from listening to teachers and texts. It may feel disrespectful to question established knowledge or authority, and you might think you should be told what is important to learn. However, in higher education in the UK, US, much of Europe, and Australasia, questioning established knowledge and authorities is encouraged.

This process of inquiry and knowledge creation can seem overwhelming. Critical thinking is especially important in research. The research done by others is valuable for students, academics, and professionals, but we must not simply repeat what we read or accept everything as fact. Instead, we should engage with the information, think critically about it, test it, and determine if it is logical and supported by evidence. We should avoid relying blindly on the facts and information provided by others in our readings or discussions."
80,"Cities have always been centers of intellectual activity. In the 18th century, coffee houses in London were places where people discussed science and politics. In modern Paris, cafés on the Left Bank were where artists like Pablo Picasso talked about art. However, living in a city can be challenging. The same cafés that encouraged conversation also contributed to the spread of diseases like cholera, and Picasso eventually moved to the countryside. 

Today, cities are known for their creativity, but they can also feel overwhelming and unnatural. Scientists are now studying how city life affects our brains, and the findings are concerning. While it has been known that city life can be tiring, new research shows that living in cities can actually reduce our ability to think clearly. One major reason for this is the lack of nature in urban environments. Studies have shown that hospital patients heal faster when they can see trees from their windows. Even brief views of nature can enhance brain function by providing a break from the stress of city life.

This research comes at a significant time: for the first time in history, more people live in cities than in rural areas. Instead of enjoying open spaces, we find ourselves in crowded urban environments filled with strangers. It has become clear that these unnatural surroundings can negatively impact our mental and physical health and change the way we think. 

When walking down a busy street, our brains must manage many distractions: people, traffic, and confusing layouts. These everyday tasks can drain our mental energy because cities are filled with so many stimuli that we constantly have to focus our attention. This process of deciding what to pay attention to is tiring. Our brains are powerful, but focusing takes a lot of energy. In contrast, natural environments require less mental effort. This idea is known as attention restoration theory, developed by psychologist Stephen Kaplan. He suggested that being in nature can help restore our attention. Natural settings have elements that naturally attract our focus without causing stress, unlike loud noises like sirens. 

Long before scientists studied this, philosophers and landscape architects warned about the negative effects of city life and sought ways to include nature in urban areas. Parks, like Central Park in New York, provide a much-needed escape from city life. A well-designed park can enhance brain function in just a few minutes. While many have looked for ways to boost mental performance, such as energy drinks or office redesigns, nothing seems to be as effective as simply walking in nature.

Given the many mental challenges caused by city living, one might wonder why cities keep growing. Even in our digital age, cities remain hubs of creativity. Research from the Santa Fe Institute shows that the same urban features that can lead to attention and memory problems—like crowded streets—are also linked to innovation. The concentration of social interactions in cities is a key factor in their creativity. Just as the crowded streets of 18th-century London led to new ideas, the busy environment of 21st-century Cambridge, Massachusetts, fosters technological creativity. Conversely, less crowded areas may produce fewer innovative ideas over time.

The challenge, then, is to find ways to reduce the negative effects of city life while preserving its unique advantages. As the saying goes, there will always be times when people feel the need to escape to the city, even if they also crave nature."
81,"Where should we search for the mind? This question may seem strange because we usually think that thinking happens inside our heads. Today, we have advanced brain imaging techniques that support this idea. However, I believe there is no strong reason to limit the study of the mind to just what is inside our bodies. There is a lot of evidence, from ancient times to now, showing that objects, as well as brain cells, play a role in how we think. 

From an archaeological perspective, it is clear that items like stone tools, jewelry, carvings, clay tokens, and writing systems have significantly influenced human development and the formation of our minds. Therefore, what exists outside our heads might also be part of our minds. It is understandable how we have come to equate the mind with the brain. Most of our knowledge about the mind has come from studying people in isolation from their surroundings, which makes sense for neuroscientists using brain scans. However, this often overlooks the fact that much of our thinking occurs outside our heads.

I do not intend to challenge the idea that our thoughts have a neural basis, but I want to emphasize that the mind is more than just the brain. It is more useful to consider that human intelligence extends beyond our bodies into culture and the material world. This is where my new theory, Material Engagement Theory (MET), comes into play. MET explores how objects can become extensions of our thinking or be integrated into our bodies. For example, when we create numbers and symbols from clay or use a stone to make a tool, we are engaging with the material world in a cognitive way. 

This theory also looks at how these interactions have changed since ancient times and what those changes mean for our thinking. It provides new insights into what minds are and how they are shaped by the things around us. Consider a blind person using a stick. Where does this person's self begin? The connection between the blind person and the stick illustrates how minds and objects can be seen as interconnected. The stick helps the blind person turn touch into a form of sight, and the brain treats the stick as part of the body. 

The blind person’s stick reminds us that human intelligence can adapt and change significantly by incorporating new technologies. I view the human mind as an ongoing project that is always evolving. It is essential to remember that, regardless of what form the ""stick"" has taken throughout our history—whether it be ancient stone tools or modern technology—its main purpose is to serve as a connection rather than a barrier. Through this ""stick,"" humans explore, learn, and navigate their environment, while also shaping their future.

In contrast, a monkey using a stick to get food represents a different kind of use. For humans, ""sticks"" are tools for satisfying our curiosity. This unique human ability to engage with material culture explains why we create things and how those creations, in turn, shape our minds. I refer to this concept as metaplasticity—our minds are flexible and develop as they interact with the material world. I aim to reintroduce the importance of materiality into our understanding of cognition. 

MET provides a fresh perspective on how various forms of material culture, from ancient tools to modern smartphones, have played a crucial role in defining and transforming who we are and how we think. While the idea of technology changing our minds may sound futuristic, it is important to recognize that humans have been using such technology since our earliest days."
82,"Few inventions have changed civilization and our understanding of the world as much as photography. This is especially true in the United States, where photography quickly became part of culture at all levels—practical, scientific, industrial, and artistic. It also opened up new forms of amusement and entertainment. Historians argue that photography is the greatest contribution of the US to the visual arts, as no other art form has had such a significant impact. This claim highlights how photography has become central to American intellectual and artistic discussions, making it important to explore its origins in the mid-19th century.

Why was photography so appealing? First, its mechanical nature matched a growing interest in technology, reflecting a national attitude that embraced change. Just as steam power, railroads, and electricity made communication and travel easier, photography brought the wonders of the world into homes with an immediacy that was astonishing. Second, the camera became the preferred tool for expressing identity, allowing individuals to present themselves to the public in a society that constantly reinvented personal and national identities. Third, the camera played a crucial role in creating and preserving family memories, even if those memories were somewhat idealized. Finally, the realism of photographs aligned with a broader artistic trend towards depicting everyday life in American art.

Every photograph draws attention to something specific, showing what the photographer wants us to see. The fact that photographs are created by a machine, unlike drawings, gives them a unique quality: they are records of events, people, and objects, representing at least what was in front of the camera. However, since each photograph is taken by a specific person, it also carries a subjective viewpoint. We might think we understand a photograph because we recognize its subject, leading to the idea that photography is a ""universal language."" Yet, the meaning of photographs is more complex. Few subjects convey their own meaning, and every image is presented with some context that shapes our understanding—like a caption in a newspaper or its placement in a gallery.

To understand a photograph historically, we must consider its purpose and role within its cultural context: Why did the photographer take the picture? How was it first viewed? Additionally, the same image can be interpreted differently depending on where and when it is seen. While the importance of the camera to artists was not widely recognized for a long time, it is now clear. In recent decades, starting with artist Andy Warhol's use of photographs in his work, many artists have integrated photography into their art in various ways. In summary, photographic vision has become an essential part of painting and our understanding of representation, rather than being in conflict with it."
83,"In 1890, William James, an American philosopher and physician, defined psychology as the ""science of mental life."" This definition is still relevant today. We all have a mental life, which gives us some understanding of what this means. Although we can study mental life in animals like rats and monkeys, it remains a complex idea. James focused on human psychology, which he believed included basic elements: thoughts, feelings, the physical world, and a way of knowing about these elements. Our knowledge is mostly personal and comes from our own experiences, which may or may not align with scientific facts.

This personal understanding can lead us to make judgments about psychological issues based on our own experiences. We often act as amateur psychologists when we share opinions on complex topics, such as whether brainwashing is effective or why people behave in certain ways. Problems arise when two people interpret situations differently. Formal psychology aims to provide methods to determine which explanations are most likely correct in specific situations. Psychologists help us differentiate between subjective thoughts, which can be biased, and objective facts.

While psychology studies the mind and brain, psychologists do not yet fully understand how the brain works in relation to our emotions and behaviors. It is often difficult to study the brain directly, so psychologists learn more by observing behavior and forming hypotheses about what happens inside us. A challenge in psychology is that scientific facts should be objective, but the mind's workings are not easily observable. We can only infer mental processes from behavior, similar to solving a crossword puzzle by interpreting clues.

Psychology aims to describe, understand, predict, and control the processes it studies. Achieving these goals helps us understand our experiences and apply findings to real life. Psychological research has been beneficial in various areas, such as improving reading methods for children, designing safer machine controls, and helping emotionally distressed individuals communicate their feelings.

Although psychological questions have been discussed for centuries, scientific investigation began only in the last 150 years. Early psychologists used introspection, or self-reflection, to answer psychological questions. They aimed to identify mental structures, which remains a key interest today. However, introspection has limitations, as noted by Sir Francis Galton, who said it only reveals a small part of the brain's automatic functions. William James compared introspection to trying to see how darkness looks by turning up the gas quickly. Therefore, modern psychologists prefer to base their theories on careful observations of others' behavior rather than solely on their own experiences."
84,"In a warehouse in a typical business park in Michigan, USA, there is a unique collection known as the Museum of Failed Products. This collection, owned by a company called GfK, includes items like A Touch of Yogurt shampoo and Breakfast Cola, which were taken off the market because few people wanted to buy them. The museum's owner, Carol Sherry, believes that each product represents a story of disappointment for the designers, marketers, and salespeople involved.

What is surprising is that this museum exists as a successful business. You might think that any serious manufacturer would keep a collection of their failed products, but many executives do not. They often avoid thinking about their failures and do not keep samples of their unsuccessful items. The museum was created by Robert McMath, a former marketing professional, who originally wanted to build a library of consumer products, not just failed ones. Starting in the 1960s, he began collecting every new product he could find. He soon realized a key truth: most products fail. As a result, his collection mostly consisted of unsuccessful items.

Today’s optimistic culture likely contributes to the products in the museum. Each product probably went through many meetings where no one recognized its potential failure. Even if they did, marketers might invest more money into a failing product to try to save face. Little effort is made to understand why these products failed, and those involved often choose not to discuss it.

This focus on optimism is especially strong in the self-help industry. A common idea is ""positive visualization,"" which suggests that imagining positive outcomes can help make them happen. Some researchers, like neuroscientist Tali Sharot, believe that our brains are wired to see positive outcomes as more likely than they actually are. Her research indicates that well-adjusted people tend to have an overly optimistic view of their ability to influence events, unlike those who are depressed.

However, how effective are these positive thoughts about the future? Psychologist Gabriele Oettingen and her team have studied this question. Their findings show that spending time imagining successful outcomes can actually reduce people's motivation to achieve their goals. For instance, people who were encouraged to visualize a successful week at work ended up accomplishing less.

Psychologist Carol Dweck explains that our experiences with failure are shaped by our beliefs about ability. People with a ""fixed mindset"" believe that ability is something you are born with, while those with a ""growth mindset"" think it can develop through effort and challenges. Those with a fixed mindset often find failure very distressing, seeing it as proof that they are not as capable as they thought. For example, a talented athlete who believes they are naturally gifted may not practice enough to reach their full potential. In contrast, people with a growth mindset view failure as a sign that they are pushing their limits. Dweck compares this to weight training, where muscles grow stronger by being challenged. Ultimately, having a growth mindset is a more positive way to approach life, regardless of whether it leads to success."
85,"Text: 'Everyone knows that sports teams have an advantage when they play at home. But why is that? Many of us think we understand, but professional sports are changing quickly, and what we once accepted as true is now being questioned. Two main factors are challenging the idea of home advantage: science and money. Sports scientists want to discover what helps players perform their best, leading to many theories about home advantage. At the same time, those who invest in sports want to know why home advantage is still important. If players are paid well, shouldn’t they feel comfortable playing anywhere?

What does this mean for fans? For example, would it matter if Manchester United played some home games in the Far East to reach their fans there? It would matter to British fans, who believe their team needs their support and loyalty. This belief may lead them to confuse cause and effect. When a team plays well, home fans cheer loudly, and sometimes this leads to a goal, causing even more excitement. Fans often remember the times they cheered and a goal was scored, forgetting the many times their cheers did not lead to success.

However, there is one common belief among fans that scientific evidence supports. Home fans not only cheer for their team but also direct their energy at the referee. In a well-known study, referees watched a match with crowd noise and another version without sound. The referees who heard the crowd were less likely to call fouls against the home team compared to those who watched in silence. Interestingly, the crowd noise did not make them more likely to call fouls against the away team. The researchers concluded that referees try to avoid the stress of making calls that would upset the home crowd. They do not simply follow the crowd's wishes; they aim to avoid provoking their anger.

Recent studies on home advantage have looked at long-term trends. They show that while home advantage has decreased in all major sports, it has not declined as much as expected. For example, in the early years of the Football League in the 1890s in England, home teams won about 70% of the points available, compared to 60% today. One reason for this change may be travel; it used to be difficult, but now players travel in great comfort, and if their hotel is not satisfactory, the club will find them a better one. Local conditions used to vary greatly, but now top stadiums are increasingly similar in their efficiency.

Despite these explanations, none fully explains the data. These changes—pampered players, modern conveniences, and similar stadiums—have occurred relatively recently, in the last couple of decades. The mystery remains as to why home advantage varies by sport. Basketball has the greatest home advantage, followed by football, while baseball has the least. One possible reason is that home advantage is more about teamwork, and baseball focuses more on individual matchups between the batter and pitcher. Team sports require coordination among teammates. In basketball, success depends on all players working together, which builds confidence when playing at home, regardless of the playing conditions.

Another possibility relates to a more primal aspect of sports. Researchers found that players' testosterone levels were normal before training and away games but increased by up to 67% before home games. This territorial instinct may connect to a basic urge to protect their home ground, as seen in recent Rugby World Cup matches. In two notable games, underdog teams won at home against stronger opponents, showing determination and a refusal to be intimidated—clear signs of home advantage. As one referee put it, ‘It’s the law of the jungle out there.’'"
86,"""The more I practice, the luckier I get,"" said golfer Gary Player about fifty years ago. This saying has become famous in sports and is appreciated by many dedicated athletes and their coaches. The origin of this quote is debated, as many other golfers from that time have also been suggested as its source. Its meaning is also not straightforward. Player was not talking about luck in a literal sense; he was being ironic. His true message was: ""The more I practice, the better I become."" However, there is a limit to this improvement, and the question of where that limit is relates to the nature versus nurture debate. This debate concerns whether talent is something we are born with or something we develop through practice.

It would be misleading to call this a balanced debate; it is more like a one-sided game where nurture has clearly won. The idea that practice is more important than natural talent in sports, music, business, and other areas is largely based on the work of psychologist Anders Ericsson. He is known for the theory that becoming an expert in any field requires 10,000 hours of practice. This theory has inspired many popular books, including Malcolm Gladwell's ""Outliers,"" as well as ""Talent Is Overrated"" and ""Bounce: The Myth of Talent and the Power of Practice."" These books generally agree that practice is the most important factor, suggesting that 10,000 hours of practice is both necessary and enough to make someone an expert.

However, as Epstein discusses in his engaging book, this idea is often not accurate. He points out a significant flaw in much of the research on excellence: it usually focuses only on successful individuals. He asks if there are better ways to understand why some people have certain abilities while others do not, and how to separate innate talent from factors like environment, support, opportunity, and determination. Epstein travels around the world, from Kenya to Sweden and the Caribbean to the Arctic, to find answers. In Alaska, he discovers that the success of sled dogs in a tough race may depend on their drive and desire, suggesting a link between genetics and traits we think of as voluntary.

This raises the question of whether commitment and determination are choices we make, or if they might also have a genetic basis, as the case of the huskies implies. Such examples highlight the complexity of this topic. Epstein differentiates between ""hardware"" (nature) and ""software"" (nurture), and he believes that both are essential for elite athletes. He does not downplay the importance of training or environment. For instance, he suggests that if Usain Bolt had grown up in the US, he might have become a good basketball player instead of the fastest man in history. However, Epstein also examines cases where genetics play a crucial role that cannot be overlooked. He also addresses the important issues of race and gender in sports. He questions, ""If only practice hours matter, why do we separate men and women in athletic competitions?"" Sometimes, the most important questions are the simplest ones."
87,"A recent international report shows that many children in rich, developed countries feel lonely and unhappy. Jay Griffiths asks a simple question: why are today’s children so unhappy? In her new book, Kith, Griffiths explains that these children spend too much time indoors, stuck in front of screens, and have lost touch with nature – the forests, mountains, rivers, and streams. She believes this is the main issue. This idea connects with other discussions about childhood today. A follow-up study interviewed children to understand their unhappiness better. It found that many children do not wish for the latest technology; instead, they would be happier if they could spend more time outside. Many adults over 40 often reminisce about their own childhoods, recalling how they enjoyed long summer days exploring, swimming, or building forts. They believe this was much healthier than the protected lives of today’s children. However, they often forget that they created this protective environment for their own kids, avoiding risks like building forts in old sheds. 

Griffiths’ book contains strong arguments. She discusses how the fear of dangers in the outside world and the focus on child-centered consumerism are connected. Parents’ fears of letting their children play outside benefit the toy and gadget industry, which sells products to keep children entertained indoors. She also criticizes trends like giving medication to restless children or requiring safety goggles for traditional playground games. While I am unsure how common these strict rules are, Griffiths expresses her frustration with great passion, also discussing other aspects of childhood, like fairy tales and school rules. 

However, Griffiths sometimes goes too far with her ideas, ignoring important counterarguments. At one point, she even compares the modern treatment of children to a subtle form of racism, which seems extreme. Griffiths has a romantic view of children. Although she acknowledges that children can be mischievous, she mostly presents an idealized view of them that may not match reality. For example, she claims that “children are the musicians of thought.” While this might be true if they had the freedom to explore, I doubt it reflects all children’s nature. 

A key theme of the book is that children should have the freedom to explore and take risks. Griffiths argues that children need to experience some danger to learn how to manage risks. She writes, “Children need accidents,” suggesting that small accidents help them avoid bigger ones later. However, she does not explain how to create these “right-sized” accidents. Moreover, not all children may want to follow the adventurous model Griffiths admires. What about the shy, cautious children who prefer to stay at home? Perhaps the real issue is that we often try to fit all children into the same mold, whether by keeping them too safe or pushing them too far outside."
88,"I am a research bio-psychologist with a PhD, which means I have studied a lot. I am good at solving problems in my work and life, but this skill is not just from my education. Many life problems cannot be solved with complicated formulas or memorized answers from school. They need judgment, wisdom, and creativity that come from real-life experiences. For children, these experiences often happen through play. 

My recent research focuses on how important play is for children's development. All mammals, including humans, play when they are young, and those that have the most to learn tend to play the most. Carnivores play more than herbivores because hunting is harder to learn than grazing. Primates, including humans, play more than other mammals because they rely more on learning than on instinct. Children, who have the most to learn, play more than any other young primates when they have the chance. 

Play is a natural way for both adults and mammals to learn. The most important skills children need to live happy and productive lives cannot be taught in school. These skills are learned and practiced through play. They include thinking creatively, getting along with others, cooperating, and managing their own feelings. Creativity is essential for success in today’s world. We no longer need people who simply follow instructions or perform routine calculations. Instead, we need people who can ask new questions and solve new problems. If we can encourage creative thinkers, we will have a strong workforce. 

However, we cannot teach creativity directly; it can be stifled by a school system that focuses on fixed questions and answers. More importantly, children need to learn how to get along with others, care for them, and cooperate. Children naturally want to play with each other, and through play, they develop social skills and learn about fairness and morality, which are important for their future. 

Play is voluntary, meaning players can choose to stop at any time. If they cannot quit, it is not play. Players understand that to keep the game enjoyable, they must make sure everyone is happy. This freedom makes play a very democratic activity. 

Unfortunately, school has become more demanding, with fewer breaks, more homework, and greater pressure for high grades. Outside of school, organized sports have taken the place of spontaneous games, and adult-supervised playdates have replaced unsupervised neighborhood play. Adults often feel they must intervene instead of allowing children to solve their own problems. 

These changes have happened slowly but have had a significant impact over time. They are caused by various social factors, including parents' fears, warnings from experts about dangers, less connected neighborhoods, and the belief that children learn more from adults than from each other. 

Our children do not need more school; they need more play. If we care about our children and future generations, we must change the negative trend of the past fifty years. We must give childhood back to children. They should be allowed to play and explore freely so they can grow into strong adults ready for an unpredictable future."
89,"In many countries, more young people in their twenties are using social media to find jobs. Websites like Twitter and LinkedIn allow them to connect directly with potential employers, which is much easier than the old method of standing outside an office with a sign saying ""hire me."" However, this increased access also means there is a higher risk of making mistakes.

For example, a young job seeker in the US reached out to a senior marketing executive on LinkedIn. This executive had many influential contacts, and the job seeker thought she might help him find a job. However, the executive was offended by the idea of sharing her contacts with a stranger who had not earned that privilege. She rejected his request and sent a sarcastic message that quickly spread online. Many people were shocked by her response, and she likely regrets her tone, if not her message. 

This incident highlights an important point: social media can be a risky tool for job seekers who do not know how to use it properly. Unfortunately, many young people are making mistakes. Ironically, social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter have been central to the social lives of young people for years. When my generation was young, social media was a way to escape from parents and teachers. It was a place to impress others and create a different identity. You could have long conversations online and then ignore those people in real life. With the right pictures and songs on your Facebook page, you could seem like a more interesting person overnight. 

However, using social media for professional networking is very different. For some young people, the line between personal and professional use is not clear. We learned to be bold and confident online, which may lead some to think this is still appropriate. Just because many people liked your posts on Facebook does not mean you can use LinkedIn to show employers you are a good candidate. We need to understand that what we learned as teenagers does not apply anymore, and we must meet employers' expectations to succeed in the job market.

One common complaint from employers about young job seekers on professional networking sites is that they are too casual and come across as arrogant. This reinforces the stereotype of young people as an ""entitled generation."" In reality, many of us are struggling to find jobs, which is why we are using social media. This perception of arrogance can hurt the job prospects of young people who actually have the skills and motivation to be valuable employees.

So, how should you contact someone on a professional networking site? First, clearly explain who you are and what you can offer them, such as doing research or helping in another way. This approach increases your chances of receiving a helpful response. Avoid sending generic messages, and keep your tone respectful to prevent leaving a negative impression. Remember, social media can be a great way to make important connections, but it requires careful use to avoid closing doors."
90,"Anyone who claims they can accurately predict the future of newspapers is either lying or mistaken. The numbers show a troubling trend: since 2000, the circulation of most UK national newspapers has dropped by one-third to one-half. According to the Pew Research Centre in the USA, only 26% of Americans now rely on newspapers for news, down from 45% in 2001. Many people confidently predict that printed newspapers will disappear within 15 years. However, history shows that traditional media often survive longer than expected. 

For example, in 1835, a journalist in New York claimed that books and theatre were finished, and that newspapers would become the main source of social life. Yet, theatre has survived alongside newspapers, cinema, and television. Radio has thrived even in the age of TV, and cinema has continued to do well despite the rise of videos and DVDs. Even vinyl records have made a comeback, with online sales increasing by 745% since 2008.

Interestingly, newspapers were once considered a new form of media. It took centuries for them to become the primary source of news, which was made possible by advancements like the steam press, railways, and the telegraph in the mid-19th century. This shift also involved a new understanding that the world is always changing, and we need regular updates—an idea that was foreign to people in medieval times. Back then, life was seen as cyclical, with only seasonal changes and unpredictable disasters like famine or disease.

Before the 19th century, journalism was not a full-time profession that could support a living. Even then, there was little reason for most people to seek news regularly. The fixed schedule and format of newspapers can be limiting. In contrast, online news allows readers to access information based on their own interests and the urgency of events. Advanced search engines and algorithms help personalize news, and updates can be provided almost instantly when significant stories break. There are no space limitations, allowing for more detailed narratives and analyses.

However, many news providers seem focused on being the first to report rather than on promoting understanding. This creates confusion, similar to the medieval marketplace where news was mixed with rumors and misunderstandings. Newspapers have often struggled to explain how the world works. They may be facing extinction, or perhaps, as the internet adds to our sense of living in a chaotic universe, newspapers might find a way to guide us toward greater wisdom and understanding."
91,"If humans truly belonged under the moon and stars, we would walk happily in the dark, just like many night creatures that thrive in it. However, we are daytime beings, with eyes designed for sunlight. This fact is deeply rooted in our genetics, even if we don’t often think of ourselves as daytime creatures, just as we don’t think of ourselves as primates or mammals. This understanding helps explain our impact on the night. We have changed the night by filling it with artificial light. This control is similar to building a dam on a river. While it has benefits, it also leads to problems known as light pollution, which scientists are just starting to study. 

Light pollution mainly comes from poor lighting design that allows artificial light to shine into the sky instead of focusing it down where it is needed. Bad lighting brightens the night, changing the light levels and patterns that many living beings, including us, have adapted to. Wherever artificial light spreads into nature, it affects important life activities like migration, reproduction, and feeding. 

For most of human history, the term ‘light pollution’ would have been meaningless. Imagine walking towards London on a moonlit night around 1800, when it was the most populated city on Earth. Nearly a million people lived there, using candles, torches, and lanterns. Only a few homes had gas lighting, and there were no public gaslights in the streets for another seven years. From a distance, you would likely smell London before seeing its faint glow. We have illuminated the night as if it were empty, but that is far from the truth. There are many nocturnal species among mammals. Light is a strong biological force that attracts many creatures. Scientists have noted that songbirds and seabirds can be ‘captured’ by bright lights, circling endlessly until they fall. Birds that migrate at night often crash into brightly lit tall buildings, and young birds on their first journeys are especially affected. Some birds, like blackbirds and nightingales, sing at odd hours because of artificial light.

Initially, it was believed that light pollution only impacted astronomers, who need to see the night sky clearly. While most of us may not require a perfect view of the stars for our work, we, like many other creatures, need darkness. Rejecting darkness is pointless. It is as vital for our health as light is; disrupting our natural rhythms can lead to various health issues. The regular cycle of waking and sleeping reflects the natural light changes on Earth. These rhythms are so essential to our existence that disturbing them is like changing our center of gravity. 

Ultimately, humans are just as affected by light pollution as frogs living near a bright highway. By living in our own artificial light, we have disconnected ourselves from our evolutionary and cultural roots—the light of the stars and the natural rhythms of day and night. In a significant way, light pollution makes us forget our true place in the universe and the vastness of our existence, which is best understood against the backdrop of a dark night filled with the Milky Way overhead."
92,"The founder of a large international company recently said that his business will stop tracking how much paid holiday time employees take. This decision seems to be inspired by a similar policy from an internet company. The founder mentioned that he got the idea from a cheerful email from his daughter, which many newspapers have shared. However, this way of announcing the change feels like a superficial attempt to make a potentially unkind policy seem friendlier. 

Is this idea practical? The internet company has 2,000 employees and offers one service, while the multinational corporation has 50,000 employees and many different services, including finance, transport, and healthcare. The idea of ""take as much time off as you want, as long as it doesn’t hurt the business"" seems more suitable for a smaller company where employees know each other’s workloads better. The founder stated that employees can take as much leave as they want, as long as they feel completely sure that their absence won’t harm the business or their careers. But can anyone be that sure? No matter how much work you finish before a holiday, there will always be more waiting when you return. 

Following these guidelines might make employees hesitant to take time off or feel guilty about doing so. This guilt can lead to stress, and if workers don’t take enough leave, it could reduce productivity over time. There may also be pressure from colleagues and office gossip about who is taking time off and for how long. In many corporate environments, there is a culture of working late, which could lead to a ""no holiday"" mindset in a company with unlimited leave, where employees compete for promotions. 

If the security and rights that come with statutory leave are removed, employees might feel they cannot take the time off they need for fear of being seen as lazy. They would lose the legal protection that guarantees their leave. This policy could create a situation where workers feel unable to take their entitled leave, or they might continue to rely on their statutory rights, making the new policy ineffective. 

Modern technology allows us to receive work messages anytime and anywhere, blurring the lines between work and personal time. The internet company started its unlimited leave policy after employees questioned how this new work style fit with the old time-off rules. If the company can’t track how much time employees spend working, why should it apply a different standard for time off? However, a problem with having no set working hours is that it can feel like every hour is a working hour. Employees may never know if their hours are being monitored, leading them to self-discipline in potentially harmful ways. 

Employment laws exist for a reason. Workers have the right to a minimum amount of paid annual leave because rest and leisure are essential for their mental and physical health. The benefits of increased morale, creativity, and productivity that are expected from unlimited leave can exist without ensuring worker well-being. Therefore, I am skeptical that allowing employees to take as much holiday as they want is either the true goal or likely result of this policy."
93,"Journal-based peer review is the process where experts in a field evaluate a scientific research paper before it is published. This process is often seen as a way to ensure the quality of research, as it aims to prevent flawed or nonsensical papers from being published. However, the review process can delay publication by up to a year. Is this delay worth it to maintain trust in published research? The answer is both yes and no. 

While I still believe in the importance of some form of review before publication, I see changes happening in scientific publishing. The rise of preprints—drafts of papers shared online without peer review—plays a significant role in this change. Preprints allow researchers to quickly share new findings so that others can read, critique, and build upon them. Unfortunately, publishing in journals has become more about gaining recognition and advancing careers, which can distort the motivations of authors and reviewers. 

The competition for publication in prestigious journals encourages scientists to produce high-quality work, but it can also lead to shortcuts, where important data is omitted to make a paper more appealing. Reviewers often focus on whether a paper is good enough for a specific journal rather than its overall quality. For top journals, the decision can depend more on how timely or newsworthy a paper is rather than its scientific merit. 

These issues are well-known, yet many are reluctant to change the current system. However, as biologist Ron Vale recently suggested, preprints could offer a solution without drastically changing the norm. Although preprints have been around for twenty years, they have not been widely accepted. This slow adoption is partly due to scientists' conservative nature and the misconception that journals will not accept papers that have been posted as preprints. There is also concern that publishing unreviewed papers could lead to poor-quality research, but this has not happened so far.

Preprints may lack formal peer review, but authors understand that their work is open to critique from a global community of reviewers. For example, psychology professor Tanya Elks shared her experience of critiquing a published paper. In the traditional peer review system, the original authors might block critical feedback, but by posting a preprint, both sides could engage in open discussion. This transparency allows readers to assess the quality of the arguments presented. 

Preprint archives facilitate informal scientific discussions that were once limited to private correspondence. They also provide a platform for sharing negative results, which are often overlooked by journals focused on new discoveries. Additionally, papers on preprint archives tend to be read and cited more frequently, demonstrating the effectiveness of this method of sharing research. By embracing the internet's culture of openness and collaboration, preprints can help shift the focus back to the quality of the research itself, rather than the prestige of the publication."
94,"When I ask my literature students to define a poem, they often say it is ""a painting in words."" However, these answers usually do not satisfy either me or them. One day, I asked a group of students to choose an object and write two paragraphs about it: one as a scientist would, describing it objectively, and another from the object's perspective, titled ""Poem."" One student chose an oxygen mask and wrote: 

""Poem: I may look strange or scary, but I help people breathe. I am used only in emergencies and for a short time. Most people will never need me.""

This unusual choice helped the class understand how poetry works in a unique way. The exercise led to laughter and meaningful discussions. When I was in school, I found poetry confusing. To me, every poem felt like a silly puzzle that made it hard to understand and feel deeply. After school, most people pay less attention to poetry. Occasionally, a poem stands out because it is not continuous prose. It challenges you to read it, but often you feel let down by its simplicity or because you don’t understand it right away. Still, you feel good for trying.

What do we hope to find in poems? We might expect them to express deep emotions, beautiful images, thoughtful reflections, or sharp humor. The answer seems to be yes. But if we want tears, we watch movies; for information or sharp analysis, we read articles. Novels let us escape, paintings please our eyes, and music combines lyrics, instruments, and melody in a way that is hard to match. However, one thing that poems can offer is ambiguity, which is common in everyday life.

Searching online for ""poem"" leads to ""poetry,"" defined as ""a form of literary art that uses the beauty and rhythm of language."" This sounds impressive, but it overlooks the word's origins. ""Poem"" comes from the Greek word poí?ma, meaning ""a thing made,"" and a poet is ""a maker of things."" So, if a poem is a created thing, what kind of thing is it? Poets sometimes compare poems to wild animals—uncontrollable and unpredictable—or to machines—carefully designed and precise—depending on their perspective. However, these comparisons often break down upon closer examination.

The most valuable part of trying to define a poem through comparison is the discussion it generates. Whether you see a poem as a machine or a wild animal, this process can change how you think about both. It encourages us to rethink our usual ways of thinking and see ordinary things in a new way. Poems can be mental objects, especially since song lyrics often stick in our minds. The combination of words and melody has a strong impact, as shown in schoolyard rhymes like ""Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt me."" But can words sometimes hurt, like sticks and stones? 

Think about a poem in a newspaper or magazine, staring at you: a poem can resonate deeply like nothing else, even though it is just ink on paper, like the prose around it. What about the empty space around the poem—space that could have been used for a longer article or an ad? A poem is written and rewritten like any article, story, or novel, but it is not usually created to be sold. Publishers send out press releases and review copies of poetry collections, but few expect them to make back their printing costs. A poem exists not as a product for sale, but for its own sake. Because of its unique position in a magazine or book, a poem can still surprise us, even if just for a moment."
95,"I bought my first metal detector shortly after getting married. At that time, £70 was a lot of money, and it might have been wiser to spend it on something practical for our home. However, my wife, Marion, was impressed when I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first outing. Over the years, every brooch and coin I discovered brought me joy. I have always enjoyed feeling connected to the past. After the gold ring, it took 40 years before I found something that impressed Marion as much.

One dull February afternoon, I had a few hours to spare and a place in mind to search. It was raining, so I chose a nearby spot known for old farming equipment. When my detector first beeped, I found a piece of a metal wheel. Then it beeped again. I tried to ignore it, but I couldn’t walk away without checking. I dug down about half a meter and lay in the mud when I saw a rounded, golden ball. Having previously dug up brass curtain rails, I tried not to get my hopes up. But as I cleared more dirt, the ball turned into a thick, beautifully designed loop. I stopped and stared, remembering to breathe. I had seen something like this before—the Great Torc, displayed in the British Museum. It is the most famous object from Iron Age Britain, over 2,000 years ago. A torc is a beautiful necklace made of gold and silver, with gold rings at each end, just like the one I was holding.

I took it to my car, and at every stoplight on the way home, I looked at the torc on the passenger seat. I rinsed it in my kitchen sink, probably the first proper cleaning it had in centuries. “Marion!” I called out, “I have something for you.” As I admired my find, I heard my wife enter the room and pause. “What is it?” she asked after a moment. I explained that it was a very old and rare piece of jewelry. We didn’t try it on because we were afraid of damaging it. At bedtime, I hid it in our wardrobe. Although we had never been robbed, I felt anxious and restless. Eventually, I got up, unscrewed a floorboard in my office, and hid it underneath.

The law requires that such discoveries be reported to the authorities within 14 days. I wanted to enjoy the torc as much as I could before handing it over. I even took it in a plastic bag to show a friend in the hospital. Finally, I brought it to the council office in the same bag. The registrar was talking to someone with his back to me. When I placed the torc on his desk, he turned around, stopped mid-sentence, and looked surprised. The torc was verified and later sold to my local council. It is now in the British Museum in London. The £350,000 from the sale was shared between the landowner and me. However, the torc means much more to me than just a lucky find. I feel like I have preserved a piece of history for the nation. People often say, “Now that you’ve made such a fantastic discovery, will you stop detecting?” But I still find brooches and coins just as interesting. Besides, if a fisherman catches a big fish, he doesn’t stop fishing—there’s always the chance of catching an even bigger one tomorrow."
96,"Sleeping is one of my greatest joys when I travel, but I rarely mention it because I feel a bit guilty. When my friends talk about their carefully planned trips filled with activities like visiting museums and hiking, I just smile and stay quiet. What would they think if they knew my travel plans often include long naps during afternoon rainstorms and lazy mornings in cozy Italian beds? Better sleep is one of the nice benefits of traveling. 

When I went to Mexico's Yucatán coast in my early 20s, I was surprised by how many hours—over 12—I spent sleeping each day. There were many loud birds nearby, but it didn’t bother me. Away from home and my own bed, surrounded by new smells and sounds, I could enjoy a deeper, more dream-filled sleep than I ever expected. Without alarm clocks and responsibilities, sleep comes more easily. 

However, I believe that the quality of sleep while traveling is different for a reason. I think sleep is part of our travel experience, not just a break from it. When we travel, we expose ourselves to new sights, sounds, smells, and ways of living. This flood of new experiences fills us up, and when we sleep, we process all of it. It makes sense that sleep feels more intense when we are away from home.

Sleep also changes from place to place. People often worry about jet lag, but I think the challenges I face after long trips are more about adjusting to local cultures than just time differences. For instance, in Trinidad, people wake up at dawn to avoid the heat, slow down around 10 a.m. when the sun is strong, and then become active again in the cool evening. Even though Trinidad is only one hour ahead of New York, it takes me days to adapt to their different sleep patterns. When I finally adjust, I feel like I have truly arrived.

I remember one afternoon in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic, when I had a large lunch with new Dominican friends in an apartment overlooking the beautiful Caribbean Sea. After eating, we all felt sleepy, and one by one, my friends left the table to lie down on hammocks and sofas. I realized why they had so many pillows around. I took some for myself and joined them. I had heard about the Latin American tradition of the siesta, but that day, I truly experienced it. I shared not just sleep, but a piece of Dominican life.

Travel sleep has another wonderful quality: I remember it. Being far from my usual routine, I enjoy the new scents, textures, and sounds that fill my mind while I sleep. If the idea of ‘slow travel’—taking the time to enjoy each experience instead of rushing—is what makes a modern traveler aware, then what could be slower than sleep? Maybe I should stop feeling embarrassed about my love for sleep and tell my ambitious friends that travel sleep is, in fact, an important part of the journey."
97,"The woman turned away from the mirror. ""What do you think? Be honest,"" she asked. Mia picked up a medium-sized hat, soft with a nice layer of gauze and a silk bow. ""I still think this one looks best on you,"" she said diplomatically. The woman wrinkled her nose and made a face that resembled a bulldog. ""But it’s so boring,"" she replied. ""Every other woman will wear a hat like that at my daughter’s wedding. This beautiful little hat will make me stand out."" She sighed and adjusted the red and black miniature top hat on her head. ""Yes, this is the one I want,"" she decided. 

Mia realized she couldn’t change the woman’s mind. With a smile, she agreed that the woman would indeed stand out at the wedding. As she thought about her own daughter, Jen, she remembered it was Jen’s thirtieth birthday today, and they were having a family gathering. It had been a while since everyone was together, and she looked forward to seeing Jen, Dan, and Luke. She was also curious about the friend Jen was bringing, someone they didn’t know. Her husband, Jeff, had quickly pointed this out when Jen called last week to ask if she could bring Tattie. 

“Tattie?” Jeff had said when Mia shared the news. “What kind of name is that?” 

“It’s short for Tatiana,” Mia replied. “I think it’s nice.” 

“More like something pretentious,” Jeff shot back. He didn’t like anything showy and often criticized Mia for being too polite. He would have told the woman in the shop directly that she was choosing the wrong hat and might have even said a dustbin lid would look better on her. “The problem with you, Mia,” he often said, “is that you’re too polite for your own good.” 

An hour later, Mia closed her shop and entered Medlar House through the back door; her commute took only forty seconds. Four years ago, when Luke, their youngest child, left home, Mia decided to turn the unused barn next to their house into a bright space for her business. Jeff had been doubtful. “Do you really think there’s a demand for hats?” he asked. 

Mia knew from her friends that finding the perfect hat for special occasions was difficult, so she was sure there was a demand. She was right. From the first day, after Jen helped her create a website, Mia’s Hats became successful. Women traveled from far away to her showroom in Little Pelham, where she provided a relaxed atmosphere for them to try on as many hats as they needed. She encouraged customers to bring their outfits to ensure a perfect match. Recently, she expanded her business to include handbags and costume jewelry as well."
98,"It’s a long journey from London to Atlanta, and at his new home in America, Lawrence Okoye reflects on his incredible sports journey. He is confident but also surprised by how far he has come, from competing in the Olympic discus final to possibly starting a new career. Although he has never played American football before, Lawrence is likely to be chosen for one of the major teams in the USA. In Atlanta, he is still figuring out what his new role involves. The idea that a 21-year-old beginner from London could be selected for one of the biggest teams in American sports seems unbelievable. However, Lawrence is known for proving doubters wrong.

After receiving an offer to study law at Oxford University, he decided to focus on training for the discus instead, having previously played rugby. Within 20 months of starting, he became the world’s fourth-best discus thrower. Lawrence initially went to Atlanta for warm-weather training for the discus, preparing for the world championships. When asked about his unexpected opportunity in American football, he confirms that it was on his mind, but he only decided to pursue it after arriving in the USA. He had thought about it while in school in London, but it seemed unrealistic then.

Soon after arriving in America, he learned about the NFL trials in Atlanta. Even though he had no experience in the sport, he believed he could be good enough to attend the trials. “Pretty much,” he says simply. When asked if he was nervous about competing against experienced players, he replies, “No, not at all. I don’t get nervous for many things.” Although he is not very talkative, he is confident in his abilities. His performance in various tests impressed the coaches, and he was selected as the standout player. “I was very happy to hear that,” he admits, showing a rare moment of pride.

However, he remains cautious. With no basic experience, how can he make it onto an NFL team? “From what the coaches have told me, I have all the qualities needed. It’s just about how hard I work,” he explains. Will he be relaxed while waiting to hear if he has been selected? “I will be. There’s no pressure on me. Many people say I will definitely be chosen, but I’m not too worried.” This calmness may come from his disappointing experience in the Olympic discus final, where he finished last. He seems to have moved on from that moment and takes pride in having qualified for the final with a strong last throw. “That was an amazing day,” he reflects. “The final didn’t go as I wanted, but that’s part of sports. It’s something I can return to.”

After his Olympic disappointment, some speculated that he had let the experience affect him. Lawrence chooses not to comment on that. The minimum salary for an NFL player is over $400,000 a year, making the financial benefits clear. So, Lawrence has shifted from rugby to athletics and now to American football. Given his many talents, wouldn’t it be better to focus on just one sport? “I understand why someone would say that,” he replies. “I’m trying to achieve something I’ve dreamed about since I was a school kid. If it doesn’t work out, I can always return to the discus, the sport I love. Every decision I’ve made has been thought out.”"
99,"We had been flying east all night, and I woke up to find it was already daylight. Looking out the window at the empty landscape below, the dark shades of brown and green comforted me. Even though it was mid-September, Siberia had not yet changed for autumn. I saw no signs of human life, just a strange mix of mountains, streams, and forests stretching to the horizon. I shook my head. My neighbor woke up and smiled sleepily. “Good morning, Robert,” he said, saying my name with a slow Russian accent. Sergei was a salesman from Moscow, traveling to the remote areas to sell safety clothing to local mining companies. His English was almost as poor as my Russian, but with a dictionary, I explained that I was going to the far-eastern Siberian city of Magadan with a one-way ticket because I planned to return home to England by bicycle. 

“But, Robert,” he argued, “there is no road from Magadan; you cannot ride a bicycle.” I told him I believed there was a road, even if not many people used it anymore. “Alone?” he asked, pointing at me. “No, I will be riding with a friend named Al.” “Just one friend?” “Yes, just one,” I nodded. Sergei still looked doubtful and pointed outside, saying “Holodna” (cold). I tried to convince him with hand gestures that I had plenty of warm clothes, but I didn’t mention that I was on a tight budget for my trip. Most of my clothes and gear were bought at low prices. In truth, I wasn’t sure they would be good enough, especially my large postman’s over-trousers that I had bought for £10.

It all began in a lecture hall in Scotland. That morning, the hall was filled with students slumped in their seats. Some were taking notes without much energy. The lecturer droned on, and I was deep in thought about a dilemma. Should I ask him or not? “Well, why not?” I tore a fresh sheet from my pad and wrote, “Hi Al, Do you want to cycle across the Karakorum Highway between Pakistan and China this summer? Rob.” In front of me sat Al, my old school friend. I tapped him on the shoulder and passed the note. He tried to read my handwriting, scratched his head, wrote something, and passed it back. I unfolded it and held my breath while I read, “OK.” 

It was six years later that I was going to meet Al in Siberia. I had been working as a geography teacher. Although I still struggled to control my classes fully, the job met many important needs for me. It was often challenging, rarely boring, and fulfilling, plus there were long holidays to seek adventures. Twice since I started teaching, I had used these holidays to visit Al. He had caught the adventure bug after our bike ride through Pakistan and decided to do something more exciting than teaching: to cycle around the world. Since our first ride together, Al had taken on bigger challenges. This round-the-world bike trip was certainly his biggest yet. Sometimes he thought the ride would break him. Although it sounded tough, I envied him. He was having an amazing adventure, facing each new challenge, even when it seemed impossible. He was proving wrong those who said he could not do it. He was doing something that scared him nearly every day, and it made him feel alive."
100,"In The Red Bull Air Race, twelve pilots take turns racing through tall pylons that are between 15 and 25 meters high. They make sharp turns, barrel rolls, and loops while flying at speeds of up to 370 km per hour. I was invited to experience what it feels like to participate. An hour before my flight, I had to sign two forms. The first confirmed that I was healthy, and the second stated that I would empty my pockets, as small objects can be dangerous during the flight. I learned that I needed to stay oriented throughout the experience. I was told, “The horizon is your best friend,” and the pilot would guide me on where to look. I also promised to relax and enjoy the view when flying upside down.

Half an hour before the flight, I received a safety briefing where I was instructed not to touch anything. As we taxied down the runway, my legs were up, my feet avoided the important steering pedals, and my hands stayed away from the many switches nearby. Despite the instructions, I found it hard to relax and enjoy the flight. This is the challenge of high-speed acrobatic flying: to survive without fainting, you must stay calm and focused, tensing and relaxing at the right moments. Panicking is not a good idea.

As we began to accelerate down the runway, I felt nervous. Dario, the pilot, and I were in the Zivko Edge 540, one of the fastest acrobatic planes in the world. The plane took off, and just two seconds later, we made a sharp right turn. It was a sudden and intense move, and I felt the air rush out of my lungs. I looked at the horizon, tensed my body, and gasped as I sank into my seat. For a brief moment, I felt 6.2 times my normal weight. Then we leveled out, turned sharply left, and dove down, leaving my stomach behind at 2,000 meters.

Seconds later, we were just 10 meters above the ground, aiming for a small space between two pylons. We passed them at 400 km per hour, but my excitement was interrupted by another sharp turn. I was allowed to fly the plane for two minutes, but my hand shook so much that the plane shook too, as it is very responsive. Dario spoke to me, but I couldn’t hear him clearly. Instead of answering, he performed a barrel roll, a full 360-degree turn. “Are you okay?” he asked. “Yes,” I replied. “Have you had enough?” “No,” I lied. Then he did a loop, flying up and over, completing a full circle in the air.

I know many people would find this thrilling, like those who enjoy roller coasters. However, I thought it was overwhelming. At the top of the loop, while upside down, I heard a voice saying, “Relax, relax, look up.” I looked up and saw fields below. The flight lasted 10 minutes and felt easy compared to what the pilots experience during races. To show this, Dario took out sandwiches as soon as we landed and happily started eating. I didn’t eat for hours, and that night, I kept dreaming about doing loops over and over again."
101,"Doug Allan is a filmmaker who captures wild animals in cold environments. If you have ever been impressed by videos of polar bears in a nature documentary, it is likely that he filmed them. He prefers a temperature of -18°C. Allan studied marine biology and worked as a commercial diver, which was his first love. Through diving, he learned how to survive in cold conditions. His big opportunity came when a TV crew arrived in Antarctica, where he was working, to make a wildlife documentary. He ended up guiding the crew to various locations and realized that being a wildlife cameraman was perfect for him because it involved travel, adventure, and underwater experiences.

Allan has become a leading cameraman and has contributed to many important wildlife TV series. He started his career at a time when few people had explored Antarctica. While there were experts for other animals, he became known as the ""cold man."" He felt that many incredible scenes were waiting to be filmed. When he began his career 35 years ago, the camera and communication technology were very basic. He notes that filming is much easier now. In the past, if you recorded something, you had to remember it. Today, with digital technology, you can shoot a lot of footage and review it immediately. In the past, you had to carefully plan your shots because film was expensive, but now it is easy to have too much material.

Allan believes his experience in cold environments is valuable. He feels comfortable on sea ice, which now seems as easy as crossing a street to him. Although he sometimes gets cold toes, he finds the polar regions healthy because there are no leeches, diseases, or mosquitoes. He acknowledges that wildlife filming has many successes, but also failures and awkward moments. For example, while filming kittiwakes in the Orkneys, he struggled to identify the birds.

Recently, Allan received permission to film in Kong Karls Land, a group of islands in the Arctic Ocean. He knew it would be a challenging task, as it is home to polar bears and is only accessible to the bravest or most reckless individuals. In April, temperatures can drop to -32°C, and the strong winds make carrying cameras through deep snow very difficult. After walking for five or more hours each day and observing polar bear dens for 23 days, he had only seen one mother bear and her cub. However, on the 24th day, he felt as if he was in the world of bears, moving and sensing like them. 

He describes a moment when he spotted a bear. After waiting and watching, he finally saw a bear's nose appear, which quickly became its full head. The bear seemed unbothered by his presence. Just as he thought the moment couldn't get any better, the bear slid down the slope, seemingly enjoying itself. Soon after, two cubs emerged from the den, clearly seeing the world for the first time. Allan felt like he had front-row seats to a spectacular show.

Now, Allan hopes to create his own documentary about climate change in the Arctic, focusing on the people who live there and witness its effects firsthand. He believes he could make an extraordinary film."
102,"In 2004, Pen Hadow became the first person to walk to the North Pole alone without getting supplies along the way. This journey involved swimming in extremely cold waters and facing dangers like frostbite and polar bears. Just eight months later, he reached the South Pole as well. Now, he is back in the Arctic, preparing for an even more ambitious expedition. Explorers like Pen are confident and determined individuals, which is essential for their work. This time, however, the stakes are much higher. Pen and two colleagues will embark on a three-month, 1,000-kilometer trek to the North Pole, where they will take detailed measurements of the ice's thickness and density. No one has done this before, and Pen understands that the results will be crucial for scientists. This research will provide a clearer understanding of how global warming is affecting the polar ice.

Pen was prepared for this kind of work from a young age. He was raised by his father's old nanny, who had worked for the famous polar explorer, Scott of the Antarctic. She toughened him up by sending him out into harsh weather with minimal clothing. His father also inspired his love for adventure in cold places, and Pen developed remarkable physical endurance. He is married to Mary, a horsewoman who shares his passion for the outdoors. Mary helps run his polar guide business and often worries about him more when he is at home, saying, ""He’s in more danger driving along the A303 because I know that in his head he’s somewhere in the Arctic."" For fun, she once raced against him in a mountain event where horseback riders compete against runners, and she finished an hour ahead of him. 

Pen and Mary live in the countryside with their two children. He admits that it is much harder to be away from them this time. When he last went on an expedition, his children were one and five years old. He made a mistake in how he said goodbye, telling his son to take care of his mother and sister. His son took this seriously and constantly checked on them, which became too much for him. Although Pen meant well, he feels it was unfair. For this trip, he plans to have very little contact with his family while in the Arctic, as he believes that calling them would only remind them of how far away he is.

In the days leading up to his departure, Pen is meticulously preparing his equipment. He knows that once he is on the ice, it will be very difficult to fix anything or do anything complicated. He will be joined by Ann Daniels, a leading polar explorer, and Martin Hartley, the expedition photographer. They will have a support crew of six people who will fly in supplies. Pen finds being part of a team stressful, and he is also concerned about his age. He will turn 47 soon and feels he has not trained as much as he would like. He explains that organizational tasks often take priority, leaving him anxious about the challenges ahead.

Pen believes that his mission connects exploration with the quest for knowledge that motivated earlier generations to explore the unknown. He admits that reaching the North Pole was mainly a personal goal and had limited value for anyone outside the polar exploration community. This time, however, scientists will benefit from the data collected, and they aim to engage as many people as possible in understanding what is happening in the Arctic Ocean. Pen emphasizes that this is important work, and they are uniquely qualified to do it. ""Our skills, which may seem strange and unnecessary in everyday life, have become extremely relevant. Suddenly, we are socially useful again,"" he says."
103,"Text: 'I took a year off. What was I going to do? Being a successful Olympian is a wonderful experience. I had the opportunity to do more writing and TV work, and to speak to businesses and schools. Although I enjoyed these different activities, I felt there was nothing competitive to focus on. I wanted to stay fit so I could compete for an Olympic spot if that dream came back to me. So, I signed up for marathons and triathlons. That should have been enough, but I kept thinking about Ben Fogle’s invitation: ‘Do you want to row across the Atlantic with me?’ I have always loved rowing and the feeling of the boat moving through the water. I missed that feeling, but I wasn’t ready to train every day. Still, I wanted some kind of competition. I asked some of my rowing friends if they wanted to join the race, but they weren’t very interested. I knew that if I entered the race, even though it was called an adventure, I would want to win. Would rowing with Ben give me the best chance to win? Probably not. But being an underdog without pressure was appealing. I contacted Ben. He was going to participate in the race anyway and had managed to gather the large entry fee and deposit for a boat, making the race a real possibility. We discussed the other costs; the boat and equipment would cost £70,000, which is a lot of money. We believed we had a better chance than most, but it would still require effort to secure funding. Additionally, I had to consider the loss of income from being away from home. Speaking at business conferences is one of the best ways to earn money as a retired athlete. It’s nice that people are interested, but I find it hard to talk about my past without a new goal. Joining the race would mean I wouldn’t just be discussing past achievements; I would actually be doing something again: rowing across the Atlantic. I learned a lot while planning this adventure, but one of the biggest lessons was to appreciate the easy life of a full-time athlete. My preparation for the Olympics was tough, with my life focused on getting in the best shape possible, but looking back, it was quite simple. Yes, I trained almost every day, but the training program was organized, and I had doctors and dieticians to help. I was worried about how people would react to me racing with a TV presenter. I feared it would seem like I just wanted to be on TV, or else I would have chosen a better partner to win the race. However, my concerns faded as we prepared. The Atlantic Rowing Race is about more than just rowing; it’s also about mental strength. Ben had completed the difficult Marathon des Sables, spent time at sea, and lived on a deserted island. However, he didn’t know how to row. I was surprised by how little natural ability he had with a boat, and he was shocked by my lack of understanding. I could have been more patient, but I felt it was important to be honest with Ben about the significant improvements he needed to make. I should have realized that this would be his level when I agreed to race with him.'"
104,"Just over a year ago, I left my job in London to work with huskies in the Arctic Circle in northern Finland. At 26, I felt restless and dreamed of cold, empty landscapes, perhaps because I was tired of the busy life in London. I found a small company run by Anna McCormack and her husband, Pasi Ikonen, in Finnish Lapland. They offered me a position as a husky dog handler for the winter season. From December to February, they take many tourists on sled rides pulled by huskies across the snow and ice, for trips that can last from one hour to five days. They started with six dogs, but now have over 100. Recently, they acquired a second location called the 'wilderness farm,' which they described as a beautiful but basic place with unreliable electricity and no running water. They told me I could join their team for three months, but warned me that the hours would be long, the conditions tough, and the work very physical. I began packing right away.

On November 6, while flying to Finland, I stared at a page with over 100 pictures of huskies, trying to memorize their names. I felt distracted and anxious, so I looked out the window instead. I thought about how spring moves north at about 26 km per day, bringing flowers and leaves. However, I felt like winter was moving south, freezing the rivers.

On November 7, I took a bus north, which was just as I had hoped. We drove through endless dark forests filled with snow-covered trees, stopping occasionally for reindeer. I arrived at the farm after dark and was quickly given a pair of boots and sent outside into the cold. Anna asked if I wanted to be thrown in at the deep end, and I followed the sound of barking to the dogsheds. There, I saw three people running around, harnessing the excited huskies to sleds. I could barely introduce myself because everyone was too busy. I stood to the side and petted one of the calmer dogs. Someone urged me to get in, and I almost fell into the nearest sled. A command was shouted, and we took off into the dark, guided only by a headlamp.

By November 15, I was starting to learn how to be a husky guide, but first, I faced a tough questioning about my skills. Anna asked if I was useful, and I was unsure. I realized I wasn’t very useful: I had never driven a snowmobile, hadn’t done woodwork since school, and had never chopped anything with an axe. Finally, someone asked if I had a driving license, and I nodded, feeling relieved. 

I quickly learned the basics of dog-sledding: lean into the corners, use both feet on the brake to stop, and never let go of the handlebar. However, many other tasks were complicated. Simple things like feeding and watering the dogs became hard in freezing temperatures. A bowl of water would freeze quickly, so we had to make a 'soup' of meat in hot water for the dogs. By the end of my first week, I was overwhelmed with instructions, and my muscles ached from pulling heavy sleds and being pulled around by excited huskies. But I felt proud. I emailed my friends, saying, ""I can chop with an axe, hammer a nail, and use a circular saw—in the snow!"""
105,"On that day, when Radcliffe crossed the finish line, reporters gathered to understand her amazing performance. They noted that her time was fast enough to qualify her for the men's marathon at the world championships in Paris. Curious journalists asked her about the benefits of emu oil, a natural treatment recommended by Olympic gold medallist Cathy Freeman to heal injuries Radcliffe suffered when she accidentally collided with a bike during training. Radcliffe said that the significance of her achievement didn’t fully hit her at the time. Looking back, she realizes it was a big deal, but she felt it was just what she was meant to do that day, so it didn’t feel overwhelming. She and her team had decided not to set any limits, following the motto: no limits.

During the race, Gary Lough, Radcliffe's husband and coach, was in a car with her support team, listening to the radio coverage. Gerard Hartmann, her physiotherapist, was with him. After 16 kilometers, Radcliffe's agent wondered if she could maintain her fast pace, fearing it might cause her to drop out. Hartmann was upset by this concern, although he acknowledged that anyone unfamiliar with her fitness might see it as a risk to start so quickly.

With 800 meters left, Radcliffe began to think about her finish time. She realized she could complete the race in under 2 hours and 16 minutes if she finished the last stretch in less than three minutes. After running 41 kilometers at a fast pace, she managed to sprint the final distance in 2 minutes and 25 seconds. At the finish, she thought, ""I can run faster than that."" She remembered the race director, Dave Bedford, saying he never expected anyone to come close to that time for a long time, and she thought, ""I will come back and do it next year."" Unfortunately, that did not happen.

After the race, many were curious about how Radcliffe, who had an unusual running style, managed to outperform the skilled East African runners. Hartmann had worked closely with Radcliffe for weeks, providing daily training sessions to support her as she ran 250-300 kilometers each week. He said, ""I've worked with 63 Olympic medallists, and no one else could handle that level of pain. She would push me to my limits; I had to ice my thumbs afterward because I was in so much pain.""

Hartmann described traveling 13 hours from Ireland to Radcliffe's training base in France, only to be greeted by her husband saying, ""Gerard, you're 15 minutes late, Paula's waiting."" There was no time for pleasantries; she was ready for a two-hour training session. ""Paula would push you to give everything you had. That’s what made her so successful."" Hartmann dedicated so much time to Radcliffe that other athletes he worked with became resentful.

When asked if Radcliffe could explain why no one has come close to her record, she replied, ""Not really. I trained very hard, but there are more talented people out there. I thought Mary Keitany, a two-time London marathon winner, might achieve it. Maybe it’s because people are competing against each other instead of focusing on their own performance."" She explained, ""That mindset of never easing up, even when you’re winning, probably helped me because I never thought, 'I can relax now.' It was always about pushing myself as hard as I could.""

Radcliffe did not realize at the time that this marathon was the peak of her career, and she would never run that fast again. However, she inspired many women to take up long-distance running."
106,"When my first cooking show, In Search of Perfection, was released, I was unsure how viewers and critics would react. At that time, there was a lot of discussion about a food ‘revolution’ happening in Britain. I believed we had created a series that truly contributed to this movement, but I still worried: would people enjoy a cooking show that included not just techniques but also history, nostalgia, and science? I watched the first episode feeling both excited and anxious. Fortunately, I needn’t have worried. The show became very successful, leading to many interesting projects, including a book about my experiences at my restaurant. Each project felt like a journey, whether into the past, the mind, or cooking techniques. I later wrote several books in a series called ‘Perfection’, each linked to its own TV show. In these books, the journey was often physical, involving passports, suitcases, and travel plans. The latest book, In Search of Total Perfection, takes you around the world to meet amazing artisans, like a man who finds joy in making golden pasta that tastes better than any other. These artisans have spent years chasing their own ideas of perfection. 

Perfection is very personal. Even choosing which dishes to feature in the series was challenging, and I knew I would disappoint some people by not including their favorites. I could imagine them asking, “Where’s steak and kidney pie and bread and butter pudding?” However, after a long meeting with the TV production team, we finally created a list that would satisfy everyone. This experience reinforced my belief that each person has their own view of perfection, shaped by their emotions, memories, and environment. Despite the book’s title, I knew I wouldn’t claim that the recipes were the ultimate versions. I believed that by using my skills and knowledge, and by talking to food producers, artisans, chefs, and their customers, I could identify what made these dishes special. 

The dictionary defines ‘perfection’ as being perfect, but it also means improving through constant experimentation. It’s about trying ideas and refining them until something unique emerges. The TV series allowed me to explore many foods, people, and places I had never seen in restaurants, and I was excited to delve into the memories and nostalgia connected to food, as I began my career in a similar way. Finding the best ingredients took me around the world. I had many adventures, such as visiting a canning factory that was processing the wrong type of tomato and going to a dairy farm that did not meet our standards for perfection, which forced us to stop filming there! While perfecting each recipe, I ended up hand-milking a cow and using dry ice to make ice cream, cooking chicken in a hospital scanning machine, and almost burning my house down trying to get the oven hot enough for a real Neapolitan-style pizza."
107,"We were still a long way from Marrakech when the van made a loud noise, swerved off the road into a field, and stopped. John got out and opened the hood. He looked at the engine for a long time with his hands in his pockets, looking like he knew what he was doing. Finally, he said, “Actually, I have no idea what I’m doing,” and he and Mum started to laugh. Bea was worried, saying, “We can’t stay here forever.” The field was big and empty, just grass and many flowers like poppies and daisies. I agreed with Bea, saying, “No, we can’t stay here forever.” We got back into the van and waited for Mum and John to stop laughing. We watched John get smaller as he walked away to find someone who could help with the van. Mum lay down on the grass and said, “Tell us a story.” Bea lay down next to her and encouraged me to tell a story. I shared how, the day before we left London, I heard two birds talking about breadcrumbs, other birds, the weather, and an argument over a worm. Bea said, “That’s silly, no one understands bird language.” My eyes felt teary. I said, “I do,” but I didn’t sound very sure. Bea called me a liar, and I felt embarrassed. How could I be lying if I remembered everything? I thought about asking Mum, but she had fallen asleep in the sun. 

John came back with three Moroccan boys who helped us push the van to the hotel. Bea didn’t want to get out, but the boys waved and smiled at her through the back windows. We followed John into a café that was not far from where our van was parked. “It’s a hotel,” John whispered. “It might be a bit expensive.” Mum reassured him, saying, “We’ll just have some tea,” and we sat in the shade. The tea was made from mint leaves and was very sweet. Mum looked into the pot and said, “It’s like syrup in there.” We stayed at the café all day while John looked sadly at the engine. When it started to get dark, he said, “I guess it’s a miracle it got us this far.” Mum took out blankets and made a bed for us in the hotel garden. It felt nice to sleep on solid ground. John said, “I’ll have to get us towed into Marrakech.” 

Half an hour later, we were in a truck watching our van being pulled behind with John driving. At first, Bea didn’t want to move, so John picked her up and put her in the truck. Now she sat in the front with the driver. I kept wondering how we would get home since our van had to be towed everywhere. I thought it might be easier to take a boat straight to London. Then I must have fallen asleep."
108,"Lucy was at a welcome party in a hotel ballroom, talking to two other pianists who were also at the Prague Classical Music Festival. They were not competing like she was. One was a man from Tokyo, and the other was a woman from a European city whose name Lucy didn’t quite hear, maybe Liesel or Louisa. They were both about ten years older than Lucy and spoke English well enough to discuss the music they were playing and their recent travels. 

“I think I’m doing Tanglewood this summer,” Lucy said, trying to sound impressive. However, she didn’t really want to go to the Tanglewood festival. She often felt overwhelmed by the concerts and competitions that took her around the world, making her miss so much school that she was no longer officially enrolled. Instead, she worked with tutors from the University of San Francisco. 

Lucy hadn’t even wanted to come to the Prague Festival, which only accepted fifteen pianists her age from around the world. She had been selected from thousands of applicants. There had been a celebration, and her dad bought her a white-gold necklace with an L pendant to congratulate her. Her little brother Gus dreamed of being at the same festival one day. Her teacher, Grace Chang, took Lucy out for a special dinner to plan her music pieces. The truth was, Lucy hadn’t applied herself; her mother had filled out the application and sent in a CD. “I didn’t want you to be disappointed if you didn’t get in,” her mom had said. Lucy thought her mom just didn’t want to give her the chance to say no. At that time, Lucy believed that causing trouble was the worst thing to do, so she didn’t think about trying to back out.

The man from Tokyo leaned in, seeming surprised. “Tanglewood?” he asked. “Yeah,” Lucy replied. “How old are you?” he asked. “Fifteen,” she said. He exchanged a look with Liesel/Louisa, who said, “Wow.” Lucy hadn’t meant to brag; it was hard to know when she was just sharing her experiences or showing off. “It’s just part of this new youth-spotlight thing they’re trying…” Liesel/Louisa interrupted, looking across the room as if she saw someone she needed to talk to. The man from Tokyo stayed and asked, “Have you ever been to Japan?” He had long, messy hair, like many musicians, to show they were cool even if they loved music.

“Once, when I was about eight,” Lucy replied. He started to respond when Lucy's grandfather appeared beside her. “Lucy, let me introduce you to someone,” he said, pulling her away from the conversation. “And don’t get too friendly with the competition.” “They’re not the competition,” Lucy replied. “Everyone is the competition,” her grandfather insisted. He took her around the room, making her talk to important people. Lucy smiled and nodded, understanding only part of what was said.

Later, in the elevator to their suite, her grandfather said, “You did well in there, Lucy. I’m proud of you. This is an important festival, and people are talking about you. They all know who you are.” She liked that part—being recognized. Even if some people were jealous or thought she was too young for the attention she received. Being a concert pianist didn’t earn her respect from the kids at her old school. Even her best friend, Reyna, wouldn’t care that she could play a difficult Rachmaninov piece perfectly. But in places like this, Lucy felt she mattered."
109,"Text: ""‘Spending too much time online isn’t good for you. You should spend more time in the real world,’ said Dad. It’s hard to argue with him, so I looked into what experts say about this topic, and I found it quite interesting. Research shows that many teenagers who use social media have a large group of real-life friends, a strong sense of identity, and are learning important technical skills for the digital world. Simon Miles, an expert in online safety, states that ‘social networking is now a key part of growing up. Teenagers don’t just use media like adults do; they live in it. This isn’t necessarily good or bad – it depends on how you use it.’ 

How does our social networking compare to what our parents did when they were young? Jim Matthews, a social media analyst, describes it as ‘the modern version of hanging out at the youth club, where parents used to share jokes and gossip. It’s like a virtual youth club.’ He explains that it helps teenagers form their identity away from their parents and learn to handle teenage issues while connecting with their peers. 

Psychologist Professor Keith Davidson says, ‘Adolescence is a time for discovering who you are. Social networking can help with this self-discovery: you can share your favorite music or sports, find out what you enjoy, and see that others have different perspectives. Research shows that active social networkers are not as self-centered as those who don’t use social media.’ He adds that social media can be helpful for shy people: ‘Talking online can be easier than in person, and it allows you to practice social skills in a less intimidating way.’ 

Professor Andrew Phillips is studying how young people use social networking sites. He believes they can be beneficial for quiet individuals with specific interests because they connect with others who share those interests. ‘If you’re one of only a few people in your school who likes a certain type of music, you might feel alone. But finding a social networking group of similar people can make you feel connected and popular in a different way,’ he explains. 

Pauline White, a digital education expert, shared an interesting point: ‘Young people who discover new interests online, join networks of like-minded individuals, and create their own content are truly making the most of social networks.’ She believes social networking is becoming a creative outlet: teenagers are making videos, podcasts, and blogs about their interests. Photo-sharing sites are changing how we express creativity. Passionate photographers can connect, learn skills, share images, and deepen their interests. ‘This enhances employability and will be valuable in the workplace,’ she says. ‘Every business uses social media to promote and build brand awareness – understanding how it works is essential. For instance, if you create a product and have 1,000 friends on various social networks, they could all be potential customers. Linking these networks creates your customer base.’ 

Teenagers who use social networking creatively will benefit when they become adults and enter the job market, Matthews agrees. ‘One great feature of many sites is the chance to collaborate with others to create and share content. Collaboration is a vital skill in the 21st century and is important for being employable in a digital world.’"""
110,"When people think of a relaxing family vacation, they might not imagine a long trip across nine western states in the US and a Canadian province. However, my parents were not interested in a quiet getaway when they planned our summer vacation this year. My dad seemed determined to create what he called the ultimate family bonding experience, which my twin brother and I found terrifying. “Not enough people do this anymore,” my parents said repeatedly, while we exchanged worried looks.

In mid-June, we packed our car with suitcases, coolers, and a mix of clothes for any weather. I was excited but knew I would miss my privacy for the next two weeks. With barely enough space left for us, we began “The Family Great American Road Trip.” Leaving our spacious home for smaller places over the next five thousand miles made me wonder what we had gotten ourselves into.

We headed west through the Oklahoma panhandle. Even though we were still close to home, we had our share of adventures. We stopped for the night in Oklahoma, under a sky full of stars, after almost being blown off the road by a dust storm. We quickly learned that cattle have the right-of-way on the road!

The next day, we woke up early and continued our journey. The desert changed to mountains, and the days started to blend together, but each adventure was still unique. We left our footprints in the Great Sand Dunes and then moved on to Pagosa Springs, Colorado, where we noticed a strong smell of sulfur. As we climbed to our next stop, we realized that the roads marked for Jeeps were best for actual Jeep drivers.

Every place we visited showed a mix of old and new. Dealing with construction traffic became normal. We laughed at the large “CLOSED” signs in front of the Four Corners Monument. On our way to Yellowstone National Park, we saw many wind farms and watched the sunset over bear habitats near the roads. We experienced “bear jams,” where traffic would stop to let bears cross, and had a memorable encounter with a bear and a nervous park ranger.

As we continued driving, life back home felt distant, and even our hotel, which was an old building with no internet or cell service, couldn’t dampen our excitement. Instead, I enjoyed some of the most beautiful views I had ever seen. After watching a rainstorm from our hotel in Canada, we began our journey back south. My parents were right; you don’t need to travel to a faraway place to find something amazing. 

Returning home was a mix of emotions, but at least I hadn’t argued with my brother during our one hundred hours on the road! We had three thousand photos from our adventure to look through, and I knew that the best memories would be the unexpected and spontaneous moments."
111,"Rose Frost was sixteen years old and was going to live with her grandmother, Daisy. Rose's family was separating for two years. Her father, Jeff, had a job overseas, and her mother, Dahlia, would join him. Rose and her older sister, Amy, would stay in England. Amy needed to finish her last year of school, so it was better for her to remain there. She was happy to have the best room at her college, which included a kitchen and study area, along with free Internet and phone access. Jeff and Dahlia would keep an eye on Amy, whether she liked it or not. 

Rose was moving to her grandmother’s house. She only had vague memories of her grandmother from past holidays and had never met her grandfather. When Daisy offered Rose a place to stay, her parents were not excited about it, but Daisy was eager to reconnect with her granddaughter. Rose didn’t fully understand why her parents had issues with her grandmother, but there had been a disagreement in the past, leading to summers spent away from Daisy. Rose remembered her last goodbye at age ten, and those memories were happy. Dahlia suggested that living with Daisy would be interesting. Daisy was very social and loved to bring people together. Rose could expect dinner invitations, coffee mornings, and shopping trips soon, which made her smile. Daisy was not a typical frail old lady; she seemed to attend more social events than anyone else.

Before the move, Dahlia and Rose had a serious talk. Rose was sensible and mature for her age. She understood healthy eating, fitness, and the importance of sleep. However, she wanted her independence. Living with Daisy would meet her needs, but Rose wanted to play music loudly, invite friends over, and go out without always asking for permission. She believed she could be trusted with these small things. She didn’t want to be nagged about homework or curfews, and she didn’t want to be controlled by her grandmother. Daisy understood this.

Dahlia gave Rose a new touch-screen mobile phone with a video camera for emergencies only, which made Rose very happy. They all agreed that their relationship would be based on trust. Daisy would trust Rose to make mature decisions, and Rose would trust Daisy not to be too strict. If either of them crossed a line, they would talk about it again.

Rose was not a wild child. Her few school friends were similar, so her school reports were always good, and her exam results were excellent. This helped her a lot. In five weeks, Rose would start at a new school, meet new friends, and begin her life again. This would be her fourth senior school in five years, so she felt experienced. At least she knew this would be the last time, as she would be starting her final two years of school. For Rose, this was a new chapter in her life."
112,"Charlotte Grainger shares that her primary school teacher was the first to think she might write a novel. She felt that writing a book was a big challenge and, unlike other teenagers who aimed for things like the Olympics, she decided to try writing when she turned 13. Now, the novel she started at that age is about to be published. When she recently told her former teacher about it, the teacher was surprised, as she had expected Charlotte to write a book when she was much older, around 30 or 40. Charlotte found it strange that she should wait to pursue something she felt she could be good at.

On a winter afternoon, I met Charlotte in her publisher's office. I was surprised to see a 15-year-old girl sitting there, even though I knew I was interviewing a teenager about her book. The book is a significant achievement; it is well-written and exciting. The only thing that reveals its young author is the age of the main character. A public relations representative was present, but Charlotte did not need any support. She is confident, intelligent, and grounded, showing a maturity beyond her years.

Charlotte recognizes the limits of her youth. When I asked her about the complex moral questions in her book, she said she was more interested in asking big questions than providing answers. She laughed, saying she doesn’t think her age limits her understanding of the world, but she also doesn’t consider herself particularly wise. She wanted to explore the theme of taking responsibility.

Charlotte has a theory about how teenagers are often misrepresented in fiction. She believes there are three common types of teenage characters: the outsider who becomes accepted, the naïve teenager who knows little about the world, and the socially awkward teen. She found it frustrating to see these stereotypes repeated. She wondered, “What if you’re just fine?” Many stories suggest that teenagers are inadequate or lost, which can harm their self-confidence.

Although Charlotte enjoys reading works by famous fantasy authors, she admits that their depth sometimes discouraged her from writing. She questioned whether she needed to explore such complex themes to write well. However, she found helpful advice in a book called How Not to Write a Novel, which taught her that if readers can predict what will happen next, the suspense is likely gone.

Some might think that Charlotte's parents, both journalists, played a crucial role in getting her novel published. Her father's connections in publishing helped her get her book read. She is grateful for this opportunity, as it is challenging for any new writer to have their first novel read, regardless of age. She believes that every aspiring writer needs support and a bit of luck, but ultimately, success depends on their talent. Charlotte concludes that she does not take her achievements for granted."
113,"""‘Remember, speed is your friend, not your enemy,’ said Gareth, our instructor, as we looked down the ski slope. ‘Now, who wants to go first?’ The group looked nervous. Then David, who had some experience with freestyle ski-jumping and wanted to show off, stepped forward and skied down the slope towards the jump. He approached the ramp quickly and flew into the air, arms flailing. Even we could see something was wrong. We held our breath. He landed hard, losing both skis, and flipped head-first into the snow. ‘Remember,’ Gareth kindly reminded us, ‘speed can be unpredictable.’ Maybe freestyle skiing wasn’t for me. On past skiing holidays, I enjoyed practicing turns in the snow. I wasn’t like those teenagers who did tricks on ramps and half pipes at skate parks. I thought it looked fun, but I felt I would be ridiculed if I tried to join them with their baggy pants and special slang. Then my parents decided we would have a winter holiday at a freestyle skiing training center in the US. It had a large indoor facility with trampolines and ski jumps covered in artificial snow, where students practiced their tricks and landed in foam pits – not a realistic way to prepare for the slopes. After practicing indoors, students went outside to try their skills for real. ‘Progression is inevitable!’ the center’s slogan cheerfully promised. ‘Before places like this trained people, inexperienced ski jumpers would just throw themselves down the slopes and hope for the best,’ said Gareth. ‘But remember – if you land on the knuckle, you’ll be in trouble.’ The ‘knuckle’ is the flat area behind the jump before the slope becomes the landing zone. Landing in the zone allows you to continue moving forward, reducing impact. Landing on the flat stops you suddenly, which is painful. So, speed is important. At first, it was hard to convince my body to ignore my brain’s fears and race towards the jump. My legs seemed to go backward as I neared the launch point, and I landed hard on the knuckle. I didn’t fall, but by midday, I felt exhausted. ‘You need to control the jump, not let it control you,’ said Gareth. 

Day two began on the trampolines. I thought I would dislike being indoors while looking at the snowy mountains, but bouncing on the trampolines was fun. Some drills mimicked ski-jumping moves, while others taught ‘aerial awareness’ – understanding what your body is doing while spinning in the air. Gareth provided commentary. My ‘aerial awareness’ needed improvement – I was only aware of the moment before take-off and then found myself in the foam cubes next to the trampoline. We returned to the mountain to try again. There were more setbacks before I finally landed correctly. Gareth seemed as happy as I was, and for a moment, I felt proud of achieving such a difficult goal. But that feeling didn’t last long. On my last run of the day, I forced myself to keep my speed up as I approached the jump, became airborne, and landed correctly in the landing zone. Then I noticed both skis sliding down the slope ahead, no longer attached to my feet."""
114,"Imagine you are on a rollercoaster at an amusement park. Your hands are sweaty with fear, and you grip the harness tightly. Suddenly, the ride stops, and you take a deep breath as the carriage slowly climbs up. There’s a pause, then a sudden drop that makes your stomach feel weightless. You rush forward, turn sharply to the left, and go upside down. Your senses are overwhelmed, and you scream in fear. But you chose to be here, just like millions of others who pay to enter theme parks.

What surprises me is how big the amusement park industry is, with thrilling rides designed to attract crowds. Behind the scenes, there are many creative and skilled engineers, designers, and marketing experts working hard. The idea of being a ""rollercoaster designer"" might sound like a childhood dream, but it is actually a tough job. Designers must find the right mix of excitement and safety while also introducing new features to keep visitors interested. 

While many people think rollercoasters are becoming more extreme, most of the techniques used today were developed by John Miller, a US designer, in the early 20th century. During his time, there were fewer safety regulations, and some rides were quite uncomfortable for passengers. Now, designers must work within the limits set by specialized ride manufacturers.

I spoke with three experts in rollercoaster design. Professor Brendan Walker, a ""thrill engineer,"" explained that the skill lies in putting all the elements together. Dr. John Roberts, a member of the Royal Academy of Engineering, added that it’s about quickly alternating between thrilling and calming sensations so that riders feel excited but safe. 

To create an amazing ride, teams must develop a strong story, whether it’s a space adventure or a jungle chase, and combine it with exciting features like the tallest drops or the most twists. However, Professor Walker noted that, like in many creative fields, intuition, experience, and trial-and-error are crucial. Jeff Hornick, a senior director in theme park development, agreed that understanding what riders want and testing the rides before they open is important.

I asked the experts if rollercoaster designers would need to use new technologies like virtual reality. Walker responded that while virtual reality can enhance the experience, the physical thrill of the ride will always be the main attraction. New technologies come and go, but the core experience of riding a rollercoaster will remain essential for many years."
115,"At 25, Miranda Ellington has accomplished a lot as a choreographer, creating performances for many theatres and dance companies. She also dances occasionally. I wonder why she manages to do both in her busy life. She explains, “Dancing again reminds me of what it’s like to be in the studio, following the instructions of strict choreographers, which can be stressful. Choreographers sometimes forget how it feels to rehearse all day.”

As a choreographer, she takes on a teaching role and enjoys working with young dancers. “Beginners are often open to trying new ideas. In some ways, it’s easier to work with students than professionals because they are willing to take risks. They are eager to succeed but don’t yet fully understand their strengths and weaknesses. This lack of clarity helps them accept even tough criticism. However, they might still question my advice, and I appreciate their honest feedback.”

When Miranda starts with a new group, she focuses on the dance steps, guided by the music. “There might be music I don’t like, but I still strive to create the best dance routine for it. If dancers don’t respond well to a certain piece, it can be frustrating, but I must find solutions. I can’t just choose a new piece of music. Ideally, I would like to experiment more and have the option to switch music, which would help improve the atmosphere during tough rehearsals. Unfortunately, I often work on large productions where the music is already decided and cannot be changed.”

Miranda believes in making connections with new people rather than sticking to one institution. “It’s important to meet new people, but I must remember that each theatre and school has different methods and styles. I need to adapt my approach each time I work somewhere new, which helps me avoid becoming too set in my ways.”

We discuss a recent documentary about professional ballet dancers and choreographers. “Previous glamorous documentaries have been misleading,” Miranda says. “This one tries to show the real life inside a dance company. There’s a scene where a young dancer receives many corrections, and I smiled because I recognized that struggle. She knows she’s not getting it right but can’t make her body do what’s needed. It’s hard to watch, but it’s genuine. The public often underestimates the hard work and dedication required in ballet.”

I ask Miranda what makes a great dance production. “It’s when everything the company has worked on – the music, costumes, lighting, and dancers – comes together. While perfection is hard to achieve, aiming high is appreciated by audiences and can help cover up some artistic mistakes. I’ve been part of productions where the dance steps are excellent, but distracting costumes or props can be disappointing.”

Given her diverse work, I wonder how she defines herself: is she a modern dance choreographer or a ballet expert? “People like to label you, and I don’t understand that. There’s also a trend to specialize in a narrow area. I don’t follow that, but maybe one day I’ll be known for one thing. For now, I want to broaden my experiences.”"
116,"A friend once asked me why I travel when I can see everything on television. I agreed that TV shows us amazing things, but why stay at home when there is so much to experience outside? This conversation inspired my unusual four-day trip and a film that encourages people to turn off their TVs. A friend was getting rid of his old sofa, which became the main focus of my film. I added three wheels and some cables to it, attaching them to old seatbelts over my shoulders. I placed my luggage on the sofa and slept on it each night, even spending one night on the beach. Several friends joined me, helping to pull the sofa and motivating me to keep going. I have done many walking trips in recent years, but this was completely different. It was the longest distance I have ever walked, and I walked on main roads, which allowed me to stop at cafés and enjoy a cappuccino on the sofa instead of having my sandwiches blown away while sitting on a rock. I often had to tell people, “No, I’m not doing this for charity, and I’m not training for a marathon.” When someone at work asks about my weekend, I prefer to share how I dragged a sofa 100 miles across southern England rather than talk about the latest TV show. You can watch the film on my website."
117,"When I read about guided swimming trips in the sea around some small Greek islands, I felt excited. I had never tried organized group trips before. My brother, who I had traveled with before, was busy, so I thought a group holiday would be a good idea. The man at the Greek port looked surprised when I asked for a single ferry ticket, as the islands are popular with families. I explained that I wouldn’t be alone for long; I would be joining ten others to swim around the small islands. Although he still looked confused, he smiled and let me on the ferry.

Our group had exchanged emails before we left, but there was little time to talk before our first group swim. Our guides explained that a support boat would follow us the whole time and made sure we knew how to communicate with it. We did a short swim to divide us into speed groups, and then it was time for our first proper swim of 1.5 km, which made me nervous. I had trained in my local pool and done some river swimming, but I had never swum long distances in the open sea. Soon, the waves got bigger, and I found myself at the back of the slow group, which was not where I wanted to be. I watched the faster swimmers move ahead like dolphins. However, I wanted to finish this first distance, and I was very happy when I finally did it on my own.

The following days had a routine: jumping in, finding a comfortable speed, and stopping to enjoy the beautiful scenery. As the swims became longer, my speed and enjoyment also increased. I felt less need for the support boat. I can hardly wait to come back again next year."
118,"Being a flight attendant is not an easy job, but it has many rewards. Since I started, I have traveled to many places, from the US to Australia. I work with amazing people, have plenty of time off, and my life is always interesting, which makes it a great job for someone young like me!

As a child, I attended a boarding school far from my family, so I often flew alone at the beginning and end of each term. Sometimes I felt lonely, so I would ask the flight attendants if I could help serve meals to passengers, and some of them let me. This experience stayed with me when I decided to leave my banking job and look for a new career.

At the interview for the flight attendant position, there were many young people, and many of us were hired. Like me, they were often well-qualified and looking to change careers. Before the interview, I practiced what to say. I wanted to stand out, so instead of just saying I loved to travel, I talked about my skills and past work experience. This approach helped me get the job!

I would recommend this job to anyone because it has many benefits, although the free flights are not the main reason. Most airline staff work very hard, and there is a saying: ""no one is finished until everyone is finished."" It feels like a big family; even if we don’t see each other often, we are still close. When I’m not working, I don’t have to take my job home with me. If I do encounter difficult passengers, which is rare, I remind myself that the flight will end soon, and I probably won’t see them again!"
119,"At the summer camp where I work, I really enjoy watching the children achieve things they never thought they could. Most of the children already know how to swim and play table tennis before they arrive, but rock climbing is a new experience for many of them. Some children feel nervous at first, but with encouragement, they decide to try, and eventually, they all reach the top. This accomplishment makes them feel wonderful.

At the start of the week, some children miss their homes. Interestingly, it is not the younger ones who feel this way the most; it is usually the ten- to thirteen-year-olds. We limit their use of mobile phones. We first tell them they can call home after lunch. When they ask again, often after dinner, we explain that it is too late to call and suggest they do it the next day. Most children adjust within a couple of days, and by the end of their stay, they come to us to express their gratitude for the enjoyable time they had.

It is not only the children who feel lonely. We also have parents who frequently call to check on their child, which is often unnecessary. Their child is usually busy playing games or engaging in other activities, so we have to ask the parents to call back later.

We often see a certain type of child at camp, typically dressed in expensive new clothes. These children often argue when we ask them to change into more appropriate attire, but soon they understand the reason behind our request."
120,"'Rock the Planet is a musical show where the actors also need to be skilled musicians. It opened in London last year after being in the USA for five years, where it won the title of ‘Best Musical’ four times! However, putting on the show with an all-British cast was difficult. The UK has stricter rules about how many performances young actors can do each week compared to the USA, where they can perform more often. This meant that they needed twice as many actors in the UK. Fortunately, the director found many talented actors based in the UK, and they have just won their first ‘Best Musical’ award. 

Even though the theatre in London is larger than the one in the USA, it has been full every night, with audiences eager to hear the songs that became popular in America. I met Jamie, an 11-year-old actor in the show. He said, ‘It’s amazing that I get paid to play, especially with a beautiful and expensive Gibson guitar.’ He shared how busy the young actors are. ‘We have regular school lessons every day at the theatre. The teacher is great, but I miss my old school friends.’ I asked him what his classmates thought of the show. He replied, ‘My whole class came! The theatre offers special ticket deals for schools. They loved it, which made me feel really confident. My parents come when they can, but it’s expensive for them.’

When I mentioned that I also play guitar, Jamie found a spare one and invited me to join him and the other young actors. We played a song called Days, which I didn’t know. Jamie helped me learn it, and I felt proud when I finally got it right. I was impressed by Jamie’s talent and wished I had similar skills. I was just trying to keep up and was relieved that the show’s director wasn’t there to hear my mistakes! Although the young actors were already musicians, some playing multiple instruments, none had played in a band before. Luckily, they found it quite easy. Jamie admitted that the challenging part was looking natural when they first performed together. They were so focused that they forgot to smile! The show will be in London for another year, and it is definitely worth seeing.'"
