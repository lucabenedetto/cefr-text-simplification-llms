1,C2,"Some time ago, a website talked about the dangers of public check-ins. This means telling everyone where you are online. The website said that when you say, ""Hey, I’m at this place,"" you are also showing your location to many people, not all of whom you might want to see. This shows that sharing everything online can have bad sides. 
The internet gives us many chances to share our lives with many people. We can share our stories, photos, and feelings. But sometimes, we can get lost in this sharing. It can feel overwhelming. 
In the early days of the internet, some people, called bloggers, explored these dangers. They shared their lives online and faced many problems. They lost jobs and friends, and they learned about the risks of being famous online. One of these early bloggers was Justin Hall. In January 1994, he started sharing his life on the web. At that time, the internet was mostly for students and scientists. Hall wanted to share his personal stories. 
In 1996, he began writing a daily blog. Many people read it because he was open about everything in his life. But one day, his homepage disappeared and was replaced by a sad video called Dark Night. He had fallen in love, but when he wrote about it, his partner said he had to choose between the blog and the relationship. Hall felt that sharing his life online made people not trust him. 
In 2002, another blogger named Heather Armstrong wrote about her job on her blog called Dooce. One day, a coworker sent her blog link to the bosses at her company, and she lost her job. This shows that what we say online can have real-life consequences. 
Armstrong’s story had a happy ending. After some time, she got married and started blogging again, focusing on her family. Now, she is a well-known ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing helps support her family. 
What we can learn from these stories is that while the internet lets us say anything, we should think carefully before we share."
2,C2,"A while ago, some scientists started to warn people about a low-budget film called What the Bleep Do We Know? This film mixes documentary and drama to show that there is a lot we do not understand about our universe. Scientists can be a bit proud, but even the most confident ones do not say they know everything about the universe. Some scientists felt they needed to warn people about the film, calling it “atrocious” and “very dangerous.” This made me curious to see the movie.
At first, I did not understand why the film was so important. Some scientists talked about new discoveries that show the universe is stranger than we thought. But when the film talked about these discoveries, I started to see why it was interesting. One claim was that water molecules can be changed by our thoughts. I had heard before that a Japanese researcher showed how the shape of water molecules could change based on people’s thoughts. The movie showed pictures of ice crystals that looked beautiful when someone was happy and ugly when someone was in a bad mood. Many people find this kind of evidence convincing, but scientists often say, “Give me a break.” 
The idea that water can be affected by thoughts is amazing, but we need good proof that it is true. Pretty pictures of crystals are not enough. The movie’s claims were not strange enough. For example, scientists say that water molecules have energy that comes from nowhere and is linked to a force that is making the universe expand. This evidence comes from many years of research in labs and observatories around the world.
There are real discoveries that show the universe is stranger than we thought. Astronomers found that the universe is made of an unknown type of matter and is pushed by a mysterious force called “dark energy.” Other discoveries are also surprising. Neuroscientists found that our brains take about half a second to understand what is happening around us. Anthropologists believe they have found where modern humans began and how they spread around the world. Some scientists think there are connections between life on Earth and the design of the universe.
Science is not finished. In fact, we are learning that many natural events are more complicated than we thought. New ideas about chaos and uncertainty show that there are limits to what we can know. Some of the best physicists are trying to create a “Theory of Everything” that explains all the forces and particles in the universe with one equation. Many of us believe that the universe can be described in one word: incredible."
3,C2,"Writing novels is hard for me, but writing short stories is fun. Writing a novel is like planting a big forest, while writing a short story is like planting a small garden. Both are important to me. The trees in the forest give shade, and the wind makes the leaves move. In the garden, flowers bloom and attract bees and butterflies, showing the change of seasons.
Since I started writing, I have often switched between novels and short stories. After I finish a novel, I want to write short stories. After I finish some short stories, I want to write a novel. I never write short stories while writing a novel, and I never write a novel while working on short stories. They use different parts of my brain, and it takes time to change from one to the other.
I began my writing career with two short novels in 1975. From 1984 to 1985, I started writing short stories. I didn’t know much about writing short stories then, so it was hard, but it was a great experience. I felt my imagination grow, and readers liked this new side of me. One of my first short stories, “Breaking Waves,” was in my first collection called Tales from Abroad. This was how I started writing short stories.
One great thing about short stories is that they don’t take long to finish. Usually, it takes me about a week to write a short story, but I can change it many times. Writing a novel takes a year or two, and it can feel very long. Sometimes, I wonder if I will finish. So, writing short stories is a nice change for me. 
Another good thing about short stories is that you can create a story from small ideas, like a thought or an image. It feels like jazz music, where the story goes where it wants. Also, with short stories, you don’t have to worry about failing. If an idea doesn’t work, you can just move on. Even famous writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver didn’t write perfect stories every time. This makes me feel better. I can learn from my mistakes and use that in my next story.
When I write novels, I try to learn from what works and what doesn’t in my short stories. Short stories help me experiment with ideas. It is harder to try new things in a novel, so without short stories, writing novels would be even more difficult for me. My short stories are like soft shadows I have left in the world. I remember where I wrote each one and how I felt. Short stories show my feelings, and I am happy to share them with my readers."
4,C2,"Science is a way to understand the world. It can help us find cures for diseases and make our lives easier. However, it can also create problems. Science tries to explain everything, from tiny atoms to the vast universe. It has influenced many people, including poets and politicians. Sometimes, people do not understand science well, and its importance can be seen in different ways.
Science is always changing. New ideas can replace old ones, and this can cause arguments among scientists. This book will talk about important ideas in science and how they have changed our thinking. We will look at the beauty of these ideas and also remember that science has limits. 
Throughout history, scientists have made many discoveries. For example, in the 1600s, Isaac Newton explained how the universe works better than earlier thinkers like Aristotle. Later, Albert Einstein built on Newton's ideas. Science can make mistakes, but it keeps moving forward. 
In the late 1800s, many scientists thought there was not much left to discover. But then, new ideas like radioactivity and quantum mechanics changed everything. Today, some people believe we are close to finding a complete explanation of the universe.
Science is important for everyone. It affects our lives and the future of our planet. We cannot ignore scientific progress because it will shape the world our children will live in. Understanding science is necessary for making good choices about our future."
5,C2,"From around 2015, many big book publishers noticed that sales of ebooks were not growing anymore. In some cases, sales even went down. This made people question if ebooks would be important in the future. One publishing executive said that the excitement about ebooks might have led to bad investments, and his company lost trust in printed books. 
Even though it seems that ebooks and printed books can exist together, people still ask if ebooks will replace printed books. This question is interesting and makes people talk a lot. Why do we think of ebooks and printed books as being in competition? The answers to these questions tell us more about how we feel about new technology and change.
In my research, I found that people often think one type of media will replace another when new technology comes out. For example, when television was invented, many people thought radio would disappear. But radio found new ways to be used, like in cars and factories. The idea that books might disappear is not new either. In 1894, some people thought that phonographs would replace books with audiobooks.
Many times, people have said that new things like movies, radio, and smartphones would end printed books. Some believed this would hurt culture, while others thought ebooks would be much better. The idea that books might disappear often comes up when new technology is introduced. This shows our mixed feelings about change.
We form strong emotional connections with different types of media, like books and computers. Studies show that we can even name our cars or get upset when our laptops don’t work. When new technology, like e-readers, comes out, it changes our relationship with things we love. As technology changes, we often miss what we used to have.
This is why people still enjoy older products and technologies. For example, when the printing press was invented in the 15th century, people wanted to find original manuscripts. When movies changed from silent to sound in the 1920s, people felt nostalgic for silent films. The same thing happened when photography changed from film to digital and from vinyl records to CDs. 
E-readers have made people appreciate the feel and smell of printed books more. This should make those who worry about printed books disappearing feel better. However, the idea of books disappearing will continue to be a popular story about how technology changes our lives and how we feel about that change. 
We often use familiar stories, like those about loss, to understand change. The story of books disappearing is easy to remember and share. It reflects our excitement for the future and our fear of losing things we love, including parts of ourselves."
6,C2,"
For a year and a half, I woke up every weekday at 5:30 in the morning. I brushed my teeth, made coffee, and wrote about how great thinkers from the last four hundred years did their best work. I wanted to show how they found time each day to be creative and productive. By writing about their daily lives – when they slept, ate, worked, and worried – I hoped to give a new view of their personalities and careers. 
A French writer, Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, once said, “Tell me what you eat, and I shall tell you what you are.” I say, “Tell me what time you eat, and if you take a nap afterward.” This book is not deep; it is about how creative people work, not what they create. But it is also personal. The writer John Cheever said that you show something about yourself even when you write a business letter. 
I have questions that I think about in my own life: How can you do meaningful creative work and also earn money? Is it better to focus on one project or to work a little each day? When there is not enough time, do you have to give up things like sleep or a clean house, or can you learn to do more in less time? I do not have all the answers, but I have examples of how many successful people faced similar challenges. 
The title of the book is Daily Rituals, but I really wrote about people’s routines. A routine can seem boring, but it can also help you use your time, willpower, and optimism better. A good routine helps you focus and keeps your mood steady. The psychologist William James said that having good habits can help us focus on more interesting things. Ironically, he was a procrastinator and could not keep a regular schedule.
This book started because of my own procrastination. One Sunday, I was at my job at a small architecture magazine, trying to write a story due the next day. Instead of working, I was cleaning my desk and making coffee. I am a morning person and can focus well in the morning, but I struggle in the afternoon. To feel better about this, I started looking online for information about other writers’ schedules. I found many interesting stories and thought someone should collect them. That is how I started the Daily Routines blog and later this book.
The blog was simple; I shared people’s routines from biographies and articles. For the book, I gathered more information and made it better researched. I let the people I wrote about share their own words from letters and interviews. In some cases, I summarized their routines from other sources. I want to thank the many biographers, journalists, and scholars whose work helped me. I have listed all my sources in the Notes section for further reading."
7,C1,"Howard wanted to be a palaeontologist when he was six years old. This happened after his father said they could not go on holiday to Spain because of money problems. Instead, they went to a beach in England. One day, Howard found an ammonite, which is a type of fossil, on the beach. He had always wanted to study fossils and, by the end of university, he knew he wanted to study the very old ones, not dinosaurs.
After finishing his studies, Howard worried about finding a job. He felt good about his skills, but he knew that sometimes good people do not get good jobs. When a job opened at Tavistock College in London, he applied, but he did not expect much.
On the day of his interview, the professor who was supposed to help with the interview had a fight with his wife. He was upset and crashed his car, so he could not come to the interview. Another professor, who did not like the first one, took his place. This professor helped Howard get the job, even though Howard did not know him well. Howard was happy to get the job, but later he learned that it was not just because of his skills.
Howard was glad to have the job and to do the work he loved. He often thought about how his work life was organized, while his personal life was sometimes chaotic. One day, someone stole his briefcase with his lecture notes while he was at a train station. He was very angry and went back to the college. He called to explain and postponed his lecture. 
After reporting the theft, he went for coffee and met a colleague who was with a visitor from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. Howard learned about a new collection of fossils that needed to be studied. This could be a great opportunity for him. Because of the theft, he changed his plans. He decided not to go to a conference in Stockholm or take students to Scotland. Instead, he would find a way to visit the museum in Nairobi."
8,C1,"Charles Spence eats many different foods. He even has ice cream made from bee larvae at home. It may look strange, but it tastes a little like nuts and flowers. Spence is a Professor of Experimental Psychology at Oxford University in the UK. He studies how our senses work together to help us taste food. He wants to make eating bugs more acceptable. 
Spence's research affects what we eat and drink. He works with big food companies and famous restaurants. He studies many things that can change how we taste food, like who we eat with, how food is presented, and even the noise around us. His book, The Perfect Meal, has interesting facts about food. For example, the first person to order in a restaurant usually enjoys their meal the most. Also, we eat more food when we are with other people.
Spence's lab in Oxford is simple. He uses basic tools and old equipment. This helps him work with chefs who do not have much money for research. Many of his projects are funded by a big food company. In the past, some people thought research funded by companies was not real science. But now, it is important for universities to show that their work matters to people.
Spence helps food companies reduce salt and sugar in their products. This is good for customers because it helps them stay healthy. Many companies make these changes slowly so that customers do not notice. Spence found that when people know about these changes, they may not like the food as much.
Spence met famous chef Heston Blumenthal while working on a project. They worked together to create a dish called ""Sound of the Sea."" Spence studies how sounds can change the taste of food. For example, high music can make food taste sweeter, while low music can make it taste bitter. Soon, an airline will match music with the food they serve.
Spence has fun at home too. He has had dinner parties where they eat rabbit with fur on the cutlery and play with colorful lights. He even had a party with different drinks and headphones to see how sounds change the taste. For Spence, home and food events are just like his lab."
9,C1,"Our brains are very busy today. We get a lot of information, some of it true and some not. We have to figure out what is important and what we can ignore. In the past, travel agents helped us book flights, and salespeople helped us find things in stores. Now, we do most of these things ourselves. We are trying to do many tasks at once while also managing our lives, families, jobs, hobbies, and favorite TV shows. Our smartphones help us with this, but they also make us feel like we need to do everything quickly.
However, thinking we can do many things at once is a big mistake. Earl Miller, a scientist at MIT, says our brains are not good at multitasking. When we try to do many things at the same time, we are really just switching quickly from one task to another. This can make us less efficient. Multitasking can also increase stress in our bodies, making it hard to think clearly.
Our brains can easily get distracted by new things. This means that the part of our brain we need to focus is often pulled away by other things. Just having the chance to multitask can hurt our ability to think well. Glenn Wilson, a psychology professor, found that trying to focus on a task while seeing an unread email can lower our IQ by almost 10 points. This is worse than being tired.
Russ Poldrack, another scientist, found that if students do homework while watching TV, they remember the information in the wrong way. Without distractions, they can remember it better. Multitasking also means we have to make many small decisions, like whether to answer a text or not. Making many small decisions can tire our brains and lead to bad choices about important things.
Many people, including business leaders and scientists, say that email is a big problem. It is not that email is bad, but the huge amount of messages we get is overwhelming. A 10-year-old boy once said his father, a neuroscientist, just answers emails. His father agreed that this is often true. We feel we must reply to emails, but it is hard to do that and get other things done."
10,C1,"In a zoo in Sweden, a chimpanzee named Santino broke concrete at night to throw at visitors during the day. Was he being mean? In caves in the US, female bats help other fruit bat mothers if they cannot give birth properly. Are they being kind? Fifty years ago, people did not think much about these questions. Animals acted in certain ways, and scientists studied those actions. They did not believe that animals had feelings or thoughts like humans. But now, this idea is changing. Research on bats, chimps, rats, dolphins, and chickens shows that animals have emotions. This new understanding is starting to appear in popular science books, like Mark Bekoff’s ""Wild Justice"" and Victoria Braithwaite’s ""Do Fish Feel Pain?"". 
This change has started a big question: do animals have consciousness? This leads to another question about conscience, which is a person’s sense of right and wrong. In a recent study with cows, those that opened a locked gate for food seemed happier than those that had help. If cows enjoy solving problems, what does this mean for how we raise and eat cows? While people agree on what they see, they do not agree on what it means. Dr. Jonathan Balcombe, who wrote ""Second Nature,"" believes we should stop eating meat. He thinks we are close to a big change in how we think about ethics, like when slavery ended. Aubrey Manning, a professor, believes we should rethink how we see animal thinking. He says animals might have a simpler way of thinking than humans. Professor Euan MacPhail thinks we should not put human feelings on animals. 
These experts may never agree because the main issue is not just science or morals, but philosophy. It is hard to define consciousness, so can we really know what it is like to be a bat? Balcombe talks about an important study he did that suggests starlings, a type of bird, can feel sad. In a study at Newcastle University, starlings were kept in two different types of cages. One group had big, nice cages, and the other had small, empty cages. At first, both groups learned to eat tasty worms from one box and avoid bad worms from another. But when only bad worms were offered, only the starlings in nice cages would eat. Balcombe thinks that being in a bad cage made the starlings feel negative about life. 
Balcombe, who supports animal rights, believes that in the future, people will look back and feel bad about how we treated animals, just like we feel bad about racism. He says we cannot support animal rights while eating meat. If he were the only one with this view, it might be easy to ignore him. But Professor Aubrey Manning agrees with him. Manning has written a book about animal behavior. He says we are changing our views again. In the past, some people thought animals thought like us, but now we are starting to think differently. However, this is a complicated topic, and it is important to listen carefully to different opinions."
11,C1,"Critical thinking is a way to understand better what we read or hear. Adrian West, a research director, says that arguing can help us find the truth. Technology helps us store and process information, but it can also change how we think about complex problems. West points out that we see a lot of poor thinking and opinions that can confuse us. More information does not always mean better knowledge or decisions. 
According to the National Endowment for the Arts, fewer people are reading books, and this is happening faster now. Patricia Greenfield, a psychology professor, believes that focusing more on visual media, like videos, can hurt our critical thinking. People are multitasking and not focusing on one thing. 
We do not yet know exactly how technology affects critical thinking. Technology has changed how we think, and it can be both good and bad. For example, some video games can help us think critically, while reading online can improve our analysis skills, but clicking on many links can make it hard to think deeply. 
Greenfield says that reading helps our imagination and critical thinking, while visual media like video games and TV do not. However, she also found that visual media can help with some types of information processing. Unfortunately, most visual media do not give us time to think or reflect. This can lead to many young people not reaching their full potential.
How society views technology affects how we think critically. James Paul Gee, a professor, says that video games are often seen as bad for kids, but they can actually be good for learning. Some games, like Sim City and Civilization, teach decision-making and analytical skills in a fun way. These games allow players to explore ideas that they might not be able to in real life. 
In our digital age, as reading and math scores go down, we need to understand better how technology affects our thinking and analysis."
12,C1,"Matthew Crawford is a motorcycle mechanic. He chose this job because he was unhappy with working in an office and social policy jobs. His first book talked about the good things about manual work. His latest book is about how to deal with modern life. He got the idea for this book while shopping. He saw ads on the credit card machine while he was entering his pin number. Crawford realized that it is hard to avoid these ads that take our attention. 
He believes that what we think about is personal, but we often cannot choose this because of things we do not notice. It is getting harder to think or remember conversations. People try to avoid being interrupted, so they stop talking to strangers. Crawford says we see the world through things like video games and apps, which can control our desires. 
Many people feel overwhelmed by emails at work and still check emails in their free time. Studies show that just seeing a phone can make it hard to focus. We have worried about this since the telegraph was invented in 1837. We are more aware of other things we could be doing. Crawford thinks technology makes us more self-focused. 
With so many choices, it is hard to control ourselves, which affects our social lives. People prefer to text friends instead of talking to them. By only interacting with screens, we might lose important connections with others. For example, in his gym, people used to listen to one music player together, which created a social atmosphere. Now, everyone listens to their own music with earbuds, and the gym feels less social.
Crawford has two ideas to help. First, we need to reduce noise and distractions in public places. Second, he believes we should practice skills that help us connect with the real world. He mentions cooks, ice-hockey players, and motorcycle racers as examples of people who deal with real things. They use their judgment and work with others around them. 
Crawford says that when we engage with the real world, we see that fake experiences are not as good. This does not mean everyone should become a chef, but it is important to use our judgment. There are many benefits to this, like feeling satisfied with our work. Constantly fighting distractions can be tiring and make it hard to focus on what is important. Focusing on one thing can help us pay attention to other things better."
13,C1,"
""What do you do for a living?"" This is a common question we ask to get to know someone. Most people answer this question with a few words about their job. But if you are a philosopher, like me, it can be a bit more complicated. Saying ""I am a philosopher"" can sound a bit showy. It feels better to say that I study or teach philosophy. Many people think philosophers know special truths, but that is not true. Philosophers are just like everyone else.
One reason people think this way is that philosophers often judge what others do and talk about thinking deeply. A famous Greek philosopher named Aristotle believed that thinking about life is very important. He thought it was the best way to live. Today, not all philosophers agree with him, but people still connect philosophy with deep thinking.
Another Greek philosopher, Socrates, said that ""the unexamined life is not worth living."" This means that just going along with what everyone else thinks is not enough. We need to think about our lives to make good choices. However, you do not need to read many difficult books or spend all your time thinking to examine your life. It just means paying attention to your daily experiences and making sure they are meaningful.
Philosophy should help us understand our lives better. But sometimes, academic philosophy feels far away from real life. This is partly because philosophers often write for other experts and not for everyone. Because of this, many people think philosophy is not relevant to them. 
I sometimes call myself an ""ethicist"" because I study ethics, which is about what is right and wrong. Recently, I feel this title does not fully describe my work. Ethics is often seen as related to rules and laws. But there is more to it. Ethics also looks at whether certain actions are fair or unfair in society. 
For example, we might discuss if downloading movies illegally is wrong (it is) and then talk about our ideas about responsibility and art. Philosophy helps us think more about the actions and beliefs that shape our lives. Sometimes we find out we already know the answers; other times, we realize our beliefs need more thought. By examining these ideas, we can all benefit."
14,C1,"
People who love food, like foodies and chefs, often think about how what we eat can make us happy. But, in the past, when philosophers talked about food, they usually used it to explain other ideas, like learning. Sometimes, discussions about food seem to be about food, but they are really about other topics.
One famous philosopher, Epicurus, believed in seeking pleasure and avoiding pain in many parts of life. Today, his name is often connected to enjoying food and drink. Many restaurants and food shops use his name because they think it will attract customers. Food is not just about eating; it is also about sharing with others and our culture. The food we eat comes from history and is shared with people in our communities. These communities help us grow and share food.
Food is special because we interact with it more than with other things. After food is cooked, critics write and talk about it. Some people wonder why food critics are important. One philosopher said that tasting food is not a special skill; critics are just better at describing what food tastes like. Most studies about our senses focus on sight, but taste should also be studied more.
Another interesting part of food is its beauty. We often say paintings or music are beautiful, but we don’t usually say that about food. Some philosophers think that, because of modern cooking, food should be considered beautiful like art. However, food is eaten and gone, while art stays. So, it is not right to think of food as art.
There are also many important questions about food. For example, what should we eat? Should we choose organic, free-range, or vegetarian foods? Our choices show our beliefs. Philosophers like to ask why we make these choices, and this is a good topic for discussion.
Cooking at home is different from cooking in restaurants. Home cooks have a special duty to their friends and family. When we cook at home, everyone shares food and time together. But restaurant cooks have to follow rules for their job, and they work with colleagues, not friends.
A recent essay called ""Diplomacy of the Dish"" talks about how food can help people from different cultures connect. We can learn to enjoy other people's food and build friendships by eating together. The essay includes many interesting stories that make this idea about food philosophy come alive for everyone."
15,C1,"Rob Daviau is a game designer from the US. He creates special board games called ‘legacy’ games. When he was a child, he played traditional board games, but he thought they were not fun or challenging anymore. He wanted to make board games better. He asked himself if board games could have stories and if choices made in one game could affect the next game. 
He took a classic game called Risk and made a new version called Risk Legacy. In this game, choices made by players during the game have lasting effects. Players might have to tear up cards, change the game board, or open new packets with different rules. The game is played over several sessions, and players can remember past actions. Daviau said, “You could point to the board and say: ‘Right here! You did this!’”
Later, he worked on a legacy version of another popular game called Pandemic, where players work together to cure diseases. His next game was SeaFall. Pandemic Legacy was very popular, but SeaFall was seen as a big test because it was a new game, not based on an old one. In SeaFall, players are sailors exploring a new world in the 16th to 19th centuries. 
Designers of legacy games must think about all the choices players can make to keep the story interesting. They use play-testers to see how the game works. Jaime Barriga was a play-tester for SeaFall. He said it takes a lot of time to test the game. Sometimes the game works well at first, but later it can have problems, and they need to fix it.
At first, Daviau did not think legacy games would be very popular. He thought only a few people would like them. But many players, like Russell Chapman, really enjoyed the idea. He said it was a big improvement in game design. “It’s a new level of commitment and excitement,” he said. Another fan, Ben Hogg, said that even though players might worry about changing the game, they loved the adventure. He compared it to watching a new movie instead of the same one again.
Legacy games are inspired by video games and popular TV shows. Daviau wanted to be a TV writer when he was in college, but he ended up in advertising and then game design. He still loves telling stories. Matt Leacock, the creator of Pandemic, said making a legacy game is like writing a book. You need to know how it starts and how it will end, but you also need to plan the details.
Daviau is happy with his work but is curious to see how others will use the idea. He thinks players will soon want something new. Colby Dauch, who works for the company that published SeaFall, believes the legacy format has changed how people think about board games."
16,C1,"One night not long ago, an octopus named Inky escaped from his tank at New Zealand’s National Aquarium. He crawled across the floor and squeezed into a small drain that led to the Pacific Ocean. This story was exciting and many people shared it online. 
People enjoy stories like this because they like to think that animals are like us. Octopuses are very smart and can do many amazing things. They can open jars, recognize faces, use coconut shells for protection, and even play games. 
Dr. Frans de Waal studies animals like gorillas and chimpanzees. He believes that we often do not see how smart animals really are. He says that animals can think about the past and future, feel empathy, and understand what others want. This means animals are smarter than we usually think.
In the past, people believed that animals were smart. In medieval Europe, animals could even be put on trial for crimes. Charles Darwin, who changed how we see our place in the world, said that the difference between human and animal minds is not so big. 
In the twentieth century, many people thought animals were just machines that reacted to rewards and punishments. This idea made people forget that animals have feelings and thoughts. During this time, humans also harmed animal habitats and did not care for animals' well-being.
Now, Dr. de Waal thinks we are starting to understand that animals are intelligent in their own ways. He says that we are learning more about animal intelligence every day. For example, squirrels may not do well on human memory tests, but they can remember where they hide their nuts.
In her book, The Soul of an Octopus, naturalist Sy Montgomery says that if an octopus tested human intelligence, it might look at how well we can change the colors of our skin. If we could not do this, the octopus might think we are not very smart.
Dr. de Waal is not sure if Inky really knew how to escape to the ocean. But he understands that stories like Inky’s help people appreciate how smart animals can be. He once did an experiment with capuchin monkeys to see if they could feel envy. When some monkeys got cucumbers and others got grapes, the ones with cucumbers got very upset. This study was published in a scientific journal, but a video of the experiment made people really believe the findings. 
This shows how interesting and complex animal minds can be."

Robots are becoming very important in our world. They are not just in stories anymore; they are changing how we work. For many years, robots have helped in factories and making cars. Now, experts say that robots will be used in many more areas soon, but many people are not ready for this change.
Many people think that robots will do most of the work that humans do in the next 50 years. However, most of them also believe that their jobs will stay the same. This is not true. Robots will affect all kinds of jobs in the next few years. For example, an Australian company called Fastbrick Robotics has made a robot named Hadrian X. This robot can lay 1,000 bricks in one hour. It would take two human workers a whole day to do the same job.
Another example is a robot called Tally, made by a company in San Francisco. Tally walks around supermarkets to check if the shelves are full and the prices are correct. It does not clean the aisles, as some might think.
Some people say that robots cannot fix or program themselves yet. This means there will be new jobs for people who can work with robots. But others worry that we need to keep the human touch in our jobs. Dr. Jing Bing Zhang, an expert in robotics, studies how robots will change work in the future. He says that in two years, many robots will be smarter and able to work with each other and with humans.
In three years, many big companies will have a special person in charge of robots. In five years, salaries in the robotics field will go up a lot, but there will still be many jobs that cannot be filled because there are not enough skilled workers.
Dr. Zhang believes that people with lower skills will be affected the most by robots. He says they need to learn new skills instead of waiting for the government to protect their jobs. 
New technologies will create new types of robots that we have never seen before. These robots will live with us in our homes and interact with us. This is a big chance for companies, but it also brings challenges, like making sure we are safe and our privacy is protected.
With many jobs at risk, it is important to focus on education. Countries need more graduates in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) to stay competitive in the future."
18,C1,"George Mallory, a famous mountaineer, once answered a reporter's question about why he wanted to climb Mount Everest by saying, ""Because it’s there."" This answer shows that many people wonder why someone would take such a dangerous risk. Some climbers might feel inspired by this answer to follow their dreams. Climbing can be about adventure and having fun.
In 1967, a Bolivian writer named Tejada-Flores wrote an important essay called ""Games that Climbers Play."" He talked about seven different climbing activities, from playing on small rocks to climbing high mountains. Each activity has its own rules, and the way climbers choose to climb depends on these rules. This idea has become popular in climbing discussions in the West, appearing in magazines and conversations.
Many climbers love climbing because it makes them feel free. However, climbing can also be very limiting. For example, being stuck in a tent during a storm is not what most people think of as freedom. This shows a contradiction in climbing. But some people believe that having fewer choices can make life simpler and give a different kind of freedom.
When asked, ""Why climb?"" US rock climber Joe Fitschen suggests asking, ""Why do people climb?"" He believes climbing is part of being human. We like to take on challenges and test our limits, even if it is risky. The joy of climbing is connected to our nature.
Another important idea comes from US academic Brian Treanor. He says that climbing can help us develop good qualities like courage, humility, and respect for nature. While not all climbers show these qualities, Treanor thinks they are important in today’s world.
Some believe that climbers who do not depend on others or technology must be very dedicated to succeed. Expert climbers Ebert and Robinson stirred some debate by saying that climbing alone is harder and deserves more recognition than climbing with a team or using tools like bottled oxygen. However, this idea might encourage some climbers to take unnecessary risks.
Climbing can also be understood outside of Western ideas. Many climbers talk about being in the moment or going with the flow. The physical effort, focus, and problem-solving in climbing are similar to techniques in Zen philosophy, which helps people find peace. This gives us another reason to think about why people are attracted to climbing."
19,B2,"Alfred Brendel was a famous pianist for over sixty years. He was known for playing important European piano music. He wrote and played a lot, but he did not teach many students. People who knew him saw that he could be playful, but he was usually serious in his concerts. He spent his time studying, traveling, and performing.
About four or five years ago, a young boy named Kit Armstrong came to one of Brendel’s concerts and asked him for lessons. At first, Brendel did not think much of it. He had very few students and did not want to start teaching now. He remembered a saying from another pianist: “You don’t ask a mountain guide to teach a child how to walk.” But when he heard Kit play, he was impressed. Kit was about 14 years old and played very well from memory. He even gave Brendel a CD of his performance, which was beautiful. Brendel thought, “I need to make time for him.” 
As Brendel steps back from performing, Kit is starting to become more known. Kit is now 19 years old and is always busy. He learns new languages, studies math, writes computer code, and plays tennis, all while his mother watches over him. He also composes music. Brendel believes that writing music helps Kit learn to read it better. He noticed that Kit has an amazing memory and can read music very well. Kit listens carefully to his own playing and understands Brendel’s instructions.
Brendel is careful not to raise expectations for Kit. He gets upset when newspapers call Kit the next great pianist of the 21st century. He thinks this can be harmful. Young musicians can play some things very well, but they still need time to improve in other areas. 
Now at 80 years old, Brendel is more relaxed in his life after performing. He says that when he was young, he did not want to be famous quickly. He wanted to achieve certain goals by the time he was 50. When he reached 50, he felt he had done most of those things but still wanted to do more. Even though he cannot play as much now, he still has many ideas in his mind and enjoys his new life."
20,B2,"When I was a child, I thought gardens were beautiful places. My grandad’s garden was by a river and sloped down to the water. You couldn’t touch the river, but you could hear the water and the birds in the trees. I thought all gardens were like this – peaceful and nice. 
Grandad’s garden was simple. He didn’t have a fancy greenhouse like some neighbors. Their greenhouses were made from old window frames with plastic covering broken glass. At home, my dad was quiet. He liked to say funny phrases, like “It’s immaterial to me,” instead of just saying “I don’t mind.” He didn’t finish school and became a plumber, which he didn’t love. He wasn’t very ambitious, but he was good at fixing things around the house. 
My parents only moved once in their life, but my mom liked to change the furniture a lot. Just when you got used to one chair, a new one would appear. The biggest change was when a piano came into the house. I wanted to like it, but it scared me. I liked the brass candlesticks on it, but my mom said they were too fancy and they disappeared while I was at school. I never got to play the piano, but my sister took lessons. When I asked my mom why I couldn’t play, she said, “You’d never have practiced.”
I loved the river more than the moors or woods. I could imagine a different world there. I would take a fishing net and wear old sandals with the front cut out for my toes. I walked along the riverbank looking for a good spot to take off my sandals and have a picnic. I tried to catch fish, but they didn’t survive in my backyard, so I put them back in the water.
I wanted to leave school quickly, but it seemed hard until one day my dad said, “There’s a job for an apprentice gardener in the Parks Department. I thought you might like it.” In that moment, he surprised me. He might have preferred if I became a carpenter, but I think he hoped I would do well in gardening. Even though he didn’t like gardening, I believe he saw my love for it and wanted me to succeed."
21,B2,"Lawrence MacEwen is on his Scottish island, the Isle of Muck. I am with him. A strong wind is blowing, and it feels like we might be blown off the cliff and into the ocean below. But Lawrence’s sheepdog, Tie, comes close, and Lawrence pets him gently. The wind is loud, but Lawrence is happy on his island.
Lawrence shows me around. He points to the north and shouts, “That island is Eigg. The one next to it is the Isle of Rum. It gets more rain than we do.” I see dark clouds raining on Rum’s big mountains. “Beyond Rum is the island of Soay.” 
Suddenly, Lawrence says, “I have sheep to move.” We walk down the hill. He tells me about the island: Muck is three kilometers long and one and a half kilometers wide. The geese here eat a lot of grass. The MacEwen family has lived on this island for 3000 years. 
While herding the sheep, Tie is not doing a good job. Lawrence says, “Away to me, Tie,” which means the dog should go to the right. But Tie goes straight through the sheep, causing confusion. Lawrence sounds disappointed. “That will never do.” Tie looks sorry.
The Isle of Muck is mostly run by the MacEwen family. Lawrence and his wife, Jenny, run the farm. Their son Colin takes care of the island cottages, and their daughter Mary runs the island hotel, Port Mor, with her husband, Toby. Mary and Toby like that their two boys can play outside and sail boats in the summer. “They go out and come back when they are hungry,” Mary says.
But life on the island has some problems. For example, electricity is not always available. On my first night, I wait for the lights to turn on. The next morning, I see Mary making breakfast with a flashlight. I also have no mobile phone service. Mary tells me, “You can get a signal on the hill, but most people just put their phones away after a couple of days.” So I do the same.
Life on Muck is surprising. A boat brings groceries and three musicians today. They come off the boat with their instruments. Their concert in the tearoom is very popular, and the islanders enjoy the music.
That night, while it rains outside, Lawrence tells me how he met Jenny. “Her father bought a small farm on the Isle of Soay without even seeing it. He had never been to Scotland. Jenny went to manage it.” I ask if Jenny knew how to run a farm. “She had good typing skills,” Lawrence replies.
I go to bed with the sound of rain and wake up to more rain. But I eat well because most of the food comes from the island. Mary sends me to fisherman Sandy Mathers for fresh fish. I carry it back to Mary’s kitchen. By 7 pm, our fish is on the table, and it is very delicious.
The next morning, I worry about my ferry ride to the next island. Many ferries have been canceled because of high waves. If my ferry does not come, I will be stuck on Muck for two more days. Part of me secretly hopes that happens, phone or no phone."

The game design industry used to be mostly for computer scientists and self-taught people. Many thought video games were just a hobby for young people. But now, the video game industry is taken seriously. It is not easy to get into this field. Making video games based on new movies needs many team members and a lot of skill and hard work. 
Jim Donelly, who works for an online games magazine, says it is hard to get a job in big companies. But the industry needs game designers now more than ever. They need not just the top people who manage the whole game, but also those who design parts of the game. 
So, how can you start a career in this competitive industry? Many companies want people with a degree in computer science, but Jim thinks differently. He says, ""The best way is to make games. You need to show what you can do. If you don’t make anything, you won’t get a job."" Game design is not just a job; it is a way of life. 
Another expert, John Field, agrees but adds that it is more complicated. Many people want to work in games, but few have the skills needed today. It is important to have creativity, technical skills, and the ability to think of new ideas. 
Can you work alone? John says, ""Maybe, but it is hard."" A good course in game design can help you learn and get support. Most game designers start as programmers or artists and then move up in their careers. They love all kinds of entertainment and are interested in art and culture. They may have worked for a few years after school but know that games are what they want to do. 
Connections are also important. To succeed in games, like in many jobs, you need to meet people. 
The idea that only young boys play video games is changing. Now, many adults play games too. Families often play together on game consoles. Smartphones also have many new games through apps and social media. John believes there is a lot of room for growth in this area. ""Games are popular with many people. They are also a fun way to learn, and I see many new opportunities in this field."""
23,B2,"Since I was a child, I have always wanted to play football. My dad encouraged me to play, and I am thankful for that. I had a friend whose dad was very strict. He always said, ""You can’t do this, you can’t do that."" My friend could have been a good player, but he stopped wanting to play football. I am happy that I still love the game. 
When I score a great goal from far away, some people say it is just luck, but it is not. I have practiced shooting from a distance since I was young. You need to practice to score amazing goals. The best players in the world have natural talent, but they also practice a lot. 
Sometimes, I see young players bumping into each other, but I learned the right way to play. When I teach kids, I always tell them to enjoy learning new skills. At school, I played many sports like rounders, baseball, athletics, and basketball. I know now that a good education is important, but back then, I only thought about football. The teachers were good, but I didn’t notice it at the time. I want my son to have a different experience. We are already trying to read him books, even though he is too young to sit still. I hope he does not just want to kick the books around like I did.
At the start of my professional football career, the manager helped younger players like me to play for the first team. He never made a big deal about it, but we all knew we had to do our best. I scored in my first game, but we lost. A famous TV presenter said, ""You can’t win anything with kids."" This made us realize we had to work hard. We had some doubts, but we believed in ourselves as a team.
I depend a lot on my close friends and family. Having money can sometimes cause problems. People ask me why my mother still works. I help my parents with money. I paid off their house loan and bought them a car for Christmas. My family is strong, and they do not want to just take money from me. My mom loves her job as a hairdresser, even if she does not earn much. I enjoy using my money to help my family.
I have money, but not as much as people think. Money does not solve all my problems. After I stop playing football, I want to take a year off to do things I have not done for a long time. I want to go skiing the day after I stop playing. I cannot do that now because if I break a leg while skiing, I would not be able to play football again, and I would not be insured."
24,B2,"It was because of Sam Carter that we lived at Reef Point. Sam was my father’s agent in Los Angeles. He helped us find a cheap place to live because my father could not write anything while we were in Los Angeles. Sam was worried about losing his clients and money.
During the summer, the beach was empty because the sun was often covered by sea fog. Reef Point did not have many visitors. The road to get there was not nice, and a better place called La Carmella was nearby. Most people went there instead. Only those who had no money or loved surfing came to Reef Point. But now, with the hot weather, many people were at the beach. After being alone for months, we were now surrounded by people and activities.
My father was busy every day trying to write a script. He was very stressed. I often went to the beach with a book and my dog, Rusty. When we first moved to Reef Point, we did not have a dog, but Rusty came to us. I tried to send him away, but he always came back. One morning, I felt sorry for him and gave him some water. My father threw a boot at him, but he did not really want to hurt him. Rusty knew this and came closer. I asked my father, “Who does he belong to?” My father said, “You are wrong, Jane. He thinks we belong to him.”
Rusty loved the beach. He liked to dig and bring things to me. Sometimes he found things that were not his, like a new sneaker or a beach towel. I had to give those back to their owners. Rusty also liked to swim and always wanted to swim with me, even though I could swim faster. He never got tired of it.
That day, we had been swimming. My father went to Los Angeles to deliver his script. Rusty and I played in the sea all afternoon. As the sun began to set, it got cooler, and we watched the surfers. They had been surfing all day and did not seem to get tired. One surfer caught my eye. She was very good and made the others look clumsy. When she finished, she came over to us.
“Hi,” she said. “Why didn’t you join us?” 
“I don’t have a surfboard.”
“You could get one.”
“I have no money.”
“You’re British, right? Are you visiting?”
“No, I live here.”
“Is your father American?”
“No. He came here to write a film script from a novel he wrote.”
“Really? What’s his name?”
“Rufus Marsh.”
“Do you mean, Tall as the Morning?” 
I nodded. 
“I read that book!” She looked at me with interest. I thought this was how it always was. People were friendly but only showed interest when I mentioned Tall as the Morning."
25,B2,"Violet Hetherington was confused. She stood in a long line at the dock in Southampton, waiting to board the Queen Caroline. The line was very long, and no one was moving. Her friend Annie had told her, “It’s better to arrive late. If you come too early, you will just wait.” Annie was married to a diplomat and traveled a lot, so she knew what she was talking about. But this time, Annie was wrong.
After some time, an announcement came over the loudspeakers. They said there was a problem with the computer system. The people waiting became unhappy. Some tried to be patient, and a few even tried to be cheerful, but most were angry. They had paid a lot of money for this trip, and they wanted to enjoy it. Violet felt like leaving. 
She checked her bag for her phone but could not find it. This made her more upset than the long wait. She thought that maybe taking a cruise was a bad idea. Now, without her phone, she could not call the taxi company to see if she left it in the taxi. All her important numbers were in her phone. Her son Harry always told her to be careful about this.
In line behind her, there was a nice couple. Violet asked them, “I’m sorry, but I think I left my phone behind. Can I use yours to make a call?” She called Harry and left a message. She asked him to ask their neighbor, Kristina, to check if her phone was at home. If it was not there, she would be in trouble because she needed her phone to find numbers in New York. Part of her felt relieved, but she did not tell Harry that. Harry thought he was wiser than his mother. Daniel, her younger son, was more understanding of her mistakes, but he might forget to give the message to Kristina.
Finally, the line started to move. Violet went to a window, gave her travel documents, and got ready to board the ship. When she entered the ship, she felt disappointed. The inside looked like a fancy hotel that was not very nice. There were shiny fake wood panels, big chandeliers, and carpets that looked like those in airports.
Violet followed the signs to the elevators. The elevators were full of tired passengers who did not want to see their reflections in the mirrors. She was squeezed against the wall as the elevator went up, stopping at each floor to let people out. Finally, on the twelfth floor, she stepped out and felt free. 
She was happy to see that her room had the balcony she wanted. She had worried about what to say if it did not. Ignoring Annie’s advice to wait for a better deal, she had decided to pay more money to make sure she had a nice view of the sea."
26,B2,"When John Maloof bought a box of old photo negatives at an auction, he did not know he was starting to discover the mystery of Vivian Maier. Maloof wanted pictures for a book about Portage Park, a neighborhood in Chicago, USA. Instead, he found 30,000 photos taken by Maier, a street photographer who had a special talent for taking interesting pictures. Since then, Maloof has collected many things about Maier’s life and work. In his home attic, he keeps her cameras, 2,000 rolls of film, 3,000 prints, and 100,000 negatives, along with many 8mm movies and audiotapes.
One morning, Maloof looked around at all the items. He felt he was close to something amazing, and it happened by chance. “When I bought this, I had no idea what it was,” Maloof said. “I could have easily sold it all to someone else.” For a while, Maloof and his friend Anthony Rydzon have been learning about Maier’s life. They talked to families who hired her as a nanny and to people at the shop where she developed her film.
Maier was born in 1926 in New York and spent much of her childhood in France. In 1951, she returned to New York and in 1956 moved to Chicago to work as a nanny. Maier was a private person and always carried a camera. She wore big coats, wide-brimmed hats, and sturdy shoes. “On her day off, she would have her camera around her neck and we wouldn’t see her until late at night,” said Maren Baylaender, whose husband hired Maier to care for his daughter. “She was private but had strong opinions about movies and politics.”
Maier knew a lot about theater and movies. Even though she was not very social, she walked the streets with her camera and talked to people, some of whom she interviewed on audiotape. She seemed to be very dedicated to her “second job” of documenting the world around her. “She was a true artist and followed her dreams,” said Rydzon. “She didn’t let anything stop her.”
Maier’s work is pure art; she did not create it for money. Her photos often show women, children, the elderly, the poor, and abstract scenes. “What is interesting about Vivian is that she has many fascinating pictures,” said photography expert Larry Silverman. He sees influences from other photographers in her work and wonders if she developed her own style. “Was Vivian very skilled, or did she take ideas from others?” Maloof often thinks about whether he will ever go through all the negatives, which he keeps in three tall, fireproof cabinets. 
The funny thing is that he was not really interested in photography until he found Maier’s work. Inspired by her photos, Maloof started taking his own pictures. “As I learned more about photography and looked at her work again, I realized that the people and street scenes were what mattered to her,” he said. “There was much more to her work than I thought, and I realized I had something very important. Now our goal is to share her name and get Vivian Maier into the history books.”"
27,B2,"When a book is called ambitious, it often means it did not succeed as expected. But this is not true for Eleanor Catton’s book, The Luminaries. I spoke with her in the UK when her book was very popular. She was calm, even though she was still in her twenties. She had just come from Germany and was going back to New Zealand the next day. 
Eleanor told me a story about being stopped at passport control. The officer asked her to prove she was a writer. She showed her book to the officer, who then asked, “What is it about?” This is not an easy question for a writer. 
The Luminaries takes place in New Zealand during the 1860s. There are many crimes, and twelve men come together to solve them. The story is very complex. Eleanor wanted to write a murder mystery, not a historical book, but she found that the past gave her many ideas for her characters. The book is over 800 pages long because she wanted to give each of the 20 main characters a good story.
When I asked her how it feels to be so successful at a young age, she said it feels nice to come from a small country. She feels that everyone at home shares in her success. She also mentioned that it can be annoying when people think her book is not serious.
Eleanor wanted to write the book in a spiral shape. Each part is half the length of the part before it, making the story speed up. I asked if it matters if readers notice this. She said she wanted to create patterns in the book that readers could see if they wanted to, but it was not necessary.
Even with its unique structure, The Luminaries is still an exciting murder mystery. Surprisingly, Eleanor did not know how the story would end when she started writing. She would write herself into difficult situations and then find creative ways to get out of them. She also wanted to make the book fun for readers.
We talked about her love for TV dramas, which have cliff-hangers and different points of view. I asked if she would like to write for TV. She said that could be interesting. 
Eleanor is very passionate when she talks about her writing and New Zealand. She notices how her ideas change when she is in different places. She understands why writers leave New Zealand for bigger cities with more people. But for now, New Zealand will still be her home. I hope it gives her the inspiration for many more novels."
28,B2,"Jonny Kinkead is a man who loves guitars. When he was a boy, he liked to make things in his dad’s garage and play the guitar. For the last forty years, he has built acoustic guitars by hand. Jonny is amazed that two pieces of wood can make beautiful music. He learned to play his brother’s guitar when he was eleven years old. At sixteen, he wanted to learn the bass guitar. Instead of saving money for one, he decided to make it himself. He studied how different shapes and types of wood change the sound of the guitar.
Before making the bass guitar, Jonny and his brothers built model boats and planes. Their father taught them how to use tools. Jonny also fixed guitars for his friends. His first bass guitar turned out well, but he did not think about making guitars as a job at that time. He was also interested in painting and sculpture. After finishing school, he went to university to study architecture because he liked design. But halfway through, he left because he wanted to do something different. He realized that making guitars is like making art, but it is also useful because people can play them.
For ten years, Jonny made guitars and cleaned windows to earn extra money. At first, he sold his guitars for the cost of materials. As he became known as a good guitar maker, he could charge more money. Even now, after almost forty years, he says he is still just getting by. He can only make about ten guitars a year, which limits his income. In the beginning, he worked hard to get people to know him. He went to music festivals and let musicians try his guitars.
Jonny thinks it is easier for new guitar makers today. When he started, many people believed that only guitars made in the USA were good. But now, UK-made guitars are respected. He believes that new guitar makers should take classes to learn important skills. However, he also thinks that learning by trying and making mistakes is very important. Jonny says it is good to look at other instruments and see what works and what doesn’t. If you make the back of the guitar too thin or too thick, it will not sound good. He believes that if you learn from someone else, you may only learn one way, but if you teach yourself, you can learn many things."

When people talk about English conversation, they often start with the weather. A famous writer from the 1700s, Dr. Johnson, said, “When two Englishmen meet, their first talk is of the weather.” This is still true today. Many people try to explain why the English talk about the weather so much, but they often get it wrong. They think that English people talk about the weather because they really care about it. 
For example, the American writer Bill Bryson says that English weather is not very interesting. He points out that in England, there are no big storms like tornadoes or blizzards. However, the English broadcaster Jeremy Paxman disagrees. He believes that English weather is interesting because it is always changing. He says that even if the weather is not extreme, it is still important to talk about because it is never the same.
I think both Bryson and Paxman miss the real reason why English people talk about the weather. Our conversations about the weather are not really about the weather. They are a way for English people to start talking to each other. For example, when someone says, “Nice day, isn’t it?” or “Ooh, isn’t it cold?” they are not really asking about the weather. These phrases are just ways to greet someone or to keep a conversation going.
There are specific times when people use weather talk. Some people say that English people talk about the weather all the time, but that is not true. There are three main situations for weather talk: as a greeting, to start a conversation, or to fill a pause when there is silence. This is why it seems like English people talk about the weather a lot. A conversation might start with a weather greeting, then move to other topics, and go back to the weather when there is a pause. This is why many people think that English people are obsessed with the weather."
30,B2,"Alice Leader was standing in front of Hadrian’s Wall in Britain. She was trying to explain to her class of 12- and 13-year-olds how amazing it was that the Romans built something 120 km long and 5 meters high about 1900 years ago. The students were interested in this trip instead of going to Spain, Greece, or France. But they wanted to know why the wall was built, and Alice felt her answers were not good enough. 
Alice could not find a good historical novel about life at the Wall during Roman times, so she decided to write one herself. After teaching for 31 years, she started a new career as a writer in 2001. She felt nervous but excited about this big change. Alice said, “Teaching is like acting. It is very demanding. Writing is exciting, but it is not so tiring. My old teaching friends are jealous because I still connect with children through my stories.”
Alice wants her books to fill a gap in children’s fiction. She noticed that many books for teenagers talk about negative experiences or are total fantasy, like Harry Potter. Her books are different. Alice always taught English and History together, using stories like the Tale of Troy to make lessons interesting. She loves to see when a child goes from being bored to being interested. “I enjoy having bored children because it is a challenge for me to make them interested,” she said.
Alice started writing her first novel because she saw a need for it. She was also inspired by her head teacher, who suggested she take a creative writing course. At first, Alice did not want to spend her summer on a course. But she had to send a story to the tutors before she could join. She quickly wrote a story about a Roman couple and their baby. After three hours and 30 pages, she sent it in and got accepted.
During the course, other students read her story and gave her good feedback. They encouraged her to publish it. With only her report cards as proof of her writing skills, she asked her head teacher for a year off to write her first novel. Alice’s husband, Zachary Leader, helped her by editing her work. She said, “My mother-in-law thinks we are rival authors, but I believe we help each other. He changes the sentences and suggests better words, while I like to add more scenes.”"
31,B2,"To raise money for charity, a newspaper and a TV company asked brothers Jonny and Alistair Brownlee, who are champion triathletes, to join a special race. This race would have Jonny in a car and Alistair on a mountain bike. They would race in the beautiful and hilly Yorkshire Dales in northern England. 
Jonny was excited. He said, “I’ve never done anything like this before! These roads have beautiful views, and it’s very cold, so I can stay warm in the car.” Alistair was also eager, but he wore warm cycling clothes. He joked, “I’ve seen Jonny drive before, so I’m not sure he will make it. I might stop for a cup of tea!”
The race started at Semerwater lake and would finish at Fleet Moss, which is the highest road in Yorkshire, about 350 meters up. Jonny had an easy drive, but Alistair had to climb a steep hill right away. They quickly shook hands and then started the race. Alistair rode fast on his bike, while Jonny got in his car and drove off. 
Just 15 seconds into the drive, Jonny faced a problem. A big tractor was in the road. He complained to the cameraman, “If Alistair beats me, it’s all because of this farmer!” After getting past the tractor, Jonny continued driving. Meanwhile, Alistair was having a hard time. He had to get off his bike and carry it up the hill, while sheep watched him. 
Finally, Alistair reached the top of the hill. The sun came out, and he started to ride faster. In the car, Jonny had to deal with narrow roads in the villages. He drove slowly and even went through a small stream on the road. After leaving the last village, he raced straight to the finish line. 
Neither brother knew how close they were to each other. Jonny drove fast to Fleet Moss, while Alistair rode quickly across his last field and back to the road. He pushed hard and then stopped suddenly at the finish line. He looked up and asked the crowd, “Is he here?” When they said no, he raised his arms and shouted, “Yes!”
A few minutes later, Jonny arrived in his car. He got out and said, “Well done,” but he looked disappointed. “I’m gutted.”"

When you play on Centre Court at Wimbledon, it is very quiet. You bounce the ball on the soft grass; you toss it up to serve; you hit it and hear the sound of your shot. The quietness helps me focus on the game. I try to forget everything else and just think about the match. When a point ends, the silence breaks with applause and cheers. I hear the crowd, but it feels far away. I do not think about the fifteen thousand people watching me. I am focused on playing Roger Federer in the 2008 Wimbledon final, which is the biggest match of my life.
I always wanted to play at Wimbledon. My uncle Toni, who is my coach, told me it is the most important tournament. When I was 14, I dreamed of playing there and winning. Before 2008, I played Federer twice and lost both times. In 2006, I was happy just to be there, even though I lost. But in 2007, I was very sad because I knew I could have played better. I cried for half an hour after that match. Losing hurts, especially when you have a chance to win.
Toni usually does not comfort me, but after my loss in 2007, he told me not to cry and that I would have more chances to play at Wimbledon. I felt like it was my last chance to win. I know that a professional athlete's career is short, and I want to make the most of it. I let an important moment slip away in 2007. 
But Toni was right. I had another chance in 2008, just one year later. I felt confident that I had learned from my past loss. The night before the final, I had dinner with my family and friends, but we did not talk about the match. I wanted to focus and prepare in my mind. From that moment until the match started, I wanted to keep my thoughts to myself."
33,B2,"In early April 1957, a young Englishwoman named Jane Goodall arrived in Africa. In her first letter home, she wrote, ""I am living in the Africa I have always wanted."" She spent most of her life in Africa and became known as a citizen, journalist, scientist, activist, and environmentalist. 
In 1963, Jane became famous when Britain’s National Geographical Society made articles and TV shows about her research on chimpanzees. She also wrote popular books, including children's books and the bestseller ""In the Shadow of Man,"" which has been translated into 47 languages and is still available today. Jane Goodall is one of the most famous female scientists of the 20th century. 
Many stories have been told about her life, but they often focus on her adventures and not her real achievements. Jane Goodall should be recognized for her important work in understanding chimpanzees. She showed us that chimpanzees have emotions like humans and live in social groups similar to ours. Before her research, people did not know that chimpanzees ate meat or used tools. 
Her book, ""The Chimpanzees of Gombe,"" published in 1986, is a key work in chimpanzee research. Jane Goodall studied wild chimpanzees in Gombe State, Nigeria, for many years. Her work changed how we study animals and how we think about ourselves as humans. 
Even as a child, Jane showed signs of becoming a biologist. When she was five years old, she disappeared one day. Her family and the police searched for her. After a long search, she came back with straw in her hair and clothes. When her mother asked where she had been, Jane explained that she wanted to know how hens lay eggs. To find out, she hid in a henhouse for five hours until she saw a hen lay an egg. This curious nature was the start of her journey as a scientist."
34,B2,"Shirley Ford is a voice actor. In our first talk, she shows me many funny voices. She can sound like a cheeky 8-year-old boy, a tired mother, an old Scottish woman, and even a fast-talking alien. People who watch children’s TV and cartoons know her voices well. Shirley tells me she just did a voiceover about back injuries and had to learn many medical words quickly.
Shirley explains that doing voiceovers is not just about funny voices. You need to make the script exciting for people who cannot see you. Many famous actors want to do voiceovers, but they often do not get the jobs because they are used to acting with their whole bodies.
After school, Shirley took a drama course. She wanted to be a regular actor. Sometimes, she sang jingles for TV ads. One day, the man at the recording studio asked her to try out for a rabbit in a cartoon. She thought it was silly but tried it for fun and got the part! This made her realize she could do voices well and that voiceover work could be her path.
In her second film, she played the main character and also her brother and mother. Many adult women voice small boys and girls because their voices are higher. It is complicated to hire child actors, so companies often prefer adult women.
Shirley learned to make different sounds and collects new voices by watching children’s TV. She enjoys working on cartoons the most, but she also does educational videos and ads. Sometimes, it is hard to sound excited about things she does not care about, but she learned to smile while talking to make her voice sound happy.
The competition for voiceover work is tough, and having a good showreel, which shows what you can do, is very important. Shirley says it is worth making a strong showreel and that there are agencies to help with this. She believes she has succeeded because she works hard and does not give up.
For people who want to be voice actors, Shirley suggests going to special workshops that teach about voiceovers. She loves voices and often becomes the characters she plays. Sometimes, after doing a specific voice, she talks like that for hours or even days. Her children are used to her speaking in different voices."
35,B2,"People often ask me how I became a cartoonist. This is normal because many kids dream of being cartoonists, just like they dream of being race car drivers. But most people stop dreaming and choose more practical jobs, like being a tax lawyer or making car parts. It seems silly to think you can make a living by drawing simple pictures, but some people do it.
Not everyone becomes a cartoonist in the same way, but most have wanted to be one for a long time. I had a typical childhood for a cartoonist. I loved comic strips, drew for school papers, and was known as ""the kid who draws."" I studied graphic design in college. After I graduated, I showed my drawings to different companies. I was lucky to find a newspaper that wanted political cartoons about local issues. I created some ideas, and they bought them. Soon, I was making enough money to live on.
You don’t need much to be a cartoonist. You don’t need a university degree, a lot of money, or even great drawing skills. You just need your brain, your hand, and something to draw with. But if it were that easy, there would be many more cartoonists than teachers. Being a cartoonist is not easy. It’s better to choose a regular job that pays well and gives you time for family and hobbies.
The more skills you have, the better chance you have to make a living with your art. I have done political cartoons, comic strips, and comic books. I have also written, made caricatures, and done some design work. I take any job because you can learn a lot, even from work you don’t like. It helps to be smart, read a lot, and be curious about the world.
What about the business side of being a cartoonist? In the past, many cartoonists could find regular jobs with different newspapers and magazines. But now, most cartoonists have to sell their own work. The better you are at selling, the more successful you will be. I have seen cartoonists who are not very creative but are good at business do much better than those who are very talented but don’t know how to sell their work.
Many people worry about someone stealing their ideas, but they have never sold a cartoon. Some are so scared that they won’t even let others see their work! To protect your work, you just need to draw a small ‘c’ for ‘copyright,’ put a circle around it, and write your name and the date next to it. But honestly, it’s more likely that no one will care about your work. If someone does take your cartoon and it becomes popular online, it’s not a disaster – it could be a lucky break!"
36,B2,"Twenty years ago, I was moving to a new house and cleaning out my things. I decided to throw away an electric guitar that my dad had given me for my 16th birthday. It was a nice black guitar from Japan. I usually don’t like to throw things away, so I was surprised that I wanted to get rid of it. I took it to the dump and was about to put it in the trash when a young man came up to me. He looked confused and asked, “You’re not going to throw that away, are you?” I told him I was, and I started to feel sad. He asked if he could have it, and I said “Yes.” After that, I felt very sad about giving it away.
A few months ago, I opened an email that changed everything. I remembered a story about a man who lost his wedding ring in the ocean. Ten years later, he found it in a fish he was eating. That’s how I felt when I read an email from a man named Keith Rushton, who fixes and sells guitars. He told me, “I have your electric guitar.” It had been sold many times since I gave it away. Keith found my name on a label on the guitar and looked for me online. He contacted me through the newspaper I work for and wanted to sell it back to me. I was so happy I almost cried. He asked for a fair price, and I was ready to pay anything for it.
I remembered how my dad liked to put name labels on everything I owned, even my guitar. My parents wanted me to learn classical guitar because it was popular in the 1970s. I loved the sound of it; it was calm and gentle. But I didn’t get better at it, so I switched to electric guitar, which was easier. At that time, punk music was popular, and anyone could be a rock star, even if they didn’t play well.
When I opened the box with my old guitar, I remembered my birthday in 1978 when my parents gave it to me. The guitar felt smooth and smaller than I remembered. I sat down to play, but then I stood up and put the strap over my shoulder because that’s how you play electric guitar. My fingers remembered where to go. I couldn’t draw the chords, but my hands knew what to do. My fingers felt a little pain from pressing the strings.
The electric guitar is not usually played alone. Now that I am learning it again, I think I should start a band. My son is learning the saxophone, so maybe we can play together. Or maybe I can find other people my age who feel like I do. We could call ourselves “The Regainers!”"
37,B2,"
There has been a lot of talk about sleep recently. I wrote a book called Insomniac about people who cannot sleep well. I wanted to warn people about the dangers of not getting enough sleep. Lack of sleep can affect our minds, bodies, and feelings. People who have trouble sleeping know how important sleep is. It is good that people are now paying more attention to sleep. 
But what about dreams? I have not heard much about dreams in this conversation. We often lose our dreams. When you wake up early because of an alarm, you miss the last hour or two of sleep. This lost sleep is mostly REM sleep, which is when we dream the most. Our best and most memorable dreams happen in REM sleep just before we wake up. A good sleeper spends about a quarter of their sleep time in REM. If a person lives for 90 years, they will spend six or seven years dreaming in REM.
When researchers take away REM sleep from people, they find that the next night, people have more REM sleep. This shows that dreams are important. In 1953, researchers found REM sleep, and many agreed with psychologist Sigmund Freud, who said that understanding dreams helps us understand our minds. However, later studies showed that this was not so simple. Now, researchers focus more on the physical reasons for dreams rather than the psychological ones. 
Currently, there is not much agreement among dream researchers, according to Robert Stickgold from Harvard University. Dreams are important. At a meeting of sleep experts, P.F. Pagel from the University of Colorado found that actors, writers, and directors remember and use their dreams better than others. He believes that creative people use their dreams more. This makes sense because films are very dream-like.
But I wonder, do only creative people need their dreams? Don’t teachers, software designers, and politicians also need to think creatively? Stickgold says that dreams help us connect ideas in new and surprising ways. They help us find new patterns and think differently. For example, when people are woken from REM sleep and asked to think of something related to a word, their ideas are more original than when they wake from other sleep stages. They think outside the box and make surprising connections. This is what creativity is.
I find that I write better after having intense dreams. Even a bad dream can help me think better. On those days, ideas come to me quickly, and I can hardly keep up with my typing. I don’t know how it works, but it does help. Creativity is not just for writers or artists. We all live in a complex world. We need our brains to work well. We need to think creatively in our relationships with colleagues, family, and friends. This is why dreaming is important."
38,B2,"Twenty years ago, Susie Ray left London to live in a small town by the sea in south-west England. When you enter her studio, you see many empty frames on the walls and pictures of her two daughters. Susie is a talented artist who copies famous paintings. She can make copies of beautiful paintings from the early 20th century and the 16th century. It is strange that she does not keep any of her own work. “I don’t have any of my own around,” Susie says. “As soon as I finish them, they go.” 
Many people want her work. In her 30 years as a copyist, she has painted many famous artists like Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh. Her copies are so good that experts sometimes think they are the real paintings. The real paintings can sell for millions of pounds, but her copies sell for a few hundred pounds to £12,000, depending on how long she works on them. Susie does not tell who her clients are, but they include art galleries and private collectors. Some collectors want to show off their art, and one famous buyer likes to say he has a ‘Van Gogh’ painting, but it is really a ‘Susie Ray Van Gogh’. 
Susie is honest about her work. When she copies a famous painting, she tries to make it look as real as possible. She believes that doing a bad job would be unfair to the original artist. However, she puts her name on the back of the canvas. It is illegal to sell a copy as the real painting, and even though some people make money that way, Susie does not want to take that risk. She knows that people who make fake art often get into trouble. 
Susie has not always been a copyist. After finishing her art degree, she worked as an illustrator for a botanical garden. She did not earn much money, but it helped her learn important skills. She had to be very careful and get things right the first time. She is happy she found a job that pays better now. 
When young artists ask Susie for advice, she tells them to learn to draw well and to be accurate. She has studied a lot to do her work. She can draw plants and make copies of old paintings, but she now focuses on French impressionists like Manet, Cezanne, and Degas. 
Some people think modern art is easy, but Susie believes that impressionists worked hard and paid attention to detail. It is not as simple as it seems. People wonder why Susie does not create her own art. She says her work comes from years of practice, and she makes a good living from it. She has tried to make her own art, like oil paintings of fishing nets, but they looked too much like photographs. 
Susie is a perfectionist, and she enjoys her work."
39,B2,"Ellen MacArthur loved the sea more than anything else when she was a racer. Since she was a child, she wanted to be the fastest on the water. She felt a strong connection with her boats, and when she was back on land, life felt boring. She wanted to be back at sea, challenging herself against nature, even in dangerous places.
After she finished second in a big solo race around the world, she showed me her small boat, Kingfisher. She lived in a tiny cabin for 94 days. She planned everything carefully, even how many rolls of kitchen paper she needed. She was proud of her simple food and her small gas stove. Her boat was very important to her, and she took good care of it because her life depended on it.
Now, Ellen sees the world like a boat: small and beautiful, but also fragile. She had a big change in her thinking when she visited South Georgia, a lonely island in the South Atlantic. There, she helped with a study of albatross birds. This experience made her think differently about the world. She saw many old whaling stations and felt it was a warning. She realized that people often take what they want and leave.
When I visited Ellen at her office, she was finishing a busy phone call. She told me why we need to act now to save the planet. She said that coal, oil, and gas are limited resources. We need to find ways to use less. At first, she focused on using less, but then she started to talk about re-using things, like special carpet tiles.
For three years, she has been visiting factories and talking to businesses and governments about our use of resources. She said, “I will never be an expert, but I love learning.” She felt that sailing was selfish compared to her new mission. She wants to find out how to use her voice to help. 
Ellen also started the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a charity that helps young people think about a sustainable future. She misses the adventure of being at sea because it is a big part of who she is. She felt connected to everything around her and focused on survival. Now, her message is more complex than just wanting to be the fastest. She believes this work is more important than anything she has done before."
40,B2,"Jordan Romero is 13 years old and wants to be the youngest person to climb Mount Everest. If he succeeds, he could become very famous. He hopes to inspire other kids to go outside and climb their own mountains. Jordan's climbing team includes his father, Paul, and his mother, Karen. They call themselves ""Team Romero."" Climbing Everest is just one of their goals. If Jordan climbs Everest and Vinson Massif in Antarctica, he will be the youngest person to climb the Seven Summits, which are the highest mountains on each continent. Very few people do this before they turn thirty. Jordan has already climbed five of these mountains and might finish before he is a teenager.
Many famous climbers think it is not a good idea to take a 13-year-old up Mount Everest. They believe that while Jordan may be strong, he might not be emotionally ready. They also think he may not have enough experience to make good decisions while climbing. Paul and Karen have heard these opinions before. Paul says, ""I know people criticize us, but we have a lot to do. We think about the risks, but we believe our experience will help. Watching Jordan grow gives me confidence.""
Paul also wants to make sure that Jordan really wants to do this. He says, ""This project is not about me becoming famous through my son. At first, Jordan thought he would do this later, but we decided, 'Why not now?' We talk to him often to see if he still wants to do it."" When asked what he enjoys about the challenge, Jordan says, ""I just focus on achieving my goal.""
In the past, not many people cared about being the youngest or fastest climber. Now, every adventure is shared online, and people want to see records broken. This creates a problem for Jordan. Some people think that trying to achieve records can take away the fun of climbing. But if Jordan wants to inspire others, he needs to share his journey online, take photos, and give interviews. He needs to do something amazing, like climbing Everest.
Paul adds, ""If Jordan comes home tomorrow and says he wants to stop climbing and play basketball instead, we will stop this project and go to the gym."""
41,B2,"When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, they are probably not listening to classical music. Most people can name many pop groups, but if you ask my friends about Brahms, they look confused. I just started studying music, but my classmates know as little about classical music as other teenagers. If you don’t know who wrote the music, you probably don’t have any of their recordings. This is sad for people who love classical music. Last year, only 3% of concert tickets sold were for classical music, and most classical recordings sell only 300 copies. This is hard to believe.
So, why are fewer people interested in classical music? Older people often blame our love for TV and video games, but I don’t think that is the reason. The truth is that classical music does not attract most people, especially teenagers, who buy the most music and concert tickets. I know some teenagers who go to classical concerts, but they are not many. Even though I play in an orchestra, I don’t really like classical music. I enjoy many types of music, but I listen to classical music very little.
Why don’t teenagers like classical music? First, classical music has many changes in mood and rhythm, which can be hard for us. We like fast talking, fast playing, and fast thinking. Experts say we can only pay attention for about three minutes, which is too short for most classical pieces but just right for pop songs. Pop music is simple and easy to listen to, while classical music needs more time and focus. Also, pop music talks about things that interest teenagers, while classical music often does not.
How we listen to music has changed too. In the past, families would play music together at home, and playing an instrument was important. Now, we can find any music we want online, but we rarely hear classical music in our daily lives. When was the last time you heard classical music in a store? One of my teachers says that more people are going to classical concerts now. Maybe, but I don’t think many of them are teenagers. In my orchestra, we play classical music in many places, but when I look at the audience, I mostly see older people. 
I don’t know why more middle-aged people like classical concerts, but I do know that if your parents love something, you might want to avoid it. Some people say schools are to blame for teenagers not liking classical music, but many kids want to play classical music in their school orchestras. They come early to practice and stay late to rehearse. They enjoy playing classical music, but it is not their favorite music to listen to. When we want to relax, we always choose pop music."
42,B2,"Bonnie Wyndham got out of her mother’s car and looked at Almonside School. “I’ll make you sorry I’ve come here,” she said with a smile. Her mother was getting out of the car too, so she didn’t hear Bonnie, but Bonnie didn’t mind. Her mother knew how she felt. 
Mrs. Wyndham looked around. Almonside was a strange school with many buildings hidden in the trees on a hill. It looked confusing at first. Then she saw signs: Science block, gym, riding center… “Riding center,” Bonnie said, suddenly interested. “Headmaster’s study,” her mother said. “This way.” Bonnie followed her mother along a wide path between the trees. 
“I wish you’d walk beside me instead of following me like a dog,” Mrs. Wyndham said tiredly, but she didn’t expect Bonnie to do it. A few minutes later, her mother was talking to Bonnie’s new headmaster in his study, while Bonnie waited outside the door. Suddenly, Bonnie stood up. “Why should I just sit here?” she thought. “I’ll be thrown out soon anyway, so why not go now?” She left the building and went to the riding center, following the sign. 
There was a nice old building for the horses and a big place for indoor riding. Bonnie looked around, but no one was there. She walked carefully to the horses, treating them with respect. The horses were well cared for. Almost every stall had a horse, and she looked at each one. “I know what you’re doing here,” she said to a small pony, gently touching its nose. 
Then she saw the next horse and stopped. “But aren’t you the best!” she said. He was brown with a little white. He looked lively, and Bonnie liked that. “I feel like we’ve met before,” she said, stroking his neck. His name was Maverick. She really wanted to ride him. “I wonder where I can find a bridle and a saddle,” she thought. 
Bonnie was happy to find that the room with the riding equipment was open. She forgot about her mother and the headmaster while she put a saddle on Maverick. When she sat on the big horse outside, she felt like a queen. At her old school, they called her Queen Bee, and she laughed as she remembered it. “You’re the best horse I’ve ever ridden, Maverick,” she said. “I know about horses, even if I don’t know about anything else.” 
She nudged him to walk, then to trot. “If I stay here, I think we could be great friends,” she said. She rode around the paddock, feeling the wind on her face. She could tell Maverick trusted her, and she felt sure he would jump well."
43,B2,"I have met Cody Simpson before, and I was impressed by his quiet confidence. Cody is a 15-year-old from Australia. He has already released many successful songs. How did this relaxed surfer become a star in front of many fans? 
Cody says, “I first picked up a guitar when I was six years old and started writing songs when I was seven.” He loved swimming and surfing more than anything else at that time. When he was 13 and in high school, he posted some videos online. These videos changed everything. He started with a video of him and a friend singing at a school concert. Fans wanted to see more of his videos on social media. So, Cody recorded more videos at home, and the fans loved them.
Cody was also a great swimmer. He trained hard with good coaches. But then, record labels wanted him to sign a deal. He had to choose: stay in Australia and keep swimming or take a big risk and move to the US with his family. Cody decided to take the chance. 
He said, “It was very difficult for me – especially at such a young age – to choose a career. Can you imagine being 12 or 13 years old and trying to decide what you want to do for the rest of your life?” He had to tell his swimming coach and friends that he was moving to America. Most people were surprised because he was a quiet kid. 
Cody packed his bags and moved with his family to another part of the world. He gave up one dream to try to make another dream come true. His family stays out of the spotlight but supports him. Cody believes it is important to have good people around you to stay grounded.
Sometimes, he feels doubt. He thinks about how his decision affects his little brother and sister. His brother is eight years old and travels the world, doing school on the road. Cody worries about how this affects him, but his family always supports him.
Cody believes that success comes from being ready to say ‘yes’ to big opportunities, even if it is scary. He says, “It all just happened so fast and unexpectedly. Now, I go to countries I never thought I would visit and play in front of many fans. It is like a dream for many people. But I know it won’t last forever.”"
44,B2,"I jumped out of bed, pulled back a corner of the curtain, and looked at the river. There was a new crack in the ice shining in the morning sun. I squinted and looked upstream at the sandbags. They were there to stop the buildings from flooding when the ice melted. My back still hurt from lifting the sandbags last week. I worked hard with many people in the town to help. But my grandfather did not notice my effort.
I looked at the dark water from the factory. There was ice on both sides, but the water was open in the middle. As I took off my pajamas and put on my kayaking wetsuit, I saw a boy on the other side of the river. I did not know him. He was trying to balance on the ice near the warm water from the factory. I zipped up my wetsuit and put on my kayaking jacket. I checked my pocket for my lucky silver chain. My famous grandfather gave it to me after his trip to South America. Only my grandfather, my mom, and I know about it. I also have his diary from that trip. I keep it under my pillow and read it before I sleep. I touched the chain and went to the kitchen.
“Good morning, Rex,” my mom said with a smile as I took a banana from the counter. “You’re up early for a Saturday. I will make brunch after your training. Be careful.” 
“Thanks, Mom.” I walked down the hall and almost bumped into my tall grandfather as he came out of his room. 
“Can’t you watch where you’re going?” he shouted. “Where are you going?” 
“Sorry, Grandpa. I’m going kayaking.” It was clear because I was wearing my wetsuit. He always saw me in my kayak every morning. Grandpa can be hard to deal with when he gets angry. 
“What’s the point of training? You didn’t win the competition,” he said. His words hurt, but I took a deep breath and counted to three. He went into the bathroom and slammed the door. My mom came over with a kind smile. 
“Don’t mind him. He’s…” 
“...not himself right now,” I finished for her. I wanted to say he was always like this, but I tried to be nice to him. When I was little, he was my hero. He showed me pictures of himself in National Geographic magazine. Those old pictures are still on his wall, with his medals and trophies. But I don’t go into his room anymore. I have my own trophies to look at, and maybe one day, my own picture in National Geographic. Still, I want to stay close to him, even if he is grumpy.
Mom smiled. “At least he is coming out of his room more. Have a good training session, Rex. I admire your determination to keep going, even in this cold weather!” 
I smiled back as I peeled my banana. “It will be warmer in South America if I find sponsors for my trip.” She laughed and went back to the kitchen. I finished my banana and went downstairs. I stepped into the backyard and hurried to the boathouse."
45,B2,"Mum grabbed Jess by the arm. ""Come with me,"" she said. Jess followed her to the study. On the table, there was a painting by Grandpa. It was not framed and looked different from his other work. It was not finished. 
""Do you know anything about this?"" Mum asked. Jess shook her head. ""I’ve never seen it before. I didn’t know he was working on anything."" Jess looked closely at the painting. It showed a river, but it was not a river she knew. It looked like a fantasy river. The painting was strange and beautiful in a spooky way. The riverbank was very small, with just a little green. The eye was drawn to the light water and a hidden sea. There were no animals, birds, or people in the painting, and it felt right that way. Jess thought about autumn coming after a long summer.
Mum spoke again. ""It has a name."" There was something in her voice that showed she was excited. Jess knew why. Grandpa never named his paintings. He just painted them and let others think about them. Mum turned the painting over and pointed to the words Grandpa had written. Jess read them: ""River Boy."" The words felt important to her, but she didn’t know why. 
Jess looked at Mum. ""There is no boy."" 
""Exactly. It’s strange for him to be so specific. But maybe he will add the boy later. I made the mistake of asking him about it."" 
""Mum! You should have known better."" 
""I know, but I couldn’t help it. It’s such an unusual painting, especially with a name. You can guess what he said."" 
Jess didn’t need to guess. She knew Grandpa would say, ""It’s not the artist's job to explain a painting. Each painting has its own life and language, like a poem. We either understand it or we don’t. Painting is hard work, and I can’t waste time explaining it to everyone."" 
Mum laughed. ""Something like that. Anyway, I was hoping you might know something about this painting since you seem to inspire him."" 
""Inspire?"" Jess asked. 
""Yes, someone who helps an artist."" Jess knew what it meant. Grandpa often said it when she watched him paint. He would say the muse was not helping him or that he needed to be nice to the muse. But he never said it was about her. She thought a muse was like a goddess, not a real person. It was hard to think anyone could inspire someone as strong-willed as Grandpa. 
""He doesn’t need me to inspire him,"" she said. ""He has been painting all his life."""
46,B2,"This morning, I woke up and accidentally cut a hole in my bedroom carpet. I didn’t mean to do it. I could have tripped over the bed with my dad’s knife in my hand, and the knife might have gone into the carpet. That could have happened, but I’m not saying it did. I just didn’t want to damage the carpet. I didn’t wake up thinking, “Today I will cut a hole in my carpet.” It seemed like a good idea at the time, but later I wondered why I thought that. This happens to me a lot. 
What I was really doing was trying to fit my corner cabinet into a corner. My grandma gave me this cabinet when she moved to a flat. It is very cute! It is small, painted white, and has pink and blue flowers on it. It has tiny glass doors. Grandma used to keep pretty things in it, like little figures. Now, I keep my shells and stones in there. I was very happy when she gave it to me!
The cabinet is a corner cabinet, so it has to go in a corner. My bedroom is small and shaped like a wedge of cheese. There are two corners in my room. The big bedroom is for my parents, my sister Angela has the back room, and my brother Tom has the little room over the garage. I have the smallest room, which is like a broom cupboard. 
Mum says when Angela goes to university, Tom can have her room, and I can have Tom’s room. But Angela is only fifteen, so I think I will be in my small room for a long time. I don’t mind; I like my little bedroom. It feels cozy, like a nest. The roof slopes down, and the window is low. 
The problem is, there are not many corners! My bed is in one corner, and my wardrobe is in the other. I tried to fit Grandma’s cabinet in the space between the roof and the floor, but it was too tall. I thought, if I can’t cut the cabinet, maybe I can cut a hole in the carpet. It seemed like a good idea. My dad always tells us to “think outside the box,” and that is what I was trying to do!"
47,B2,"The novel ""The Borrowers"" is about a family of tiny people who live secretly in the walls and floors of a house. They borrow things from normal-sized people to survive. When I was asked to make a TV show from the book, I knew it would be hard to meet people's expectations. Fans of the book have strong ideas about how it should be. I used the original drawings from the book a lot because I didn’t want people to say I did it wrong.
The author wanted the show to show things from the Borrowers' point of view, not from the humans'. This made filming more difficult. The most important thing was to get the size right. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans. So, when we filmed them walking across a room, we had to be ten times further away than usual. The crew had to crawl on the ground and film from no higher than 15 centimeters to show the Borrowers' view. They went through many pairs of jeans!
We only raised the cameras for special shots. One big challenge was to make the shadows look right when we combined the tiny Borrowers with the normal-sized background. We created a special way to do this. After the show aired, famous director George Lucas called me to ask how I did it.
We built only one set, which was the Borrowers' home under the floorboards. It was filled with giant objects to make the actors look small. It was very fun. I remember the coins we used; they were bigger than dinner plates and hard to lift. We often had to stop filming because the crew laughed so much. In the story, there is a scene where the Borrowers are swept down a drain. To film this, the actors had to go down a tunnel with hoses, and they said it was so scary that they didn’t need to act.
It was also important to me to get the costumes right. I had them made from heavy canvas so they looked like doll clothes. This made it hard for the main actress to move. She couldn’t sit down during breaks and had to be sewn into her dress every morning. The lead actor's trousers were made from a rug because normal fabric looked too smooth. Unfortunately, it was very hot while we filmed, and I don’t think they were happy with the costumes!
Most of the action away from the Borrowers' home was filmed with the actors in front of a blue screen. It was hard for them to react to things that weren’t really there. I had to draw pictures of every scene to show how they should look. I drew 2,000 pictures by the end. We didn’t have enough money to use special effects studios during the day, so I worked nights for three months. We had to work quickly. Once, I filmed a whole scene and then realized there was no film in the camera!
But in the end, everything came together, and I think the series was successful in showing the magic of the books."
48,B2,"Mom stops the car at the corner of my new school, Palm Grove High School. She looks around nervously, searching for reporters that are not there. I wonder how long it will take before the craziness starts. It always does. The fake smiles, the people who want to be my friends, and the ones who ask for free tickets to my dad’s concerts. “Everything will be fine,” I tell her. She kisses her fingertip and touches my cheek before I get out of the car. Then she drives away, leaving me alone at this new school. But this is what I wanted. I wanted to leave my old life of traveling and tutors. While the rest of the band is here for recording, we are staying for good. I wanted to come to this school because I want to meet real kids. Kids with normal parents, like a mom who works in an office or a dad who cuts grass. That would be so cool.
I walk into the school office. “Hi, I need my schedule, please,” I say to the secretary. “Name?” she asks, looking unfriendly. “Desert McGraw.” “Desirée?” she asks, leaning closer. “Desert,” I say again. The secretary looks confused. “Oh,” she says and types my last name on her computer. That’s good because not many people know my last name since my dad uses a stage name. “What grade?” she asks. “Eleventh.” “One second, it’s printing,” she says. Then she gives me the paper. My first class is English Literature. Great! I like English. But I will be late. English is in Room 214 on the second floor. I studied the map last night so I wouldn’t look silly looking for my class.
When I get to the door, I hear the teacher calling names. “Aurelio Gonzalez.” “Here.” I slip in quietly and sit at the last desk in the second row. The girl next to me smiles. She looks at my normal outfit – jeans and a T-shirt. “Nice shoes,” she whispers. I look down at my fancy shoes with flowers. Oh no, I shouldn’t have worn these. “Thanks,” I say. The teacher pauses. “Desert... McGraw?” she says. “Here.” The teacher smiles and introduces herself as Ms. Smigla. She talks a lot and gives us our course outlines. After we look at them, she lets us talk to each other! All teachers should do this.
“Why did you move here?” my new friend asks. I have a few choices. Do I say it’s because I wanted a normal life away from cameras and reporters? Or do I say what my dad thinks? “We need a change, Desert,” he said, “and this is the perfect place to record the new album.” I think he just wants to relax on the beach. Why else would they choose a studio so close to the sand? “My dad had to move,” I tell her. “What does he do?” she asks. I know everyone will find out soon, but I can pretend to be normal for a while. “He’s an artist,” I say, playing with my backpack zipper. “Cool. I’m Becca, by the way.” And she doesn’t seem to care much. Great!"
49,B2,"Not only is the average American teenage girl expected to be the president of the Student Council, but she also needs to have a part-time job, volunteer, and do well in school. This is what it means to be a teenager in America today. Boys and girls cannot just go to school and be average because being average is not enough anymore. People think that not trying hard is being lazy.
Teenager Kristen Loose says, “Adults often forget how much pressure we have. We have a lot of homework, tests, after-school activities, jobs, chores, and we also want to have a social life.” Even with all this stress, people still have negative ideas about teenagers. They think teenagers are lazy, disrespectful, loud, and only care about themselves. While some teenagers may act this way, it is not fair to say all teenagers are like this.
Kristen Loose believes that many people think teenagers only watch TV and use their phones all the time. She says this is not true. She keeps her phone close, but she uses it for important things, not just for fun. Teenagers use their phones to help with schoolwork and to stay connected. With smartphones and social media, students can do homework anywhere and anytime. They can even listen to language lessons while going to school.
Many teenagers wake up around 6 a.m. or 7 a.m. and often go to bed after midnight. They have a busy schedule with school, activities, family duties, and homework. They do not get enough sleep. The US National Sleep Foundation found that only about 20 percent of teenagers get the recommended nine hours of sleep each night. Also, 28 percent of teens said they fall asleep in school about once a week because they are tired.
Teenager Lindamarie Olsen thinks she only has about 18 hours of free time each week. With 168 hours in a week, 18 hours is not much. She does not waste her time on social media or TV. Instead, she spends her time volunteering. She says, “People think teenagers only care about themselves, but I love to help others. I want to make a positive difference in my school and community.”
In 20 years, the ideas about teenagers may change, but they will still be working hard and making the world better. There will always be new students who are doing great things before they finish school."
50,B2,"The Earth to Sky Calculus Club is a group of teenagers who live in Bishop, a small mountain town in the US. This town is surrounded by nature and is near the Sierra Nevada mountains. In the last few years, the club has sent over fifty balloons high into the sky, about 35 km above the Earth. This project is a mix of science and adventure, which is why many teenagers want to join.
One weekend in late spring, I joined them as they prepared to release a high-altitude balloon. They wanted to see shooting stars, which are bright lights in the sky caused by rocks or metal entering the Earth's atmosphere. As it got dark, the teenagers attached a soft lunch box to the bottom of the balloon. Inside the box were a camera, a tool to measure height, and a thermometer to check the temperature as the balloon went up. They also put two GPS trackers on the outside of the lunch box to help find it later. 
They used a gas tank, given by a friend from another state, to fill the balloon, which grew to the size of a small car. An older boy drove for seven hours to get the gas tank. He said, “I didn’t really mind.” For these kids, this is normal. 
Finally, it was time for the balloon to go up. They counted down, “Five, four, three, two, one,” and the balloon started to rise. Some of the teenagers ran after it with flashlights, trying to see it in the dark sky. There was a quiet moment of wonder as the balloon disappeared into the night.
After the launch, most students went home, but a few stayed to watch for shooting stars. They lay on blankets and looked at the clear sky, which was surprising because it was only four hours from busy Los Angeles. I saw a boy get into a sleeping bag and fall asleep. One girl whispered, “We’re the only ones talking.” Another girl replied, “I know.” Suddenly, a meteor flew across the sky.
As the balloon went higher, the air pressure changed, and the balloon got bigger until it popped with a loud bang. A parachute helped the lunch box land safely back on Earth. The students would find it the next day using the GPS trackers. Finding it was not easy, but that was part of the fun. There is not much land with people around Bishop, so the lunch box often lands in remote places.
The group’s leader said, “Recoveries are a big part of the program.” They had only lost two lunch boxes in 53 launches. He explained that this project helps them learn more about the area. This time, the lunch box landed 84 km west of Bishop. To get it, the team had to drive south and then back up the mountains. They had to decide if they should drive or walk, especially if the lunch box was on a high mountain or in a tall tree.
The leader said, “These students know the Eastern Sierra well. What seems wild to some is normal for others.” It took them 11 hours to find the lunch box. It was in a canyon, on a flat rock, near a waterfall. The camera did not catch any shooting stars, which was a little disappointing. But it gave them a chance to talk about science and share another adventure story."
51,B2,"Chloe Morgan did not like science, especially Palaeontology, until she was fifteen years old. It happened by chance. Her younger brother was very interested in dinosaurs, which she did not care about at all. One day, she helped him with a science project and found an article about new dinosaur discoveries. This surprised her and made her want to learn more.
Chloe remembers meeting her first professional palaeontologist, Matt Cornelius. He was young and already famous. At first, she was very nervous because she thought he might find her annoying. But he was friendly and listened to her, which made her feel better.
Chloe thinks that movies like Jurassic Park have made many people interested in dinosaurs. However, she believes that these films do not show palaeontologists correctly. They often show them as strange geniuses or silly people who cannot talk to others. Chloe says this is not true. 
Her job is very different. She spends time digging up dinosaur bones, working in labs, studying fossils, and writing scientific papers. Sometimes, she also talks to the public about science. She believes it is important to help young people understand science better. Talking about dinosaurs can make children excited about nature and science.
Chloe worked on a TV documentary called Walking with Dinosaurs. She helped make sure the dinosaurs were shown correctly. The show attracted many viewers because it showed dinosaurs that looked real and were different from those in movies like Jurassic Park.
Chloe thinks dinosaurs are still interesting because they make us curious. They remind us that there is still much to discover in the world. Palaeontology is like traveling back in time."
52,B2,"When you travel by car with your family, even if you are six years old, you know you are not “there yet.” You keep asking, “Are we there yet?” But when you arrive, it is not “there” anymore; it is “here.” So, if you think you are “there,” you should ask, “Are we here yet?” 
Parents really want to be “there” because they hear this question many times on long trips. Kids should be happy in the back seat. You can watch DVDs, listen to music, or do puzzles while looking at the beautiful views outside the window. 
In the front seat, your mom or dad is there to give you juice boxes and cookies, change the radio, and keep everything running smoothly. But sometimes, things can get crazy. For example, my younger brother, Tim, might put his foot on my side of the seat. I don’t like that, so I put my foot on his side. Soon, we are fighting, and our parents have to separate us while driving. They tell Tim to stay in his seat and keep his hands to himself. 
After a while, things calm down, and we can enjoy the views again. But then, I feel a breeze on my arm. The window is closed, so where is it coming from? Tim is next to me, breathing on me. He is not touching me, so he thinks it is okay. This makes me angry, and the fighting starts again. 
Over the years, Dad has found ways to deal with us. When we ask, “Are we there yet?” he sometimes says, “Yes, we’re here. Get out of the car.” But we are still on the highway! Then he says, “Oh, maybe we’re not there yet.” This makes us quiet for a bit. 
You know you are finally “there” when the adults get out of the car and walk away from us. So remember, if your mom and dad are still close enough to answer your question, the answer is: no, you are not there yet."
53,B2,"John and Zuzi Morgan have opened a café in Oxford, UK. In their café, people can enjoy coffee and cake while playing board games. They hope that customers will love the experience and come back again. Zuzi says they wanted to create a place where people can connect without using their phones and screens. 
The games played in their café are called ‘Eurogames’. These games have simple themes, like farming and building. The first Eurogame was The Settlers of Catan, made by a German designer named Klaus Teuber. In this game, players build settlements on an island and trade resources with each other. Everyone stays involved and has fun until the end of the game. 
Later, cooperative games were created, where all players work together to win or lose as a team. One popular cooperative game is Pandemic, made by Matt Leacock. In Pandemic, players work together to solve global problems. Leacock was inspired by a game called Lord of the Rings, which is based on a book. He remembers feeling scared and excited while playing it with friends. 
Leacock loved board games as a child, but he often felt disappointed when they did not meet his expectations. With help from his uncle, he tried to make better games using the pieces from the games they played. Pandemic became very successful and included a lot of storytelling, similar to video games. 
The rise of video games has helped board games become popular again. Many people now play games on their phones, making them more open to playing board games too. Ben Hogg, who works for a game company, says that video games and board games have learned from each other. 
At first, video games allowed people to play together in person, but then many games moved online. Some players wanted to play games with others who were physically present. In John and Zuzi's busy café, board games have become a way for people to connect in real life. This trend of enjoying games together is likely to continue."
54,B2,"Jamie Scott has written and produced many popular songs in the UK. His story shows that hard work and not giving up are very important in the music business, even if you start with many failures. He says his mother was a great singer and helped him learn to play the guitar. The only radio he listened to at home was a local station for older people, which influenced his music taste. He was 12 years old when he first heard a modern song. Around the same time, he had to choose between playing tennis and making music. He played tennis at a high level but preferred music. He spent his lunch breaks in the school music room learning songs on the piano.
At 17, he left school to become a performer. He formed a duo with a friend who was a good guitarist but did not want to perform. Jamie told his parents that he wanted to make music. His dad gave him 18 months to succeed; if he didn’t, he would need to find a job. After some close calls with record labels, he got signed to a music publisher at 19 because of one song. However, the record labels wanted him to be a solo artist, so he had to leave his friend.
Jamie found success as a songwriter instead of a performer. After a tough time with a record label in the UK, he asked to leave and joined another label to release a new album. He did not become famous right away. He felt he was often in the wrong place at the wrong time as an artist, but as a writer, he was in the right place. He believes he is one of the main writers that UK labels trust to help new artists. He sometimes tells artists that wanting to write popular songs is okay. He asks them if they want many people to listen to their music.
Jamie is honest about wanting to write big songs that reach number one. He does not act better than others; he knows he has a talent for writing hit songs. Instead of trying to please everyone, he focuses on his work. He says that when he goes into the studio, they need to aim to write the best music for the next year. It is not just about what is popular; they want to create great modern pop songs."
55,B2,"Tony Connor is a new kind of celebrity. He is very popular online, but many people, like me, do not know him because we do not watch videos of people doing tricks on bikes. He is a ""street trials cyclist."" This means he jumps from hard places like roofs or walls to land safely in other strange places. People film his stunts and put them online.
I met Tony one Saturday morning at a BMX park. The local kids all know him, and some older people come to say hello and call him ""an absolute legend."" After watching him, I agree with them. At first, I was unsure about him, but I was impressed by his bravery and creativity. Before each jump, he explains what he wants to do, and sometimes I think he might not make it. But when I tell him he did a great job, he seems a bit sad and does not react much.
Tony says he does not like being famous. He finds it hard to talk to fans. He understands it is important, but he prefers to focus on doing his stunts. This is funny because his fame comes from social media and the small cameras that help make his videos. He says, ""This technology helps people like me earn money."" Sometimes he feels like everyone is filming themselves or looking at screens, and he does not like that.
Tony makes a good living from his videos, which is different from the past when people did similar things just for fun. After many years of talking to top athletes, I learned that two things help a child become a great competitor: energy and the ability to handle disappointment. These are often more important than talent. In risky sports, it is very important to be mentally strong.
Even in the park, Tony fell a few times on what he thought were easy challenges. But he got back up and kept trying until he succeeded. Some people do not see him as a hero. They think he takes too many risks. Tony says, ""These people may care, but they do not understand. They probably have never tried riding a trials bike and do not know the sport. They do not see that I get advice from experts to stay safe.""
Tony is careful about the risks he takes. He explains, ""People are different. Some are not scared, and they should not do these sports. It is smart to know the dangers. I feel fear, but I find a way to get past it. I am not addicted to risk. I spend a lot of time planning and getting ready. Sometimes I ride around to prepare myself before trying a new jump. I know I must stay calm before I jump. If I focus completely, I will be fine."""
56,B1,"Television presenter Helen Skelton has done many dangerous challenges for charity. She has run a marathon in the desert and traveled down the Amazon river in a small boat. For her latest challenge, Helen walked on a high wire. This wire was 66 meters above the ground, between two tall towers of an empty power station. There was no safety net. She only had a belt around her waist that was attached to another wire above her. To help her stay balanced and not fall, she carried a long stick that weighed eight kilograms.
Helen took lessons from a high-wire expert. Even though she had some circus skills, she found out that walking on a high wire was very different. “The training was a shock,” said Helen. “I didn’t know I needed to be so strong. Every day started at 8 am with a run up a steep hill. Then I did an hour of exercises, and after that, I practiced on the wire for another hour. I also had to learn how to fall onto the wire so I could keep going if I slipped. Every time I fell, it hurt a lot. But I had to stay positive: if I got nervous and started shaking, the wire would shake too!”
On the day of the challenge, it was windy. Helen took deep breaths to control herself as she moved step by step along the wire. The 150-meter walk took 15 minutes. “That was the scariest thing I’ve done,” she said after finishing. “I’m glad it’s over!” But this experience did not stop Helen from planning her next charity project: to reach the South Pole by ski, kite, and bike."
57,B1,"In 2006, Jeff Somers started a trip around the world on a penny farthing. This is an old bicycle with one big wheel and one small wheel. Before this, he wrote a book about his travels in Canada using a 50-year-old car. He loved cars and worked on racing car engines. To save money, Jeff rode an old bicycle to work and also used it to go on holiday to Amsterdam. He said, “That trip opened my eyes. I decided to see the world by bike.”
Jeff did not want a normal bike. He wanted to build a special one. He thought a penny farthing was the craziest bike he could make, so he went to a museum to learn how they were made. After trying to start his trip in 2001 and 2003 but stopping because of a knee injury, he finally left in 2006. He traveled for three years and visited 23 countries on four continents. The best part of his trip was arriving in Tibet and seeing Mount Everest. 
He met other cyclists who could ride up mountains, but he was happy with his penny farthing. People were very surprised to see it as he traveled further from home. His worst moment was when he had to drink dirty water from a stream. He got very sick and stayed in a hostel for ten days without medicine. He had no money for a hospital or to go home. 
Even with these problems, Jeff now says, “If I could afford it, I would start traveling again tomorrow on my penny farthing.”"
58,B1,"I work at a university in the US. My team and I are learning about water birds, especially the American black duck. We just started using a special tool called a ‘night-vision scope’. This tool helps us see the ducks in the dark!
We are worried about black ducks because their numbers have dropped a lot. We don’t know if there is enough food for them on the east coast. We have a lot of information about what they do during the day, but we don’t know what they do at night. This is because we didn’t have the right equipment before. The new scope will give us clear pictures, even when there is no moon. This will help us learn more and make better choices to protect their home.
Our work is very hard. There are four of us, and we each work six hours a day. We have studied ducks in different places. Sometimes, I have to take a boat to reach some areas and write down what ducks I see. The weather can be difficult. Some nights are warm, but most of the time it is wet. It is very quiet, so I drink a lot of coffee to stay awake!
So far, we have only missed one day of work because the snow was too deep for our special vehicles. I like this challenge, especially when I think about summer. In summer, we will work in a laboratory and look at our results together. It will be hard to be inside, but it is important. I wouldn’t change this job for anything!"
59,B1,"Whenever I tell people what I do for work, they can hardly believe it. But I’m not joking! I spend my days at work eating chocolate! Tasting chocolate is very important to make sure that customers get the best chocolate from my company. Every week, I get small samples from our factory. I check them for taste, texture, and smell. I also taste the raw materials we use, like nuts and fruit. I spend time choosing the best ones to put in the chocolate.
Next to my office, I have a kitchen where I can test and taste the products I make. I also share samples with my colleagues! My kitchen has many machines and ingredients to use. It’s great to have my own space during the day. No two days are the same in this job. Sometimes I am in our food lab, and other times I travel to buy raw materials. This can be hard because I have a young family. But I love the variety in my job, even more than the chocolate!
People often ask me if I get bored of chocolate. I have worked with it for a long time, and I still love to eat it. In fact, I often go home and eat more chocolate in the evening!"
60,B1,"Have you ever thought about what it is like to perform in a circus? Sophia Grayson works at Circus Experience, a place that teaches young people circus skills. She says her course is popular because it teaches many skills. Students learn to juggle, throw and catch things like balls or even fire. They also learn trapeze, which is flying through the air in front of an amazed audience.
The course lasts for one year. Students slowly take more risks in each class, and parents can come to some classes to see how their children are doing. Sophia explains, “To have a career in the circus, performers need to do different things. It is important to keep performances exciting and full of action. If you want to be successful in the circus, you must keep practicing. Another great thing is making friends with other performers and learning from them. Being fit is also very important. Circus artists, like athletes, train every day to stay strong. Training is very important, but the best performers are those who want to succeed, have creativity, and always want to improve their skills.”
Some people think that circus performers get hurt a lot or that they only work for a short time each year. But the real challenge is thinking about the future. You can only travel and perform when you are young, and then you need to think about other jobs. The course also teaches business planning. Many past students have started their own businesses around the world and are happy to share their stories. However, Sophia warns that this job is not for making a lot of money! “The work usually does not give you a regular salary. It is also very competitive, but it is a lot of fun!”"
61,B1,"You may not know her name or face, but you have probably heard her many times. Mariam Hobson is a backing singer. This means she sings in the background to help the main singer. Many people think backing singers are not as good as lead singers, but that is not true. They often have to be even better! People like Mariam are very important in the music world.
Mariam says, ""What I love about my job is that when I go to the recording studio, I never know what I will sing. It could be classical, jazz, hip hop, or rock. Sometimes, I even sing funny songs for radio or ads. I am often surprised by what the producers ask me to do. Once, I was asked to sing like a fish underwater! But I never argue; I just do my job!""
She explains that to do her work well, you need to be very good at music and learn quickly. Often, there is no music sheet to read. Mariam remembers her first time recording music for a film. It was hard because there were eight singers, each singing a different part, and there was also an orchestra. She was scared because if she made a mistake, they would have to record everything again, and nobody likes that. Recording sessions are already long.
One of her favorite jobs is recording for songwriters. Some new writers do not know which notes sound best for a female voice. By listening to Mariam sing their song, they can learn how to make it better."
62,B1,"Julie Deane started with only a little knowledge about fashion, but she built a successful business selling ‘satchels.’ A satchel is a traditional bag that schoolchildren use. Now, these bags are sold in famous shops and many celebrities use them.
Before she chose to sell satchels, Julie thought about different business ideas, like cake decorating and party planning. She wanted to make the best choice. When she decided to sell satchels, not everyone agreed with her. Many people said there was no need for them, but Julie believed in her idea.
Julie worked with her family from the beginning. She worked with her mother, who had never worked before but was good at business. The design of the satchels was inspired by children’s storybooks. Julie did not know much about fashion blogs, but they helped her business a lot. At first, she sold only one satchel a week. To get more people interested, she sent satchels to fashion writers and hoped they would write about them. They did, and more people started to like her bags. Now, her company makes satchels faster.
Julie enjoys seeing which celebrity is seen with a satchel. While other companies spend money on online ads, she uses ideas from the internet community to create new and exciting styles. There was a tough time when another company copied her design and sold similar bags. Now, she makes sure she trusts her production team as much as her own staff.
Visitors to her office say it feels positive and happy there. People enjoy working in her company. There is a new factory, and while the buildings are important, it is the team that makes it a special place."
63,B1,"When Vicky Harmiston was a child, her parents let her and her brother Jamie choose what to do in their free time. Vicky liked to play many sports. She was a good swimmer, and her coach thought she could be a champion. But the swimming club was far from her home, so it was hard for her to train and do her schoolwork.
When they were teenagers, Jamie loved cycling. He bought a special racing bike and started to compete. Vicky thought this was exciting and wanted to try it too. She says it was the best choice she ever made. Soon, she was cycling every day and doing very well. The track was close to her school, so it was easy for her to go to training after school.
Vicky had a successful career in track cycling and won many competitions. When she was 28, she stopped competing. Vicky said, “I loved winning for many years, but I started to feel tired of it. When the excitement goes away, it’s not fun anymore. Luckily, I found a new job.”
Vicky got a job with a charity called CycleZone. She said, “We work with young people who have never liked sports. The first thing we do is teach them to ride a bike. We want them to believe in themselves. CycleZone is great because it brings young people together.”
The charity uses famous people to help promote their work. Vicky said, “Some people think having a celebrity help a charity is not always good. They say celebrities do it for their own fame, and this can hide the real work of the charity. But if famous singers and actors can help, I think they should.”"

The first time Ana sang in front of people was at school. She was very nervous, and her teacher had to help her off the stage. The teacher suggested that Ana join the school theatre club to help her feel more confident. After some time in the club, Ana sang happily with 50 other students at a concert.
A year later, her brother, who was in a band, asked her to write a song for them. Ana wrote her first song called ""Falling Stars"" in just three days. She enjoyed writing so much that she took a songwriting course with a professional. Even though she was the youngest student, she knew a lot about music. But Ana felt that the teacher did not listen to her, so she wrote a song called ""Something to Say"" about her feelings. She shared this song online, and many people loved it.
Joss Alton, who owns a recording company called Isotope Music, came to ask Ana to join his company. At first, Ana was unsure because she did not know much about Isotope and did not want anyone to tell her what to sing. But Joss assured her that this would not happen. Soon after, Ana performed at a concert in Dublin organized by Isotope. The tickets sold out quickly, and it was a wonderful night.
Ana prefers to write songs about difficult times in life because she feels she has more to say then. One of her favorite songs is ""Decision,"" which is about why her brother stopped singing for a while and how it made him sad. Ana hopes her fans will like her songs, but she wants to write about her own important experiences."
65,B1,"Last year, I went on a great trip. I traveled by boat on a guided tour along the west coast of Canada. It was my brother Harry’s idea. He is a journalist, like me, and he wanted to write stories about the trip. He loves boats, but I do not share that interest. I had always wanted to visit this area because I saw it on TV when I was a child. I knew it was where our great-grandparents lived before they moved to Europe. So, I kept asking Harry if I could go with him until he finally said yes!
A few days before we left, there were storms where we were going. But the weather was supposed to be nice when we arrived. I was busy with work and did not have much time to prepare, but Harry said he would take care of everything, so I felt better.
When we got to Canada, we joined the group, packed our things into small boats, and started our journey. The guide told us that very few people live along that coast. On the first morning, we only saw dolphins and birds. There were islands in the distance, but the fog made it hard to see. I enjoyed watching the beautiful patterns our boat made in the water.
We often stopped to explore the rock pools on the beaches. They were full of colorful fish, many of which I did not know. I loved that I did not have to worry about time. We always remembered to have lunch and dinner, which we cooked together over campfires. At night, we slept on the boats. The beds were hard, but it felt nice to live without stress.
When it was time to go home, I felt sad. I did not want to return to normal life. But I knew I would miss my family and friends. I was also excited to tell everyone at home about our adventures!"
66,B1,"My dad was a professional basketball player in Germany, just like his dad before him. When I was a kid, I went to many of his games. You might think I would love basketball, but I didn’t. I liked to tell my friends how good my dad was, especially when he won, but I often read a book instead of watching the games.
When I started secondary school, I was still two years away from being a teenager, but I was already two meters tall. My sports teacher saw my height and asked if I wanted to train with the basketball team. I enjoyed the practice, but I thought I needed to get better before playing in a real game. The teacher believed in me more than I believed in myself. After some time, I agreed to play, and a few weeks later, I played against another school. My parents came to watch, which made me nervous, but it turned out fine!
For the next four years, I practiced every day and did very well. I even joined an adult team before I moved to a special sports academy in the USA when I was fifteen. The coach there trains Olympic basketball players, and it was amazing to work with him. However, I didn’t enjoy living far from my parents at first. At home, I couldn’t spend much time with my friends because of all the training, so that part was not new for me. In the end, I got used to my new life, and my English got better quickly!
I became a professional player at eighteen, three years after arriving in the USA. I had been taller than most players since I was fifteen, but I needed to gain weight to match my height. My coach knew a team that would take me while I was still in college, so I joined them and have never regretted it."
67,B1,"Seven years ago, I was studying Tourism in college. I needed a part-time job because my course was expensive. I decided to become a weekend tour guide in my city, Chicago, USA. I took visitors around the city, and I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. I saw my city in a new way every time!
After I finished my studies, I wanted to be a tour guide full-time. I thought it would be easy, but I learned that I needed to know a lot more to get a license. All tour guides in Chicago must answer many questions about the city, like its buildings, history, and public transport rules. After a few months of hard work, I got my tour guide qualification and became an independent tour guide.
Being a tour guide is not just about knowing facts. You also need to be entertaining and tell interesting stories. It is important to handle unexpected situations, like if a place is closed when you arrive. Tourists want to enjoy their tour, not hear about problems. I need to make sure visitors are happy, or they might leave a bad review online. Good reviews are very important because they help me get more customers.
I try to make my tours fun and easy for everyone. Because I love my job and put a lot of energy into it, I usually get very good reviews. Many visitors recommend my tours to others coming to Chicago."
68,B1,"My name is Ella, and I am 22 years old. Last year, I went to Thailand for two weeks with my sister, Josie. She is five years younger than me, but we get along well. We went to help at an elephant sanctuary. This is a place where people take care of sick and rescued elephants. 
At first, I was not sure if we would get along with the other volunteers because they were older than us. We were also nervous because it was our first time doing this kind of work. But in the end, we had nothing to worry about. 
One of our main jobs was to collect food for the elephants. Elephants eat a lot of grass and banana plants, so this took most of the day. Josie found it hard work, but I thought it was worth it to see the elephants enjoy their food. We also helped wash the elephants in the river with big brushes and soap. I had a lot of fun, even if I got wetter than the elephants!
The part I looked forward to the most was the evening. At night, we walked the elephants into the forest where they slept. All the volunteers stayed in the same house. Josie and I shared a small bedroom because she did not want to be alone. It was hot and humid at night, but we expected that. The food was delicious and did not have meat, which we do not like.
After dinner, all the volunteers and staff talked and played games together. Now that we are back in the UK, Josie does not talk about Thailand much. But if someone asks her if she liked the sanctuary, she says she loved it. I think she might be a little upset with herself because she missed her friends too much and did not enjoy her time fully. But when she thinks back, she knows she was lucky to go there. Maybe she will go back one day – I know I will!"
69,B1,"I’m Gina D’Costa, and I have a flower shop in the UK. We sell flowers to many different customers. Hotels and offices often buy flowers for their reception areas. Sometimes, we provide flowers for businesses to use in their advertising photos. Once, I even decorated a castle with flowers for a wedding. It was a lot of work, but I was very proud of it.
My day starts at 4 a.m. when I go to the market to buy fresh flowers. Most people are still asleep, and my friends think I am crazy, but I love my job. It is often cold and dark at that time, but I don’t let it bother me. The flower market is amazing, with flowers from all over the world. The sights and smells make it hard to choose. If I were buying for myself, I would choose only pink flowers because it is my favorite color. But I have to remember that what I like is not always what my customers want. 
Not all flowers are available all year, so I can’t always find what customers want. I don’t like arguing about prices with the flower sellers, but I have to do it. Flowers can be expensive, so I try to get the best price. 
Back at the shop, we look at customer orders and prepare vases with the flowers I bought. Then we make flower bunches and calculate the costs. Customers are often surprised by the prices, and I sometimes ask them to think again about what they want. Some people might think this is too much trouble, but I enjoy finding the best flowers for the money someone wants to spend. That’s what you have to do when you sell things, and I wouldn’t want any other job!"
70,B1,"My city has a modern cinema that shows the latest films and many kids' films on weekends. It is close to my home, but a year ago, I felt something was missing. I wanted to talk about films with other people after watching them. So, I started a film club with two friends!
We decided not to rent a cinema. Instead, we choose a different place in the city each month. For example, we used an old factory to show a film set in Antarctica. It was very cold, which made it perfect for the film, and it was great!
Some places we use are free because the owners sell snacks during the film. This helps us keep our prices low. We are happy to make enough money to cover our costs, but we do not want to make a profit. Each time we show a film, it gets easier, especially now that we have our own good equipment. We can also see how many tickets we sell online, so we do not worry about empty seats.
There is always a lot to do, but when people of all ages tell us they had a great time, it feels wonderful. Our website helps us a lot, and we are now in touch with other film clubs in the country. We have visited them to see how they do things, but it is always nice to come back to our own club!
We started a blog because we know many people look online for film information instead of reading local papers. We also put up some posters in cafés. But the best way to get new people is when others tell their friends about us. The audience loves the special activities we have with each film. Last month, we had a movie quiz, and everyone enjoyed it!"
71,B1,"Taking photographs was my favorite thing to do when I was a child. When I turned 15, I wanted to make my hobby more special. So, I decided to start a project: I would take one photo every day for a whole year. Many other young photographers had done this before, but I thought it was a great idea, so I began.
After a few weeks, I put my photos on a website for young photographers. I wanted to create a photo diary and show my pictures to others. I was surprised to find that many people liked my photos. I enjoyed taking pictures of many different things. Then, someone suggested that I should focus on one topic for my photos. I agreed and decided to take more pictures of nature, especially birds and the sky.
Most of my photos were black and white, which was different from what many other young photographers were doing. They were taking color photos. Sometimes, I doubted my project and almost gave up. But in the end, I trusted myself and became more confident in my style.
One day, I showed my project to my art teacher. She told me about a photography competition for young people. I entered some of my photos just for fun. I will never forget the moment when the judges told me I won first prize. I was so happy because my project meant a lot to me. It was the first time I realized that my photography was good, and I could be a professional photographer.
Now, I have my own photography studio, and I have never regretted my choice to follow this career."
72,B1,"I joined the National Youth Challenge (NYC) last year. I wanted to try new things like camping and sailing, and learn skills like public speaking. In NYC, you can do many activities to challenge yourself and learn. There are different levels, from beginner to advanced, and adult volunteers called ‘leaders’ help us. When you finish each level, you get a certificate.
When I first joined, my leader said I should help organize activities at a local children’s club for two hours a week. I was not sure about this because I had joined that club when I was eight, and I found it hard to make friends. I was shy, and the other kids already had their own friends, so I stopped going after a few weeks. But I decided to take the challenge because I wanted my first NYC certificate.
Soon, I wanted to spend all my free time at the children’s club. It became more important to me than just getting the certificate. When I finished the challenge, the NYC leader let me keep volunteering at the club because I made good friends with the children. Now, I go there for about four hours a week, and I always look forward to it.
Because of what I learned at the children’s club, I decided that when I finish school in three years, I want to go to college to become a youth worker. A youth worker is someone who helps children. I never thought about this job before I started at the club. This has been my favorite part of NYC, and I have improved my communication skills while helping others. I have several NYC certificates now, and one of them is for camping!"
73,B1,"I was born in Denver, USA. I started snowboarding when I was eight years old. My dad took me to a place in the mountains, about two hours from Denver. The hill looked very steep, and my dad had to convince me to try it. I was too young to ask him if I could snowboard, but he loved it and wanted me to enjoy it too. He made it look easy, and in the end, I did well. 
After that, I really loved snowboarding and got better at it. I started to compete when I was ten. Some people enter many competitions and get bored, but I still love to compete and win. This helps me work harder. I like not having a strict plan, and sometimes this works out well. For example, I was the first girl to get a perfect score of 100 in a local competition. I was nervous about doing the jumps, but I did them and felt proud of myself.
In the summer, I train and study because there is no snow. I train every day, but I don’t have to follow a strict diet like in winter. I also spend a lot of time with my friends. This helps me feel better when I can’t snowboard, which I love and am good at.
I think about my future. Snowboarding is a big part of my life, but I want to have another job too, just in case I don’t become a professional snowboarder or if I get hurt. I am thinking about becoming a doctor if I can find time to go to college. I can’t imagine getting tired of snowboarding, but I know I can’t do it forever."
74,B1,"When I was fifteen, I wanted everything my friends had. I did not think about the future. For example, I did not know what I wanted to do after school. One day, my best friend got a new phone for her birthday. I wanted a new phone too. My parents said I could only have one if I paid for it myself. So, I decided to work part-time and save money. I am thankful to my parents for making me do this because it taught me an important lesson.
I worked every Saturday in a café, but I did not enjoy it. My parents suggested I start my own small business. I had seen my mum making necklaces, so I asked if I could try. I thought it would be hard, but it was easy! My friends thought it was boring, but I liked the idea. My mum showed me how to make pretty things at home with simple tools and materials.
I sold my first jewellery to my friends and family. They said they loved it, but I thought they were just being nice. I wanted to know if other people would like it too. So, I rented a market stall with my mum. There are many tourists where I live, and they bought a lot of my jewellery to take home. Soon, people from all over the country called us to buy more. They thought we were a big company, but it was just me and my mum at the stall!
That was when I knew my business could work, and I decided to create a website. Since then, I have made a lot of money from my business, mostly online, but we still have our stall. It has been a lot of fun!"
75,B1,"When Janine Stuart was 13 years old, she wrote a book called Being Amelia. This book became very popular. Being Amelia is partly about Janine’s own life. In an interview, Janine said, “Because my father’s job made us move a lot, I learned to make new friends. I know what it is like to be the new student in a class. This helped me write about Amelia, the main character, who starts at a new school. Some funny parts of the book are about Amelia’s home life, especially with her older brother. Since I am an only child, I had to use my imagination to write about that.”
Janine started her book one summer when she was bored at home. Her mother wanted to be a writer, and her teachers always told her to write, so writing seemed like a good way to spend her time. The year before, she won a short story competition on a website for young writers. That is why, when Janine finished Being Amelia and sent it to a publishing company, they were excited to read it. They loved the book, and a year later, it was in stores.
One review of Being Amelia says that even though the cover shows happy teenagers, the characters face real problems. This makes readers believe in them. The reviewer also says that even though Janine is young and her book is not very long, she is a better writer than many famous authors.
Janine is still getting used to being a famous writer. She said, “At first, I hid when people recognized me in the street, but now it’s OK. I want to help other young writers, but they need to find their own way. For me, I just need to spend time with my friends, and then I will have something interesting to write about!”"
76,B1,"I’m Tom, and I’m fifteen years old. Three years ago, my family and I moved to a castle on a small island! My dad got a job as the manager of the castle. He works for a group that takes care of old buildings and keeps them open for visitors. At first, we were not sure about moving. We thought life on the island would be different. The castle is not as comfortable as our home, and there is no school on the island.
After we moved, we got used to living on the island. The castle is not very beautiful, but our apartment is nice. In summer, the island is busy with many visitors, and there are often beach parties. In winter, we only see the other families who live here, and there are not many teenagers. The adults help each other with work on the island, which can be hard.
The biggest change for me is taking a boat to my old school every day. I like going on stormy days when there are big waves, but the ferries do not run then! I also learned that if I miss the bus to the harbor after school, I miss the last ferry home, which is stressful. So, when my friends come to visit, I always tell them to hurry!
We often see beautiful views, especially when the sun sets over the sea. Some days, it is very foggy, and you can’t see anything, but then it can be sunny again in a few hours. It is still amazing to see that, even after living here for a long time. We do have strong storms, and I sometimes worry if the castle will be okay. But I remember it has been here for many years, and it is still standing!"
77,B1,"I live in a house in the beautiful countryside of Scotland. I have always loved nature and wild animals. Six years ago, I started a new hobby – birdwatching! I went to the mountains in northern Scotland with my family. We saw many birds in their natural homes. I spent hours watching them with my parents. They taught me how to tell different types of birds apart and where to find them. It was amazing! After that trip, I joined a local birdwatchers’ club for young people.
My goal is to see 200 different types of birds. I am almost there! When my family goes on holiday, I look for birds from other countries too. We always find places where we can watch birds together. I have been to Egypt, and last summer we went to South America. I thought I would see my 200th bird there, but it didn’t happen. I learned that you need to be patient with birdwatching.
I made a video about my birdwatching challenge and shared it online. Many teenagers liked it and said it looked fun. My teachers saw the video and asked me to talk about birdwatching at school. I felt nervous before I went on stage because all my friends and the whole school were watching me! I relaxed after I finished, and my teachers said I did a great job.
I am lucky to live in the countryside. I understand why many teenagers in cities might not think about birdwatching, but there are many birds to see in green areas. I believe birdwatching clubs should try to get more young people interested in this hobby. Everyone should connect with nature, no matter how old they are, and it doesn’t have to cost a lot of money."
78,B1,"I started playing football when I was 7 years old. I would hurry home from school to play with other kids. I loved it, and soon I became a good player. My family thought I would stop playing like I did with other hobbies, but I didn’t. I dreamed of playing football professionally when I grew up. 
One day, I played in a local tournament. A referee saw me and told the manager of a professional women’s club to watch me. After that, she asked me to join her club. I was surprised because I didn’t know young girls could join women’s clubs. But the manager liked my skills, and I started training with the big club when I was 13 years old. I got much better at football.
Even so, some people were not sure I would be a star player, and this made me a little sad. But my coach told me to be myself and believe in myself. He even let me play in an important match earlier than I thought I would! I ran very hard because I didn’t want to let my team down. Then, by chance, I scored the winning goal! I could hear my coach cheering for me, and after the match, my team carried me around the field. It was amazing! 
Since then, I have scored many more winning goals. Next month, my coach and I are organizing a football tournament for teenagers in my area. We want to get them interested in football and help them meet other players from my club. They will see what it is like to play professionally and feel that they can also play for a top team if they work hard. 
I will tell them what my coach told me – there will be good times and bad times. I have had very few bad times, so I feel lucky!"
79,C2,"
In the UK and around the world, schools and universities are encouraging new students to start doing research early in their studies. Research is not just for famous scholars or scientists. It is a way for everyone to learn and build skills. Research skills are important for studying and for jobs because they help us think about the world and how to do our work.
As a student, you can help create knowledge. You do not just learn and repeat what others say; you ask questions. You might wonder: Why? How? When? What does this mean? What if things were different? These questions are part of research.
Research can be very complex, but it can also be simple. It starts with asking questions about everyday things. Most students have done some research before. You have probably asked questions for school projects or at work. You might have researched where to go on holiday, how to grow plants, or how to fix things at home.
In college and university, you are expected to ask questions, think critically, and explore information. Some students find this hard because in some cultures, knowledge is seen as fixed. They may think they should only listen to teachers and books. However, in many places like the UK, US, and Europe, it is important to question what you learn and who teaches it.
Doing research can feel challenging. Critical thinking is very important. We should not just repeat what we read or hear. Instead, we need to think about it, test it, and see if it makes sense. We should not just accept everything as true without questioning it."
80,C2,"Cities have always been important places for ideas and creativity. In the past, people met in coffee houses in London to talk about science and politics. In modern Paris, artist Pablo Picasso discussed art in cafés. However, living in a city can be hard. The same cafés that encouraged discussion also helped spread diseases like cholera. Picasso eventually moved to the countryside.
Today, cities are full of creativity, but they can also feel overwhelming. Scientists are studying how city life affects our brains, and the results are surprising. We know that city life can be tiring, but new research shows that it can also make it harder for us to think clearly. One big reason for this is that cities lack nature, which is good for our brains. For example, patients in hospitals heal faster when they can see trees from their windows. Even a little bit of nature can help our brains relax from the busy city life.
More people now live in cities than ever before. Instead of living in open spaces, we are packed into crowded areas with many strangers. This crowded environment can affect our mental and physical health and change how we think. When we walk in busy streets, our brains have to pay attention to many things, like other people and traffic. This constant need to focus can make us feel tired because it uses a lot of our brain's energy.
Natural places are easier for our brains to handle. This idea is called attention restoration theory, created by psychologist Stephen Kaplan. He believed that being in nature helps our brains recover. Natural settings have things that catch our attention without causing stress, unlike loud noises like police sirens. This helps our minds relax and recharge.
Long before scientists studied this, philosophers and landscape designers warned about the problems of city life and wanted to bring nature into cities. Parks, like Central Park in New York, give people a break from city life. A well-designed park can help our brains feel better quickly. While people look for many ways to improve brain function, like energy drinks or new office designs, walking in nature seems to be one of the best solutions.
Despite the mental challenges of city life, cities keep growing. Research shows that the same crowded features that can make it hard to focus also help create new ideas. The close interactions between people in cities can lead to creativity. Just like the crowded streets of 18th-century London led to new ideas, the busy environment of modern cities can also help innovation. However, less crowded areas might not create as many new ideas over time.
The challenge is to find ways to reduce the stress of city life while keeping its benefits. Sometimes, people feel tired of nature and want to be in the city again!"
81,C2,"**Where Should We Look for the Mind?**
This question might seem strange. We usually think that thinking happens inside our heads. Today, we have advanced machines that can show us this. But I believe we should not only look inside our heads to study the mind. There is a lot of evidence from history that shows objects and tools also help us think. 
For example, things like stone tools, jewelry, drawings, and writing have played an important role in how humans have developed and how we think. So, what is outside our heads might also be part of our mind. 
Many scientists focus on the brain when studying the mind. They often separate people from the things around them to understand how they think. This is useful for brain studies, but it can make us forget that we think with the help of things around us. 
I do not want to say that the brain is not important. Instead, I want to explore the idea that our intelligence connects with culture and the objects we use. This is what my new idea, called Material Engagement Theory (MET), is about. 
MET looks at how objects can help us think. For example, when we make numbers from clay or use a stone to create a tool, these actions show how objects are part of our thinking. MET also studies how this has changed over time and what it means for our thoughts. 
Think about a blind person using a stick. The stick helps the person feel and understand the world. The brain sees the stick as part of the body. This shows that our minds can change and grow when we use new tools. 
My idea sees the mind as something that is always changing. The stick, in this case, is not just a tool; it helps us learn and explore. For humans, tools are not just for getting food; they help us understand and learn about the world. 
This special way humans interact with objects is why we create things. These things also help shape our minds. I call this idea metaplasticity. It means our minds can change and grow as we use different objects. 
I want to show that objects are important for understanding how we think. MET helps us see how different tools, from ancient stone tools to modern smartphones, have changed who we are and how we think. Technology that changes our minds may sound like science fiction, but humans have been using it since we first appeared."
82,C1,"""Photography is one of the most important inventions that changed how we see the world. In the United States, photography became a big part of culture. It is used in many ways, like science, industry, and art, and it also brings fun and entertainment. Historians say photography is one of the greatest contributions to visual arts in the US. 
Photography became popular in the mid-19th century. People liked it for many reasons. First, photography was a new technology that matched the excitement for machines and change. Just like trains and electricity made travel easier, photography brought images of the world into homes quickly. 
Second, people used cameras to show who they were. It helped them create images of themselves and their families. Third, photographs are realistic and fit well with the art style of showing everyday life in the US. 
Every photograph tells us to look at something special. It shows what the photographer wants us to see. Because photographs are made by machines, they are records of real events, people, and things. However, the person taking the photo also gives their own view, which can change how we understand the image. 
We might think we know what a photograph means, but it can be more complicated. The meaning of a photo can change based on where we see it, like in a newspaper or a gallery. To understand a photograph, we should think about why the photographer took it and how people first saw it. 
In recent years, artists have used photographs in their work in many ways. For example, artist Andy Warhol used photographs in his paintings. Now, photography is seen as an important part of art, not just separate from painting."""
83,C1,"In 1890, William James, an American philosopher and doctor, defined psychology as the ""science of mental life."" This definition helps us understand psychology even today. Everyone has a mental life, which means we all have thoughts and feelings. Psychology can be studied in humans, rats, and monkeys, but it can be hard to understand.
William James was especially interested in human psychology. He believed it has basic parts: thoughts, feelings, the physical world, and how we know about these things. Our knowledge is personal and comes from our own experiences. Sometimes, we make judgments about psychology based on our own feelings and opinions. For example, we might think we know why someone feels sad or why they quit their job. 
However, problems can happen when two people understand things differently. Formal psychology tries to find the best explanations for different situations. Psychologists help us tell the difference between our personal thoughts and scientific facts. They study the mind and brain, but they do not know everything about how the brain works. 
Psychologists learn more by observing behavior rather than studying the brain directly. They use these observations to make educated guesses about what is happening inside us. Studying psychology is like solving a crossword puzzle. It requires careful observation and logical thinking.
Psychology aims to describe, understand, predict, and change behavior. When psychologists achieve these goals, they can help us understand our experiences and improve our lives. Their findings have helped in many areas, like teaching children to read better, designing safer machines, and helping people express their feelings.
Although people have talked about psychological questions for a long time, scientific study of psychology started only about 150 years ago. Early psychologists used introspection, which means looking at one’s own thoughts and feelings, to find answers. While this method is interesting, it has limitations. William James said trying to understand the mind this way is like trying to see in the dark. Today, psychologists prefer to observe the behavior of others to develop their theories."
84,C1,"In a storehouse in a simple business area in Michigan, USA, there is a special place called the Museum of Failed Products. This museum shows products that people did not want to buy. Some examples are A Touch of Yogurt shampoo and Breakfast Cola. The museum is owned by a company called GfK. Carol Sherry, who runs the museum, believes that each product has a sad story about the people who tried to sell it.
It is surprising that this museum exists and makes money. Many companies do not keep samples of their failed products. Robert McMath, who started the museum, wanted to collect new products, not just the ones that failed. He began this in the 1960s. He learned that most products do not succeed. Because he collected many new items, most of them turned out to be failures.
The museum shows how people often think positively about new products. Many products went through meetings where no one realized they would not sell. Sometimes, marketers put more money into a product that is not doing well, hoping to make it successful. They often do not look into why the product failed and prefer to forget about it.
This positive thinking is also common in the self-help area. One popular idea is ""positive visualization,"" which means if you imagine good things happening, they are more likely to happen. Research shows that people might be naturally inclined to think positively, which helps them survive. However, psychologist Gabriele Oettingen found that thinking too much about how well things could go can actually reduce people's motivation to reach their goals. For example, people who thought about having a great week at work ended up doing less.
Psychologist Carol Dweck says that how we feel about failure depends on our beliefs about ability. Some people think ability is something you are born with, while others believe it can grow with effort and challenges. People who think ability is fixed feel very bad about failure because they see it as a sign that they are not good enough. On the other hand, those who believe ability can grow see failure as a way to learn and improve. Dweck compares this to weight training, where muscles get stronger by being pushed to their limits. Having a growth mindset is a happier way to live, whether or not it leads to success."

Everyone knows that sports teams have an advantage when they play at home. But why is this? Many people think they know the answer, but things are changing in professional sports. Two main reasons make us question the idea of home advantage: science and money. 
Sports scientists want to understand what helps players do their best. They have many ideas about home advantage. At the same time, people who pay for sports want to know why home advantage is important. They think that if players are paid enough, they should feel good playing anywhere.
What about the fans? Would it matter if a team like Manchester United played some games far away, in places like the Far East, to reach more fans? It would matter to British fans. They believe their team needs their support and loyalty. Fans often think that the order of events explains what happens. For example, when a team plays well, the home fans cheer loudly. Sometimes, this cheering happens just before a goal is scored. But fans forget the times when the cheering did not lead to a goal.
One thing that fans believe is supported by science. Home fans cheer for their team and also try to influence the referee. In a study, referees watched a game with crowd noise and another game in silence. The referees who heard the crowd were less likely to call fouls against the home team. This shows that referees try to avoid making calls that would upset the home crowd.
Recent studies show that home advantage has decreased in many sports, but not by much. For example, in the 1890s, home teams in England won about 70% of the points. Today, they win about 60%. One reason for this change is travel. In the past, travel was hard, but now players travel in comfort. Stadiums also look more similar now, which may affect home advantage.
However, the reasons for home advantage are still not clear. Different sports have different levels of home advantage. Basketball has the most home advantage, followed by football. Baseball has the least. This might be because baseball is more about individual players, while basketball is about teamwork. In basketball, players feel more confident when they play at home.
Another interesting point is about players' energy. Studies show that players have higher testosterone levels before home games. This might be because they want to protect their home ground. In some recent rugby games, underdog teams won at home against stronger teams. They showed great determination and strength, which is part of home advantage. As one referee said, ""It’s the law of the jungle out there."""
86,C1,"""‘The more I practice, the luckier I get,’ said golfer Gary Player many years ago. This saying is famous in sports and is important for many athletes and their coaches. It is easy to understand why. First, many people argue about who really said it first. Second, the meaning is not clear. Player did not mean lucky in a real way; he was being funny. His real message was: ‘The more I practice, the better I get.’ 
But there is a limit to this idea. Where this limit is, and if it even exists, is part of a big discussion about talent. Some people believe talent is something you are born with, while others think it is something you can learn. This discussion is not balanced; it seems that practice is more important than natural talent. 
Psychologist Anders Ericsson is known for saying that you can become an expert in anything with 10,000 hours of practice. Many books, like Malcolm Gladwell’s Outliers, support this idea. They all say that practice is the most important thing. They suggest that ‘10,000 hours is enough to make anyone an expert in anything.’ 
However, Epstein, in his interesting book, argues that this is not always true. He points out a problem in many studies about successful people: they often only look at the best athletes and try to explain their success. He asks if there are other ways to understand why some people have special abilities and others do not. 
Epstein travels around the world, from Kenya to Sweden, to find answers. In Alaska, he learns that the best sled dog racers might win because of their dogs’ strong desire to run. This shows that both genes and choices can be important. 
Some people think that commitment and determination are just choices. But what if, like the huskies, a person’s drive is also part of their genes? This makes the topic more complicated. Epstein talks about nature (genes) and nurture (environment) and says that both are important for top athletes. 
He does not ignore the importance of training or environment. For example, he thinks that if Usain Bolt had grown up in the US, he might have been a good basketball player instead of the fastest man in the world. But he also looks at cases where genes are very important. 
He also discusses race and gender. He asks: ‘If only practice matters, why do we have separate competitions for men and women?’ Sometimes, the best questions are the simplest ones."""
87,C1,"A recent report shows that many children in rich countries feel lonely and unhappy. Jay Griffiths asks why children today feel this way. In her new book, Kith, she explains that many children spend too much time indoors, looking at screens like TVs and computers. They do not spend enough time outside in nature, like in the woods, mountains, or by rivers. This, she believes, is a big part of the problem.
A follow-up study talked to some children to understand their feelings better. Many of them said they would be happier if they could go outside more. Older people often remember their childhoods fondly, saying they had more freedom. They spent time exploring, swimming, and playing outside. They think this was better and healthier than how children live today. However, they forget that they are the ones who keep their children safe and do not let them play outside as much.
Griffiths discusses how parents worry about dangers outside and how this affects what children can do. This fear makes parents want to keep their kids at home, which helps companies that sell toys and gadgets. She also talks about strange rules, like making children wear goggles to play games or giving medicine to kids who can’t sit still. Some of these rules may not be very common, but Griffiths expresses her strong feelings about them.
While Griffiths has good ideas, she sometimes goes too far. She compares how we treat children today to racism, which seems extreme. She has a very positive view of children, saying they are creative and full of ideas. However, this view may not always match reality, especially when dealing with energetic young children.
One important idea in her book is that children should be allowed to explore and take risks. Griffiths believes that children need to experience small accidents to learn how to be safe later. However, she does not explain how to let children have these small accidents safely. Also, not all children want to explore the wild. Some are shy or prefer to stay at home. It might be wrong to expect all children to be the same or to force them into one way of playing."
88,C1,"I am a bio-psychologist with a PhD, which means I have studied a lot. I am good at solving problems in my work and in life, but this is not just because of my education. Many problems in life cannot be solved with complicated formulas or answers we learn in school. They need good judgment, wisdom, and creativity that come from life experiences. For children, these experiences happen during play.
My recent research is about how important play is for children’s growth. All mammals, including humans, play when they are young. Animals that need to learn more play the most. For example, meat-eating animals play more than plant-eating animals because hunting is harder to learn than eating grass. Primates, like monkeys and apes, play more than other mammals because they need to learn more.
Children, who have a lot to learn, play more than any other young primates when they can. Play is how both adults and young mammals learn. The most important skills children need to live happy and good lives cannot be taught in school. These skills are learned through play. They include thinking creatively, getting along with others, working together, and controlling their feelings.
Creativity is very important for success. We do not need people who just follow orders or do simple math. We need people who can ask new questions and solve new problems. If we can help people think ahead and find solutions, we will have a strong workforce. But this needs creative thinking. Creative people often have a playful mind.
Some adults, called geniuses, keep their childlike ability to play and think creatively. Albert Einstein said that school almost made him lose his love for math and science, but he found it again after school. He called his creative work “combinatorial play.” He imagined chasing a sunbeam and thought about what would happen.
We cannot teach creativity, but school can take it away by focusing on fixed questions instead of children’s own questions. It is also very important to get along with others, care for them, and work together. Children naturally want to play with others, and through play, they learn social skills and fairness, which they need for life.
Play is voluntary, which means players can stop whenever they want. If you cannot stop, it is not play. Players know they must keep each other happy to keep playing. This makes play a very fair activity.
School has become harder. There are fewer breaks, more homework, and more pressure for good grades. Outside of school, organized sports have taken the place of free play. “Play dates” with adults have replaced playing in the neighborhood without supervision. Adults now often feel they must step in instead of letting children solve their own problems.
These changes have happened slowly but have been very big. They are caused by many social factors, like parents’ fears, warnings from experts, and the idea that children learn more from adults than from each other. Our children do not need more school. They need more play. If we care about our children and the future, we must change this trend that has been happening for many years. We must let children play and explore so they can grow into strong adults ready for the future."
89,C1,"In many countries, more young people in their twenties are using social media to find jobs. Websites like Twitter and LinkedIn help them connect directly with employers. This is easier than before when people had to stand outside offices with signs saying ""hire me."" But using social media can also lead to mistakes.
For example, a young man in the US tried to connect with a senior marketing executive on LinkedIn. He thought she could help him find a job because she knew many important people. However, she was upset by his request. She did not want to share her contacts with someone she did not know. She rejected his request and wrote a very rude message that many people saw online. People were shocked by her message, and she might regret how she wrote it. 
This situation shows that young people need to be careful when using social media for work. Many young job seekers do not know how to use it properly. Social media is a big part of life for many young people, but using it for jobs is different. When I was a teenager, social media was a way to escape from parents and teachers. It was a place to show off and be creative. You could talk to someone online for hours and then ignore them at school. You could also change how you looked online with pictures and songs.
However, using social media for work is not the same. Some young people still act like they did when they were teenagers. Just because many people liked your posts on Facebook does not mean you will impress employers on LinkedIn. We need to understand that the rules have changed. Employers expect us to be professional.
One common complaint from employers is that young job seekers are too casual and seem arrogant. This makes older people think badly of our generation. In reality, many young people are struggling to find jobs, which is why they use social media. This impression of arrogance can hurt their chances, even if they have the skills to do well at work.
So, how should you contact someone on a professional site? First, clearly say who you are and explain how you can help them. Maybe you can offer to do some research or assist them in another way. This will give you a better chance of getting a good response. Avoid sending the same message to many people, and keep your tone polite. Remember, social media can help you make important connections, but you need to use it carefully to avoid problems."
90,C1,"""It is hard to say what will happen to newspapers in the future. Many people think newspapers are in trouble. Since 2000, the number of people reading UK national newspapers has dropped by a lot. In the USA, only 26% of people get their news from newspapers now, down from 45% in 2001. Some people believe that printed newspapers will disappear in 15 years. 
However, history shows that old forms of media often survive. For example, in 1835, a journalist said that books and theatre were finished and that newspapers would be the most important source of news. But theatre survived, even with the rise of cinema and television. Radio is still popular today, and cinema has also done well against videos and DVDs. Even vinyl records are coming back, with online sales increasing a lot since 2008.
Newspapers were once a new form of media too. It took a long time for them to become the main way people got news. This happened because it became easier and cheaper to share news with many people in the 19th century, thanks to new technology like the steam press and the telegraph. People started to think that they needed to know what was happening around them regularly. In the past, people only noticed changes in the seasons or big disasters like floods or diseases.
Before the 19th century, journalism was not a job that many people could do for a living. Even then, most people did not feel they needed news every day or week. Newspapers have a fixed way of publishing news, which can be limiting. Now, with the internet, people can read news whenever they want. They can also choose what news is important to them. Online news can be updated quickly, and mistakes can be fixed right away. 
However, many news providers focus on being the first to share news instead of helping people understand it. In the past, news was shared in busy places like markets or taverns, where truth mixed with rumors. Today, it seems we are going back to that way of sharing news. Newspapers have not always done a good job of explaining how the world works. They might disappear, or they might find a way to help us understand better in this confusing world."""

Humans are not very comfortable in the dark. We are used to the light of the sun. Our eyes are made to see well in the daytime. This is part of who we are, even if we don’t think about it. Because of this, we have changed the night by adding a lot of light. This is similar to building a dam on a river. While it helps us, it also causes problems, which we call light pollution. 
Light pollution happens when lights shine in the wrong places, like up into the sky instead of down where we need it. This bright light changes the darkness of night. Many animals, including us, have adapted to the natural light and dark. When there is too much artificial light, it can affect how animals live, including how they migrate, reproduce, and find food.
A long time ago, people lived with very little light at night. For example, in London around 1800, most people used candles and lanterns. There were no bright street lights. If you walked towards London at night, you would smell the city more than see its light.
Today, we have made the night very bright, but many animals are still used to the dark. Some birds are attracted to bright lights and can get lost or hurt. They may fly around lights until they fall. Other birds sing at strange times because of the light.
At first, people thought light pollution only bothered astronomers who want to see the stars. But we all need darkness. Without it, our bodies do not work well. Our sleep and wake cycles are important for our health. Changing these cycles can make us feel unwell.
In the end, light pollution affects us just like it affects animals. We have created a bright world that makes us forget about the natural night and the stars. This makes it hard for us to remember our true place in the universe. The beauty of a dark night with the stars above is something we are losing."
92,C1,"A founder of a big company said that his business will not keep track of how much paid holiday time employees take. He got this idea from an internet company that has a similar rule. The founder said his daughter sent him a happy email about it. 
But is this idea good? The internet company has 2,000 employees and does one job, while the big company has 50,000 employees and does many different jobs like finance, transport, and healthcare. The idea of taking as much time off as you want might work better in a smaller company where workers know each other well. In a big company, it can be hard to know if taking time off will hurt the business or your job.
The founder said employees can take as much leave as they want, but they must be sure that their work is done and that their absence will not hurt the business or their careers. But is it really possible to be that sure? When you come back from a holiday, there is always a lot of work waiting for you. This can make people feel guilty about taking time off, which can lead to stress. If workers feel they cannot take their holiday, they may become less productive over time.
In big companies, there is often pressure from coworkers about who is taking time off and for how long. This can make people feel they should not take holidays. If workers feel they cannot take their legal holiday time, they might feel lazy or worry about their jobs. 
Also, with modern technology, it is hard to separate work time from free time. The internet company started their unlimited leave policy because employees wanted to know how to balance work and time off. But if there are no set working hours, employees might feel they are always being watched by their boss. 
Workers have the right to take a minimum amount of paid holiday because rest is important for their health. I am not sure if allowing employees to take as much holiday as they want is a good idea or if it will really help them."
93,C1,"
Peer review is a process where experts check a scientific research paper before it is published. This process is important because it helps to make sure that only good quality papers are published. However, it can take a long time, sometimes up to a year, for a paper to be reviewed. Some people wonder if this long wait is worth it.
Many scientists still believe in peer review, but there are changes happening in how research is published. One change is the use of preprints. Preprints are drafts of papers that are shared online before they are reviewed. This allows other scientists to read and discuss the new research quickly. 
Publishing in journals has become very competitive. Scientists want to publish in well-known journals to help their careers. This can sometimes lead to problems, like scientists leaving out important information to make their papers look better. Reviewers may also focus more on whether a paper is good enough for a specific journal rather than if it is good science.
Some scientists are starting to use preprints more. They believe preprints can help solve some problems in the current system. However, not all scientists are ready to use preprints. Some think that journals will not accept papers that have been shared as preprints. Others worry that publishing without peer review could lead to bad science being shared.
Tanya Elks, a psychology professor, shared her experience with preprints. She wrote a paper that criticized another published paper. In the traditional system, the authors of the original paper could block her critique. But with preprints, both sides could share their views openly. This way, readers can see all the arguments and decide for themselves.
Preprint archives allow scientists from around the world to discuss their work. They can also share negative results, which are often ignored by journals that focus only on new discoveries. Papers shared as preprints are read and cited more often, showing that this method works well. By using preprints, scientists can focus on the quality of their work instead of where it is published."
94,C1,"When I ask my students what a poem is, they often say it is ""a painting in words."" But this answer does not make me or them happy. One day, I asked my students to pick an object and write two paragraphs about it. One paragraph was to describe the object like a scientist, and the other was to write from the object's point of view, calling it ""Poem."" One student wrote: 
""Poem 
I may look strange or scary, but I help people breathe. I am used only in emergencies and for a short time. Most people will never need me."" 
The object was an oxygen mask. This choice helped the class understand how poetry works in a unique way. The exercise was fun and led to good discussions. 
When I was in school, poetry was confusing for me. I thought every poem was a silly puzzle that made it hard to understand feelings. After school, many people pay less attention to poetry. Sometimes, you see a poem, and it stands out because it is not like regular writing. It challenges you to read it, but often you feel let down because it is boring or hard to understand. Still, you feel good for trying. 
What do we want from the poems we read? A poem should hold deep feelings, beautiful images, and clever thoughts. The answer seems to be yes. But if we want tears, we watch movies. For information, we read articles. Novels take us to different worlds, and music is hard to beat with its mix of words and sounds. 
However, poems can show us something special: ambiguity, or uncertainty. Our daily lives are full of this. But this does not explain what a poem really is. If you look up ""poem"" online, it leads you to ""poetry,"" which is described as a type of art using beautiful and rhythmic language. This is fancy language, but it does not explain the word's roots. ""Poem"" comes from the Greek word meaning ""a thing made,"" and a poet is ""a maker of things."" 
So, if a poem is a thing made, what kind of thing is it? Some poets say poems are like wild animals – hard to control – or like machines – made with care. But these comparisons do not fully explain poems. The best part of trying to define a poem is the discussion it creates. Whether you see a poem as a machine or a wild animal, this can change how you think about both. It helps us see ordinary things in a new way. 
A poem is easy to understand, especially when we think about how song lyrics can stick in our minds. The mix of words and music is powerful, like the saying, ""Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt me."" But sometimes, words can hurt. Think about a poem in a newspaper or magazine. A poem can touch us deeply, even though it looks like regular writing. 
What about the empty space around the poem? This space could be used for a longer article or an ad. A poem is written and rewritten like any article or story, but it is not just made to sell. Publishers send out poetry collections, but they do not expect them to make money. A poem is not just for the market; it is special on its own. Because of this, a poem can still surprise us, even if just for a moment."
95,B2,"I bought my first metal detector soon after I got married. It cost £70, which was a lot of money at that time. My wife, Marion, was very impressed when I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first trip. Over the years, I have found many brooches and coins, and each one has made me happy. I like feeling connected to the past. 
After the gold ring, it took 40 years before I found something that impressed Marion again. One dull February afternoon, I had a few hours to search. It was raining, so I went to a nearby place where I knew there were old farming tools. When my detector beeped for the first time, I found a piece of a metal wheel. Then it beeped again. I tried to ignore it, but I had to see what it was. I dug down half a meter and lay in the mud when I saw a round, golden ball. 
I had found brass curtain rails before, so I tried not to get too excited. But as I cleaned it, I saw it was a beautiful, thick loop. I stopped and stared. I remembered seeing something like this in the British Museum. It was called a torc, a famous necklace from over 2,000 years ago. It is made of gold and silver, with a gold ring at each end. 
I took it to my car and looked at it on the way home. I washed it in my kitchen sink, which was probably the only clean it had since ancient times. I shouted, “Marion! I have something for you!” When she came in, she stopped and asked, “What is it?” I told her it was a very old and rare piece of jewelry. We didn’t try it on because we didn’t want to damage it. 
At bedtime, I hid it in our wardrobe. I was worried about it being stolen, so I got up and hid it under a floorboard in my office. The law says I must tell the authorities about such finds within 14 days. I wanted to enjoy the torc as much as I could before I gave it away. I even took it in a plastic bag to show a friend in the hospital. 
Finally, I took it to the council office in the same bag. The registrar was talking to someone when I put the torc on his desk. He turned around and stopped talking. The torc was checked and later sold to my local council. It is now in the British Museum in London. I received £350,000, which I shared with the owner of the field. 
But the torc is more than just money for me. I feel like I have saved something important for everyone. People ask me if I will stop searching for treasures now that I found something so amazing. But I still find brooches and coins interesting. Just like a fisherman who catches a big fish, I will keep searching for more treasures."
96,B2,"Sleeping is one of my favorite things about traveling, but I don’t talk about it much because I feel a bit guilty. When my friends tell me about their busy trips with many activities like visiting museums and hiking, I just smile and don’t say much. What would they think if they knew I like to take long naps during my travels? I enjoy lazy mornings in nice beds and sleeping during rainstorms. 
When I traveled to Mexico's Yucatán coast in my early 20s, I was surprised that I slept more than 12 hours most days. There were loud birds nearby, but it didn’t bother me. Away from home, I could sleep deeply and have wonderful dreams. Without alarms and responsibilities, I found it easier to sleep. 
I think sleep while traveling is different because we experience new things. We see new sights, hear new sounds, and smell new smells. When we sleep, we process all these new experiences. That’s why sleep feels more intense when we travel. 
People often worry about jet lag, but I think the real challenge is getting used to new places and cultures. For example, in Trinidad, people wake up very early to avoid the heat, then take a break when the sun is high, and come back to life in the cool evening. Even though Trinidad is only one hour ahead of New York, it took me days to adjust to their sleep patterns. When I finally did, I felt like I really belonged there.
I remember one afternoon in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic. I had a big lunch with new friends in an apartment with a view of the blue Caribbean Sea. After eating, we all felt sleepy and started to relax. One by one, my friends went to lie down on hammocks and sofas. I understood why they had so many pillows around. I joined them and took a nap. I had heard about the siesta, but that day I really experienced it. I shared not just sleep, but a part of Dominican life.
Travel sleep is special because I remember it. In new places, I enjoy the different smells, textures, and sounds while I sleep. If traveling slowly means enjoying every moment instead of rushing, then sleeping is one of the slowest things we can do. Maybe I should not feel embarrassed about my love for sleep while traveling and tell my friends that it is an important part of the experience too."
97,B2,"The woman looked away from the mirror. “What do you think? Please be honest.” Mia picked up a nice hat with a soft layer of fabric and a silk bow. “I still think this one looks best on you,” she said politely. The woman wrinkled her nose and made a funny face. “But it is so boring,” she said. “Every other woman will wear a hat like that at my daughter’s wedding. This pretty little hat will make me stand out.” She touched the small red and black top hat on her head. “Yes,” she said firmly, “this is the one I want.” 
Mia smiled and agreed that the woman would stand out at the wedding. She thought about her own daughter, Jen. It was Jen’s thirtieth birthday today, and they were having a family party. It had been a long time since everyone was together, and Mia was excited to see Jen, Dan, and Luke. She was also looking forward to meeting Jen’s friend, Tattie. They did not know anything about Tattie. Mia’s husband, Jeff, had quickly asked, “What kind of name is that?” when Jen called last week. “It’s short for Tatiana,” Mia said. “I think it’s nice.” “It sounds strange,” Jeff replied. He did not like anything fancy or complicated. He also thought Mia was too polite. He would have told the woman in the shop that she was choosing the wrong hat. He might have even said that a trash can lid would look better on her.
An hour later, Mia closed her shop and went in the back door of her house, Medlar House. It took her only forty seconds to get home. Four years ago, when Luke, their youngest child, moved out, Mia decided to turn the empty barn next to their house into a space for her business. Jeff was not sure. “Do you really think people want to buy hats?” he asked. But Mia knew that many friends had trouble finding the right hat for special occasions. She was right. From the first day, after Jen helped her make a website, Mia’s Hats became a success. Women came from far away to her shop in Little Pelham. In a friendly place, she let them try on many hats until they found the right one. She encouraged her customers to bring their outfits so they could match everything. Recently, she also started selling handbags and jewelry."
98,B2,"It is a long way from London to Atlanta. In his new home in America, Lawrence Okoye thinks about his amazing sports journey. He is very confident, but he is also surprised by how far he has come. He went from being in an Olympic final in discus throwing to possibly playing American football. Lawrence has never played American football before, but he might be chosen for a big team in the USA.
In Atlanta, Lawrence is learning about his new position in football. It is surprising that a 21-year-old from London could be picked for one of the biggest teams in American sports. But Lawrence likes to prove people wrong. He was offered a place at Oxford University to study law, but he decided to train hard for discus throwing instead. He had played rugby before. In just 20 months, he became the fourth-best discus thrower in the world.
Lawrence came to Atlanta to train for discus throwing in warm weather. He wanted to prepare for the world championships. When asked about his chance to get a big NFL contract, he said, “American football was in my mind, but I only decided to try it when I got to the USA.” He had thought about it while in school, but it seemed crazy then. After arriving in America, he read about NFL trials in Atlanta. Even though he had never played, he thought he could be good enough to attend the trials. “Pretty much,” he said. He applied online.
Was he nervous about being tested with experienced football players? “No,” he said. “I don’t get nervous for many things.” He is not very talkative, but he believes in his abilities. His test results showed that he was the best player. “I was very happy to hear that,” he said, showing some pride.
However, he is also careful. He has no experience in football. How can he make it into an NFL team? “Coaches say I have what it takes. It’s about how hard I work,” he replied. Will he be calm while waiting to hear if he is selected? “I will be. There’s no pressure on me. Many people say I will be chosen, but I’m not too worried.”
This calmness might come from his bad experience in the Olympic final when he came last. He has moved on from that and is happy that he qualified for the final with a great last throw. “That was an amazing day,” he said. “The final didn’t go as I wanted, but that’s part of sports. I can go back to it.”
After his Olympic disappointment, some people thought he let that moment affect him. Lawrence does not want to talk about it. An NFL player earns over $400,000 a year, so there is a lot of money to be made. Lawrence has changed from rugby to athletics and now to American football. With all his talent, wouldn’t it be better to focus on just one sport? “I understand why someone would say that,” he replied. “I’m trying to achieve something I’ve dreamed about since I was a kid. If it doesn’t work out, I can go back to discus, the sport I love. Every decision I’ve made has been thought out.”"
99,B2,"We had been flying east all night, and I woke up to see that it was already morning. I looked out of the window at the empty land below. The dark brown and green colors made me feel better because it was mid-September, but it still looked like summer in Siberia. I could not see any people, just mountains, rivers, and forests going far away to the horizon. I shook my head. 
My neighbor woke up and smiled at me. “Good morning, Robert,” he said with a slow Russian accent. His name was Sergei, and he was a salesman from Moscow. He was flying to sell safety clothes to the local mines. His English was not very good, and my Russian was not good either. But with a dictionary, I told him I was going to the city of Magadan in far-eastern Siberia. I had a one-way ticket because I wanted to ride my bicycle back home to England. 
“But, Robert,” he said, “there is no road from Magadan; you cannot ride a bicycle.” I told him I thought there was a road, but not many people used it. “Alone?” he asked, pointing at me. “No, I will ride with a friend named Al.” “Just one friend?” “Yes, just one,” I nodded. Sergei still looked unsure and pointed outside, saying “Holodna” (cold). I tried to show him with my hands that I had warm clothes, but I did not tell him I was on a tight budget. Most of my clothes were bought at low prices. I was not sure if they would keep me warm, especially my big postman’s trousers that I bought for £10.
It all started in a lecture hall in Scotland. The hall was full of tired students. Some were taking notes without much energy. The teacher was talking on and on. I was thinking about a question. Should I ask him or not? “Well, why not?” I took a fresh sheet of paper and wrote, “Hi Al, Do you want to cycle across the Karakorum Highway between Pakistan and China this summer? Rob.” Al, my old school friend, was sitting in front of me. I tapped him on the shoulder and passed the note. He tried to read my handwriting, wrote something, and passed it back. I opened it and held my breath while I read. It said, “OK.” 
Now, six years later, I was going to meet Al in Siberia. I had been working as a geography teacher. The job was not easy, but it was interesting and I had long holidays to go on adventures. Twice, I used these holidays to meet Al. After our bike ride in Pakistan, Al wanted to do something more exciting: to cycle around the world. Since our first ride together, Al had been taking on bigger challenges. This trip around the world by bike was his biggest one yet. Sometimes he thought the ride would be too hard for him. Even though it sounded difficult, I envied him. He was having an amazing adventure and facing new challenges every day. He was proving the people wrong who said he could not do it. He was doing something that scared him almost every day, and it made him feel alive."
100,B2,"In The Red Bull Air Race, twelve pilots race through tall pylons that are between 15 and 25 meters high. They make sharp turns and do loops at speeds of up to 370 km per hour. I was invited to experience what it is like to fly in this race. 
An hour before my flight, I had to sign two forms. The first form said I was healthy, and the second said I would empty my pockets. This is important because small objects can be dangerous during the flight. I learned that I needed to keep my eyes on the horizon. The pilot would tell me where to look. I also had to promise to relax and enjoy the view when we flew upside down.
Half an hour before the flight, I had a safety talk. I was told not to touch anything during the flight. When we started to taxi down the runway, I was very nervous. I had to keep my legs up and not touch the important pedals and switches. I knew I should relax, but I was too scared.
As we took off, the pilot, Dario, made a sharp turn to the right. I felt the air push out of my lungs. I looked at the horizon and tensed my body. For a moment, I felt much heavier than normal. Then we leveled out and made another sharp turn. We were flying very low, just 10 meters above the ground, and I could see the small space between two pylons. We passed them at 400 km per hour, and I felt excited but also scared.
For two minutes, I got to fly the plane, but my hands were shaking. Then Dario asked me something, but I couldn’t hear him. Instead of answering, he did a barrel roll, which is a full turn in the air. He asked if I was okay, and I said yes. He then did a loop, flying up and over in a circle. 
Many people would find this fun, like riding a rollercoaster, but I thought it was too much. At the top of the loop, I heard a voice telling me to relax and look up. I looked up and saw fields below us. The flight lasted 10 minutes, and it felt easy compared to what the pilots usually do. When we landed, Dario ate sandwiches, but I couldn’t eat for hours. That night, I kept dreaming about flying in loops."
101,B2,"Doug Allan films wild animals in cold places. If you have seen polar bears in a nature documentary, it is likely that he filmed them. He likes it very cold, around -18C. Allan studied marine biology and worked as a diver. Diving was his first love, and he learned how to survive in cold places. His big chance came when a TV crew came to Antarctica, where he was working, to make a wildlife documentary. He helped the crew find different places to film. After 48 hours, he realized that being a wildlife cameraman was perfect for him because it included travel, adventure, and underwater work.
Now, he is a well-known cameraman and has worked on many important TV wildlife shows. When he started 35 years ago, not many people had been to Antarctica. There were people who filmed coral, elephants, and chimpanzees, but he became known as the ""cold man."" He felt that many amazing scenes were waiting to be filmed. 
When he began, the camera and technology were very simple. He says it is much easier to film today. In the past, if you filmed something, you had to remember it. Now, with digital cameras, you can see what you filmed right away. Before, you had to think about what shots you needed and what you missed. Film was also very expensive, so you filmed less. Now, it is easy to have too much footage.
Allan has a lot of experience in cold places. He feels comfortable on sea ice, like it is just crossing the street. He does get cold toes, but he says the poles are healthy places with no leeches, diseases, or mosquitoes. 
Wildlife filming has many successes, but also failures. Once, he was in the Orkneys to film kittiwakes, but he could not tell which birds they were. Recently, he got permission to film in Kong Karls Land, a group of islands in the Arctic Ocean. This place is home to polar bears and is very dangerous. In April, it is usually -32C, and the wind is strong. Carrying cameras in deep snow is very hard. After walking for five hours a day and watching polar bear dens for 23 days, he only saw one mother bear and her cub.
On the 24th day, he felt like he was part of the bear world. He and his team waited quietly and moved around to stay warm. After watching for five hours, he saw a quick glimpse of a bear. The camera was ready, and he focused on the viewfinder. At first, he saw just a black nose, then a full head. The bear came out and rested in front of the hole. She looked at him but did not seem scared. Just when he thought it could not get better, she slid down the slope happily. Then, two cubs appeared at the den entrance. It was their first time seeing the world, and it was an amazing moment.
Now, Allan wants to make his own film about climate change in the Arctic. He wants to talk to the people who live there and see how it affects their lives. He believes he can create a very special documentary."
102,B2,"In 2004, Pen Hadow was the first person to walk to the North Pole alone without getting more supplies on the way. He had to swim in very cold water and deal with frostbite and polar bears. Eight months later, he also reached the South Pole. Now, he is back in the Arctic, getting ready for a new adventure that is even bigger. 
Pen and two friends will go on a three-month journey of 1,000 kilometers to the North Pole. They will measure the ice to see how thick and dense it is. No one has done this before, and Pen knows the results will be very important for scientists. This will show how global warming is affecting the ice in the polar areas.
Pen was prepared for this job since he was a child. His father’s old nanny, who worked for a famous polar explorer, helped him become strong. She sent him out into the cold with very few clothes. His father also loved adventures in the cold, and Pen became very strong.
Pen is married to Mary, who loves horses. She helps him with his polar guide business. Mary says she worries more about him when he is at home because he thinks about the Arctic. Once, she raced against him in a mountain event, and she finished an hour before him. 
Pen and Mary live in the countryside with their two children. He finds it harder to be away from them this time. When he last left, his son was only one year old, and he told him to take care of his mother and sister. This made his son very worried. Pen feels it was not fair to put that on him. This time, he plans to have little contact with his family while he is in the Arctic because he does not want to remind them how far away he is.
Before he leaves, Pen is getting his equipment ready. He says that on the ice, it is very hard to fix things. He will be with Ann Daniels, a top polar explorer, and Martin Hartley, a photographer. They will have a team of six people to help them with supplies.
Pen is feeling stressed because he has not trained as much as he wanted. He is turning 47 soon and worries about what he will ask of himself. He believes this mission is important because it connects exploration with learning. He says that reaching the North Pole was a personal goal, but this time, scientists will use the information they gather. He wants to involve many people in understanding what is happening in the Arctic Ocean. He feels that their skills are now very important and useful."
103,B2,"""I took a year off. What was I going to do? Being a successful Olympian is amazing. I had the chance to write more, work on TV, and talk to businesses and schools. Even though I enjoyed these activities, I wanted to compete again. I wanted to stay fit so I could try for the Olympics if I felt that way again. So, I joined marathons and triathlons. That should have been enough, but I kept thinking about Ben Fogle’s invitation: ‘Do you want to row across the Atlantic with me?’ I have always loved rowing and how the boat moves through the water. I missed that feeling, but I wasn’t ready to train every day. Still, I wanted some competition. I asked my rowing friends if they wanted to join the race, but they were not very excited. I knew that if I joined the race, I would want to win. But would rowing with Ben help me win? Maybe not. However, being an underdog without pressure sounded nice. I contacted Ben. He was going to join the race anyway and had found the money for the entry fee and a boat. This made the race feel real. We talked about the costs; the boat and equipment would cost £70,000, which is a lot of money. We thought we had a good chance, but we still needed to work hard to get it. I also had to think about losing money because I would be away from home. Speaking at business events is one of the best ways to earn money after being a professional athlete. It feels good that people are interested. But I find it hard to talk about my past without a new goal. Joining the race would mean I was doing something again: rowing across the Atlantic. I learned a lot while planning this adventure, but one big lesson was to appreciate the easy life of a full-time athlete. My training for the Olympics was hard, but it was simple. I trained almost every day, but I had a set program, doctors, and dieticians. I was worried about what people would think of me racing with a TV presenter. I thought it might look like I just wanted to be on TV. But my worries went away as we prepared. The Atlantic Rowing Race is not just about rowing; it is also about the mind. Ben had done tough challenges, but he could not row well. I was surprised by how little he knew about rowing, and he was surprised by my lack of patience. I could have been more patient, but I needed to tell Ben how much he needed to improve. I should have known what to expect when I agreed to race with him."""
104,B2,"
A little over a year ago, I left my job to work with huskies in the Arctic Circle in northern Finland. I was 26 years old and felt restless. I dreamed of cold, snowy landscapes because I wanted to escape the busy life in London. I found a small company run by Anna McCormack and her husband, Pasi Ikonen, in Finnish Lapland. They hired me as a husky dog handler for the winter season. From December to February, they take tourists on sled rides pulled by huskies across the snow. They started with six dogs, but now they have more than 100. They also took over a second place called the 'wilderness farm,' which is pretty but basic, with no running water. They told me I could join the team for three months, but the work would be hard. I started packing right away.
On November 6, I flew from London. I had to memorize the names of more than 100 huskies, but I felt nervous. I looked out the window instead. I thought about how winter was coming, with rivers freezing over.
On November 7, I took a bus north. The ride was beautiful. We drove through dark forests with snow on the trees and stopped for reindeer. I arrived at the farm after dark. As soon as I got in, Anna gave me a pair of boots and sent me outside into the cold. She asked if I wanted to start working right away. I followed the sound of barking and found the dogs. They were very excited and wanted to run. I tried to introduce myself, but everyone was too busy. I petted one of the quieter dogs, and then someone told me to get in the sled. Suddenly, we were off into the dark with only a headlamp for light.
By November 15, I was learning how to be a husky guide. Anna asked me if I was useful, and I didn’t know what to say. I had never driven a snowmobile or used an axe. But I did have a driving license, which made me feel better. I learned the basics of dog-sledding quickly: lean into the corners, use both feet on the brake to stop, and hold on to the handlebar. But other tasks, like feeding the dogs, were hard in the cold. Water would freeze quickly, so we made a 'soup' of meat in hot water for the dogs. By the end of my first week, I was tired and my muscles hurt from pulling heavy sleds and being pulled by excited huskies. But I felt proud. I emailed my friends, saying, ""I can chop with an axe, hammer a nail, and use a saw. In the snow!"""
105,B2,"On that day, Radcliffe ran very fast and crossed the finish line. Many reporters came to talk to her about her amazing run. They said her time was good enough to compete in the men's marathon at the world championships in Paris. The journalists asked her about emu oil, a special treatment that helped her heal after she had an accident while training. Radcliffe said she did not fully understand how big her achievement was at that moment. She thought it was just what she was supposed to do that day. She and her team believed in having no limits.
During the race, her husband Gary Lough and her physiotherapist Gerard Hartmann were in a car, listening to the race on the radio. After 16 kilometers, Radcliffe's agent worried that she might not be able to keep running so fast. Hartmann was angry about this because he knew how fit Radcliffe was. With 800 meters left, Radcliffe realized she could finish in under 2 hours and 16 minutes if she ran the last part quickly. She had already run 41 kilometers very fast, but she still sprinted the last part in 2 minutes and 25 seconds. At the finish, she thought, ""I can run faster than that."" The race director, Dave Bedford, said he never thought anyone would run that fast for a long time, and Radcliffe thought she would come back and do it again next year. Sadly, that did not happen.
After the race, many people wanted to know how Radcliffe, who ran in a strange way, beat the skilled East African runners. Hartmann worked with her a lot, helping her with her training. He said he had worked with many Olympic winners, but Radcliffe could handle a lot of pain. He often traveled 13 hours from Ireland to France to train with her, and when he arrived, her husband would say, ""Gerard, you're late, Paula is waiting."" There was no time for greetings; she wanted to start training right away.
Hartmann spent so much time with Radcliffe that other athletes became jealous. When asked why no one has come close to her record, Radcliffe said she trained very hard, but there are other talented runners. She thought Mary Keitany, a two-time London marathon winner, could do it. Radcliffe believed that some runners focus more on beating others instead of pushing themselves. She always pushed herself to run hard, even when she was winning. 
Radcliffe did not know it at the time, but that marathon was the best she would ever run. However, she inspired many women to start long-distance running."
106,B2,"When my first cooking show, In Search of Perfection, came out, I was not sure how people would like it. There was a lot of talk about a food ‘revolution’ in Britain, and I thought we made a special series that added something new. But I worried: would people like a show that talked about cooking techniques, history, and science? I watched the first episode feeling both happy and scared. I didn’t need to worry. The show became very successful and led to many other interesting projects, including a book about my restaurant. 
In each project, I felt like I was on a journey, whether into the past, into my thoughts, or into cooking methods. I wrote several books in a series called ‘Perfection’, each one with its own TV show. In these books, the journey was often about traveling, with passports and bags. The latest book is called In Search of Total Perfection. In it, you will travel around the world to meet amazing people, like a man who makes golden pasta that tastes better than any other. These people have spent many years trying to reach their own idea of perfection.
Perfection means different things to different people. Choosing which dishes to include in the series was very hard, and I knew some people would be upset if their favorite dish was not there. I could imagine people asking, “Where is steak and kidney pie and bread and butter pudding?” But after a long meeting, the TV team and I made a list that had something for everyone. This showed me that everyone has their own idea of perfection, based on their feelings, memories, and experiences.
Even though the book is called ‘Perfection’, I knew I could not say the recipes were the best. But I believed that by using my cooking skills and talking to food makers, chefs, and customers, I could find out what makes these dishes good. The dictionary says ‘perfection’ means being perfect, but it also means improving through practice. This means trying new ideas and changing them until you have something special.
The TV show let me explore many foods, people, and places I had never seen before. I was excited to learn about food and memories because I started my career in the same way. Finding the best ingredients took me all over the world. I had many adventures, like visiting a canning factory that was using the wrong tomatoes and going to a dairy farm that was not good enough for filming. I even tried to make each recipe better by hand-milking a cow and using dry ice to make ice cream, cooking chicken in a hospital machine, and almost burning my house down trying to make a real Neapolitan pizza."
107,B2,"We were still far from Marrakech when the van made a loud noise, went off the road into a field, and stopped. John got out and opened the front of the van. He looked at the engine for a long time with his hands in his pockets. He looked like he knew what he was doing. Then he said, “Actually, I don’t know what I’m doing,” and he and Mum started to laugh. Bea was worried. “We can’t stay here forever,” she said. The field was big and had only grass and many flowers, like poppies and daisies. “No, we can’t stay here forever,” I said, because I wanted to agree with Bea. We got back into the van and waited for Mum and John to stop laughing. We watched John get smaller as he walked to find someone who could help with the van. Mum lay down on the grass. “Tell us a story,” she said. Bea lay down next to her. “Go on, tell us a story.” So I told them about how the day before we left London, I heard two birds talking. I told them what the birds talked about: breadcrumbs, other birds, the weather, and an argument over a worm. “That’s silly, no one understands bird language,” Bea said. My eyes felt wet. “I do.” But I didn’t sound sure. “Liar,” Bea said. I felt embarrassed. How could I be lying if I remembered everything? I thought about it and felt confused. “Mum…?” But she was asleep in the sun. 
John came back with three Moroccan boys who helped us push the van to the hotel. Bea didn’t want to get out. The boys waved and smiled at her through the back windows. We followed John into a café. It was not far from where our van was parked. “It’s a hotel,” John whispered. “It might be a bit expensive.” “We’ll just have some tea,” Mum said, and we sat in the shade. The tea was made from mint leaves and was very sweet. Mum looked into the pot. “It’s like syrup,” she said. We stayed at the café all day while John looked at the engine. “It’s a miracle it got us this far,” he said when it started to get dark. Mum took out blankets and made a bed for us in the hotel garden. It felt nice to sleep on the ground. “I’ll have to get us towed into Marrakech,” John said. 
Half an hour later, we were in a truck watching our van being pulled behind it with John driving. At first, Bea didn’t want to move, so John picked her up and put her in the truck. Now she sat in the front with the driver. I kept thinking about how we would get home now that our van had to be pulled everywhere. I thought it might be easier to take a boat straight to London. Then I must have fallen asleep."
108,B2,"Lucy was at a welcome party in a hotel ballroom. She was talking to two other pianists who were also at the Prague Classical Music Festival. One was a guy from Tokyo, and the other was a girl from Europe named Liesel or Louisa. They were both about ten years older than Lucy. They spoke good English and talked about the music they were playing and their travels. 
“I think I’m going to Tanglewood this summer,” Lucy said. It sounded impressive, but she didn’t really want to go. She didn’t want to do many things that took her away from school, like concerts and competitions. Because of this, she wasn’t officially in school anymore. Instead, she worked with tutors from the University of San Francisco. 
Lucy didn’t even want to come to the Prague Festival, which only took fifteen young pianists from around the world. She was lucky to be chosen from thousands of applicants. At the party, her dad gave her a white-gold necklace with an L pendant to celebrate. Her little brother Gus dreamed about being at the festival one day. Lucy’s teacher, Grace Chang, took her out for a special dinner to plan what music she would play. 
The funny thing was, Lucy hadn’t applied to the festival. Her mom filled out the form and sent in a CD of her playing. “I didn’t want you to be sad if you didn’t get in,” her mom said. Lucy thought her mom just didn’t want her to say no. Back then, Lucy thought it was bad to speak up about what she wanted.
The guy from Tokyo leaned in and asked, “Tanglewood?” 
“Yeah,” Lucy replied. 
“How old are you?” he asked. 
“Fifteen,” she said. He looked surprised and shared a glance with Liesel/Louisa, who said, “Wow.” Lucy didn’t mean to show off. It was hard to know when to share her achievements and when to be humble. 
“It’s just part of a new youth program they are trying,” she explained. 
“Excuse me,” Liesel/Louisa said, looking away as if she saw someone she needed to talk to. The guy from Tokyo stayed and asked, “Have you ever been to Japan?” He had long hair, like many musicians, to show he was cool. 
“Once, when I was about eight,” Lucy answered. He started to reply when Lucy's grandfather came over. 
“Lucy, let me introduce you to someone,” he said, taking her arm and pulling her away. “And don’t get too friendly with the competition.” 
“They’re not the competition,” Lucy replied. 
“Everyone is the competition,” her grandfather said. He took her around the room to meet important people. Lucy smiled and nodded, but she only understood part of what they said. 
In the elevator to their room after the party, her grandfather said, “You did well, Lucy. I’m proud of you. This festival is important, and people are talking about you. They all know who you are.” 
Lucy liked that. She liked being someone special, even if some people were jealous or thought she was too young. Being a concert pianist didn’t make her popular with the kids at school. Even her best friend, Reyna, didn’t know or care that she could play difficult music. But in places like this, Lucy felt she mattered."
109,B2,"""Dad said, 'It’s not good for you to spend so much time online. You need to go outside and enjoy the real world.' I wanted to know what experts think about this, so I did some research. It is interesting! 
Most studies show that many teenagers who use social media have real friends, feel good about themselves, and learn important skills for the digital world. Simon Miles, an expert on online safety, says that social media is a big part of growing up today. Teenagers use it differently than adults. They are not just looking at things quickly; they are living in it. This is not good or bad; it depends on how you use it.
Jim Matthews, a social media expert, says that using social media is like hanging out at a youth club, like parents did when they were young. It helps teenagers connect with friends and deal with problems. 
Psychologist Professor Keith Davidson says that being a teenager is a time to ask, 'Who am I?' Social media can help with this. You can share your favorite music or sports and see how others think. Research shows that teenagers who use social media are not more self-centered than those who don’t. He also says that talking online can be easier for shy people and helps them practice social skills.
Professor Andrew Phillips studies how young people use social media. He believes it helps quiet people with special interests connect with others who like the same things. If you are one of the few in your school who likes a certain type of music, you might feel alone. But online, you can find a group of people who share your interest, and you can feel popular in a new way.
Pauline White, an expert in digital education, says that teenagers can find new interests online and create their own content. She thinks social media is a way for teenagers to be creative. They can make videos, podcasts, and blogs about what they like. Photo-sharing sites help photographers connect, learn, and share their work. This can help them get jobs in the future.
Every business uses social media to sell products and reach customers. If you have many friends on social networks, they can be potential customers for your product. 
Teenagers who use social media creatively will benefit when they grow up and start working. Matthews agrees that many sites allow people to work together to create and share content. Working together is an important skill for jobs today."""
110,B2,"When most people think of a fun family vacation, they might not think of a long trip across nine western states in the US and one province in Canada. But my parents wanted to have a special summer vacation this year. My dad planned a big family trip that my twin brother and I were not excited about. They often said, “Not enough people do this anymore,” while we exchanged worried looks.
In mid-June, we packed our car with suitcases, food, and clothes for any weather. I was happy but knew I would miss my own space for the next two weeks. With little room left in the car, we started our “Family Great American Road Trip.” Leaving our big home for smaller places for the next five thousand miles made me wonder what we were getting into.
We drove west through Oklahoma. Even though we were close to home, we had some adventures. We stopped for the night in Oklahoma after almost being blown off the road by a dust storm. We learned that cows have the right to cross the road!
The next day, we woke up early and continued our trip. We saw deserts and then mountains. Each day was different, but they all blended together. We left our footprints in the Great Sand Dunes and then went to Pagosa Springs, Colorado, where we smelled sulfur. As we drove up the mountains, we realized that some roads are better for Jeep cars.
Every place we visited had a mix of old and new things. We often got stuck in traffic because of construction. We laughed when we saw big “CLOSED” signs at the Four Corners Monument. We passed many wind farms on our way to Yellowstone National Park. There, we watched the sunset over bear habitats. Sometimes, we had to stop for bears crossing the road, which made for exciting memories.
As we drove, I forgot about life at home. Even our hotel, which was old and didn’t have internet, couldn’t stop our excitement. I saw the most beautiful views ever. After watching a rainstorm from our hotel in Canada, we started our journey back home. My parents were right; you don’t need to go far away to find something amazing. 
It felt nice to be home together again, and I was happy I didn’t fight with my brother during our long trip. We took three thousand photos of our adventures, and I knew I would remember the fun surprises we had along the way."
111,B2,"Rose Frost was sixteen years old. She was going to live with her grandmother, Daisy. Rose's family was separating for two years. Her father, Jeff, had a job in another country, and her mother, Dahlia, would go with him. But Rose and her older sister, Amy, would stay in England. Amy was finishing her last year of school and would live at the college. She had the best room with a kitchen and a study area. Amy was happy because she also had free Internet and phone access. Their parents would check on Amy, whether she liked it or not. 
So, Rose was moving to her grandmother’s house. She only remembered a few happy times with Daisy and had never met her grandfather. When Daisy offered Rose a place to stay, her parents were not very happy, but Daisy was excited to see Rose again. Rose did not know why her parents did not get along with her grandma, but they had a fight a long time ago. Because of this, Rose had spent her summers away from Daisy. 
Dahlia told Rose that living with Daisy would be interesting. Daisy was very social and loved to meet people. Rose thought she would get many dinner invitations, coffee mornings, and shopping trips. This made her smile. Daisy was not a typical old lady; she went to many social events. 
Before the move, Dahlia and Rose talked. Rose was sensible and mature for her age. She knew about healthy eating, exercise, and sleep. But Rose wanted one thing: her independence. She wanted to play music loud, invite friends over, and go out without asking for permission. She wanted to be trusted. Daisy understood this. 
Dahlia gave Rose a new mobile phone with a video camera for emergencies. Rose was very happy. They all agreed to trust each other. Rose would act mature, and Daisy would not be too strict. If either of them went too far, they would talk about it again. 
Rose was not a wild child. She had good friends, and her school reports were always good. In five weeks, Rose would start at a new school, meet new friends, and begin her life again. This was her fourth school in five years, so she felt experienced. She knew this would be her last school before finishing. For Rose, it was a new beginning in her life."
112,B2,"Charlotte Grainger talks about how her primary school teacher thought she might write a book one day. Charlotte says, “I thought writing a book would be a big achievement because it seemed hard. I didn’t know what other teenagers were doing, like going to the Olympics. When I turned 13, I thought, ‘I should try this now.’” Now, the novel she started at that age is about to be published. 
Charlotte recently told her old teacher about her book, and the teacher was surprised. The teacher thought Charlotte would write a book when she was 30 or 40 years old. Charlotte didn’t understand why she should wait to do something she was good at.
It is a winter afternoon in the office of Charlotte’s publishers. I was going to interview a 15-year-old girl about her book, and I was surprised to see a teenager sitting there. The book is a big achievement. It is exciting and well-written. The only thing that shows it was written by a teenager is the age of the main character.
A public relations person is with us in case Charlotte needs help, but she doesn’t. Charlotte is confident and smart, but she is also calm and not too proud. She knows she is still young. When I ask her about the important questions in her book, she says, “I wanted to ask big questions, not give answers. I don’t have many life lessons to share with my readers.” She laughs and adds, “I think my age doesn’t limit my understanding of the world, but I don’t think I am very wise. I just wanted to explore the idea of taking responsibility.”
Charlotte has a theory about teenagers and the stories written for them. She believes there are three types of teenagers in books: the outsider who becomes accepted, the naïve teenager who knows little about the world, and the awkward teenager who struggles socially. She feels annoyed by these types. “What if you’re just fine? There aren’t many stories about teenagers who are okay. Some writers make it seem like teenagers don’t know who they are because they lack experience. This can hurt their self-confidence.”
Charlotte loves reading famous fantasy writers, but their books almost stopped her from writing. “My favorite fantasy books talk about deep things in life. I wondered if I had to write like that to make a good book and if I could do it.” However, she likes a book called How Not to Write a Novel. “It says if the reader can guess what will happen next, the excitement is gone.”
Some people might think Charlotte’s parents, who are journalists, helped her get her book published. Her father knew someone in publishing who read her book first. Charlotte knows she is lucky because it is hard to get anyone to read a first novel, no matter how old the writer is. “Every writer needs support and a bit of luck, but after that, you are on your own. In the end, writers succeed or fail based on their talent, so I don’t take anything for granted,” Charlotte says."
113,B2,"""‘Remember, speed is your friend, not your enemy,’ said Gareth, our instructor, as we looked down the ski slope. ‘Now, who wants to go first?’ The group looked nervous. Then a guy named David, who had some experience with freestyle ski-jumping, stepped forward and skied down the slope towards the jump. He went fast and flew up into the air, but something looked wrong. We held our breath. He landed hard, lost both skis, and fell into the snow. ‘Remember,’ Gareth said kindly, ‘speed can be unpredictable.’ 
I thought maybe freestyle skiing was not for me. On my previous skiing trips, I liked to practice turns in the snow. I was not like the teenagers who did tricks on ramps and half pipes. I thought it looked fun, but I was afraid to try because I didn’t know how and I didn’t want to look silly. Then my parents decided we would go to a training center for freestyle skiing in the US. It had a big indoor area with trampolines and ski jumps with fake snow. Students jumped and tried their new tricks, landing in foam cubes. This was not a real introduction to skiing outside.
After practicing indoors, we went outside to try our tricks for real. ‘Progression is inevitable!’ the center’s slogan said. Gareth told us, ‘Before places like this, new ski jumpers just went down the slopes and hoped for the best. But remember – if you land on the knuckle, you’ll be in trouble.’ The ‘knuckle’ is the flat part behind the jump before the slope goes down to the landing area. If you land in the right place, you keep moving forward. If you land on the flat, you stop suddenly, and that hurts. So, speed is important.
At first, it was hard for me to ignore my fear and go fast towards the jump. My legs wanted to slow down, so I landed on the knuckle. I didn’t fall, but I felt tired. ‘You need to control the jump, not let it control you,’ said Gareth. 
On the second day, we started on the trampolines. I thought I would hate being inside, but bouncing was fun. Some exercises helped us practice ski-jumping moves, and others helped us learn ‘aerial awareness’ – knowing what our bodies were doing in the air. Gareth gave us tips. I needed to work on my ‘aerial awareness’ because I only noticed when I was about to jump and then I found myself in the foam cubes.
We went back to the mountain to try again. There were more mistakes, but finally, I landed properly. Gareth was happy, and I felt proud. But that feeling didn’t last long. On my last jump of the day, I made myself go fast. I jumped and landed in the right place. Then I saw both my skis sliding down the slope, no longer on my feet."""
114,B2,"Imagine you are on a rollercoaster at an amusement park. You feel scared and hold on tight. The ride stops, and you take a deep breath as the carriage goes slowly up. Then, suddenly, it drops, and your stomach feels funny. You go fast forward, turn left, and even go upside down. You scream because you are scared. But you chose to go on this ride, just like many other people who pay to enter the park.
Amusement parks are very popular and make a lot of money. Many people work behind the scenes to make the rides exciting and safe. There are engineers, designers, and marketing experts who help create these rides. Being a rollercoaster designer sounds fun, but it is a big job. They must make sure the ride is thrilling but also safe for everyone.
Most of the ideas for rollercoasters today were created by a designer named John Miller in the early 1900s. In the past, rollercoasters were very extreme, but now there are rules to keep people safe. I talked to some experts about rollercoasters. Professor Brendan Walker, a thrill engineer, said the skill is in putting all the parts together. Dr. John Roberts explained that it is important to make people feel excited but safe at the same time.
To create a great ride, the teams must tell a story, like a space adventure or a jungle chase, while adding exciting features like tall drops and twists. Professor Walker said that experience and trying new things are very important in this job. Jeff Hornick, a director of theme park development, agreed that it helps to love thrills to understand what riders want.
I asked if new technology, like virtual reality, would change rollercoasters. Walker said that while new technology can be exciting, the real experience of the rollercoaster will always be the most important part for many years."
115,B2,"At 25 years old, Miranda Ellington has done a lot as a choreographer. She has created dances for many theatres and dance companies. She also dances sometimes. I wonder why she does both things with her busy life. She says, ""Dancing again helps me remember what it is like to be in the studio and follow the orders of choreographers. It can be very tense and frustrating. Choreographers sometimes forget how hard it is to practice all day.""
As a choreographer, Miranda teaches and enjoys working with young students. She says, ""New dancers are often open to trying new ideas. Working with students can be easier than working with professionals because they are willing to take risks. They want to succeed, but they do not always know their strengths and weaknesses. This means they can accept even tough criticism. Sometimes they challenge what I say, but I like their honest feedback.""
When Miranda starts with a new group, she focuses on the dance steps, and the music guides her. She says, ""There might be music I don’t like, but I still try to create the best dance routine for it. If dancers do not respond well to the music, it can be frustrating, but I have to find solutions. I cannot just choose a new piece of music. I wish I could try different pieces to make rehearsals more fun. But now, I always work on big productions where the music is already decided.""
Miranda does not want to stay with one place. She says, ""It is important to meet new people. But I have to remember that each theatre and school has different methods and styles. I need to change how I work each time I go somewhere new. This helps me not to get stuck in my ways.""
We talk about a recent documentary about ballet dancers and choreographers. Miranda says, ""Some documentaries look nice but are not true. This one shows real life in a dance company. There is a scene where a young dancer gets many corrections. I smiled because I understood her struggle. She knows she is not doing it right but cannot make her body move as needed. It is hard to watch, but it is real. People do not see how much work and dedication ballet needs.""
I ask Miranda what makes a great dance production. She says, ""It is when everything comes together – the music, costumes, lighting, and dancers. Perfection is hard to achieve, but aiming high is important. It helps you get away with some mistakes. I have worked on shows where the dance steps are good, but the costumes or props are distracting. That is disappointing.""
Miranda has done many types of work, and I wonder how she sees herself. Is she a modern dance choreographer or a ballet expert? She replies, ""People want to label you, but I do not understand why. There is a trend to focus on one area of expertise. I do not agree with that, but maybe one day I will be known for one thing. For now, I want to explore more."""
116,B1,"A friend once asked me why I travel when I can watch everything on TV. I said that TV shows many amazing things, but why stay at home when there is so much to see and do outside? This conversation gave me the idea for my fun four-day trip and a film to make people turn off their TVs. 
A friend was giving away his old sofa, and I used it in my film. I added three wheels and some cables to the sofa and connected them to old seatbelts on my shoulders. I put my bags on the sofa and slept on it every night, even one night on the beach. Some friends came with me to help pull the sofa and cheer me on. 
I have walked on many trips before, but this was very different. It was the longest distance I have ever walked, and I walked on main roads. This meant I could stop at a café and relax on the sofa with a cappuccino instead of sitting on a rock with my sandwiches blowing away in the wind. 
I often told people, “No, I’m not doing this for charity, and I’m not training for a marathon.” When someone at work asks about my weekend, I prefer to tell them how I pulled a sofa 100 miles across southern England instead of talking about the latest TV show. You can watch the film on my website."
117,B1,"When I read about swimming trips in the sea around some small Greek islands, I felt excited. I had never been on a group trip before. My brother was busy, so I thought a group holiday would be good for me. The man at the Greek port looked surprised when I asked for a ticket for one person, because many families visit the islands. I told him I would not be alone for long; I would join ten other people to swim around the small islands. He still looked confused, but he smiled and helped me get on the boat.
Before we started, our group had sent emails to each other, but we did not have much time to talk before our first swim. Our guides told us that a support boat would be with us the whole time and showed us how to communicate with it. We swam a short distance to split us into speed groups, and then it was time for our first long swim of 1.5 km. I felt nervous. I had trained in my local pool and swum in rivers, but I had never swum long distances in the open sea.
Soon, the waves got bigger, and I found myself at the back of the slow group, which was not where I wanted to be. I watched the faster swimmers move ahead like dolphins. I wanted to finish this first swim, and I was very happy when I did it by myself. 
The next days were similar: we jumped in, found a good speed, and stopped to enjoy the view. As the swims got longer, I swam faster and felt happier to finish them. I did not need the support boat much. I can’t wait to come back again next year!"
118,B1,"Being a flight attendant is not easy, but it is a great job. Since I started, I have traveled to many places, like the US and Australia. I work with amazing people, I have a lot of free time, and my job is never boring. This makes it a good job for someone young like me!
When I was a child, I went to a boarding school far from my family. I often flew alone when school started and ended. Sometimes I felt lonely, so I asked the flight attendants if I could help serve meals to the passengers. Some of them let me help. 
Later, when I wanted to change my job from banking, I remembered this. I went to an interview for the flight attendant job. There were many young people there, and many of them were also changing careers. I practiced what to say before the interview. I talked about my skills and my past work, not just that I loved to travel. Because of this, I got the job!
I think this job is great for many reasons, but the free flights are not the best part. Most airline workers work very hard. There is a saying: ""No one is finished until everyone is finished."" It feels like a big family. Even if we don’t see each other all the time, we are still close.
When I am not working, I don’t have to take my work home. If I have a difficult passenger, which is rare, I know the flight will end soon, and I will probably never see them again!"
119,B1,"At the summer camp where I work, I really enjoy seeing the children do things they thought they could not do. Most of the children can swim and play table tennis before they come here, but rock climbing is new for many of them. Some children feel nervous, but after some encouragement, they try, and they all reach the top in the end. This makes them feel very happy.
At the start of the week, some children miss their homes. It is not the youngest ones who feel this way; it is usually the ten- to thirteen-year-olds. We do not let them use their mobile phones all the time. We tell them they can call home after lunch. When they ask again after dinner, we say it is too late to call now and they can do it tomorrow. Most children feel better in a couple of days, and at the end of the week, they come to us and thank us because they had a great time.
Sometimes, it is not just the children who feel lonely. We also have parents who call a lot to ask how their child is doing, which is not needed. Often, their child is busy playing games or doing other activities, so we tell the parents to call back later.
We also see some children who come dressed in expensive new clothes. These children often argue when we ask them to change into something more suitable, but soon they understand why we ask them to do this."
120,B1,"'Rock the Planet is a musical show where actors also need to be good musicians. It opened in London last year after being in the USA for five years. In the USA, it won the title of ‘Best Musical’ four times! Doing the show with all British actors was not easy. In the UK, there are rules about how many shows young actors can do each week. In the USA, they can do more shows. Because of this, they needed twice as many actors in the UK. Luckily, the director found many talented actors in the UK, and they just won their first ‘Best Musical’ award.
The theatre in London is bigger than the one in the USA, and it has been full every night. Many people want to hear the songs that became popular in America. I met Jamie, who is 11 years old and one of the actors in the show. He said, ‘It’s great that I get paid to play, especially with a beautiful Gibson guitar.’ He told me that the young actors are very busy. ‘We have normal school lessons every day at the theatre. The teacher is great, but I miss my old school friends,’ he said.
I asked Jamie what his friends think of the show. He said, ‘My whole class came! The theatre gives special ticket prices for schools. They loved it, and that made me feel really confident. My parents come when they can, but it’s expensive for them.’ When I told Jamie I also play guitar, he found a spare one and invited me to play with him and the other young actors. We played a song called Days, which I didn’t know. Jamie helped me learn it, and I was happy when I got it right. I was impressed by Jamie’s skills and wished I could play like him. I was just trying to keep up and was glad the director wasn’t there to hear my mistakes!
The young actors were already musicians, and some played several instruments, but none had played in a band before. They found it easy to play together. Jamie said the hard part was looking natural when they first performed. They were so focused that they forgot to smile! The show will be in London for another year, and it is worth seeing.'"
