1,"A while ago, a website talked about the dangers of telling people where you are online. When you say, ""I am here,"" you are also telling many people, some of whom you may not want to meet. This shows that sharing everything online can have bad sides. The internet gives us many chances to share our lives, and we might think it is fun. But sometimes, we can lose control and feel lost.

In the past, some people explored the internet and learned about its dangers. They faced problems like losing jobs and friends before social media was popular. These early internet users, called bloggers, have stories that can help us. 

In January 1994, a 19-year-old student named Justin Hall started sharing his life online. The internet was new and mostly used by students and scientists. Hall wanted to share his experiences. He created a blog where he wrote about everything. Many people read his blog because he was brave and wrote about many topics. 

One day, Hall's homepage changed to a sad video. He had fallen in love, but when he wrote about it, his partner said he had to choose between the blog and the relationship. Hall chose love, but he felt that sharing his life online made people not trust him. 

In 2002, a woman named Heather Armstrong had a blog called Dooce. She wrote about her job, but one day, a coworker shared her blog with their bosses. This caused her to lose her job. People often say things online that they would not say in real life. But what we do online can affect our real lives.

Armstrong's story had a happy ending. After some time, she got married and started blogging again about her family. Now, she is a popular ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing helps her family. She learned that while the internet lets us say anything, we should be careful about what we share."
2,"A while ago, some scientists warned people about a low-budget movie called What the Bleep Do We Know? This movie mixes real facts and stories to show that we do not understand a lot about our universe. Some scientists thought the movie was very bad and even dangerous. 

At first, I did not understand why the movie was so important. Some scientists talked about new discoveries that show the universe is very strange. But then the movie talked about how water can change because of thoughts. I heard that a Japanese researcher showed that water can look different based on how people feel. The movie showed nice pictures of ice crystals that looked good when people were happy and looked bad when people were sad. Many people liked these pictures, but scientists were not impressed. They wanted real proof, not just pretty pictures.

The movie's ideas were not strange enough. Scientists have found that water molecules have energy that comes from nowhere. This energy is connected to a force that makes the universe grow. The proof comes from many years of research in labs around the world. 

Scientists have discovered that the universe is made of unknown matter and is pushed by a mysterious force called ""dark energy."" Other discoveries are also amazing. Scientists found that our brains take about half a second to understand what is happening around us. They also think they found where modern humans began and how they spread around the world. Some scientists believe there is a link between life on Earth and the design of the universe.

Science is not finished. In fact, we know less than we thought. Many things in nature are still a mystery. Some scientists are trying to create a Theory of Everything, which would explain all the forces and particles in the universe. But many of us think the universe is best described with one word: incredible."
3,"Writing novels is hard for me, but writing short stories is fun. Writing a novel is like planting a big forest. Writing a short story is like planting a small garden. Both are important to me. 

When I write a novel, I focus only on that. When I finish a novel, I want to write short stories. When I finish short stories, I want to write a novel again. I started writing short stories in 1984 after writing two short novels in 1975. At first, it was difficult, but I enjoyed it. 

One of my first short stories is called ""Breaking Waves."" It is in my first book of short stories, ""Tales from Abroad."" I like writing short stories because they do not take a long time to finish. It usually takes me about a week to write one. Writing a novel can take a year or two, and it can feel very long. 

Short stories can come from small ideas, like a word or a picture. Writing them is like playing jazz music; the story goes where it wants. If a short story does not work out, it is okay. Not every story has to be perfect. Even famous writers have stories that are not great. 

I learn from my mistakes in short stories and use that to help me write novels. Short stories help me try new things. They are like small memories I have shared with my readers. Writing short stories makes me happy."
4,"Science is a way to learn about the world. It helps us understand many things, like tiny atoms and big galaxies. Science can make our lives better, but it can also create problems. Scientists study many ideas, and sometimes they disagree. New ideas can change what we think about the world.

In the past, scientists like Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein helped us understand more about how things work. They built on the ideas of others. Science is always changing. Sometimes, scientists find new things that surprise us, like radioactivity and black holes.

Science is important for everyone. It helps us understand nature, but it can also change it. We need to pay attention to science because it affects our lives and the future of our planet. Everyone should try to learn about science, so we can make good choices for ourselves and our children."
5,"From around 2015, big book companies started to say that sales of ebooks were not growing anymore. Some even said sales were going down. This made people wonder if ebooks would be important in the future. One publishing worker said that the excitement about ebooks made companies invest too much money. He said his company lost faith in the power of printed books. 

Even though many people think ebooks and printed books can exist together, some still ask if ebooks will replace printed books. This question makes people think and talk a lot. Why do we think this way? Why do we see ebooks and printed books as a fight? The answers show us how we feel about new things and changes in our lives.

In my research, I found that people often think one type of media will replace another when new technology comes out. For example, when television was invented, many people thought radio would disappear. But radio found new ways to be used, like in cars and factories. The idea that books might disappear is not new. In 1894, some people thought that phonographs would replace books with audiobooks.

Many times, people have said that new things like movies, radio, and smartphones would end printed books. Some people worried that this would be bad for culture. Others thought ebooks would be much better. The idea that books might disappear often comes up when new technology is introduced. This shows our hopes and fears about change.

We feel strong connections to things like books and computers because they are part of our lives. Studies show that we can even name our cars or get upset when our laptops do not work. When new technology, like e-readers, comes out, it changes our relationship with things we love. We often miss the old things we used to have. This is why some people still want old products and technologies.

For example, when the printing press was invented in the 15th century, people wanted to find old manuscripts. When movies changed from silent to sound in the 1920s, people missed silent films. The same thing happened when photography changed from film to digital and from vinyl records to CDs. E-readers made people appreciate the feel and smell of printed books more.

This should make people feel better about printed books not disappearing. But the idea that something might go away will always be interesting. It shows both the power of technology and our fear of change. One way we understand change is by telling stories about it, like stories of loss. These stories are easy to remember and share. The idea that books might die reflects our excitement for the future and our fear of losing things we love."
6,"Text: 

Every weekday morning for a year and a half, I woke up at 5:30. I brushed my teeth, made coffee, and wrote about how great thinkers from the last 400 years worked. I wanted to show how they found time to be creative and productive. I wrote about their daily lives, like when they slept, ate, and worked. I hoped to show their personalities and habits.

A famous French writer, Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, said, ""Tell me what you eat, and I shall tell you what you are."" I say, ""Tell me what time you eat and if you take a nap."" This book is about how people create, not just what they create. It is also personal. The writer John Cheever said that you show something about yourself when you write. 

I have questions in this book that I think about in my life: How can you do creative work and also earn money? Is it better to work on one project or a little bit each day? When there is not enough time, do you give up things like sleep or a clean house? Or can you learn to do more in less time? 

I do not have all the answers, but I share how many successful people faced these same problems. I wanted to show how big ideas become small daily actions and how habits affect work. The book is called Daily Rituals, but it is really about people’s routines. Routines can seem boring, but they can help us use our time and energy better.

The psychologist William James said we should put part of our life on autopilot. Good habits can help us focus on important things. Ironically, he was a procrastinator and could not keep a regular schedule. 

This book started because of my own procrastination. One Sunday, I was at my job, trying to write a story. Instead of working, I cleaned my desk and made coffee. I am a morning person and work best in the morning. That afternoon, I looked online for other writers’ schedules. I found many interesting stories. I thought someone should collect these stories, so I started a blog called Daily Routines. 

In the blog, I shared people’s routines from biographies and articles. For this book, I gathered more information and tried to keep it interesting. I let the people I wrote about share their own words from letters and interviews. I also used summaries from other sources. 

This book would not be possible without the work of many biographers and journalists. I have listed all my sources in the Notes section for more reading."
7,"Howard wanted to be a palaeontologist when he was six years old. One day, he found a fossil called an ammonite on the beach. He studied hard in school and university to learn more about fossils. 

After finishing his studies, Howard wanted a job. He felt good about his skills, but he knew it could be hard to find a job in science. When a job opened at Tavistock College in London, he applied for it, but he did not expect to get it.

On the day of his interview, the professor who was supposed to help him had a bad morning. He got into an accident and could not come to the interview. Another professor, who did not like the first one, took his place. This professor helped Howard get the job. Howard was surprised but happy to have the job, even if it was not how he expected.

Howard liked his new job. He could plan his work and study fossils. But sometimes, things went wrong in his personal life. One day, someone stole his briefcase with his lecture notes. He was very upset and went back to the college. He called to postpone his lecture and reported the theft.

While having coffee, Howard met a visitor from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. He learned about a new collection of fossils that needed to be studied. This was a big opportunity for him. Because of the theft, he changed his plans. He decided not to go to a conference in Stockholm and instead wanted to visit the museum in Nairobi to study the fossils."
8,"Charles Spence eats many different foods. He even has ice cream made from bee larvae at home. It looks strange, but it tastes a little like nuts and flowers. Spence is a professor at Oxford University in the UK. He studies how our senses work together to help us taste food. He wants to make eating bugs more normal. 

Spence's work helps big food companies and restaurants. He studies how we enjoy food. For example, who we eat with, how food looks, and even the sounds around us can change how food tastes. In his book, The Perfect Meal, he shares interesting facts about eating. Did you know that the first person to order food in a restaurant usually enjoys their meal more? And when we eat with one other person, we eat about 35% more food. If we eat with three people, we eat 75% more!

Spence's lab is simple, not high-tech. He has soundproof rooms and old equipment. This helps him work with chefs who do not have much money for research. Many of his projects are funded by big food companies. Some people think that research funded by companies is not real science. But now, universities need to show that their work is useful, so this research is important.

Spence helps food companies reduce salt and sugar in their products. This is good for customers because it helps them stay healthy. Many companies do this slowly so that people do not notice the change. Spence says that when people know about the changes, they may not like the food as much.

Spence met famous chef Heston Blumenthal while working on a food project. They worked together to create a dish called ""Sound of the Sea."" Spence studies how sounds can change the taste of food. For example, high music can make food taste sweeter, while low music can make it taste bitter. Soon, an airline will play music that matches the food they serve.

At home, Spence has fun dinner parties. One time, they ate rabbit with the fur on the cutlery. Another time, they used colorful lights and sound machines to see how it changed their drinks. For Spence, home and food events are just like his lab."
9,"Our brains are very busy today. We get a lot of information, like facts, rumors, and chatter. We need to find what is important and what we can ignore. We also do more things ourselves now. Thirty years ago, travel agents helped us book flights, and salespeople helped us in stores. Now, we do these things by ourselves. 

We try to do many tasks at the same time, but this is not good for us. A scientist named Earl Miller says our brains are not good at multitasking. When we think we are doing many things at once, we are really just switching quickly from one task to another. This can make us less efficient. 

Multitasking can also make us feel stressed. It can increase stress hormones in our bodies, which can make it hard to think clearly. Our brains like new things, so it is easy to get distracted. This makes it hard to focus on one task. 

Research shows that trying to do many things at once can lower our intelligence. For example, if students do homework while watching TV, they do not remember the information well. It goes to the wrong part of the brain. Without distractions, they can remember better.

Making decisions while multitasking is also hard for our brains. Small decisions can take up a lot of mental energy, just like big decisions. This can lead to making bad choices later.

Many people find emails to be a big problem. We feel we must answer them, but it can be hard to do that and finish other tasks."
10,"In a zoo in Sweden, a chimpanzee named Santino broke concrete at night. He did this to throw pieces at visitors during the day. Some people wonder if he was being mean. In the US, female bats help other bats that are not their babies if those bats need help. Are they being kind? 

Fifty years ago, people did not think much about these questions. They believed animals just acted in certain ways, and scientists only looked at the results. They thought animals did not have feelings or thoughts like humans. But now, this idea is changing. Research on bats, chimps, rats, dolphins, and chickens shows that animals have feelings. This has led to new books about animal emotions, like ""Wild Justice"" by Mark Bekoff and ""Do Fish Feel Pain?"" by Victoria Braithwaite. 

This new research raises a big question: Do animals have thoughts like humans? Another question is about conscience, which is a sense of right and wrong. In an experiment with cows, those that opened a locked gate for food seemed happier than those that had help. If cows enjoy solving problems, what does this mean for eating beef? 

Dr. Jonathan Balcombe, who wrote ""Second Nature,"" believes we should stop eating meat. He thinks this is a big change in how we think about ethics. Aubrey Manning, a professor, believes we should think more about how animals think. He says animals might have simpler thoughts than humans. Professor Euan MacPhail thinks we should not put human feelings on animals. 

These experts may never agree because the main issue is not just science or morals, but philosophy. It is hard to define what consciousness is. Can we really know what it is like to be a bat? 

Balcombe did an important experiment that suggests starlings, a type of bird, can feel sad. In a study, some starlings lived in nice cages, while others lived in small, empty cages. Both groups learned to eat tasty worms. But when only bad worms were offered, only the starlings in nice cages would eat. Balcombe thinks the starlings in bad cages felt negative about life. 

Balcombe, who supports animal rights, believes our view of animals will change like how we now see racism. He says we cannot support animal rights while eating meat. If he were the only one with this view, it might be easy to ignore him. But Professor Aubrey Manning agrees with him. He has written a book about animal behavior. He says we are starting to think differently about animals again. This is a complicated topic, and people have strong opinions about it."
11,"Critical thinking is a way to understand what we read or hear better. Adrian West, a researcher, says that arguing can help us find the truth. Technology helps us store and process information, but it can also make it hard to think deeply about problems. West mentions that we see a lot of poor thinking and opinions that can confuse us. More information does not always mean we make better decisions. 

Reading books has become less common, and this may hurt our critical thinking skills. Patricia Greenfield, a psychology professor, believes that focusing more on videos and fast media makes it harder to think about one thing deeply. We do not yet know exactly how technology affects our thinking. 

Technology can be both good and bad. For example, some video games can help us think better, while reading online can improve our analysis skills. Greenfield says that reading helps our imagination and critical thinking more than visual media like video games and TV. However, some visual media can help us process information quickly. 

Many young people may not reach their full potential because they do not spend enough time thinking deeply. How we see technology affects how we think critically. James Paul Gee, an expert on video games, says that video games can be good for learning. They can help children become smarter and improve their reasoning skills. Games like Sim City and Civilization teach decision-making and thinking skills in fun ways. 

In today’s world, as reading and math scores go down, we need to understand how technology affects our thinking."
12,"Matthew Crawford is a motorcycle mechanic. He used to work in an office but did not like it. He writes about how we should live our lives. His first book talks about the good things about working with your hands. His latest book is about how to deal with modern life. 

One day, while shopping, he saw ads on a credit card machine while he was entering his pin number. He realized that it is hard to avoid things that take our attention. We often do not choose what to think about because of these distractions. It is harder to think or remember conversations. People do not want to talk to strangers anymore because they are tired of being interrupted.

Crawford says we see the world through things like video games and apps. These things show us what we want, but they can take over our lives. Many people complain about emails at work but still check emails in their free time. Studies show that just seeing a phone can make it hard to focus. 

Crawford believes that technology makes us more self-focused. We have many choices, which makes it hard to control ourselves. We often prefer to text instead of talking to friends. By only interacting with screens, we might lose important connections with real people. 

He gives an example of a gym. In the past, there was one music player for everyone. Now, people listen to their own music with earbuds. The gym used to be a place to meet others, but now it feels different. 

Crawford has two ideas to help. First, we need to reduce noise and distractions in public places. Second, he thinks we should do activities that help us connect with the real world, like cooking or playing sports. These activities help us focus on real things and not just on screens. 

He says that it is important to use our judgment and find ways to pay attention. This can help us feel better and focus on what is important."
13,"Text: 

""What do you do for work?"" This is a common question. Many people answer it with their job. But for me, as a philosopher, it is not so easy. Saying I am a philosopher can sound like I think I am better than others. I study and teach philosophy, but calling myself a philosopher feels strange. 

People think philosophers are special because they think deeply about life. A famous philosopher named Aristotle said that thinking about life is very good. Many people today do not agree, but philosophy is still seen as important. Another philosopher, Socrates, said that a life without thinking is not worth living. This means that we should think about our lives and choices. 

You do not need to read many books or be very smart to think about your life. It just means looking closely at your daily experiences. You do not have to be away from society to think about it. In fact, thinking about life can help us make better choices. 

However, many philosophers work in universities and do not talk to regular people. This makes philosophy seem far away from real life. Philosophers often write for other experts, and this can make their ideas hard to understand. 

I sometimes call myself an ""ethicist"" because I study ethics, which is about what is right and wrong. Recently, I feel this title does not show all my work. Ethics is often seen as rules and laws, but it is also about understanding social issues. 

An ethicist looks at whether something is right or wrong. For example, we might discuss if downloading movies illegally is wrong (it is). We can also talk about our ideas about responsibility and art. Philosophy helps us think more about our actions and beliefs. Sometimes we find out we already know something, and other times we learn that our beliefs are hard to explain. By thinking about these ideas, we can help everyone."
14,"Food is important to many people, like food lovers, chefs, and those who enjoy eating. People often think about food and how it makes us happy. In the past, when philosophers talked about food, they usually meant something else, like learning or knowledge. Sometimes, they seemed to talk about food, but they were really discussing other ideas.

One famous philosopher, Epicurus, believed in seeking pleasure and avoiding pain. He talked about many things, but people now often connect his name with enjoying food and drink. Many restaurants and food shops use his name because they think it will attract customers.

Food is also social and cultural. The food we eat comes from history and is shared with our friends and family. Our communities help us grow and share food. We think about food more than other things, so it is a good topic to discuss.

When food is ready, critics write and talk about it. Some people wonder why food critics are important. One philosopher said that tasting food is not a special skill; critics are just better at describing what food tastes like. Most discussions about how we see things focus on sight, but we should also think about taste.

Another interesting point is how we think about the beauty of food. We often talk about art and music being beautiful, but we don’t usually say the same about food. Some philosophers believe that food should be included in discussions about beauty, but food is eaten and gone, unlike art that stays.

There are also many questions about what we should eat. Should we eat organic food, free-range meat, or vegetarian meals? Our choices show our beliefs about what is right or wrong. Philosophers like to ask why we make these choices.

Cooking at home is different from cooking in restaurants. When we cook at home, we share food with friends and family. But chefs in restaurants have to follow rules for their job. Their kitchens are not open to everyone, and they work with colleagues, not friends.

A recent essay called ""Diplomacy of the Dish"" talks about how food can help people from different cultures connect. We can learn to enjoy other people's food and build friendships by eating together. The essay includes many interesting stories that make food philosophy fun to read about."
15,"Rob Daviau is a game designer from the US. He makes special board games called ""legacy"" games. When he was a child, he thought regular board games were not fun or challenging anymore. He wanted to make board games better. He asked, ""Can board games have a story? Can choices in one game affect the next game?"" 

He changed a classic game called Risk and made a new version called Risk Legacy. In this game, choices made by players can change the game forever. Players might have to tear up cards or change the game board. The game is played over several sessions, and players can remember past actions. Daviau said, ""You can point to the board and say: 'You did this!'""

He also worked on a legacy version of a popular game called Pandemic, where players work together to cure diseases. His next game was called SeaFall. Pandemic Legacy was very popular, but SeaFall was a big test because it was a new game. In SeaFall, players are sailors exploring a new world.

Designers of legacy games must think about all the choices players can make. They need to test the games to see how they work. Jaime Barriga was a tester for SeaFall. He said it takes a lot of time to make the game right. Sometimes the game works well at first, but later it can break, and they have to fix it.

At first, Daviau did not think many people would like legacy games. He thought only a few people would enjoy them. But many players, like Russell Chapman, loved the idea. He said it was a big step forward in game design. Players enjoy learning new things in legacy games.

Another fan, Ben Hogg, said that even if players worry about changing the game, they still enjoy the adventure. He compared it to watching a new movie instead of the same one again. Legacy games tell stories like video games and popular TV shows.

Daviau wanted to be a TV writer but ended up in game design. He still loves telling stories. Matt Leacock, the creator of Pandemic, said making legacy games is like writing a book. You need to know how it starts and how it ends, but you also need to plan the story well.

Daviau is happy with his idea but wants to see how others use it. He thinks players will soon want something new. Colby Dauch, who works for the company that published SeaFall, believes the legacy format is a big change in how people think about board games."
16,"One night, an octopus named Inky escaped from his tank at the National Aquarium in New Zealand. He crawled across the floor and went into a small drain that led to the Pacific Ocean. This story was fun and many people shared it online. 

People like to think that animals are like us. Octopuses are very smart. They can open jars, recognize faces, and even play. Dr. Frans de Waal studies animals like gorillas and chimpanzees. He believes that we often do not see how smart animals are. He calls this ""anthropodenial."" 

Dr. de Waal says that animals can think about the past and future, feel empathy, and understand what others want. This means animals are smarter than we think. In the past, people believed animals were smart enough to be put on trial for crimes. Charles Darwin, a famous scientist, said that humans and animals are different, but not in kind, just in degree.

In the 20th century, many people thought animals were just machines that react to things. This idea made people forget that animals have feelings and thoughts. But now, Dr. de Waal thinks we are starting to understand that animals can think like humans, even if they think differently.

He believes that tests for animal intelligence should match what animals can do. For example, squirrels are good at hiding nuts, even if they are not good at human memory games. In her book, Sy Montgomery talks about octopuses and how they might think humans are not smart because we cannot change our skin color like they can.

Dr. de Waal is not sure if Inky really knew how to escape to the ocean. But he knows that stories like Inky's help people see how smart animals can be. He once did a test with monkeys to see if they feel envy. When some monkeys got cucumbers and others got grapes, the ones with cucumbers got very upset. This study was published, but a video of the monkeys made more people believe it.

This shows how interesting and complex animal minds can be."
17,"Text: 

Robots are becoming very important in our world. They are not just in stories anymore; they are in factories and other places. Many people think that robots will do most of the work that humans do in the next 50 years. But many also believe their jobs will stay the same. This is not true. Robots will change many jobs soon.

For example, a company in Australia made a robot called Hadrian X. This robot can lay 1,000 bricks in one hour. Two human workers would take a whole day to do this. Another robot, Tally, helps in supermarkets. It checks if the shelves have enough products and if they are priced correctly.

Some people think robots will create new jobs for skilled workers, like technicians. But others worry that we need to keep human skills in jobs. Dr. Jing Bing Zhang studies how robots will change work. He says that in two years, many robots will be smarter and work well with humans. In three years, many big companies will have a chief robotics officer. In five years, salaries in the robotics field will go up, but there will still be many jobs that need skilled workers.

Dr. Zhang says that lower-skilled workers will be affected by robots. He believes they should learn new skills instead of waiting for the government to help them. 

New robots will also be made for homes. These robots will be able to talk and interact with us. This is a big chance for companies, but it also brings challenges. We need new rules to keep people safe and protect their privacy.

With many jobs at risk, education is very important. Countries need more students in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) to be ready for the future."

19,"Alfred Brendel is a famous pianist. He played classical music for over sixty years. He was very smart and serious about music. He played many pieces and recorded them, but he did not teach many students. People who knew him saw that he could be fun, but he did not show this during his concerts. He worked hard, traveling and performing all the time.

A few years ago, a young boy named Kit Armstrong came to one of Brendel’s concerts. Kit asked Brendel for piano lessons. At first, Brendel did not think this was a good idea. He had very few students and did not want to start teaching now. He remembered a famous pianist who said, “You don’t ask a mountain guide to teach a child how to walk.” But when Brendel heard Kit play, he changed his mind. Kit was about 14 years old and played very well from memory. He even gave Brendel a CD of his performance, which was beautiful. Brendel thought, “I need to make time for him.”

Now, Kit is 19 years old. He is always busy learning new things, like languages, math, computer coding, and playing tennis. His mother is always with him. Kit also writes music. Brendel thinks this is important because it helps Kit understand music better. He noticed that Kit has a great memory and can read music very well. Kit listens carefully to his own playing and understands Brendel’s lessons.

Brendel is careful not to raise expectations for Kit. He does not like when newspapers call Kit the best pianist of the 21st century. He thinks this can be harmful. Young musicians can play some things very well, but they still need time to learn other things.

Now, at 80 years old, Brendel is more relaxed. He says that when he was young, he did not want to be famous quickly. He wanted to achieve certain goals by the time he was 50. When he turned 50, he felt he had done most of those things, but he still wanted to do more. Even though he does not play as much now, he still thinks about music and enjoys his new life."
20,"When I was a child, I thought gardens were beautiful places. My grandad’s garden was by a river. It went down gently to the water. You could not touch the river, but you could hear the water and the birds in the trees. I thought all gardens were like this – a nice place to relax. 

Grandad’s garden was simple. He did not have a big greenhouse like some neighbors. Their greenhouses were made from old windows and plastic. At home, my dad was quiet. He was not serious all the time. He liked to say funny things. One of his favorite phrases was, “It’s immaterial to me.” He could have just said, “I don’t mind,” but he liked the big word. 

My dad left school without any special papers and became a plumber. He did not love plumbing; it was just a job. He was not very ambitious, but once he and my mom thought about moving to Canada. They never did. 

My dad was good at fixing things at home. He could build bookshelves and cupboards very well. My parents only moved to a new house once. But my mom liked to change the furniture a lot. Just when you got used to one chair, a new one would appear. The biggest change was when a piano came into the house. I wanted to like it, but it made me nervous. I liked the two shiny candlesticks on it, but my mom said they were too fancy, and they disappeared when I was at school. I never got to play the piano, but my sister had lessons. When I asked my mom why I couldn’t play, she said, “You’d never have practiced.”

I liked the river best when I could choose between the moors, woods, or river. I could imagine many things by the river. I would take a fishing net and wear old sandals with the front cut out for my toes. I walked along the riverbank looking for a good place to take off my sandals. I would leave them with my picnic and look for fish in the water. After trying to keep the fish alive in the yard, I put them back in the river.

I wanted to leave school quickly, but it seemed hard. One day, my dad said, “There is a job for an apprentice gardener in the Parks Department. I thought you might like it.” For a moment, he surprised me. He might have wanted me to be a carpenter, but I think he hoped I would do well as a gardener. Even if he did not like gardening, he saw how much I loved it."
21,"Lawrence MacEwen is on his island, the Isle of Muck, in Scotland. I am with him. The strong wind makes it feel like we could be blown away. But Lawrence is calm. He has a sheepdog named Tie. The wind is loud, but Lawrence feels at home on his island.

Lawrence shows me around. He points to another island called Eigg. He says the island next to it is Rum, and it gets a lot of rain. I see dark clouds over Rum. He also mentions another island called Soay. 

Suddenly, Lawrence says he needs to move his sheep. We walk down the hill. He tells me that the Isle of Muck is three kilometers long and one and a half kilometers wide. The geese here eat a lot of grass. The MacEwen family has lived on this island for 3000 years. 

While herding the sheep, Tie the dog is not doing a good job. Lawrence tells him to go to the right, but Tie goes straight through the sheep. Lawrence is disappointed. 

The Isle of Muck is mostly run by the MacEwen family. Lawrence and his wife, Jenny, run the farm. Their son Colin takes care of the island cottages, and their daughter Mary runs the hotel with her husband, Toby. Mary loves that her two boys can play outside and sail in the summer. 

Life on the island is not always easy. There is electricity only sometimes. One night, I wait for the lights to come on. The next morning, I see Mary making breakfast with a flashlight. There is also no mobile phone service. Mary tells me that some people go to the hill to use their phones, but most just put them away. 

Today, a boat brings groceries and three musicians. They play music in the tearoom, and everyone enjoys it. That night, by the fire, Lawrence tells me how he met Jenny. Her father bought a farm on Soay without seeing it. Jenny had to manage it, but she only knew how to type.

I go to bed with the sound of rain. I eat well because most of the food comes from the island. Mary sends me to get fresh fish from a fisherman named Sandy. I bring it back to Mary, and by 7 pm, we have a delicious dinner.

The next morning, I have to take a ferry to another island. Many ferries have been canceled because of bad weather. If my ferry does not come, I will stay on Muck for two more days. Part of me wants that to happen."

The game design industry used to be for computer scientists and self-taught people. Many thought video games were just a hobby for young people. Now, the video game industry is taken seriously. It is not easy to get into this industry. Making video games, especially those based on movies, needs many team members and a lot of skill and hard work.

Jim Donelly, who works for an online games magazine, says it is hard to work in big companies. But the industry needs game designers. They need not just the big bosses but also people who design parts of the games. 

So, how can you start a career in this industry? Many companies want people with a degree in computer science, but Jim thinks you should just make games. You need to create something to get a job. Game design is not just a job; it is a way of life. 

Another expert, John Field, says it is not easy to do it alone. A good course in games can help you. Most game designers start as programmers or artists and then move up. They love all kinds of entertainment and art. They may have worked for a few years after school but know that games are what they want to do. They are not just fans; they are excited about the future of games.

Connections can also help you get ahead in the game industry. Many people think of video games as something only boys play, but now many families play together. Smartphones have many new games through apps and social media. John believes there is a lot of room for growth in games. They are fun and a great way to learn new things."

25,"Violet Hetherington was in a long line at the dock in Southampton. She was waiting to get on a ship called the Queen Caroline. Her friend Annie had told her to arrive late so she would not wait too long. But now, Violet was not happy. 

After some time, an announcement said there was a problem with the computers. The people waiting became upset. They had paid a lot of money for this trip, and they wanted to get on the ship. Violet felt like she made a mistake coming on this cruise. 

She looked for her phone in her bag but could not find it. This made her more worried. She needed her phone to call a taxi company to see if she left it in the taxi. She asked a couple behind her if she could use their phone. They said yes. Violet called her son Harry and left a message for him to ask their neighbor Kristina to check if her phone was at home. 

Finally, the line started to move, and Violet gave her travel documents to the worker. When she got inside the ship, it looked like a fancy hotel, but not a very nice one. There were shiny things everywhere, and the place was crowded with tired passengers. 

Violet took the elevator to the twelfth floor. When she got to her room, she was happy to see that it had a balcony, just like she wanted. She had worried about this, but now she felt relieved. She had paid a lot of money for this room to make sure she had a good view of the sea."
26,"John Maloof bought a box of old photo negatives at an auction. He wanted pictures for a book about Portage Park, a neighborhood in Chicago, USA. Instead, he found 30,000 photos by Vivian Maier, a street photographer. Maloof has collected many things from Maier's life, like her cameras, 2,000 rolls of film, 3,000 prints, and 100,000 negatives. He also has 8mm movies and audiotapes.

One morning, Maloof looked at all the things he found. He felt lucky. He said, ""When I bought this, I had no idea what it was."" Maloof is a flea market seller and could have sold everything to someone else.

Maloof and his friend Anthony Rydzon are learning about Maier's life. They talked to families who knew her when she worked as a nanny. Maier was born in 1926 in New York and spent part of her childhood in France. She came back to New York in 1951 and moved to Chicago in 1956 to work as a nanny. Maier was a private person and always had a camera. She wore big coats, wide hats, and sturdy shoes. 

Maren Baylaender, whose husband hired Maier, said, ""She always had her camera on her day off. We didn’t see her until late at night."" Maier liked movies and had strong opinions about them. She was not very social, but she walked the streets with her camera and talked to people. 

Rydzon said, ""She was a true artist and followed her dreams."" Maier's work is real art; she did not do it for money. She took pictures of women, children, old people, and the poor. Photography expert Larry Silverman said, ""Vivian has many interesting pictures."" He wonders if she created her own style or learned from other photographers.

Maloof has many negatives stored in fireproof cabinets. He did not care about photography until he found Maier's work. Inspired by her photos, he started taking pictures himself. He said, ""I realized the people and street scenes were more important than I thought."" Now, Maloof wants to share Vivian Maier's name and get her into history books."
27,"Eleanor Catton is a young writer from New Zealand. Her book, The Luminaries, is very successful. I talked to her in the UK when her book was popular. She was calm and had just come from Germany. The next day, she would go back to New Zealand.

Eleanor told me a funny story. Once, at passport control, an official asked her to prove she was a writer. She showed her book and the official asked, “What is it about?” This is a hard question for a writer. 

The Luminaries takes place in New Zealand in the 1860s. There are many crimes, and twelve men are trying to solve them. The story is very complicated. Eleanor wanted to write a murder mystery, but she found that the past made the story more interesting. Her book is over 800 pages long because she wanted to give a good story to each of the 20 main characters.

When I asked her how it feels to be successful at a young age, she said it feels nice. She feels that people in New Zealand share in her success. She also said it can be annoying when people think her book is not serious.

Eleanor wanted to write the book in a special way. Each part of the book is shorter than the one before. This makes the story go faster. She said she wanted to create patterns in the book. If readers notice them, that’s good, but it’s not necessary.

Even with its special structure, The Luminaries is still an exciting murder mystery. Eleanor did not plan the whole story before she wrote it. She liked to write herself into difficult situations and then find a way out. She wanted to make the book fun for readers.

Eleanor also loves TV dramas. She uses cliff-hangers and different points of view in her writing. I asked if she would like to write for TV. She said that could be cool.

Eleanor is very excited when she talks about writing and New Zealand. She notices that being in a different place changes her ideas. Many writers leave New Zealand to find new inspiration. But for now, New Zealand is still her home. I hope it helps her write many more books."
28,"Jonny Kinkead is a man who loves guitars. When he was a boy, he played with a guitar and made things in his dad's garage. For the last forty years, he has made guitars by hand. Jonny says, ""I love the guitar. It is amazing that two pieces of wood can make beautiful music.""

Jonny learned to play guitar when he was eleven years old. At sixteen, he wanted a bass guitar. Instead of saving money, he decided to make one himself. He studied how different shapes and types of wood make different sounds. He had made model boats and planes with his brothers, so he knew how to build things. His dad taught him how to use tools.

Jonny made his first bass guitar, but he did not think about making guitars as a job. He liked painting and sculpture too. After school, he studied architecture because he liked design. But halfway through, he left school. He realized that making guitars is like making art, but it is also useful because people can play them.

For ten years, Jonny cleaned windows to help pay his bills. At first, he sold his guitars for the cost of materials. As he became known as a good guitar maker, he could charge more money. Even now, he can only make about ten guitars a year, so he does not earn a lot.

In the beginning, Jonny went to music festivals to show his guitars. He wanted musicians to try them and tell their friends. He also had to learn how to price his guitars because he did not think about money much.

Jonny thinks it is easier for new guitar makers today. When he started, people thought only American guitars were good. But now, UK-made guitars are respected. He believes new makers should take classes to learn, but they should also try making things on their own. Jonny says, ""If you make mistakes, you learn more."""
29,"When people talk in English, they often start by talking about the weather. A famous writer, Dr. Johnson, said that when two English people meet, they first talk about the weather. This is still true today. Many people wonder why English people talk about the weather so much. They think it is because English weather is interesting. 

An American writer, Bill Bryson, says that English weather is not very exciting. He points out that in England, there are no big storms like tornadoes or hurricanes. But another writer, Jeremy Paxman, disagrees. He thinks English weather is interesting because it is always changing. 

I believe both writers miss the real reason why English people talk about the weather. When they say things like, “Nice day, isn’t it?” or “Ooh, isn’t it cold?” they are not really asking about the weather. These phrases are just ways to start a conversation or fill a pause. 

Talking about the weather helps English people connect with each other. There are three main times when they talk about the weather: as a greeting, to start a conversation, or when there is a quiet moment. This is why it seems like English people talk about the weather all the time. They might start with a weather greeting, then talk a little more about the weather, and return to it if the conversation stops. This is why many people think English people are obsessed with the weather."
30,"Alice Leader was in front of Hadrian’s Wall in Britain. She was with her class of 12- and 13-year-olds. She wanted to tell them how amazing it was that the Romans built a wall that is 120 km long and 5 meters high about 1900 years ago. The students chose this trip instead of going to Spain, Greece, or France. They wanted to know why the wall was built, but Alice felt she did not have good answers.

Alice could not find a good book about life at the Wall in Roman times, so she decided to write one herself. She stopped teaching after 31 years and became a writer in 2001. She felt nervous but excited about this new job. Alice said, “Teaching is like acting. It is hard work. Writing is fun, but it is not so tiring.” Her old teaching friends are jealous because she still talks to children through her stories.

Alice wants her books to be different from many other books for kids today. Many books are about sad things or are just fantasy, like Harry Potter. Her books are not like that. She always taught English and History together. She loves to see when a child goes from being bored to being interested. “I like it when children are bored because then I have to make them interested,” she said.

Alice started writing because she felt she had time when her two sons were leaving home. Her head teacher suggested she take a creative writing course. At first, Alice did not want to go. But she had to send a story to the teachers to get into the course. She quickly wrote a story about a Roman couple and their baby. After three hours, she had 30 pages and sent it in. She got accepted right away.

During the course, other students liked her story and told her to publish it. Alice asked her school head teacher for a year off to write her first book. Her husband, Zachary Leader, helps her with editing. He changes her sentences and suggests new words. Alice likes to add more scenes to her stories. She thinks they work well together."
31,"To raise money for charity, a newspaper and a TV company asked two brothers, Jonny and Alistair Brownlee, to race each other. Jonny is older and a champion triathlete. They raced in the Yorkshire Dales in northern England. Jonny drove a car on the road, and Alistair rode a mountain bike across the countryside.

“I’m excited!” said Jonny at the start line. “I have never done this before. The views are beautiful, and I will be warm in the car.” Alistair was ready too, wearing warm cycling clothes. He said, “I have seen Jonny drive, so I am not sure he will win. I might stop for tea!”

The race started at Semerwater lake and finished at Fleet Moss, which is very high up. Jonny’s car could go fast, but Alistair had to climb a steep hill on his bike. They quickly started the race. Alistair rode away on his bike, and Jonny drove off in his car.

Jonny’s car faced a problem right away. A big tractor was in the road. “Welcome to Yorkshire,” he said to the cameraman. “If Alistair wins, it’s because of this farmer!” After the tractor, Jonny drove on. Alistair was having a hard time. He had to get off his bike and carry it up the hill. Sheep watched him as he walked with his bike.

Finally, Alistair reached the top of the hill. The sun came out, and he started to ride fast. In the car, Jonny had to go slowly through narrow roads and small villages. He was trying to get to the finish line quickly.

Neither brother knew who was winning. Jonny drove fast to the finish line, and Alistair rode hard from the other side. When Alistair reached the finish, he asked the crowd, “Is he here?” They said no. He raised his arms and shouted, “Yes!”

A few minutes later, Jonny arrived in his car. “Well done,” he said to Alistair, but he looked sad. “I’m upset.”"
32,"Text: 

When you play on Centre Court at Wimbledon, it is very quiet. You bounce the ball on the soft grass. You throw it up to serve and hit it. You can only hear your own shots. The quiet is good for my game. I try to focus only on the match and the point I am playing. 

When a point ends, the silence breaks. People clap and cheer. I hear them, but it feels far away. I do not think about the fifteen thousand people watching me. I do not think about the millions watching on TV. I am playing Roger Federer in the 2008 Wimbledon final. This is the biggest match of my life. 

I always wanted to play at Wimbledon. My uncle Toni, my coach, told me it is the biggest tournament. When I was 14, I dreamed of playing there and winning. Before 2008, I played Federer and lost two times. In 2006, I was happy just to be there. But in 2007, I was very sad. I knew I could have played better. I cried for half an hour after that match. Losing hurts, especially when you have a chance to win.

Toni usually does not comfort me, but that time he said it was okay to cry. He told me there would be more chances to play at Wimbledon. I thought this was my last chance. I know that a professional athlete's career is short, and I want to make the most of it. 

But Toni was right. I had another chance in 2008, just one year later. I felt ready. The night before the final, I had dinner with my family and friends. We did not talk about the match because I was already thinking about it in my mind. I wanted to keep that space for myself until the match started."
33,"In April 1957, a young English woman named Jane Goodall came to Africa. She wrote home and said, ""I am living in the Africa I have always wanted."" Jane spent most of her life in Africa. She worked as a journalist, scientist, and activist. She became famous for her work with chimpanzees. 

In 1963, the National Geographic Society helped make Jane Goodall well-known by sharing her research in articles and TV shows. She also wrote many books, including children's books and a popular book called ""In the Shadow of Man."" This book has been translated into 47 languages and is still available today. 

Jane Goodall is one of the most famous female scientists of the 20th century. Many stories have been told about her life, but they often focus on her adventures and not her real achievements. Jane Goodall is important because she helped us understand how chimpanzees live and feel. 

Before her work, people thought chimpanzees were very dangerous and did not know much about them. Jane discovered that chimpanzees eat meat and use tools. She showed that chimpanzees have feelings like humans and live in social groups similar to ours. 

Her book, ""The Chimpanzees of Gombe,"" is very important for studying chimpanzees. Jane Goodall's research changed how we study animals and how we think about ourselves as humans. 

Even as a child, Jane showed her love for animals. When she was five years old, she wanted to know how hens lay eggs. One day, she crawled into a henhouse and waited quietly for five hours to see. This curiosity was the start of her journey as a biologist."
34,"Shirley Ford is a voice actor. In our first talk, she uses many funny voices. She sounds like a cheeky boy, a tired mother, an old Scottish woman, and a fast-talking alien. People know her voices from children’s TV shows and cartoons. Shirley says, “I just did a voiceover about back injuries. I had to learn many medical words quickly.”

Shirley explains what it takes to do voiceovers. She says, “Many actors think they can do funny voices, and some can. But it is more than that. You must make the script come alive for people who cannot see you.” Many famous actors want to do voiceovers, but they often do not get the jobs because they are used to acting with their whole bodies.

After school, Shirley took a drama course. She wanted to be a regular actor. Sometimes, she sang jingles for TV ads. One day, the man at the recording studio asked her to try out for a rabbit in a cartoon. She thought it was silly but tried it for fun. She got the part! Shirley found out she could do voices and liked voiceover work.

In her second film, she played the main character and also her brother and mother. Many women voice small boys and girls because their voices are higher. It is hard to find child actors, so production companies often choose adult women instead. Shirley learned to make different sounds and collects new voices by watching children’s TV.

Shirley enjoys working on cartoons the most. She also does educational videos and ads. She says, “It is hard to sound excited about something I don’t care about, but I have learned to smile while talking. It makes my voice sound happy.” When she works on animation, it feels like a holiday because she enjoys working with other actors.

There is a lot of competition for voiceover jobs. A good showreel, which shows what an actor can do, is very important. Shirley says, “It is worth making a strong showreel. There are agencies that help voice actors with this.” She believes she is successful because she works hard and does not give up. 

For people who want to be voice actors, Shirley suggests going to special workshops. She loves voices and becomes the characters she plays. She says, “If I do an American voice in the studio, I might talk like that for hours or days. My children are used to me speaking in different voices.”"
35,"People often ask me how I became a cartoonist. This is normal because many kids dream of being a cartoonist, like they dream of being a race car driver. But most people stop dreaming and choose other jobs, like being a lawyer or making car parts. It seems silly to think you can make money by drawing funny pictures. But some people do it.

Not everyone becomes a cartoonist in the same way. Most cartoonists have wanted to do this for a long time. I loved comic strips as a kid and drew a lot in school. I studied graphic design in college. After I finished school, I showed my drawings to different companies. I was lucky to find a newspaper that wanted political cartoons. I drew some ideas, and they bought them. Soon, I was making enough money to live.

You don’t need much to be a cartoonist. You don’t need a college degree or a lot of money. You just need your brain, your hand, and something to draw with. But it is not easy. It is better to have other skills too. I have done political cartoons, comic strips, and comic books. I have also written and designed. I take any job because I can learn from all kinds of work. It helps to be smart and curious about the world.

Now, being a cartoonist is different. Many cartoonists used to work for newspapers and magazines, but that is changing. Today, cartoonists often have to sell their own work. If you are good at selling, you will do better. I have seen cartoonists who are not very creative but are good at business do better than very talented artists who do not know how to sell.

Some people worry too much about others stealing their ideas. They are scared to show their work. To protect your drawings, you can write a small ‘c’ for ‘copyright’ and put your name and the date next to it. But really, it is more likely that no one will care about your work. If someone does take your cartoon and it becomes popular, it can be a great opportunity!"
36,"Twenty years ago, I was moving to a new house and cleaning out my things. I decided to throw away an electric guitar that my dad gave me for my 16th birthday. It was a nice black guitar from Japan. I usually don’t like to throw things away, so I felt bad about it. I took the guitar to the dump. Just as I was going to put it in the trash, a young man came up to me. He looked confused and asked, “You’re not going to throw that away, are you?” I said yes, but I started to feel sad. He asked if he could have it, and I said yes. We went our separate ways.

After that day, I felt very sad about giving away my guitar. A few months ago, I got an email that changed everything. I remembered a story about a man who lost his wedding ring in the ocean. Ten years later, he found it in a fish he was eating. That’s how I felt when I opened the email. It was from a man named Keith Rushton, who fixes and sells guitars. He said, “I have your electric guitar.” 

The guitar had been sold many times since I gave it away. Keith found my name on a label on the back of the guitar. He used my name to find me online. He contacted me through the newspaper I work for and offered to sell it back to me. I was so happy! I would have given him anything for it, but his price was fair. I remembered how my dad liked to put name labels on my things, even my guitar. My parents wanted me to learn classical guitar because it was popular in the 1970s. I loved the sound of it, but I didn’t get better at it. So, I switched to the electric guitar, which was easier to play.

When I opened the box that Keith sent me, I remembered my birthday in 1978 when my parents gave me the guitar. It felt smooth and smaller than I remembered. I sat down to play, but then I stood up and put a strap on my shoulder because that is how you play an electric guitar. My fingers remembered where to go. I couldn’t draw the chords, but my hands knew what to do. My fingers felt a little pain from pressing the strings. 

The electric guitar is not usually played alone. Now that I am learning it again, I think I should start a band. My son is learning the saxophone, so maybe we can play together. Or maybe I can find other people my age who feel like I do. We could call ourselves “The Regainers!”"
37,"Text: 

Many people are talking about sleep now. I wrote a book called Insomniac about people who cannot sleep. I wanted to tell everyone that not getting enough sleep is bad for our minds and bodies. People who have trouble sleeping know how important sleep is. It is good that people are paying more attention to sleep. 

But what about dreams? I do not hear much about dreams. When you wake up early, you lose the last hour or two of sleep. This lost sleep is mostly REM sleep, which is when we dream a lot. Our best and most memorable dreams happen in REM sleep, just before we wake up. A person who lives 90 years will spend about six or seven years dreaming in REM sleep.

When scientists take away REM sleep from people, they dream more the next night. This shows that dreams are important. In 1953, scientists found REM sleep. Many people thought that dreams could help us understand our minds, but later studies showed it is more complicated. Now, scientists study dreams more for their physical reasons than for their psychological reasons.

Robert Stickgold, a sleep scientist, says that there is not much agreement among dream researchers. Dreams are important. A study showed that actors, writers, and directors remember and use their dreams better than other people. This means that creative people have a special connection to their dreams. 

But do only creative people need dreams? Everyone needs to think creatively. Stickgold says that dreams help us connect ideas in new ways. When people wake up from REM sleep and think of a word, their ideas are more original than when they wake from other sleep stages. They think of surprising connections. 

I write better when I wake up from strong dreams. Even a bad dream can help me think better. On those days, I can write quickly because I have many ideas. I do not know how it works, but it helps. 

Creativity is not just for writers or artists. We all need to think well in our complex world. We need to dream to help us think creatively and solve problems with others. This is why dreams are important."
38,"Susie Ray left London twenty years ago. She moved to a small town by the sea in south-west England. In her studio, you can see empty frames on the walls and pictures of her two daughters. Susie is a copyist artist. She can paint famous artworks very well. She has painted works by artists like Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh. People often think her paintings are the real ones. 

Her copies can sell for a few hundred pounds to £12,000, depending on how much time she spends on them. Susie does not tell who her clients are, but they include galleries and collectors. Some collectors want to show off their art, even if it is not the original. Susie knows that some famous people show her copies as if they are real. 

When she copies a painting, she tries to make it look very real. She puts her name on the back of the painting. It is illegal to say a copy is the original. Susie does not want to get into trouble, so she does not do that. She is not very rich, but she is more secure now. 

Before being a copyist, Susie worked as an illustrator for a botanical garden. She learned to be very accurate in her work. She is happy she found a job that pays better. When young artists ask her for advice, she tells them to learn to draw well. 

Susie can draw many things, but she likes to copy French impressionist paintings the most. She thinks people often think modern art is easy, but it can be very hard. 

Some people wonder why Susie does not make her own art. She has tried, but she feels her own paintings do not look as good as her copies. Susie is a perfectionist and wants to do her best."
39,"Ellen MacArthur loved the sea and wanted to be the fastest sailor. She loved sailing since she was a child. When she was on her boat, she felt very connected to it. But when she was on land, she felt bored and wanted to be back on the ocean.

One time, she came second in a big race called the Vendée Globe. After the race, she showed me her small boat, Kingfisher. She lived there for 94 days. She planned everything carefully, even how many paper towels she needed. She had special food and a small stove. Her boat was very important to her, and she took good care of it.

Ellen had a big moment when she went to South Georgia, a lonely island. She helped with a study about birds called albatrosses. This made her think about how we use the earth’s resources. She saw old whaling stations and felt sad. She thought we take too much from the earth and do not give back.

Now, Ellen talks about saving the planet. She says we cannot make more coal, oil, or gas. We need to use them wisely. At first, she told people to use less, but now she talks about re-using things. She visits factories and talks to people about how we can use resources better.

Ellen started a charity called the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. It helps young people think about a better future. She misses sailing and the adventure of being at sea. But now, she feels her work is very important. She wants to help people understand how to take care of our planet."
40,"Jordan Romero is 13 years old. He wants to be the youngest person to climb Mount Everest. If he does this, he could be very famous. Jordan wants to inspire other kids to go outside and climb too. His climbing team is his father, Paul, and his mother, Karen. They call themselves ""Team Romero."" 

Jordan has a big goal. If he climbs Everest and another mountain called Vinson Massif in Antarctica, he will be the youngest person to climb the Seven Summits. The Seven Summits are the highest mountains on each continent. Not many people do this before they are thirty years old. Jordan has already climbed five of them. He might finish before he turns 14.

Some famous climbers think it is not a good idea for a 13-year-old to climb Everest. They say Jordan is strong, but they worry if he is ready for such a big challenge. They think he may not have enough experience to be safe. 

Paul, Jordan's father, knows about these worries. He says, ""I hear the criticism, but we have to keep going. We think about the risks, but we believe we can help Jordan."" Paul feels confident because Jordan is getting stronger and more mature.

Paul says this project is not just about making Jordan famous. At first, Jordan wanted to climb when he was older, but then they thought, ""Why not now?"" They talk to Jordan often to make sure he still wants to do it. 

When asked why he wants to climb, Jordan says, ""I just want to reach my goal."" In the past, not many people cared about being the youngest or fastest climber. Now, every adventure is shared online, and people want to see records broken. 

This makes it hard for Jordan. Some people think that trying to break records takes away the fun. But if Jordan wants to inspire others, he needs to share his journey online. This means he has to take photos and give interviews. He has to do something amazing, like climbing Everest.

Paul says, ""If Jordan comes home and wants to stop climbing and play basketball instead, we will stop this project and go to the gym."""
41,"When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, they are probably not listening to classical music. Many people know many pop groups, but most of my friends do not know who Brahms is. I just started studying music, but my classmates know as little about classical music as other teenagers. If you do not know who wrote the music, you probably do not have any of their recordings. This is sad for people who love classical music. Last year, only 3% of concert tickets sold were for classical music, and most classical recordings sell only 300 copies. 

Why is classical music less popular now? Older people are upset about our love for TV and video games, but I do not think this is the reason. The truth is that classical music does not interest most people, especially teenagers, who buy the most music and concert tickets. Some teenagers do go to classical concerts, but they are few. I play in an orchestra, but I do not really like classical music. I listen to many types of music, but I listen to classical music very little.

Why don’t teenagers like classical music? First, classical music has many changes in speed and mood, which can be hard for us. We like fast talking, fast playing, and fast thinking. Experts say we can only pay attention for about three minutes, which is too short for most classical music pieces but just right for pop songs. Pop music is simple and easy to listen to, while classical music needs more time and focus. Also, pop music talks about things that matter to teenagers, while classical music often does not.

How we listen to music has changed too. In the past, families would play music together at home, and playing an instrument was important. Now, we can find any music we want online, but we rarely listen to classical music. When was the last time you heard classical music in a store? Some teachers say that more people are going to classical concerts now, but I think not many of them are teenagers. In my orchestra, we play classical music in many places, but I mostly see older people in the audience. 

Some people think schools are to blame for teenagers not liking classical music, but many kids want to play classical music in their school orchestras. They come early to practice and stay after school to rehearse. They like classical music when they play it, but it is not their favorite music to listen to. When we want to relax, we always choose pop music."
42,"Bonnie Wyndham got out of her mother’s car and looked at Almonside School. She said, “I’ll make you sorry I’ve come here,” but she said it nicely. Her mother was getting out of the car too, so she didn’t hear Bonnie. Bonnie didn’t mind if she did. Her mother knew how Bonnie felt. 

Mrs. Wyndham looked around. Almonside School was strange. It had many buildings hidden in the trees on a hill. It was confusing at first. Then she saw signs: Science block, gym, riding centre… “Riding centre,” Bonnie said, suddenly interested. “Headmaster’s study,” her mother said. “This way.” Bonnie followed her mother along a wide path between the trees. 

“I wish you’d walk beside me instead of behind me,” Mrs. Wyndham said tiredly, but she didn’t expect Bonnie to do it. A few minutes later, her mother was talking to Bonnie’s new headmaster in his office, while Bonnie waited outside. Suddenly, Bonnie stood up. “Why should I just sit here?” she thought. “I’ll be thrown out soon anyway, so why not go?” She left the building and went to the riding centre. 

There was a nice old building for the horses and a big place for indoor riding. Bonnie looked around, but no one was there. She walked carefully to the horses. Bonnie respected the horses. They were well taken care of. Almost every stall had a horse. She looked at each horse and thought about them. “I know what you’re doing here,” she said to a small pony, touching its nose. 

Then she saw the next horse and stopped. “But aren’t you the best!” she said. He was brown with a little white. He looked lively, and Bonnie liked that. “I feel like we’ve met before,” she said, petting his neck. “I rode you to win a big competition in my dreams.” The horse’s name was Maverick. Bonnie wanted to ride him. “I wonder where I can find a bridle and a saddle,” she thought. 

The room with the riding gear was open. Bonnie was happy to find it. She put a saddle on Maverick’s back and forgot about her mother and the headmaster. When she sat on the big horse outside, she felt like a queen. At her old school, they called her Queen Bee, and she laughed at the memory. “You’re the best horse I’ve ever ridden, Maverick,” she said. “I know about horses, even if I don’t know about anything else.” 

She nudged him to walk, then to trot. “If I stay here, I think we could be great friends,” she said. She rode around the paddock. The rhythm was exciting, and a little breeze made her cheek feel warm. She could tell Maverick trusted her, and she felt sure he would jump well."
43,"I met Cody Simpson before. He is a quiet and confident person. Cody is 15 years old and comes from Australia. He has made many popular songs. 

Cody started playing guitar when he was six years old. He began writing songs when he was seven. He loved swimming and surfing more than anything else at that time. When he was 13, he was in high school and posted some videos online. 

These videos changed his life. He first shared a video of him and a friend singing at a school concert. Many fans wanted to see more videos of him. So, Cody made more videos at home. People loved them. 

Cody was also a great swimmer. He trained hard with good coaches. But then, music companies wanted him. He had to choose: stay in Australia and keep swimming or move to the US to make music. Cody decided to take the chance. 

“It was hard to choose my career at such a young age,” he said. He had to tell his swimming coach and friends that he was moving. They were surprised because he is a quiet kid. 

Cody moved with his family to the US. He gave up swimming to follow his music dream. His family is not in the spotlight, but they support him. Cody believes it is important to have good people around you. 

Sometimes, he thinks about how his choice affects his little brother and sister. His brother is eight years old and travels with him. Cody worries about this sometimes, but his family always supports him. 

Cody says that success comes from saying “yes” to big opportunities, even if it is scary. “Everything happened so fast,” he said. “Now, I go to countries I never thought I would see and play for many fans. It is a dream for many people, but I know it will not last forever.”"
44,"I jumped out of bed and looked out the window. I saw the river and some ice shining in the morning sun. I looked at the sandbags that protect the buildings from water. Last week, I helped put them in place with many people from the town. My back still hurt from lifting them. 

I saw a boy on the other side of the river. I did not know him. He was trying to stand on a piece of ice near the warm water from a factory. I put on my kayaking wetsuit and checked my jacket pocket for my lucky silver chain. My grandfather gave it to me. It is special because only my mom, my grandfather, and I know about it. I also have my grandfather's diary from his trip to South America. I read it before I sleep.

I went to the kitchen. “Good morning, Rex,” my mom said. She smiled at me while I took a banana. “You are up early for a Saturday. I will make brunch after your training. Be careful.” 

“Thanks, Mom.” I walked down the hall and almost bumped into my grandfather. “Watch where you’re going!” he shouted. “Where are you going?” 

“Sorry, Grandpa. I’m going kayaking.” He always sees me in my kayak. 

“What is the point of training? You didn’t win the competition,” he said. His words hurt, but I took a deep breath and counted to three. He went into the bathroom and slammed the door. My mom came to me with a kind smile. “Don’t mind him. He’s…” 

“...not himself right now,” I said. I wanted to say he always is like this, but I didn’t. I remembered when I was little, he was my hero. He showed me pictures of his adventures. Those pictures are still on his wall with his medals. But I don’t go into his room anymore. I have my own trophies now. I hope one day my picture will be in a magazine too.

Mom smiled. “At least he is coming out of his room more. Have a good training session, Rex. I admire your hard work, even in the cold!” I smiled back and ate my banana. “It will be warmer in South America,” I said. “If I find sponsors for my trip.” She laughed and went back to the kitchen. I finished my banana and went outside to the boathouse."
45,"Mum grabbed Jess's arm. ""Come with me,"" she said. Jess followed her to the study. On the table, there was a painting by Grandpa. It was not finished and looked different from his other paintings. 

""Do you know anything about this?"" Mum asked. Jess shook her head. ""I’ve never seen it before. I didn’t know he was working on anything."" 

Jess looked at the painting. It showed a river. It was not a river she knew, maybe it was just a made-up river. The painting was strange but beautiful. The riverbank was very small, with a little green. The river looked pale and seemed to go to a hidden sea. There were no animals, birds, or people in the painting. It felt right that way. Jess thought about autumn coming after summer.

Mum said, ""It has a name."" Her voice sounded a little strange. Jess knew why. Grandpa never named his paintings. He just painted them. Mum turned the painting over and pointed to the words Grandpa wrote. Jess read them: ""River Boy."" The name felt important to her, but she didn’t know why. 

Jess looked at Mum. ""There is no boy."" 

""Exactly. It’s strange for him to be so specific. Maybe he will add the boy later. I asked him about it once."" 

""Mum! You should have known better."" 

""I know, but I was curious. It’s such an unusual painting. You can guess his answer."" 

Jess didn’t need to guess. She knew Grandpa would say, ""It’s not up to the artist to explain a painting. Each painting has its own life and language, like a poem. We either understand it or we don’t."" 

Mum laughed. ""He said something like that. I hoped you might know about this painting since you inspire him."" 

""Inspire?"" Jess asked. 

""Yes, someone who helps an artist."" Jess understood. Grandpa often said this when she watched him paint. But she thought he meant a goddess, not a real person. It was hard to think anyone could inspire Grandpa. 

""He doesn’t need me to inspire him,"" she said. ""He has painted all his life."""
46,"This morning, I woke up and accidentally cut a hole in my bedroom carpet. I didn’t mean to do it. I could have tripped over my bed and the knife in my hand might have gone into the carpet. But I didn’t plan to damage the carpet. I didn’t wake up and think, “Today I will cut my carpet.” It just seemed like a good idea at the time. Later, I wondered why I thought that, but it was too late.

What I was really doing was trying to fit my corner cabinet into a corner. My grandma gave me the cabinet when she moved to a flat. It is small and painted white with pink and blue flowers. Grandma used to keep pretty things in it. Now, I keep my shells and stones there. I was very happy when she gave it to me!

The cabinet is a corner cabinet, so it has to go in a corner. My bedroom is small and has only two corners. The big bedroom is for my parents, my sister Angela has the back room, and my brother Tom has the room over the garage. My room is very small, like a broom cupboard. 

Mum says when Angela goes to university, Tom can have her room, and I can have Tom’s room. But Angela is only fifteen, so I think I will be in my small room for a long time. I don’t mind; I like my little bedroom. It feels cozy, like a nest. 

The problem is, I don’t have enough corners! My bed is in one corner, and my wardrobe is in the other. I tried to put Grandma’s cabinet in the space between the roof and the floor, but it was too tall. Then I thought, if I can’t cut the cabinet, maybe I can cut a hole in the carpet. It seemed like a good idea. Dad always tells us to “think outside the box,” and that is what I was doing!"
47,"The book 'The Borrowers' is about a family of tiny people. They live in the walls and floors of a house. They take things from normal-sized people to survive. When I was asked to make a TV show from the book, I knew it would be hard. Many people love the book and have strong ideas about it. I looked at the original drawings to help me. The author wanted the show to show the Borrowers' view, not the humans'. This made filming more difficult.

The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans. So, when we filmed them walking or borrowing things, we had to be ten times further away than usual. The crew had to crawl on the ground and film from very low, about 15 centimeters high. They wore out many pairs of jeans! We only raised the cameras for special shots. 

One big problem was making the shadows look right. We found a special way to do this. After the show, famous director George Lucas called me to ask how we did it. We built only one set, the Borrowers' home under the floor. It had big objects to make the actors look small. It was very fun. I remember the coins; they were bigger than dinner plates and hard to lift. We often stopped filming because the crew laughed so much.

In the story, there is a scene where the Borrowers go down a drain. To film this, the actors had to go down a tunnel with hoses. They said it was very scary! I wanted the costumes to look right. I had them made from heavy material so they looked like doll clothes. The leading actress could not bend or sit down in her costume. She had to be sewn into it every morning. The lead actor's trousers were made from a rug because normal fabric looked too smooth. It was very hot during filming, and I don’t think they liked the costumes!

Most of the action away from the Borrowers' home was filmed in front of a blue screen. The actors had to pretend to react to things that were not there. I drew pictures of every scene to show how they should look. I made 2,000 drawings! We could not spend much time in special effects studios, so I worked nights for three months. We had to work quickly. One time, I filmed a whole scene and then realized there was no film in the camera! But in the end, everything came together, and I think the show was successful in showing the magic of the books."
48,"Mom stops the car at my new school, Palm Grove High School. She looks around nervously for reporters, but there are none. I know things will get crazy soon. There will be fake smiles and people wanting things from me. “Everything will be fine,” I tell her. She kisses my cheek before I get out of the car. Then she drives away, leaving me alone at this new school. But I wanted this. I wanted to leave my old life of traveling and tutors. Now, while the band is recording, we are staying here for good. I wanted to come to this school to meet normal kids. I want to meet kids with regular parents, like a mom who works in an office or a dad who cuts grass. That would be so cool.

I walk into the school office. “Hi, I need my schedule, please,” I say to the secretary. “Name?” she asks, looking unfriendly. “Desert McGraw.” “Desirée?” she asks, leaning closer. “Desert,” I say again. The secretary looks confused. “Oh,” she says and types my last name. Not many people know my last name because my dad uses a stage name. “What grade?” she asks. “Eleventh.” “One second, it’s printing,” she says. Then she gives me my schedule. My first class is English Literature. That’s good because English is my favorite subject. But I will be late. English is in Room 214 on the second floor. I studied the map last night so I wouldn’t look silly looking for my class.

When I get to the door, the teacher is already calling names. “Aurelio Gonzalez.” “Here.” I slip in quietly and sit at the back. The girl next to me smiles. She looks at my normal outfit – jeans and a T-shirt. “Nice shoes,” she whispers. I look down at my fancy shoes with flowers. Oh no, I shouldn’t have worn these. “Thanks,” I say. The teacher calls my name. “Desert... McGraw?” “Here,” I reply. The teacher smiles and introduces herself as Ms. Smigla. She talks a lot and gives us our course outlines. After that, she lets us talk to each other! 

“Why did you move here?” my new friend asks. I have a few answers. I could say I wanted a normal life away from cameras and reporters. Or I could say what my dad said: “We need a change, Desert. This is the perfect place to record the new album.” I think he just wants to relax on the beach. Why else would they choose a studio near the sand? “My dad had to move,” I tell her. “What does he do?” she asks. I know everyone will find out soon, but I want to pretend to be normal for a while. “He’s an artist,” I say, playing with my backpack zipper. “Cool. I’m Becca, by the way.” She seems not to care much. That’s great!"
49,"Many American teenage girls have a lot of responsibilities. They are expected to be the president of the Student Council, have a part-time job, and do volunteer work. They also need to do well in school. Being a teenager today is not easy. Boys and girls cannot just go to school and be average. They need to work hard and have big goals. 

Kristen Loose, a teenager, says that many adults do not understand how much pressure teenagers feel. They have a lot of homework, tests, jobs, chores, and they want to have friends too. Even with all this stress, people still think teenagers are lazy and disrespectful. Kristen thinks this is not fair. She says many people think teenagers only watch TV or use their phones all the time. 

Kristen uses her phone to help her with schoolwork. She can do homework anywhere now. Teenagers can listen to lessons on their way to school. Schoolwork does not stop when they leave school. Many teenagers wake up early, around 6 or 7 a.m., and go to bed after midnight. They have school, activities, family duties, and homework. They often do not get enough sleep. A study found that only 20 percent of teenagers get enough sleep at night. 

Lindamarie Olsen is another teenager. She says she has about 18 hours of free time each week. This is not much time. She does not spend it on social media or TV. Instead, she likes to volunteer and help others. She believes that many people think teenagers only care about themselves. But she enjoys helping her school and community. 

In the future, teenagers will still work hard and show that they can make a difference in the world."
50,"The Earth to Sky Calculus Club is a group of teenagers who live in Bishop, a small mountain town in the US. This town is surrounded by nature and is near the Sierra Nevada mountains. The club has sent over fifty balloons high into the sky, about 35 km above the Earth. They do this as a science project and also for fun. 

One weekend in late spring, I joined them as they prepared to release a balloon. They wanted to see shooting stars. Shooting stars happen when a rock or metal from space falls into the Earth's atmosphere and makes a bright light. 

As it got dark, the teenagers attached a soft lunch box to the balloon. Inside the lunch box, there was a camera, a tool to measure how high the balloon goes, and a thermometer to check the temperature. They also put two GPS trackers on the outside of the lunch box to find it later. They used a gas tank to fill the balloon, which grew to the size of a small car. 

When it was time to launch, they counted down: “Five, four, three, two, one.” The balloon went up into the sky. Some of the kids ran with flashlights to follow it until they could not see it anymore. It was quiet, and everyone felt amazed. 

After the launch, most students went home, but a few stayed to watch for shooting stars. They lay on blankets and looked at the clear sky. I saw a boy get into a sleeping bag and fall asleep. One girl said softly, “We are the only ones talking.” Another girl whispered back, “I know.” Suddenly, a meteor flew across the sky.

As the balloon went up, it got bigger and bigger until it popped. A parachute helped the lunch box come back down safely. The next day, the students used the GPS trackers to find it. It was not easy to get it back, but that was part of the fun. The lunch box usually lands in a remote area. 

The leader of the group said that finding the lunch box is an important part of the project. They have only lost two lunch boxes in 53 launches. This time, the lunch box landed 84 km away from Bishop. The team had to drive a long way to get it. They had to decide if they should drive or walk to find it, especially if it was on a high mountain or in a tall tree.

In the end, it took them 11 hours to find the lunch box. It was in a canyon, on a flat rock, near a waterfall. The camera did not catch any shooting stars, which was a little disappointing. But it gave them a chance to talk about science and share another adventure story."
51,"Chloe Morgan did not like science, especially Palaeontology, until she was fifteen years old. This change happened by chance. Her younger brother loved dinosaurs, and she helped him with a science project. While helping, she read an article about new dinosaur discoveries, and it amazed her. She decided she wanted to study Palaeontology.

Chloe met a famous young palaeontologist named Matt Cornelius. She was nervous to meet him because she thought he might not want to talk to her. But he was friendly and listened to her questions, which made her feel better.

Chloe thinks movies like Jurassic Park make people very interested in dinosaurs, but they do not show palaeontologists correctly. She feels that movies often show palaeontologists as strange or silly people. In real life, her job is very different. She digs up dinosaur bones, works in labs, studies fossils, and writes scientific papers. Sometimes, she talks to the public about science, especially to young people. She wants them to learn about science and dinosaurs.

Chloe helped with a TV show called Walking with Dinosaurs. She made sure the dinosaurs looked right and lived in the same time. The show was successful because it showed real dinosaurs, unlike the ones in Jurassic Park.

Chloe believes dinosaurs are interesting because they make us curious. They remind us that there is still much to discover in the world. Palaeontology is like traveling back in time."
52,"When you travel by car with your family, even if you are six years old, you know you are not “there yet.” You keep asking, “Are we there yet?” But when you arrive, it is not “there” anymore; it is “here.” So, if you think you are “there,” you should ask, “Are we here yet?”

Parents hear this question many times on long car trips. Kids might think it is hard, but it can be nice to sit in the back seat. You can watch DVDs, listen to music, or do puzzles while looking at the beautiful views outside the window. 

In the front seat, your mom or dad drives the car. They give you juice boxes and cookies and change the radio. They help make the trip nice. 

But sometimes, things can get crazy. My younger brother, Tim, does things that annoy me. He might put his foot on my side of the seat. I do not like that, so I put my foot on his side. Soon, we are fighting, and our parents have to tell us to stop. 

After a while, I try to read, but then I feel something on my arm. Tim is blowing his breath on me. He is not touching me, but it still makes me mad. Our parents get angry again, and the car swerves. 

Over the years, Dad has found ways to deal with us. When we ask, “Are we there yet?” he sometimes says, “Yes, we are here. Get out of the car.” But we are still driving! Then he says, “Maybe we are not there yet.” This makes us quiet for a bit.

You know you are really “there” when the grown-ups get out of the car and walk away from us. So remember: if mom and dad are still close enough to answer your question, the answer is: no, you are not there yet."
53,"John and Zuzi Morgan have opened a café in Oxford, UK. In their café, people can drink coffee, eat cake, and play board games. John and Zuzi want people to enjoy their time and come back again. Zuzi says they started this café because many people use phones and computers. They want to help people spend time together and talk to each other.

The games in their café are called ""Eurogames."" These games have simple themes, like farming and building. The first Eurogame was called The Settlers of Catan, made by a German designer named Klaus Teuber. In this game, players build homes on an island and trade things with each other. Everyone stays involved and has fun until the end of the game.

There are also ""co-operative"" games where everyone plays together as a team. In these games, all players can win or lose together. One popular co-operative game is Pandemic, made by Matt Leacock. In Pandemic, players work together to solve big problems. Matt was inspired by another game called Lord of the Rings. He remembers feeling scared and excited when he played it with friends. He wanted to make a game that made people feel good, no matter if they won or lost.

Matt loved games as a child, but sometimes he felt disappointed when they were not fun. With help from his uncle, he tried to make better games. Pandemic became very popular and had a great story. It is like a video game because players can change their characters and the game changes as they play.

Video games have helped board games become more popular. Many people now play games on their phones. Ben Hogg, who works for a game company, says that everyone plays games on their phones. More people want to play games than ever before.

At first, video games let people play together in the same room. But then, many games moved online, and players could not see each other. Some people who liked video games wanted to play games with friends in person again. 

In John and Zuzi's busy café, board games are more than just fun. In our online world, games are a way for people to share time together in real life, and this will keep happening."
54,"Jamie Scott is a musician from the UK. He has written many popular songs. His story shows that hard work and not giving up are very important in music, even if you start slowly. Jamie's mother was a great singer and taught him to play the guitar. He only listened to a local radio station at home, which played music for older people. Because of this, he did not hear new songs until he was 12 years old.

When he was young, Jamie had to choose between playing tennis and making music. He played tennis very well, but he liked music more. He spent his lunch breaks in the music room at school. At 17, he left school to become a performer. He worked with a friend who played guitar but did not want to be a performer. Jamie told his parents that he wanted to make music. His dad said he had 18 months to succeed, or he would need to find a job.

At 19, Jamie got a chance with a music publisher after writing one song. But the music labels wanted him to be a solo artist, so he had to stop working with his friend. Jamie found success as a songwriter instead of a performer. He had a hard time with a record label in the UK and then moved to a new label to release a new album. He did not become famous right away.

Jamie believes he has been in the wrong place at the wrong time for his own music, but he has been successful writing for other artists. He helps new artists and tells them it is okay to want to write popular songs. He wants to write songs that many people will love. Jamie is honest about his goals. He wants to write big songs that can be number one. He focuses on making great music when he works with others. He wants to create modern pop songs that people will remember."
55,"Tony Connor is a new kind of celebrity. He is famous online, but many people do not know him if they do not watch videos of bike tricks. He is a ""street trials cyclist."" This means he jumps from hard places like roofs or walls to land safely in other strange places. People film his tricks and put them online.

I met Tony one Saturday morning at a BMX park. The local boys know him well. Many older people also come to see him and call him ""an absolute legend."" After watching him, I agree. I thought he was just okay, but I was surprised by his bravery and creativity. Before each jump, he tells us what he will do, and sometimes I think he cannot do it. But when I tell him he did a great job, he does not seem happy.

Tony says he does not like being famous. He finds it hard to talk to fans. He prefers to do things instead of just talking about them. This is funny because he is famous because of social media and cameras. He says, ""This technology helps people like me earn money."" He feels that many people are always filming themselves or looking at screens, and he does not like that.

Tony makes good money from his videos. I have learned that two things help kids become great athletes: energy and the ability to handle disappointment. These are often more important than talent. In risky sports, it is very important to be strong in your mind. Even in the park, Tony fell a few times on easy things for him. But he got up and kept trying until he did it right.

Some people do not think Tony is a hero. They say he takes too many risks. He explains that these people do not know much about his sport. They have never tried riding a trials bike and do not understand what he does. He gets advice from experts to stay safe.

Tony is careful about risks. He says, ""Some people are not scared, and they should not do these sports. Others are scared but can get past it. I feel scared but find a way to jump."" He is not addicted to risk. He spends a lot of time planning and getting ready. Sometimes he rides around to feel good before trying a new trick. He knows he must stay calm before he jumps. If he focuses, he will be fine."
56,"Helen Skelton is a TV presenter. She has done many dangerous things to help charity. She ran a marathon in the desert and traveled down the Amazon river in a small boat. 

For her new challenge, Helen walked on a high wire. This wire was 66 meters above the ground, between two tall towers. There was no safety net. She wore a belt that was attached to another wire above her. To help her stay balanced, she used a long stick that weighed eight kilograms. 

Helen learned from a teacher who is good at walking on high wires. She already knew some circus skills, but high-wire walking was very different. She said, ""The training was a shock. I didn’t know I had to be so strong."" 

Every day, her training started at 8 am. She ran up a steep hill, did exercises for one hour, and then practiced on the wire for another hour. She also learned how to fall safely onto the wire. When she fell, it hurt a lot. But she knew she had to stay positive. If she got nervous, the wire would shake too!

On the day of her challenge, it was windy. Helen took deep breaths and moved slowly along the wire. The walk was 150 meters long and took her 15 minutes. Afterward, she said, ""That was the scariest thing I’ve done. I’m glad it’s over!"" 

But Helen is not done yet. She is planning her next charity project: to reach the South Pole by ski, kite, and bike."
57,"In 2006, Jeff Somers started a trip around the world on a penny farthing. This is an old bicycle with one big wheel and one small wheel. Jeff had already written a book about his travels in Canada in a very old car. He loved cars and worked on racing car engines. To save money, Jeff rode an old bicycle to work and used it to go to Amsterdam for a holiday. He said, “That trip opened my eyes. I wanted to see the world by bike.”

Jeff did not want a normal bike. He wanted to build a special one. He thought a penny farthing was the craziest bike. So, he went to a museum to learn how to make one. After trying to start his trip in 2001 and 2003 but stopping because of a knee injury, he finally left in 2006. He traveled for three years and visited 23 countries on four continents. The best part of his trip was arriving in Tibet and seeing Mount Everest. 

Jeff met other cyclists who could ride up mountains, but he was happy with his penny farthing. People were very surprised to see it as he traveled. His worst moment was when he had to drink dirty water from a stream. He got very sick and stayed in a hostel for ten days without medicine. He had no money for a hospital or to go home. 

Even with these problems, Jeff now says, “If I could afford it, I would start traveling again tomorrow on my penny farthing.”"
58,"I work at a university in the US. My team and I want to learn more about water birds, especially the American black duck. We just got a new tool called a ‘night-vision scope’. This tool helps us see the ducks at night! 

We are worried about black ducks because their numbers are very low. We do not know if there is enough food for them on the east coast. We have a lot of information about what they do during the day, but we do not know what they do at night. This is because we did not have the right tools before. 

The night-vision scope will help us see clearly, even when there is no moon. This will help us learn more and take better care of the ducks and their home. 

Our work is hard. There are four of us, and we work six hours every day. We have studied ducks in different places. Sometimes, I have to take a boat to see the ducks and write down what I see. The weather can be difficult. Some nights are warm, but many nights are wet. It is very quiet, so I drink a lot of coffee to stay awake! 

We have only missed one day of work because the snow was too deep for our vehicles. I like this work, even if it is hard. In the summer, we will work in a laboratory and look at our results together. It will be hard to be inside, but it is important. I would not change this job for anything!"
59,"Text: ""When I tell people my job, they are surprised. I am not joking! I work with chocolate! I taste chocolate to make sure it is good for customers. Every week, I get small samples from our factory. I check the taste, feel, and smell of the chocolate. I also taste the nuts and fruit we use. I choose the best ones for the chocolate. 

Next to my office, I have a kitchen. In the kitchen, I can test and taste the chocolate I make. I share samples with my coworkers, and they like it! My kitchen has many machines and ingredients. It is nice to have my own space at work. 

Every day is different. Sometimes I work in the lab, and other times I travel to buy ingredients. I have a young family, so this can be hard. But I like the variety in my job, and I love chocolate! People often ask if I get bored of chocolate. I have worked with it for a long time, and I still enjoy eating it. I even eat more chocolate at home in the evening!"""
60,"Have you ever thought about what it is like to work in a circus? Sophia Grayson works at Circus Experience. This is a place that teaches young people circus skills. She says many people like her course because it teaches many skills. You can learn to juggle, throw and catch balls, and even do trapeze, which is flying in the air above an audience.

The course lasts one year. Students learn to take more risks in each class. Parents can come to some classes to see how their children are doing. Sophia says, “To be a circus performer, you need to do different things. It is important to keep your shows exciting. If you want to be good in the circus, you must practice a lot. You also make friends with other performers and learn from them. Being fit is very important. Circus performers train every day to stay strong. Training is important, but the best performers are those who want to succeed, have good ideas, and keep getting better.”

Some people think circus performers get hurt a lot or only work a little each year. But Sophia says the real challenge is to think about the future. You can only travel and perform when you are young. After that, you need to think about other jobs. The course also teaches business skills. Many students start their own businesses around the world and share their stories. But Sophia warns that you do not make a lot of money in this job! “You usually do not have a regular salary. It is also very competitive, but it is a lot of fun!”"
61,"You may not know her name or face, but you have probably heard her many times. Mariam Hobson is a backing singer. This means she sings in the background to help the main singer. Some people think backing singers are not as good as lead singers, but that is not true. They are very talented! Mariam says, ""I love my job because I never know what I will sing when I go to the studio. It could be classical, jazz, hip-hop, or rock. Sometimes, I even sing funny songs for radio or ads. Once, I was asked to sing like a fish underwater! I never argue; I just do my job!""

Mariam needs to be very good at music and learn quickly. Sometimes, there is no music sheet to read. She remembers her first time recording music for a film. It was hard because there were eight singers, and each one sang a different part. There was also an orchestra. She was scared because if she made a mistake, they would have to record everything again, and nobody likes that. Recording can take a long time.

One of her favorite jobs is recording for songwriters. Some new writers do not know what type of music is best for a female voice. When they hear Mariam sing their song, they can see how to make it better."
62,"Julie Deane started with little knowledge about fashion, but she made a successful business with her bags called ‘satchels.’ These bags are used by schoolchildren and are now sold in famous shops. Many celebrities also like these bags. 

Before making satchels, Julie thought about different business ideas, like cake decorating and party planning. She wanted to choose the best idea. Some people told her that no one wanted satchels, but she believed in her idea. Julie worked with her mother, who is good at business, to help her. The design of the satchels came from children’s storybooks.

At first, Julie did not know much about fashion blogs, but they helped her business grow. She sold about one satchel each week. To get more people interested, she sent satchels to fashion writers and hoped they would write about them. They did, and more people started to like her bags. Now, she is excited to see which celebrity will be seen with a satchel next!

While other companies spend money on ads, Julie uses the internet to get ideas for new styles. There was a hard time when another company copied her design, so now she makes sure to trust her production team. People who visit her office say it feels good to be there, and everyone enjoys working together. There is a new factory, but it is the team that makes the place special."
63,"When Vicky Harmiston was a child, her parents let her and her brother Jamie choose what to do in their free time. Vicky liked to play many sports. She was a good swimmer, and her coach thought she could be a champion. But the swimming club was far from her home, so it was hard for her to train and do her schoolwork.

When they were teenagers, Jamie loved cycling. He bought a special racing bike and started to compete. Vicky thought this was exciting and wanted to try it too. She said it was the best choice she ever made. Soon, she was cycling every day and doing very well. The track was close to her school, so it was easy for her to go to training after school.

Vicky became a successful track cyclist and won many competitions. When she was 28, she stopped racing. Vicky said, “I loved winning, but I got tired of it. When the fun stops, there is no reason to continue. Luckily, I found a new job.”

Vicky now works for a charity called CycleZone. “We help young people who do not like sports,” she says. “First, we teach them to ride a bike. We want them to believe in themselves. CycleZone is great because it brings young people together.”

The charity uses famous people to help them. Vicky says, “Some people think having a celebrity is not always good for a charity. They say celebrities just want attention, and this can hide the real work of the charity. But if famous singers and actors can help, I think they should.”"
64,"Ana Ronson is a singer and songwriter from Ireland. Her parents did not play music, but there was always music in her home. Her grandfather played the guitar and taught Ana and her brother how to play.

Ana was very nervous the first time she sang in front of people at school. Her teacher had to help her off the stage. The teacher suggested that Ana join the school theatre club to feel more confident. After some time in the club, Ana sang happily with 50 other students at a concert.

A year later, her brother, who was in a band, asked her to write a song for them. Ana wrote her first song called ""Falling Stars"" in just three days. She liked it so much that she took a songwriting course with a professional. Even though she was the youngest student, she knew a lot about music. But Ana felt the teacher did not listen to her, so she wrote a song called ""Something to Say"" about this feeling. She shared this song online, and many people loved it.

Joss Alton, who owns a music company called Isotope Music, came to ask Ana to join his company. At first, Ana was unsure because she did not know the company well and did not want anyone to tell her what to sing. But Joss promised that would not happen. Soon after, Ana performed at a concert in Dublin organized by Isotope. All the tickets sold out quickly, and it was a great night.

Ana likes to write songs about real life, especially when things are not good. One of her favorite songs is ""Decision,"" which is about why her brother stopped singing for a while and how sad it made him. Ana hopes her fans will like her songs, but she wants to write about her own important experiences."
65,"Last year, I went on a great trip. I traveled by boat on a group tour along the west coast of Canada. My brother Harry had the idea. He is a journalist, like me, and he wanted to write about the trip. He loves boats, but I do not. I always wanted to visit this place because our great-grandparents lived there before they moved to Europe. I asked Harry if I could go with him, and he finally said yes!

A few days before we left, there were storms where we were going. But the weather was good for the days we would be there. I was busy at work and did not have time to plan. But Harry said he would take care of everything, so I felt better.

When we arrived in Canada, we joined the group, packed our things into small boats, and started our trip. The guide said very few people live along that coast. In the morning, we only saw dolphins and birds. There were islands far away, but the fog made it hard to see. I watched the pretty patterns our boat made in the water.

We often stopped to explore the rock pools on the beaches. They had many colorful fish that I did not know. It was nice to forget about time. We always remembered to make lunch and dinner together over campfires. At night, we slept on the boats. The beds were hard, but it felt good to relax.

When it was time to go home, I felt sad. I did not want to return to normal life. But I knew I would miss my family and friends. I was also excited to tell everyone about our adventures!"
66,"My dad was a basketball player in Germany. His dad was also a player. When I was a kid, I went to watch many of my dad's games. You might think I would love basketball, but I did not. I liked to tell my friends how good my dad was, especially when he won. But I often took a book to read instead of watching the games.

When I started secondary school, I was very tall. My sports teacher asked me if I wanted to train with the basketball team. I liked the training, but I thought I needed to get better before playing in a real game. The teacher believed in me more than I did. After some time, I agreed to play. A few weeks later, I played against another school. My parents came to watch, and it made me nervous. But it was OK in the end!

For the next four years, I practiced every day and did well. I even joined an adult team before I moved to a sports academy in the USA when I was fifteen. The coach there trained Olympic players, and it was great to learn from him. But I missed my parents. At home, I could not spend much time with my friends because of training, so that was not a big change for me. I got used to my new life, and my English got better too!

I became a professional player when I was eighteen, three years after I arrived in the USA. I was taller than most players, but I needed to get stronger. My coach knew a team that would take me while I was still in college, so I joined them and I have never regretted it."
67,"Seven years ago, I was studying Tourism in college. I needed a part-time job because my studies were expensive. I decided to become a weekend tour guide in my city, Chicago, USA. I took visitors around the city, and I was happy to see how much I liked giving tours. I saw my city in a new way every time!

After I finished my studies, I wanted to be a tour guide full-time. I thought it would be easy, but I learned that I needed to know a lot more. To be a full-time tour guide, I had to answer many questions about Chicago, like its buildings, history, and public transport rules. After a few months of hard work, I got my tour guide qualification and became an independent tour guide.

Being a tour guide is not just about knowing facts. You also need to be fun and tell interesting stories. It is important to handle problems well. For example, if a place is closed when you arrive, you need to find a new plan. Tourists want to enjoy their tour, not hear about problems. I want my visitors to be happy, or they might leave a bad review online. Good reviews are very important because they help me get more customers.

I try to make my tours fun and easy. I put a lot of energy into my job, and because of this, I usually get good reviews. Many visitors recommend my tours to others who come to Chicago."
68,"My name is Ella and I am 22 years old. Last year, I went to Thailand for two weeks with my sister Josie. Josie is five years younger than me, but we get along well. We went to help at an elephant sanctuary. This is a place where people take care of sick and rescued elephants. 

At first, I was not sure if we would fit in with the other volunteers because they were older than us. We were also nervous because it was our first time doing this kind of work. But in the end, we had a great time. 

One of our main jobs was to collect food for the elephants. Elephants eat a lot of grass and banana plants, so this took most of the day. Josie found it hard work, but I thought it was worth it to see the elephants eat. We also washed the elephants in the river with big brushes and soap. I had a lot of fun, even if I got wetter than the elephants!

In the evening, we took the elephants into the forest where they slept at night. All the volunteers stayed in the same house. Josie and I shared a small bedroom because she did not want to be alone. It was hot at night, but we were ready for that. The food was very good and did not have meat, which we do not like.

After dinner, all the volunteers and staff talked and played games. Now that we are back in the UK, Josie does not talk much about Thailand. But if someone asks her if she liked it, she says she loved it. I think she might be a little sad because she missed her friends. But when she thinks about it, she knows she was lucky to go there. Maybe she will go back one day – I will for sure!"
69,"My name is Gina D’Costa. I have a flower shop in the UK. I sell flowers to many people. Some people buy flowers for friends or their homes. Hotels and offices also buy flowers. Sometimes, I help businesses by providing flowers for their pictures. Once, I decorated a castle with flowers for a wedding. It was a lot of work, but I was very proud.

My day starts at 4 a.m. I go to the market to buy fresh flowers. Most people are still sleeping, and my friends think I am crazy, but I love my job. It is often cold and dark, but I do not mind. The flower market is amazing, with flowers from all over the world. It is hard to choose flowers. My favorite color is pink, so I would choose pink flowers for myself. But I have to remember that other people want different flowers. Not all flowers are available all year.

I do not like to argue about prices with the flower sellers, but I have to do it. Flowers can be expensive, so I try to get the best price. When I am back at the shop, we look at customer orders and prepare vases with the flowers. Then, we make flower bunches and check how much they will cost. Customers are often surprised by the prices, and I sometimes ask them to think again about what they want. 

Some people may think this is too much work, but I enjoy making beautiful flower arrangements for the money someone wants to spend. That is what you do when you sell things. I love my job!"
70,"My city has a modern cinema that shows new films. It is close to my home. A year ago, I wanted to talk about films with friends after watching them. So, I started a film club with two friends! We do not want to rent a cinema. Instead, we pick a new place in the city each month. 

For example, we used an old factory to show a film about Antarctica. It was very cold, which made it fun to watch the film. Some places are free because they sell snacks during the film. This helps us keep our prices low. We just want to cover our costs, not make money.

Each time we show a film, it gets easier. We have our own equipment now. We can see how many tickets we sell online, so we do not worry about empty seats. There is always a lot to do, but when people say they had a great time, it makes us happy.

Our website helps us a lot. We talk to other film clubs in the country and learn from them. We also started a blog because many people look for film information online. We put up some posters in cafés, but the best way to get new people is when friends tell each other about us. 

The audience loves the fun activities we have with each film. Last month, we had a movie quiz, and everyone enjoyed it!"
71,"Taking photos was my favorite thing to do when I was a child. When I was 15, I wanted to make my hobby better. I decided to take one photo every day for a whole year. Many other young photographers did this too, but I thought it was a great idea.

After a few weeks, I put my photos on a website for young photographers. I wanted to make a photo diary and show my photos to others. I was happy to see that people liked my photos. I enjoyed taking pictures of many different things. Then, someone told me that if my photos had a common theme, my project would be better. I agreed and started to take more photos of nature, especially birds and the sky.

Most of my photos were black and white. This was different from what other young photographers were doing because they took color photos. Sometimes, I doubted my project and almost gave up. But in the end, I believed in myself and became more confident in my style.

One day, I showed my project to my art teacher. She told me about a photography competition for young people. I entered some of my photos just for fun. I will never forget when the judges told me I won first prize. I was so happy because my project was very important to me. It was the first time I realized my photography was good, and I could be a professional photographer. Now, I have my own photography studio, and I am happy with my choice."
72,"I joined the National Youth Challenge (NYC) last year. I wanted to try new things like camping and sailing. In NYC, you can do many activities and learn new skills. There are different levels, from beginner to advanced. Adult volunteers, called ‘leaders’, help us. When you finish a level, you get a certificate.

At first, my leader said I should help at a local children’s club for two hours a week. I was not sure about this. I had gone to that club when I was eight, but I found it hard to make friends. I was shy, and the other kids already had friends. I stopped going after a few weeks. 

But I decided to try the challenge because I wanted my first NYC certificate. Soon, I loved spending time at the children’s club. It was more important to me than just getting the certificate. When I finished the challenge, the NYC leader let me keep helping at the club because I made good friends with the children. Now, I go there for about four hours a week, and I always look forward to it.

Because of what I learned at the club, I want to go to college after school. I want to be a youth worker, someone who helps children. I never thought about this before. This has been my favorite part of NYC, and I have improved my communication skills while helping others. I have several NYC certificates now, and one is for camping!"
73,"I was born in Denver, USA. I started snowboarding when I was eight years old. My dad took me to the mountains, two hours from Denver. The hill looked very steep, and my dad had to convince me to try it. I did not think to ask him if I could snowboard, but he loved it and wanted me to love it too. He made it look easy. In the end, I did well. Soon, I loved snowboarding and got better at it. I started to compete when I was ten years old. Some people compete a lot and get bored, but I still love it. I like to win, and this helps me try harder. I enjoy not having a strict plan. Sometimes this works out well. I became the first girl to get a perfect score of 100 in a local competition. I was not sure I could do the jumps, but I tried and succeeded. This made me trust myself more.

In the summer, I train and study because there is no snow. I train every day, but I do not have to follow a strict diet like in winter. I also spend time with my friends. This helps me feel better when I cannot snowboard. I think about my future. Snowboarding is very important to me, but I want to have another job too, just in case I do not become a professional snowboarder or if I get hurt. I am thinking about becoming a doctor if I have time to go to college. I cannot imagine getting tired of snowboarding, but I know I cannot do it forever."
74,"When I was fifteen, I wanted what my friends had. I did not think about the future. One day, my best friend got a new phone for her birthday. I wanted a new phone too. My parents said I could only have one if I paid for it myself. So, I decided to work part-time and save money. I am thankful to my parents for this. It taught me an important lesson.

I worked every Saturday in a café, but I did not like it much. My parents suggested I start my own small business. I saw my mum making necklaces, so I asked if I could try. I thought it would be hard, but it was easy! My friends thought it was boring, but I liked it. My mum showed me how to make pretty things at home with simple tools.

I sold my first necklaces to my friends and family. They said they liked them, but I was not sure if they were good enough. I wanted to know if other people would like them too. So, I rented a market stall with my mum. Many tourists came to buy my necklaces for their families and friends. Soon, people from all over the country called to buy more. They thought we were a big company, but it was just me and my mum at the stall!

That made me believe my business could work. I decided to make a website. Since then, I have made a lot of money from my business, mostly online, but we still have our stall. It has been a lot of fun!"
75,"When Janine Stuart was 13 years old, she wrote a book called Being Amelia. This book became very popular. Being Amelia is partly about Janine’s life. In an interview, Janine said, “My father’s job made my family move a lot. Because of this, I learned to make new friends. I know what it is like to be the new student in a class. This helped me write about Amelia, the main character, in her new school. Some funny parts of the book are about Amelia’s home life, especially with her older brother. I am an only child, so I had to use my imagination for that.” 

Janine started writing her book one summer when she was bored at home. Her mother wanted to be a writer, and her teachers told her to write, so it was a good way for Janine to spend her time. The year before, she won a short story contest on a young writers’ website. That is why, when Janine finished Being Amelia and sent it to a publishing company, they wanted to read it right away. They loved it, and a year later, Janine’s book was in stores.

One review of Being Amelia says that even though the cover shows happy teenagers, the characters face real problems. This makes readers believe in them. The reviewer thinks that even though Janine is young and her book is not very long, she is a better writer than many famous authors. 

Janine is still getting used to being a famous writer. She said, “At first, I hid when people saw me in the street, but now it is OK. I want to help other young writers, but they need to find their own way. For me, I just need to spend time with my friends, and then I will have something interesting to write about!”"
76,"I’m Tom. I am fifteen years old. Three years ago, my family and I moved to a castle on a small island. My dad got a job to manage the castle. He works for a group that takes care of old buildings. He was happy to get this job, but we were not sure at first. We thought about how life on the island would be. The castle is not as nice as our home, and there is no school on the island.

After we moved, we got used to living on the island. The castle is not very pretty, but our apartment is comfortable. In summer, many visitors come to the island, and there are parties on the beach. In winter, we only see the other families who live here. There are not many teenagers, which is sad for me. The adults help each other with work on the island.

The biggest change for me is taking a boat to my old school every day. I like going on stormy days when there are big waves, but the ferries do not run then. If I miss the bus to the boat after school, I miss the last ferry home. This makes me worry. When my friends come to visit, I always tell them to hurry!

The views are beautiful, especially when the sun sets over the sea. Some days it is very foggy, and you cannot see anything. But then, in a few hours, it can be sunny again. This is amazing, even after living here for a long time. We do have strong storms, and I sometimes wonder if the castle is safe. But I remember it has been here for many years, and it is still standing!"
77,"I live in a house in the countryside in Scotland. I love nature and animals. Six years ago, I started a new hobby – birdwatching! I went to the mountains in northern Scotland with my family. We saw many birds in nature. I watched them for hours with my parents. They taught me how to tell different birds apart and where to find them. It was amazing! 

After that, I joined a local birdwatchers’ club for young people. My goal is to see 200 different types of birds. I am close to this goal because I have seen birds in other countries on family holidays. We always look for places with birdwatching activities so I can see new birds! 

I have been to Egypt, and last summer I went to South America. I thought I would see my 200th bird there, but I didn’t. I learned that you need to be patient with birdwatching. I made a video about my birdwatching challenge and many teenagers liked it. They said it looked fun. 

My teachers saw the video and asked me to talk about birdwatching at school. I was nervous before I went on stage. I knew what to say and had notes, but many people were watching me! I felt better when it was over. The teachers said I did a good job. I might do another presentation next year!

I am lucky to live in the countryside. I know many teenagers in cities may not think about birdwatching, but there are many birds to see in green areas. I think birdwatching clubs should help more young people enjoy this hobby. Everyone should connect with nature, no matter how old they are, and it doesn’t have to cost a lot of money."
78,"I started playing football when I was 7 years old. I would hurry home from school to play with other kids. I loved it, and I got better at it. My family thought I would stop playing like I did with other hobbies, but I didn’t. I wanted to play football professionally when I grew up. 

One day, I played in a local tournament. A referee saw me and told the manager of a women’s club to watch me. The manager asked me to join her club. I was surprised because I didn’t know young girls could play in women’s clubs. But the manager liked me, and I started training with the club when I was 13 years old. I got much better at football.

Some people were not sure I would be a star player, and that made me a little sad. But my coach told me to believe in myself. He let me play in an important match earlier than I thought I would. I ran very hard because I didn’t want to let my team down. Then, by chance, I scored the winning goal! I could hear my coach cheering for me, and after the game, my team carried me around the field. It was amazing! 

Since then, I have scored many more winning goals. Next month, my coach and I will have a football tournament for teenagers. We want to get them interested in football and help them meet other players. They will see what it is like to play in a big club and feel they can play for a top team if they work hard. I will tell them what my coach told me – there will be good times and bad times. I have been lucky and had very few bad times!"
79,"Text: 

In the UK and other countries, schools and universities want students to start doing research early in their studies. Research is not just for famous scholars or scientists. It is a way to learn and build skills. Research skills are important for studying and for jobs because they help us think about the world and our work.

As a student, you help create knowledge. You do not just repeat what you learn; you ask questions. You might wonder: Why? How? When? What does this mean? What if things were different? These questions are part of research.

Research can be very complex, but it can also be simple. It starts with asking questions about everyday things. Most students have done some research before. You have asked questions for school projects or when you wanted to learn something new. You have researched things like where to go on holiday, how to grow plants, or how to fix things at home.

In college and university, you are expected to ask questions, think critically, and explore ideas. Some students may find this hard because in some cultures, knowledge is seen as fixed. They may think they should only listen to teachers and books. However, in many places like the UK, US, and Europe, it is okay to question what you learn.

Thinking critically is very important in research. You should not just repeat what you read. You need to think about it, test it, and see if it makes sense. It is important to not just accept everything you are told without thinking."
80,"Cities are important places for ideas and creativity. In the past, people met in coffee houses in London to talk about science and politics. In Paris, the artist Pablo Picasso talked about modern art in cafés. But living in a city can be hard. The same cafés in London that helped people talk also spread diseases like cholera. Picasso eventually moved to the countryside.

Today, scientists study how living in a city affects our brains. They found that city life can make us tired and can even make it harder to think. One big reason is that cities do not have enough nature. For example, patients in hospitals get better faster when they can see trees from their windows. Even a little bit of nature helps our brains feel better.

More people now live in cities than in the countryside. We are surrounded by many people and buildings. This can be stressful and can change how we think. When we walk in busy streets, our brains have to pay attention to many things, like other people and cars. This can make us feel tired because our brains have to work hard to focus.

Nature is different. It does not make our brains work as hard. This idea is called attention restoration theory. A psychologist named Stephen Kaplan came up with this idea. He believed that being in nature helps our brains relax and feel better.

Before scientists studied this, philosophers and city planners warned about the problems of city life. They wanted to bring more nature into cities. Parks, like Central Park in New York, give people a break from city life. Spending time in a park can help our brains work better quickly.

Many people look for ways to improve their thinking, like drinking energy drinks or changing office designs. But walking in nature is often the best way to feel better.

Even with the problems of city life, cities keep growing. Research shows that crowded cities can also be places of new ideas and creativity. The many people in cities help create new things, just like in 18th-century London. So, it is important to find ways to make city life better while keeping its benefits. Sometimes, people want to escape to the city, even if they also love nature."
81,"**Where is the mind?**

This is an interesting question. We usually think that thinking happens in our heads. Today, we have special machines that can see what happens in our brains. But I believe we should not only look inside our heads to understand the mind. 

Many things around us help us think. For example, tools, decorations, and writing are important for how we think and grow as humans. This means that what is outside our heads can also be part of our mind. 

Scientists often study people without their things. This is good for understanding the brain, but it can make us forget that we think with the world around us. The mind is more than just the brain. 

I have a new idea called Material Engagement Theory (MET). This idea looks at how objects help us think. For example, when we use clay to make numbers or use a stone to make a tool, these objects help our minds. 

Think about a blind person using a stick. The stick helps the person feel and understand the world. The brain sees the stick as part of the body. This shows that our minds can change and grow with new tools and ideas. 

The mind is always changing. Objects, like tools or phones, help us learn and understand our world. This is why humans create things. These things also help shape our minds. I call this idea metaplasticity. It means our minds can change as we use different objects. 

In conclusion, we should remember that the things we use are important for how we think and understand life. Humans have always used tools to help us think better."
82,"Text: ""Photography is an important invention that changed how we see the world. In the United States, photography became a big part of culture. It is used in many ways, like science, industry, and art. Many people think photography is one of the best contributions to art in the US.

Photography started in the mid-19th century. It was popular because it used machines, and people liked new technology. Just like trains and electricity made travel easier, photography brought images of the world into homes. The camera helped people show who they are and share their lives with others. It also helped families keep memories, even if those memories were not always real.

A photograph shows us something special. It tells us what the photographer wants us to see. Because photographs are made by machines, they show real events and people. But the person taking the photo also adds their own view. This is why photography is called a ""universal language."" However, understanding a photograph can be complicated. The meaning of a photo can change depending on where and how we see it.

For many years, artists did not talk about how important cameras were. But now, artists use photographs in their work. For example, Andy Warhol used photographs in his art. Today, photography is seen as an important part of art, helping us understand and represent the world."""
83,"In 1890, William James, an American thinker and doctor, said that psychology is the ""science of mental life."" This means it studies how we think and feel. Everyone has a mind, so we all have some idea of what this means. We can study psychology in people, rats, and monkeys, but it can be hard to understand.

William James was very interested in how humans think and feel. He believed that our minds have basic parts: our thoughts, our feelings, the world around us, and how we know about these things. Our knowledge is personal and comes from our own experiences. Sometimes, this knowledge is different from scientific facts.

We often think we understand why people act in certain ways. For example, we might think someone is sad or angry. But problems can happen when two people see things differently. Psychology tries to help us find the best explanations for why people behave the way they do. Psychologists help us tell the difference between our personal thoughts and scientific facts.

Psychology studies the mind and brain. However, we do not know everything about how the brain works. Psychologists learn more by watching how people behave. They use these observations to make guesses about what is happening inside our minds. 

Studying psychology is like solving a puzzle. Psychologists look for clues in people's behavior. They must observe carefully and measure things accurately. They also need to think logically and share their ideas with others. 

Psychology aims to describe, understand, predict, and change how people think and act. When psychologists reach these goals, they can help us understand our experiences better. Their findings can help in many areas, like teaching children to read, making machines safer, and helping people express their feelings.

Psychology has been studied for a long time, but only in the last 150 years has it been studied scientifically. Early psychologists looked at their own thoughts to find answers, but this method has limits. Today, psychologists prefer to watch how others behave instead of just thinking about their own experiences."
84,"In a building in Michigan, USA, there is a special place called the Museum of Failed Products. This museum has many products that people did not want to buy. Some examples are A Touch of Yogurt shampoo and Breakfast Cola. The museum is owned by a company called GfK. 

Carol Sherry runs the museum. She believes that each product has a sad story about the people who made and sold it. It is surprising that this museum can make money. Many companies do not keep samples of their failed products. 

The museum started because Robert McMath, a former marketing worker, wanted to collect new products. He did not think about how many products would fail. He learned that most products do not succeed. 

The museum shows how people often think positively about new products. They have meetings where they believe the products will do well, even if they won’t. Sometimes, marketers spend more money on a bad product to try to make it sell. 

There is a popular idea called ""positive visualization."" This means if you think good things will happen, they might happen. But research shows that thinking too much about good outcomes can make people less motivated to work hard. 

Psychologist Carol Dweck says that how we feel about failure depends on our beliefs. Some people think ability is something you are born with. They feel bad when they fail. Other people believe ability can grow with effort. They see failure as a chance to learn and improve. 

Dweck compares this to weight training. When you push your muscles to their limit, they get stronger. Having a growth mindset can make you happier, whether or not you succeed."

Everyone knows that sports teams often do better when they play at home. But why is this? Many people think they know the answer, but things in sports are changing fast. Two main reasons make us question the idea of home advantage: science and money. 

Sports scientists want to understand how players can do their best. They have many ideas about home advantage. At the same time, people who pay the players want to know why home advantage is important. They think that if players are paid enough, they should feel good playing anywhere.

What about the fans? Would it matter if a team like Manchester United played some games far away, in places like the Far East, to reach more fans? Yes, it would matter to fans in Britain. They believe their team needs their support and energy. Fans often think that if they cheer loudly, their team will score. They remember the times when they cheered and a goal was scored, but they forget the times when cheering did not help.

One thing that fans believe is true is that home fans often cheer for their team and also for the referee. In a study, referees watched a game with crowd noise and another game without noise. The referees who heard the crowd were less likely to call fouls against the home team. This means referees try to avoid making calls that would upset the home crowd.

Studies show that home advantage has become less important in many sports, but not by much. For example, in the 1890s, home teams in England won about 70% of the time. Now, they win about 60% of the time. One reason for this change is travel. Today, players travel in comfort, and they stay in nice hotels.

Different sports have different levels of home advantage. Basketball has the most home advantage, followed by football. Baseball has the least home advantage. This might be because baseball is more about individual players, while basketball is about teamwork. In basketball, players feel more confident when they play at home.

Another reason for home advantage could be related to players' feelings. Studies show that players have higher testosterone levels before home games. This might make them feel stronger and more ready to win at home. 

In some recent games, teams that were not expected to win did very well at home. They showed great effort and did not let the other team intimidate them. As one referee said, ""It’s the law of the jungle out there."""
86,"Text: ""Gary Player, a famous golfer, once said, 'The more I practice, the luckier I get.' This saying is important for many athletes and their coaches. It means that when you practice a lot, you get better. 

Some people argue about who first said this quote. Player was not really talking about luck. He meant that practice helps you improve. 

There is a big question about talent: Are people born with talent, or do they get it from practice? Many believe that practice is more important than talent. Psychologist Anders Ericsson said that to be an expert in something, you need to practice for 10,000 hours. Many books, like Malcolm Gladwell’s ""Outliers,"" support this idea. They say practice is the most important thing to become good at something.

However, author Epstein thinks this idea is not always true. He says that many studies look only at very successful people. He wants to find out why some people are good at things and others are not. He travels to many places, like Kenya and Alaska, to learn more.

In Alaska, he finds that the best sled dogs have a strong desire to win. This shows that some abilities might come from genes, not just practice. Epstein believes both nature (genes) and nurture (environment) are important for success. 

He also talks about race and gender in sports. He asks why we have separate competitions for men and women if practice is all that matters. Sometimes, the best questions are the simplest ones."""
87,"Many children in rich countries feel lonely and unhappy. Jay Griffiths asks why this is happening. In her book, Kith, she says that children spend too much time inside, looking at screens like TVs and computers. They do not go outside to enjoy nature, like forests, mountains, and rivers. This is a big problem.

A study talked to children to understand their feelings better. Many children said they would be happier if they could play outside more. Older people often remember their childhoods fondly. They think they had more freedom, like playing outside all day. They believe this was better than how children live today. However, these older people also made rules to keep their children safe, which means kids do not have the same freedom.

Griffiths writes about how parents worry about dangers outside. This worry makes them keep their children at home. Companies sell toys and gadgets to keep children entertained indoors. She also talks about strange rules, like making children wear goggles to play games. Some of these rules may not be very common, but Griffiths is upset about them.

Griffiths believes children should be free to explore and take risks. She thinks children learn how to be safe by having small accidents. However, she does not explain how to let children have these small accidents safely. Not all children want to play outside or take risks. Some children are shy or prefer to stay at home. It might not be fair to make all children act the same way."
88,"I am a bio-psychologist. I have studied a lot. I am good at solving problems in my work and life. But school does not teach us how to solve all problems. Many problems need life experiences, not just school learning. For children, play is very important for learning. 

All young animals, including humans, play. Animals that need to learn more play the most. For example, meat-eating animals play more than plant-eating animals because hunting is harder to learn. Monkeys play more than other animals because they need to learn many things. Children play a lot because they have much to learn. 

Play helps children learn important skills. These skills are not taught in school. Children learn to think creatively, get along with others, and control their feelings through play. Creativity is very important for success in life. We need people who can think of new ideas and solve new problems. 

Some adults, called geniuses, keep their playful minds. Albert Einstein said school almost made him lose his love for math and science. He found it again after school. He called his creative work ""combinatorial play."" He imagined chasing a sunbeam to understand his ideas.

We cannot teach creativity, but school can take it away. School often focuses on answers that are already known, instead of letting children ask their own questions. It is also important for children to get along with others and care for them. Children want to play with each other, and through play, they learn to be fair and kind.

Play is fun and voluntary. If you cannot stop playing, it is not really play. Players must keep each other happy to continue the game. 

Today, school is harder. There are fewer breaks, more homework, and more pressure for good grades. Outside of school, adults often control games instead of letting children play freely. This has changed slowly over time. Parents worry, and experts warn about dangers. Many believe children learn better from adults than from each other.

Our children do not need more school. They need more play. If we care about children, we must let them play and explore. This will help them grow into strong adults ready for the future."
89,"In many countries, more young people in their twenties are using social media to find jobs. Websites like Twitter and LinkedIn help them connect with employers. This is easier than before when people had to stand outside offices with signs that said ""hire me."" But using social media can also lead to mistakes.

For example, a young man in the US tried to connect with a marketing executive on LinkedIn. He thought she could help him find a job because she knew many important people. However, she was upset that he asked her to share her contacts. She rejected his request and sent a mean message that many people saw online. People were shocked by her message, and she might regret how she wrote it. 

This situation shows that young people need to be careful when using social media for jobs. Many young people use sites like Facebook and Twitter for fun, but using them for work is different. When I was a teenager, social media was a way to escape from parents and teachers. It was a place to show off and be creative. You could talk to someone online and then ignore them at school. You could also make yourself look different with pictures and songs on Facebook.

But now, using social media for work is not the same. Some young people still act like they did when they were teenagers. Just because many people liked your posts on Facebook does not mean you will get a job on LinkedIn. We need to understand that what we learned as teens does not work for jobs. 

Employers often say that young job seekers are too casual and seem arrogant. This makes older people think badly of us. In reality, many young people are worried about finding jobs, which is why they use social media. This impression of being arrogant can hurt their chances of getting hired, even if they have the skills to do the job.

So, how should you contact someone on a professional site? First, say who you are and explain how you can help them. This way, they are more likely to reply. Avoid sending the same message to many people, and be polite. Remember, social media can help you make good connections, but you need to use it carefully to avoid problems."
90,"Text: ""It is hard to know what will happen to newspapers in the future. Many people think newspapers are in trouble. Since 2000, many newspapers in the UK have lost a lot of readers. In the USA, only 26 out of 100 people get their news from newspapers now, down from 45 out of 100 in 2001. Some people say that printed newspapers will be gone in 15 years. 

But history shows that old types of media often stay around. In 1835, a journalist said that books and theaters would not be popular anymore, and that newspapers would be the most important. But theaters are still here, even with movies and TV. Radio is still popular, and movies are still watched, even with videos and DVDs. 

Newspapers were once new too. It took a long time for them to become the main way to get news. This happened because it became easier to share news with many people. People also started to think that things change all the time and we need to know what is happening. In the past, people thought life was more about seasons and big events like floods or diseases. 

Before the 19th century, being a journalist was not a real job for many people. Most people did not need news every day or week. Now, we can get news online whenever we want. We can choose what news we want to read. When big news happens, we can get updates very quickly. 

But newspapers often do not explain things well. They may be in danger of disappearing. Or maybe, as the internet makes things feel more confusing, newspapers can help us understand the world better."""

Humans are not very good at seeing in the dark. We are used to the light of the sun. This is part of who we are. Many animals, like owls and bats, can see well at night. They feel comfortable in the dark. But we have changed the night by adding a lot of light. This is called light pollution. 

Light pollution happens when we use too much artificial light. This light goes up into the sky instead of down where we need it. Because of this, the night is not dark anymore. Many animals, including birds, are affected by this light. They can get confused and fly into bright buildings or lights. Some birds even sing at night because of the light.

In the past, people used candles and lanterns. The night was much darker. Now, we have bright lights everywhere. This makes it hard for us to see the stars and the night sky. 

Darkness is important for all living things. It helps us sleep and stay healthy. When we have too much light, it can make us feel unwell. We need both light and dark to be healthy. 

In the end, light pollution makes us forget how special the night is. We lose our connection to nature and the universe."
92,"A company leader said that his business will not keep track of how much holiday time employees take. He got this idea from another internet company that does the same thing. He said his daughter sent him a happy email about it. 

The leader thinks that employees can take as much time off as they want, but they must be sure that their work is done and that their team is okay. However, this might be hard to do. The internet company has 2,000 workers, but the leader's company has 50,000 workers. In a smaller company, workers know each other better and can help each other more easily. 

If workers feel guilty about taking time off, they might not take any holiday at all. This can make them stressed and less productive. Also, if workers worry about what their colleagues think, they might feel pressured to work more and take less time off. 

In many companies, workers often stay late, and this can make it hard for them to take holidays. If workers do not feel safe to take their holiday, they might think they look lazy. This could make them not take their holiday time, even if they have it. 

Today, technology makes it easy to get work messages anytime, which can mix work and free time. The internet company started their new holiday policy because workers wanted to change the old way of tracking time off. But without set working hours, workers might feel like they always have to work. 

Workers have the right to take time off because it is important for their health. Good feelings and creativity can happen even if workers are not always happy. So, I am not sure if this new holiday policy will really help workers take the time off they need."

Peer review is when experts check a scientific paper before it is published. This process is important because it helps make sure that the research is good and correct. However, it can take a long time, sometimes up to a year, to publish a paper because of this review. Some people think this is good, while others do not.

There is a new way to share research called preprints. Preprints are drafts of papers that are shared online before they are reviewed. This allows other scientists to read and discuss the work quickly. Many scientists still want their papers to be checked before they are published, but preprints can help share new ideas faster.

Publishing in well-known journals is very competitive. Scientists want to publish their best work to get recognition and advance their careers. But this can lead to problems, like not sharing all the important data. Reviewers may focus more on whether a paper is good enough for a journal rather than if it is good science.

Some scientists are afraid that preprints will allow bad science to be published. But preprints are open for everyone to see and discuss, which can help improve the work. For example, a psychology professor shared her paper as a preprint. This way, the original authors could respond to her critique, and everyone could see the discussion.

Preprints allow scientists to talk about their work with others around the world. They can also share negative results, which are often ignored by journals. Sharing papers as preprints can lead to more people reading and citing the work. This shows that preprints can be a good way to share research quickly and openly."
94,"When I ask my students what a poem is, they often say it is ""a painting in words."" But this answer does not make me happy, and it does not make them happy either. One day, I asked my students to pick an object and write about it. They had to write one paragraph like a scientist and another paragraph from the object’s point of view, calling it ""Poem."" One student wrote: 

""Poem 
I may look strange or scary, but I help people breathe. I am used only in emergencies and for a short time. Most people will never use me."" 

The object was an oxygen mask. This choice helped the class understand how poetry works. The exercise was fun and led to good discussions. 

When I was in school, poetry was confusing for me. I thought every poem was a silly puzzle that made it hard to understand feelings. After school, many people read less poetry. Sometimes, you see a poem, and it is not like regular writing. It makes you want to read it, but often you feel let down because it is not interesting or hard to understand. 

What do we want from poems? We want deep feelings, beautiful images, and clever thoughts. But if we want tears, we watch movies. If we want information, we read articles. Novels take us to new worlds, and music is special with its words and sounds. 

However, poems can be unclear. Life is often unclear too. But this does not tell us what a poem really is. If you look up ""poem"" online, it says it is a type of art that uses beautiful and rhythmic language. This is hard to understand. The word ""poem"" comes from Greek and means ""a thing made."" A poet is someone who makes things. 

So, what kind of thing is a poem? Some poets say poems are like wild animals – hard to control – or like machines – made with care. But these ideas do not explain everything. The best part of trying to define a poem is the discussion it creates. Whether you think a poem is a machine or a wild animal, it can change how you think about both. 

Poems can be easy to remember, like song lyrics. Words and music can stick in our heads. A poem on a page can have a strong effect, even if it looks like regular writing. The space around a poem in a magazine could be used for something else, but a poem is special. 

A poem is written and rewritten like a story or article, but it is not just for selling. Publishers send out poetry books, but they do not expect to make money from them. A poem is not just a product; it is something special. Because it is different in a book or magazine, a poem can surprise us, even if just for a moment."
95,"I bought my first metal detector after I got married. It cost £70, which was a lot of money then. My wife, Marion, was very happy when I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first trip. Over the years, I found many things like brooches and coins. I liked feeling connected to the past. 

After the gold ring, it took 40 years to find something that impressed Marion again. One rainy February afternoon, I had some time to search. I went to a place where I knew there were old farming tools. My metal detector beeped, and I found a piece of a metal wheel. Then it beeped again. I dug down into the mud and found a round, golden ball. I was excited but tried not to get my hopes up. 

As I cleaned it, I saw it was a beautiful, twisted necklace. I remembered seeing something like it in the British Museum. It was called a torc, and it is very old, from over 2,000 years ago. I took it to my car and looked at it all the way home. I washed it in my kitchen sink. 

When Marion came home, I shouted, “I have something for you!” She asked what it was, and I told her it was a very old piece of jewelry. We didn’t try it on because we didn’t want to break it. At night, I hid it in our wardrobe. I was worried about it being stolen, so I put it under a floorboard in my office. 

The law says I must tell the authorities about my find within 14 days. I wanted to enjoy the torc before I gave it up. I even took it to show a friend in the hospital. Finally, I took it to the council office. The man there was surprised when he saw it. They confirmed it was real, and later it was sold to my local council. Now, it is in the British Museum in London. 

I got £350,000 from the sale, which I shared with the owner of the field. But the torc is more than just money. It is something I have saved for everyone. People ask if I will stop using my metal detector now that I found something so great. But I still enjoy finding brooches and coins. Just like a fisherman who catches a big fish, I will keep searching for more treasures."
96,"Sleeping is one of my favorite things to do when I travel, but I don’t talk about it much because I feel a bit guilty. When my friends tell me about their busy trips with many activities, like visiting museums and hiking, I just smile and don’t say much. What would they think if they knew I like to take long naps and sleep in nice beds when I travel? 

Sleeping better is one good thing about traveling. When I went to Mexico when I was young, I was surprised that I slept more than 12 hours most days. There were loud birds outside, but it didn’t bother me. Far from home, I could sleep deeply and have nice dreams. Without alarms and worries, I could sleep easily. 

I think sleep is part of traveling, not just a break from it. When we travel, we see, hear, and smell new things. All these new experiences fill our minds, and when we sleep, we process them. That’s why sleep feels different when we travel. 

People often worry about jet lag, but I think it’s more about getting used to new places and cultures. For example, in Trinidad, people wake up very early to avoid the heat, then they rest when the sun is high, and they come alive again in the cool evening. Even though Trinidad is only one hour ahead of New York, it takes me days to get used to their sleep patterns. When I finally do, I feel like I belong there.

I remember one afternoon in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic. I had a big lunch with new friends in an apartment by the blue sea. After eating, we all felt sleepy and started to rest on hammocks and sofas. I understood why my friends had so many pillows. I joined them and took a nap. I had heard about the siesta, but that day I really experienced it. I shared not just sleep, but a part of Dominican life.

Travel sleep is special because I remember it. In new places, I enjoy the different smells, textures, and sounds while I sleep. If traveling slowly means enjoying every moment instead of rushing, then sleeping is the slowest thing we can do. Maybe I should not feel shy about my love for sleep and tell my friends that sleeping while traveling is also an important part of the experience."
97,"The woman looked at herself in the mirror. “What do you think? Be honest,” she asked. Mia, the hat seller, picked up a nice hat with a soft layer and a silk bow. “I think this one looks best on you,” she said politely. The woman made a funny face and said, “But it is so boring. Every other woman will wear a hat like that at my daughter’s wedding. This pretty little hat will make me special.” She touched the small red and black hat on her head. “Yes, this is the one I want,” she decided. 

Mia smiled and agreed that the woman would stand out at the wedding. She thought about her own daughter, Jen. It was Jen’s thirtieth birthday today, and they were having a family party. Mia was excited to see Jen, Dan, and Luke. She was also curious about Jen’s friend, Tattie, who they did not know. Mia’s husband, Jeff, had asked, “What kind of name is that?” when Jen called to say she was bringing Tattie. “It’s short for Tatiana,” Mia explained. “I think it’s nice.” Jeff did not agree. He thought Mia was too polite and should say what she really thought.

After an hour, Mia finished work and went home. It took her only forty seconds to get there. Four years ago, when their youngest child, Luke, left home, Mia decided to turn an old barn into a place to sell hats. Jeff was not sure if people wanted to buy hats. But Mia knew many women had trouble finding the right hat for special occasions. She was right. After Jen helped her make a website, Mia’s Hats became very popular. Women came from far away to try on hats in her shop in Little Pelham. Mia made sure they felt comfortable and could try on many hats. She even encouraged them to bring their outfits. Recently, she started selling handbags and jewelry too."

Lawrence came to Atlanta to train for the discus. He wanted to get ready for the world championships. He was also thinking about American football. When he got to the USA, he decided to try it. He applied to join the NFL trials in Atlanta, even though he had no experience in football.

When asked if he was nervous about trying out, he said no. He believes in himself. He did very well in the tests and drills, and people noticed him. He felt happy to hear that he was the best player in the trials.

Lawrence knows he has a lot to learn. He is not worried about being chosen for a team. He said, “There’s no pressure on me.” He remembers his last place in the Olympic final, but he is proud that he made it to the final.

Playing in the NFL can earn him a lot of money, so he is excited. He has changed from rugby to athletics and now to American football. Some people think he should focus on just one sport, but Lawrence wants to try everything. He believes he can go back to throwing the discus if football does not work out. He is following his dreams."
99,"I woke up on a plane flying east. It was morning, and I looked out the window. Below me, I saw brown and green land. It was September, but it was still summer in Siberia. There were no people around, just mountains, rivers, and forests. My neighbor woke up and smiled. “Good morning, Robert,” he said with a Russian accent. His name was Sergei. He was a salesman from Moscow. He was going to sell safety clothes to miners.

I told Sergei I was going to Magadan in Siberia. I had a one-way ticket because I wanted to ride my bicycle back to England. “But, Robert,” he said, “there is no road from Magadan. You cannot ride a bicycle.” I thought there was a road, but not many people used it. “Alone?” he asked. “No, I will ride with my friend Al,” I said. “Just one friend?” he asked. “Yes, just one,” I nodded. Sergei looked worried and pointed outside. “Holodna,” he said, which means cold. I told him I had warm clothes, but I didn’t say I was on a tight budget. I bought most of my clothes on sale. I was not sure if they would keep me warm, especially my big trousers that I bought for £10.

This adventure started in a classroom in Scotland. The teacher was talking, and the students were tired. I had an idea. I wrote a note to my friend Al, who was sitting in front of me. I asked him if he wanted to cycle across the Karakorum Highway between Pakistan and China. I passed the note to him. He wrote back, “OK.” 

Now, six years later, I was going to meet Al in Siberia. I had been a geography teacher. The job was hard but exciting, and I had long holidays to go on adventures. I visited Al twice during these holidays. After our bike ride in Pakistan, Al wanted to cycle around the world. He was taking on big challenges. Sometimes he thought the trip was too hard, but I admired him. He was having an amazing adventure and facing his fears every day."
100,"In The Red Bull Air Race, twelve pilots race through tall pylons. The pylons are between 15 and 25 metres high. The pilots fly very fast, up to 370 km per hour. I was invited to try this flying. 

One hour before my flight, I signed two papers. The first paper said I was healthy. The second paper said I would take everything out of my pockets. Small things can be dangerous when flying. I learned that I must look at the horizon. The pilot would tell me where to look. I also had to promise to relax and enjoy the view when flying upside down.

Half an hour before the flight, I had a safety talk. I was told not to touch anything. When we started to fly, I was very nervous. I had to keep my legs up and not touch the important pedals and switches. I knew I should stay calm, but I was scared.

The pilot, Dario, and I took off. The plane went up quickly and turned sharply to the right. I felt the air push out of my lungs. I looked at the horizon and held my breath. For a moment, I felt very heavy. Then we flew straight again. We turned left and went down fast. I felt my stomach drop. 

We flew very close to the pylons at 400 km per hour. I was excited but also scared. For two minutes, I got to fly the plane. My hands were shaking. Dario then did a barrel roll, which is a full turn in the air. I was okay, but I thought it was too much. 

At the top of a loop, we were upside down. I heard a voice telling me to relax and look up. I saw fields below us. The flight was over in 10 minutes. It was easier than what the pilots do in the race. When we landed, Dario ate sandwiches, but I could not eat for a long time. That night, I dreamed about flying in loops."
101,"Doug Allan makes films about wild animals in cold places. If you have seen polar bears in a nature show, he might have filmed them. He likes it very cold, around -18C. Doug studied marine biology and was a diver. He learned how to survive in cold water. 

His big chance came when a TV crew came to Antarctica, where he was working. He helped them find good places to film. After two days, he realized he loved being a wildlife cameraman. He could travel, have adventures, and dive underwater. Now, he is a famous cameraman and has worked on many wildlife TV shows.

When Doug started 35 years ago, the camera technology was very simple. It is easier to film now. Before, he had to remember what he filmed. Now, with digital cameras, he can see what he filmed right away. He has a lot of experience in cold places. He knows how to work on sea ice. He does get cold feet, but he says the poles are healthy. There are no leeches or mosquitoes there.

Doug says wildlife filming has many successes, but also mistakes. Once, he went to the Orkneys to film birds called kittiwakes, but he could not tell which birds they were. Recently, he got to film in Kong Karls Land, a place in the Arctic Ocean. It is very cold there, usually -32C in April, and the wind is strong. Carrying cameras in deep snow is hard. 

After walking for five hours a day for 23 days, he saw only one mother polar bear and her cub. But on the 24th day, he felt like he was part of the bear world. He waited and watched. Suddenly, he saw a polar bear's nose, then its head. The bear came out of the snow and looked at him. Then, it slid down a slope, and two cubs appeared. Doug felt lucky to see this.

Now, Doug wants to make his own film about climate change in the Arctic. He wants to talk to the people who live there and see how it affects them. He believes he can make a great documentary."

Pen and two friends will walk for three months, covering 1,000 kilometers to the North Pole. They will measure the ice to see how thick it is. No one has done this before, and the information is very important for scientists. It will help us understand how global warming is changing the ice in the polar areas.

When he was a child, Pen was raised by a woman who worked for a famous polar explorer. She made him tough by sending him outside in bad weather with few clothes. His father also loved adventures in the cold, and Pen became very strong. 

Pen is married to Mary, who loves horses. She helps him with his polar guide business. Mary says she worries more about him when he is at home because he thinks about the Arctic. For fun, she once raced against him in a mountain event and finished an hour before him. 

Pen and Mary live in the countryside with their two children. He finds it harder to be away from them this time. When he left before, he told his son to take care of his mother and sister. This made his son very worried. Now, Pen plans to talk to them less while he is in the Arctic because he does not want to remind them how far away he is. 

In the days before he leaves, he is getting ready and checking his equipment. He says it is hard to fix things on the ice. He will be with Ann Daniels, a top polar explorer, and Martin Hartley, a photographer. They will have a team of six people to help them.

Pen is also thinking about his age. He will be 47 soon and feels he has not trained enough. He is worried about what he will have to do. He believes this trip is important because it will help scientists learn more about the Arctic Ocean. He wants to share this knowledge with many people. He feels that their skills are now very useful again."
103,"I took a year off. I thought about what to do. Being an Olympian is special. I wrote more, worked on TV, and talked to businesses and schools. I liked these activities, but I wanted to compete again. I wanted to stay fit to try for the Olympics if I felt that way again. So, I joined marathons and triathlons. 

But then, I remembered Ben Fogle, a TV presenter. He asked me, “Do you want to row across the Atlantic with me?” I love rowing and the feeling of the boat in the water. I missed it, but I was not ready to train every day. Still, I wanted some competition. I asked my rowing friends if they wanted to join the race, but they were not excited. 

I knew if I joined the race, I would want to win. But rowing with Ben might not help me win. However, being an underdog without pressure sounded nice. I talked to Ben. He was going to join the race anyway and had found the money for the entry fee and a boat. This made the race feel real. 

We talked about the costs. The boat and equipment would cost £70,000, which is a lot of money. We thought we had a good chance, but it would take work. I also had to think about losing money because I would be away from home. Speaking at business events is a good way to earn money after being a sportsman. It feels nice that people want to hear me speak. But I find it hard to talk about my past without a new goal. 

Joining the race would mean I was doing something again: rowing across the Atlantic. I learned a lot while planning this adventure. One big lesson was to be thankful for the easy life of a full-time athlete. Training for the Olympics was hard, but it was simple. I trained almost every day, but I had a set plan and help from doctors and dieticians. 

I worried about what people would think of me racing with a TV presenter. I thought they might think I just wanted to be on TV. But my worries went away as we prepared. The Atlantic Rowing Race is not just about rowing; it is also about the mind. Ben had done tough challenges before, but he could not row well. I was surprised by how little he knew about rowing, and he was surprised by my lack of patience. I could have been more patient, but I needed to tell him how much he needed to improve. I should have known what to expect when I agreed to race with him."
104,"Text: 

A little over a year ago, I left my job to work with huskies in the Arctic Circle in Finland. I was 26 years old and wanted a change. I dreamed of cold, snowy places because I was tired of busy London. I found a small company run by Anna and Pasi in Finnish Lapland. They hired me to help with the huskies during the winter. From December to February, many tourists come to ride sleds pulled by huskies. The company started with six dogs, but now they have more than 100. They also have a second place called the 'wilderness farm,' which is simple and does not have running water. They told me I could work with them for three months, but the work would be hard.

On November 6, I flew to Finland. I looked at a page with pictures of huskies. I needed to remember their names, but I was nervous. I looked out the window and saw winter coming, with rivers freezing.

On November 7, I took a bus north. The bus ride was beautiful. We drove through dark forests with snow on the trees. I arrived at the farm at night. Anna gave me boots and sent me outside into the cold. She asked if I wanted to start working right away. I followed the sound of barking and found the huskies. They were very excited. I tried to introduce myself, but everyone was busy. I petted one of the quieter dogs. Then someone told me to get in the sled, and we started our ride in the dark.

By November 15, I was learning how to be a husky guide. Anna asked if I was useful, but I didn’t know. I had never driven a snowmobile or used an axe. But I had a driving license, which was good. I learned how to dog-sled quickly: lean in the corners, use both feet to stop, and hold the handlebar tight. Simple tasks like feeding the dogs were hard in the cold. Water would freeze quickly, so we made hot meat soup for the dogs. 

By the end of my first week, I was tired but happy. I could chop with an axe, hammer a nail, and use a saw. I told my friends, ""I can do these things in the snow!"""
105,"On that day, Radcliffe ran very fast and crossed the finish line. Many reporters came to talk to her about her amazing run. They said her time was good enough to compete in the men's marathon in Paris. The reporters asked her about emu oil, a special oil that helps heal injuries. Cathy Freeman, an Olympic champion, had told Radcliffe to use it after she hurt herself when she ran into a bike while training.

Radcliffe said she did not think much about her big achievement at the time. She felt it was just what she was meant to do that day. She and her team believed in no limits. During the race, her husband Gary and her physiotherapist Gerard were in a car, listening to the race on the radio. After 16 kilometers, Radcliffe's agent worried she might not keep up her fast pace. Gerard was angry about this because he knew how fit she was.

With 800 meters left, Radcliffe thought she could finish in under 2 hours and 16 minutes if she ran fast. She had already run 41 kilometers quickly, and she finished the last part in 2 minutes and 25 seconds. At the end, she thought, ""I can run faster than that."" The race director, Dave Bedford, said he never thought anyone would run that fast for a long time. Radcliffe thought she would come back and do it again next year, but that did not happen.

After the race, everyone wanted to know how Radcliffe, who ran differently, beat the skilled East African runners. Gerard worked with Radcliffe a lot, helping her with her training. He said she could handle a lot of pain. He traveled 13 hours from Ireland to help her train in France. When he arrived, her husband would say, ""Gerard, you're late, Paula is waiting."" There was no time for tea; she wanted to start training right away.

Gerard spent so much time with Radcliffe that other athletes were unhappy. When asked why no one has come close to her record, Radcliffe said she trained hard, but others might be more talented. She thought Mary Keitany, a two-time London marathon winner, could do it. Radcliffe believed that runners should focus on pushing themselves, not just racing against others. She did not know it at the time, but that marathon was the best she would ever run. However, she inspired many women to start long-distance running."
106,"When my first cooking show, In Search of Perfection, started, I was nervous. I did not know if people would like it. There was a lot of talk about a new way of cooking in Britain. I thought we made a good show that was different, but I worried if people would enjoy cooking that included history and science. 

I watched the first show with both happiness and fear. I did not need to worry. The show became very popular. This success helped me create other projects, including a book about my restaurant. Each project felt like a journey into the past, the mind, or cooking skills. I wrote many books in a series called ‘Perfection’, each with its own TV show. In these, I traveled to many places with my passport and suitcase.

The latest book is called In Search of Total Perfection. In this book, I meet amazing people, like a man who makes special pasta that tastes great. These people have spent many years trying to make their food perfect. 

Perfection means different things to different people. Choosing which dishes to show was hard. I knew some people would be upset if their favorite dish was not included. I could hear them asking, “Where is steak and kidney pie?” But after many meetings, my team and I made a list that had something for everyone. 

I believe everyone has their own idea of perfection based on their feelings and memories. Even though the book is called ‘Perfection’, I did not say the recipes were the best. I used my cooking skills and talked to many food makers and chefs to find out what makes these dishes good. 

The word ‘perfection’ means being perfect, but it also means trying new ideas and improving them. The TV show let me explore many foods, people, and places I had never seen before. I was excited to learn about food and memories because I started my career in the same way. 

Finding the best ingredients took me around the world. I had many adventures, like visiting a factory that was not making the right tomatoes and a dairy farm that was not good enough for filming. I tried many cooking techniques, like milking a cow by hand and making ice cream with dry ice. I even cooked chicken in a hospital machine and almost burned my house while trying to make a real Neapolitan pizza."
107,"We were still far from Marrakech when the van made a loud noise, went off the road into a field, and stopped. John got out and looked at the engine. He stood there for a long time with his hands in his pockets. He looked serious. Then he said, “I don’t know what I’m doing.” Mum and John started to laugh. Bea was worried. “We can’t stay here forever,” she said. The field was big. It had grass and many flowers, like poppies and daisies. I said, “No, we can’t stay here forever,” because I wanted to agree with Bea. We got back into the van and waited for Mum and John to stop laughing. We watched John walk away to find someone who could help with the van. Mum lay on the grass. “Tell us a story,” she said. Bea lay down next to her. “Go on, tell us a story.” So, I told them about two birds I heard talking before we left London. I told them what the birds talked about: breadcrumbs, other birds, the weather, and an argument over a worm. “That’s silly, no one understands bird language,” Bea said. I felt sad. “I do.” But I didn’t sound sure. “Liar,” Bea said. I felt embarrassed. How could I be lying if I remembered everything? I thought about asking Mum, but she was asleep in the sun. 

John came back with three Moroccan boys. They helped us push the van to the hotel. Bea didn’t want to get out. The boys waved and smiled at her through the windows. We followed John into a café. It was not far from where our van was parked. “It’s a hotel,” John whispered. “It might be expensive.” “We’ll just have some tea,” Mum said, and we sat in the shade. The tea was made from mint leaves and was very sweet. Mum looked in the pot. “It’s like syrup,” she said. We stayed at the café all day while John looked at the engine. “It’s a miracle it got us this far,” he said when it got dark. Mum made a bed for us outside in the hotel garden. It felt nice to sleep on the ground. “I will have to get us towed to Marrakech,” John said. 

Half an hour later, we were in a truck watching our van being pulled behind. At first, Bea didn’t want to move, so John picked her up and put her in the truck. Now she sat in the front with the driver. I wondered how we would get home since our van had to be pulled everywhere. I thought it might be easier to take a boat to London. Then I fell asleep."
108,"Lucy was at a welcome party in a hotel. She was talking to two other pianists. One was a guy from Tokyo, and the other was a girl from Europe. Lucy did not know the girl’s name well because it was loud. They were both older than Lucy by about ten years. They spoke good English and talked about their music and travels. 

Lucy said, “I think I’m going to Tanglewood this summer.” This sounded impressive, but Lucy did not really want to go. She was busy with concerts and competitions. She missed a lot of school and was not officially a student anymore. Instead, she learned with tutors from the University of San Francisco. 

Lucy did not want to come to the Prague Festival. Only fifteen pianists her age were chosen from many applicants. Lucy’s dad bought her a necklace to celebrate. Her little brother, Gus, dreamed of being in the festival one day. Her teacher, Grace, took her out for a special dinner to plan her music pieces. 

Lucy did not apply to the festival. Her mom filled out the form and sent in a CD. Her mom said, “I didn’t want you to be sad if you didn’t get in.” Lucy thought her mom did not want her to say no. At that time, Lucy thought it was bad to say no to things.

The guy from Tokyo asked, “How old are you?” Lucy said, “Fifteen.” He looked surprised. Lucy did not mean to show off. She was just sharing. The girl from Europe left to talk to someone else. 

The guy asked, “Have you ever been to Japan?” Lucy said, “Once, when I was eight.” Just then, Lucy’s grandfather came to her. He said, “Lucy, let me introduce you to someone.” He took her away from the conversation. He told her not to be too friendly with the other pianists. 

“They are not the competition,” Lucy said. “Everyone is the competition,” her grandfather replied. He took her around the room to meet important people. Lucy smiled and nodded, but she only understood some of what they said. 

In the elevator after the party, her grandfather said, “You did well, Lucy. I’m proud of you. This festival is important, and people know who you are.” Lucy liked that. She liked being someone special, even if some people were jealous. Being a concert pianist did not make her popular at school. Even her best friend, Reyna, did not know or care about her music skills. But here, Lucy felt she mattered."

“Dad said, ‘You spend too much time online. You need to go outside.’ I wanted to learn more, so I read what experts say about this. They say it is interesting. Many teenagers who use social media have real friends, feel good about themselves, and learn important skills for the digital world.

Simon Miles, an expert, says social media is a big part of growing up today. Teenagers use it all the time, not just to check emails or buy things like adults. He says it is not good or bad; it depends on how you use it.

Jim Matthews, a social media expert, says social media is like a youth club. It helps teenagers talk to friends, share jokes, and learn about life away from their parents. 

Professor Keith Davidson, a psychologist, says being a teenager is a time to ask, “Who am I?” Social media can help with this. You can share your favorite music or sports and see how others think. He says teenagers who use social media are not selfish. It can help shy people feel more comfortable talking to others.

Professor Andrew Phillips studies how young people use social media. He thinks it helps quiet people with special interests connect with others. If you like a certain type of music and only a few people at school do too, you can find many others online who like it. 

Pauline White, a digital expert, says teenagers can find new interests online and create their own content. She believes social media helps creativity. Teenagers can make videos, podcasts, and blogs about what they like. 

She also says that knowing how to use social media is important for jobs. Businesses use social media to sell things. If you have many friends online, they can be customers for your product. 

Experts agree that using social media creatively will help teenagers when they grow up and look for jobs. Working with others online is a valuable skill today.”"
110,"When people think of a family vacation, they might not think of a long trip across many states in the US and Canada. But my parents wanted to have a fun summer vacation this year. My dad wanted to plan a big family trip. He said, “Not many people do this anymore.” My twin brother and I looked at each other and thought, “Maybe there is a reason for that!”

In mid-June, we packed our car with bags and food. I was excited but also worried about not having my own space for two weeks. We started our trip called “The Family Great American Road Trip.” We left our big house and drove for a long time. I wondered what would happen next.

We drove west through Oklahoma. We had some adventures, like stopping for the night in a small town. We saw many stars in the sky but almost got blown off the road by a dust storm. We learned that cows have the right to cross the road!

The next day, we woke up early and drove again. We saw deserts and then mountains. Each day was different, but they all felt similar. We left our footprints in the Great Sand Dunes and went to Pagosa Springs, Colorado. It smelled funny there, but it was nice.

As we drove, we saw many old and new things. We got stuck in traffic because of construction. We laughed at the big “CLOSED” signs at the Four Corners Monument. We saw many wind farms on our way to Yellowstone National Park. There, we watched the sunset and saw bears near the road. Sometimes, traffic stopped to let bears cross, and we had a close encounter with one!

As we continued our trip, I forgot about home. The hotel we stayed in was old and didn’t have internet, but the views were amazing. After watching a rainstorm from our hotel in Canada, we drove back home. My parents were right; you don’t need to go far to find something special.

When we got home, I was happy to be with my family again. We took three thousand photos of our trip. I knew I would remember the fun and unexpected moments the most."
111,"Rose Frost was sixteen years old. She was going to live with her grandmother, Daisy. Rose's family was separating for two years. Her father, Jeff, had a job in another country, and her mother, Dahlia, would go with him. Rose and her older sister, Amy, would stay in England. Amy was finishing her last year of school and would live at the college. She had a nice room with a kitchen and a study area. Amy could use the Internet and phone for free. Their parents would watch over Amy.

Rose was moving to her grandmother’s house. She only remembered a few happy times with Daisy. Rose had never met her grandfather. Daisy wanted Rose to stay with her, and Rose's parents were not happy about it. They had a problem with Daisy, but Rose did not know why. Rose had not seen Daisy since she was ten years old.

Dahlia said living with Daisy would be interesting. Daisy liked to meet people and go to events. Rose thought this was nice. Daisy was not a typical old lady; she went to many social events. Before moving, Dahlia talked to Rose. Rose was smart and knew about healthy eating and exercise. But she wanted to be independent. She wanted to play music loud, invite friends over, and go out without asking for permission. She hoped Daisy would understand.

Dahlia gave Rose a new mobile phone for emergencies. Rose was very happy. They agreed to trust each other. Rose would act mature, and Daisy would not be too strict. If they had problems, they would talk about it.

Rose was not a wild child. She had good friends and did well in school. In five weeks, she would start at a new school. This was her fourth school in five years, but she knew it was the last time. Rose was ready for a new start in her life."
112,"Charlotte Grainger had a teacher in primary school who thought she might write a book one day. Charlotte wanted to write a book because it seemed like a big challenge. When she turned 13, she decided to try. Now, her book is going to be published. She told her old teacher about it, and the teacher was surprised. The teacher thought Charlotte would write a book when she was older, like 30 or 40. But Charlotte didn’t understand why she should wait.

It was a winter afternoon when I met Charlotte at her publisher's office. I knew I was going to talk to a 15-year-old girl about her book, but I was surprised to see her there. Her book is very good. It has a lot of action, and it does not seem like it was written by a teenager. A person from the publishing company was with us, but Charlotte did not need help. She is confident and smart, but she is also calm.

Charlotte knows she is young. When I asked her about the big questions in her book, she said, “I wanted to ask big questions, not give answers. I don’t have many life lessons to share.” She thinks that teenagers are often shown in a bad way in books. She said there are three types of teenagers in stories: the outsider who becomes accepted, the naïve teenager who knows nothing, and the awkward teenager who is not good in social situations. 

Charlotte was annoyed by these types. She said, “What if you are just fine? There are not many stories about normal teenagers. Some writers make teenagers feel like they don’t know who they are, and that can hurt their confidence.”

Charlotte loves to read fantasy books, but sometimes they made her not want to write. She thought, “Do I have to write like this to make a good book?” However, she liked a book called How Not to Write a Novel. It says that if the reader can guess what will happen, the story is not exciting anymore.

Charlotte’s parents are both journalists, and this helped her get her book published. Her father knew someone in publishing who read her book first. She knows she is lucky because it is hard to get someone to read a first book. She said, “Every writer needs help and a bit of luck, but after that, it is up to them. Writers succeed or fail based on their talent, so I don’t take anything for granted.”"
113,"""Remember, going fast is good, not bad,"" said Gareth, our teacher, as we looked at the ski slope. ""Who wants to go first?"" Everyone looked scared. Then David, who had skied before, went first. He skied down the slope and jumped. He went up in the air, but something was wrong. We held our breath. He fell and landed in the snow. ""Remember,"" Gareth said, ""going fast can be tricky."" 

I thought maybe freestyle skiing was not for me. I liked to ski slowly and practice turns. I was not like the teenagers who did tricks on ramps. I thought it looked fun, but I was scared to try. My parents took us to a ski training center in the US. It had a big indoor area with trampolines and ski jumps with fake snow. Students jumped and tried tricks, landing in foam cubes. It was not like skiing outside.

After practicing inside, we went outside to ski. ""You will get better!"" the center said. Gareth told us that before places like this, people just jumped without training. ""But be careful,"" he said. ""If you land on the flat part, it will hurt."" 

At first, I was scared to go fast. My legs wanted to stop when I got close to the jump, and I landed on the flat part. I did not fall, but I felt tired. ""You need to control the jump,"" Gareth said. 

On the second day, we practiced on trampolines. I thought I would not like it, but bouncing was fun. We learned moves for ski-jumping and how to know where our bodies were in the air. Gareth told us what to do. I needed to get better at knowing where I was in the air. I only remembered the jump before I landed in the foam cubes.

We went back to the mountain to try again. I had some problems, but finally, I landed well. Gareth was happy, and I felt proud. But on my last jump of the day, I went fast and landed correctly. Then I saw my skis sliding down the slope. They were not on my feet anymore!"
114,"Imagine you are on a rollercoaster at an amusement park. You feel scared and hold on tight. The ride stops, and you take a deep breath as the car goes up slowly. Then, it drops fast, and your stomach feels funny. You go quickly forward, turn left, and even go upside down! You scream because you are scared. But you chose to go on this ride, just like many other people do every year.

Amusement parks are very popular. They have many exciting rides. Many people work hard to make these rides safe and fun. They are engineers and designers. They want to make rides that are thrilling but also safe for everyone.

Creating a rollercoaster is not easy. Designers must make sure people feel excited but not scared for their safety. Many ideas for rollercoasters were made a long time ago, but they still use them today. 

I talked to some experts about rollercoasters. They said it is important to mix feelings of fun and safety. They also said that the story of the ride, like a space adventure or a jungle chase, is important to make it exciting.

Even with new technology, the real experience of riding a rollercoaster is still the most important part. People will always love the feeling of being on a real ride."
115,"At 25 years old, Miranda Ellington has done a lot as a choreographer. She has made dances for many theatres and dance groups. She also dances sometimes. I wonder why she does both things with her busy life. She says, ""Dancing again helps me remember what it is like to be in a studio and listen to choreographers. It can be hard and stressful. Choreographers sometimes forget how tough it is to practice all day.""

As a choreographer, Miranda teaches young students. She enjoys this. She says, ""New dancers are often open to new ideas. Working with students can be easier than with professionals because they want to learn. They want to be successful, but they do not know their strengths and weaknesses yet. They can take criticism well, but sometimes they challenge me, and I like their honest feedback.""

When Miranda starts with a new group, she focuses on the dance steps and the music. She says, ""There may be music I do not like, but I still make the best dance routine for it. If dancers do not like the music, it can be frustrating, but I must find a way to make it work. I wish I could try different pieces of music to make rehearsals more fun. But now, I work on big shows where the music is already chosen.""

Miranda does not want to stay with one place. She says, ""It is good to meet new people. But each theatre and school has different ways of working. I must change how I work each time I go somewhere new. This helps me not to get stuck in my ways.""

We talk about a new documentary about ballet dancers and choreographers. Miranda says, ""Some documentaries look nice but are not real. This one shows what life is really like in a dance company. There is a scene where a young dancer gets many corrections. I smiled because I understand her struggle. It is hard to watch, but it is real. People do not see how much work ballet takes.""

I ask Miranda what makes a great dance show. She says, ""It is when everything comes together – the music, costumes, lights, and dancers. We may not be perfect, but aiming high is good for the audience. Sometimes, the dance steps are great, but the costumes or props are not good, and that is disappointing.""

Miranda has done many types of work, and I ask if she is a modern dance choreographer or a ballet expert. She replies, ""People want to label you, but I do not understand why. Many people think you should only be good at one thing. I do not agree with that. For now, I want to learn and try new things."""
116,"A friend asked me why I travel when I can watch everything on TV. I said that TV shows are great, but it is better to go outside and see new things. This talk gave me an idea for a fun trip. I made a film to tell people to turn off their TVs. 

A friend was giving away his old sofa. I took it and put wheels and cables on it. I used seatbelts to hold it on my shoulders. I put my bags on the sofa and slept on it at night, even on the beach. Some friends helped me pull the sofa and cheered me on. 

I have walked a lot in the past, but this trip was different. I walked a long way on busy roads. I could stop at cafes and relax on the sofa with a drink instead of sitting on a rock. I often told people, “No, I am not doing this for charity, and I am not training for a marathon.” When someone asks me about my weekend, I like to tell them how I pulled a sofa 100 miles in southern England instead of talking about TV shows. You can watch the film on my website."
117,"When I read about swimming trips in the sea around small Greek islands, I was very happy. I had never been on a group trip before. My brother was busy, so I thought a group holiday would be good for me. The man at the Greek port looked surprised when I asked for a ticket for one person. Many families go to the islands. I told him I would not be alone for long; I would join ten other people to swim around the small islands. He still looked confused, but he smiled and helped me get on the boat.

Before we started, our group sent emails to each other, but we did not have much time to talk before our first swim. Our guides told us that a support boat would help us during the swims. They also showed us how to talk to the boat. We swam a short distance to split us into speed groups. Then it was time for our first long swim of 1.5 km, and I felt nervous. I had trained in my local pool and swum in rivers, but I had never swum long distances in the sea.

Soon, the waves got bigger, and I was at the back of the slow group. This was not where I wanted to be. I saw faster swimmers moving ahead like dolphins. I wanted to finish this swim, and I was very happy when I did it by myself. 

The next days were the same: jumping in, swimming at a good speed, and stopping to look at the beautiful views. As the swims got longer, I swam faster and enjoyed it more. I did not need the support boat much. I can’t wait to come back next year!"
118,"Being a flight attendant is not easy, but I love my job. I have traveled to many places, like the US and Australia. I work with great people, have a lot of free time, and my job is never boring. This makes it a good job for young people like me!

When I was a child, I went to a school far from my family. I flew alone to get there and back. Sometimes, I felt lonely, so I asked the flight attendants if I could help them serve food. They let me help, and I liked it.

Later, when I wanted to change my job from banking, I remembered this. I went to an interview for the flight attendant job. There were many young people there, and many got the job too. I practiced what to say before the interview. I talked about my skills and my past work, not just that I liked to travel. Because of this, I got the job!

I think this job is great for many reasons, but free flights are not the best part. Most airline workers work very hard. We have a saying: ""No one is finished until everyone is finished."" It feels like a big family. Even if we don’t see each other all the time, we are still close.

When I am not working, I don’t have to take work home. If I have a difficult passenger, which is rare, I know the flight will end soon, and I will not see them again!"
119,"At the summer camp where I work, I love to see the children do things they thought they could not do. Most children can swim and play table tennis before they come here, but rock climbing is new for many of them. Some children feel nervous, but with a little help, they try and they all reach the top. This makes them very happy.

At the start of the week, some children miss their homes. It is not the youngest children who miss home the most; it is usually the ten- to thirteen-year-olds. We do not let them use their mobile phones all the time. We tell them they can call home after lunch. When they ask again after dinner, we say it is too late to call now, and they can do it tomorrow. Most children feel better in a few days, and at the end of the week, they come to thank us because they had a great time.

Sometimes, it is not just the children who feel lonely. Some parents call a lot to ask how their child is. This is not needed. Often, their child is busy playing games or doing other fun things, so we tell the parents to call back later.

We also see some children who come in new, expensive clothes. These children often argue when we ask them to change into something more comfortable, but soon they understand why."

In London, it was hard to find actors. The UK has rules about how many shows young actors can do each week. In the USA, they can do more shows. Because of this, they needed more actors in London. The director found many talented actors in the UK, and they won their first ‘Best Musical’ award.

The theatre in London is bigger than the one in the USA. It is full every night. Many people want to hear the songs that were popular in America. I met Jamie, who is 11 years old and acts in the show. He said, ‘It’s great that I get paid to play, especially with a nice guitar.’ 

Jamie told me that the young actors are very busy. They have school lessons at the theatre. He misses his old school friends. His whole class came to see the show. The theatre gives special ticket prices for schools. They loved the show, and that made Jamie feel good. His parents come when they can, but tickets are expensive.

I told Jamie I also play guitar. He found another guitar and invited me to play with him and the other actors. We played a song called Days. I was happy when I got it right. I was impressed by Jamie’s skills. The young actors are good musicians, but none of them had played in a band before. They found it easy to play together. Jamie said the hard part was to look natural when they first performed. They were so focused that they forgot to smile!

The show will be in London for another year, and it is very good to see.'"
