1,"A while ago, a website talked about the dangers of telling people where you are online. When you say, ""I am here,"" you are also telling many people where you are. Some of these people may not be good to meet. This shows that sharing everything online can have problems. 

The internet gives us many chances to share our lives. We can share our stories and photos. But sometimes, this can be risky. In the past, some people, called bloggers, learned about these risks. They shared their lives online before social media was popular. They had good and bad experiences. 

One of these early bloggers was Justin Hall. In 1994, he was a 19-year-old student. He started sharing his life on the web, which was mostly used by students and scientists. He wrote about everything and shared many photos. In 1996, he began a daily blog. Many people read it because he was very open about his life. 

But one day, Justin had to stop his blog. He fell in love, and when he wrote about it, his partner said he had to choose between the blog and the relationship. He chose love, but he felt sad because sharing his life made people not trust him.

In 2002, Heather Armstrong had a blog called Dooce. She wrote about her job. One day, a coworker shared her blog with their bosses, and she lost her job. This shows that what we say online can have real-life consequences. 

Heather was sad but later got married and started a new blog about her family. Now, she is very popular and makes money from her writing. She learned that we can say anything online, but we should be careful about what we share."
2,"A while ago, some scientists wanted to tell people about a movie called What the Bleep Do We Know? This movie mixes real facts and stories. It shows that we do not know everything about our universe. Some scientists were worried about the movie. They called it “atrocious” and “dangerous.” This made me want to watch it.

At first, I did not understand why the movie was so important. Some scientists talked about new discoveries that show the universe is very strange. But then, the movie talked about how water can change because of thoughts. I heard that a Japanese researcher showed that water can look different based on how people feel. The movie showed nice pictures of ice crystals that looked good when people were happy and bad when people were sad. Many people liked these pictures, but scientists were not impressed. They wanted real proof.

The movie made big claims, but it did not have enough evidence. Scientists have found that water and other things in the universe are very complex. They discovered that the universe has unknown matter and a mysterious force called “dark energy.” 

Scientists are also learning new things about humans. They found that our brains take a little time to understand what happens around us. They believe they know where modern humans first lived and how they spread around the world. Some scientists think there is a link between life on Earth and the design of the universe.

Science is still growing. We do not know everything, and many things are still a mystery. Some scientists are trying to create a “Theory of Everything” to explain all the forces and particles in the universe. But many of us think the universe is simply amazing."
3,"Writing novels is hard for me, but writing short stories is fun. Writing a novel is like planting a big forest. Writing a short story is like planting a small garden. Both are important to me. In the forest, there are tall trees and green leaves. The wind makes the leaves move. In the garden, flowers bloom and attract bees and butterflies. 

Since I started writing, I have written both novels and short stories. When I finish a novel, I want to write short stories. When I finish short stories, I want to write a novel. I do not write short stories while writing a novel, and I do not write a novel while writing short stories. They use different parts of my brain.

I began my writing career in 1975 with two short novels. From 1984 to 1985, I started writing short stories. I did not know much about writing short stories then, but it was a good experience. One of my first short stories, ""Breaking Waves,"" was in my first collection called ""Tales from Abroad."" 

One good thing about short stories is that they do not take long to finish. It usually takes me about a week to write a short story. Writing a novel takes a long time, sometimes a year or two. Writing a novel can feel very long, and I sometimes wonder if I can finish it. So, writing short stories is a nice change for me. 

Another nice thing about short stories is that you can create a story from small ideas, like a word or an image. It feels like playing music, where the story goes where it wants. If a short story does not work out, it is okay. Not every story has to be perfect. Even famous writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver have stories that are not great. This makes me feel better. 

I learn from my mistakes in short stories and use that to write better novels. Short stories help me try new things. They are like small memories I have shared with my readers. Writing short stories makes me happy because I can share my feelings."
4,"Science is a way to learn about the world. It helps us understand many things, like tiny atoms and big stars. Science can make our lives better, but it can also cause problems. Scientists study many ideas, and sometimes they disagree. Old ideas can change when new ones come along. 

For example, a long time ago, people thought the universe was like a big clock. Now, scientists know it is much more complicated. They learn new things all the time, like radioactivity and black holes. 

Science is important because it helps us understand how things work. It can also change how we live. We need to pay attention to science because it affects our future and the world we live in. Everyone should try to understand science, so we can make good choices for ourselves and our children."
5,"From around 2015, big book companies said that sales of ebooks were not growing anymore. Some companies even lost money because they thought ebooks were better than printed books. People still ask if ebooks will replace printed books. This question makes us think and talk a lot. Why do we think ebooks and printed books are in a fight? The answer is about how we feel about new things and changes.

In my research, I found that when new technology comes, people often think it will end older things. For example, when television was invented, many people thought radio would die. But radio found new ways to be used, like in cars and factories. The idea that books will disappear is not new. In 1894, some people thought that phonographs would replace books with audiobooks. Many times, people have said that new things will end books, like movies, radio, and smartphones. Some people worried that if books disappeared, culture would get worse. Others thought ebooks were much better.

When new technology comes, we feel both excited and scared. We have strong feelings for things we use every day, like books and computers. When something new, like e-readers, comes out, we have to change how we feel about the old things we love. This is why people still want old products. For example, when the printing press was made in the 15th century, people wanted to find old handwritten books. When movies changed from silent to sound, people missed the old silent films. The same thing happened with photography and music.

E-readers made people appreciate the feel and smell of printed books more. This should make people feel better about printed books not disappearing. But the idea that books might go away will still be a popular story. This story shows how we feel excited about new things but also scared of losing what we know and love."
6,"Text: 

Every weekday morning for a year and a half, I woke up at 5:30. I brushed my teeth, made coffee, and wrote about how great thinkers from the last four hundred years worked. I wanted to know how they found time to do their best work and how they organized their days to be creative and productive. I wrote about their daily lives, like when they slept, ate, and worked. I wanted to show that they were like us, with habits and routines.

A famous French writer, Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, said, ""Tell me what you eat, and I will tell you what you are."" I say, ""Tell me what time you eat and if you take a nap."" This book is about how people create things, not just what they create. It is also personal. The writer John Cheever said that when you write, you show something about yourself. 

I have questions about my own life: How can I do creative work and also earn money? Is it better to work on one project or a little bit each day? When there is not enough time, do I have to give up things like sleep or a clean house? Or can I learn to do more in less time? I do not have all the answers, but I want to show how many successful people faced similar problems.

The book is called Daily Rituals, but it is really about people’s routines. A routine can seem boring, but it can help us use our time well. A good routine helps us focus and not be affected by our moods. The psychologist William James said that good habits can help us think about more interesting things. 

One Sunday, I was trying to write a story for work, but I kept cleaning my desk and making coffee instead. I am a morning person and work best in the morning. That afternoon, I started looking online for information about other writers’ routines. I thought it would be good to collect these stories, so I started a blog called Daily Routines. 

In the blog, I shared what I found about people’s routines from books and articles. For this book, I gathered more information and tried to keep it interesting. I let the people I wrote about share their own words from letters and interviews. I also used summaries from other sources. This book would not be possible without the help of many writers and researchers. I have listed all my sources in the Notes section for more reading."
7,"Howard wanted to be a palaeontologist. When he was six years old, his family could not go on holiday to Spain. Instead, they went to the beach in England. There, Howard found a special stone called an ammonite. He liked fossils and wanted to study them.

After university, Howard worked hard on his studies. He wanted to learn about the very first living things. He finished his big project, but he was worried. Would he get a job? He felt good about his skills, but he knew that sometimes good people do not get good jobs.

One day, a job opened at Tavistock College in London. Howard applied for it, but he did not think he would get it. On the day of his interview, the professor who was supposed to help him had a bad morning. He got into an accident and could not come. Another professor, who did not like the first one, took his place. This professor helped Howard get the job.

Howard was surprised but happy. He wanted to do the work he loved. He noticed that his job was organized, but his personal life was sometimes chaotic. One day, someone stole his briefcase with his lecture notes. He was very upset. He went back to the college and called to postpone his lecture. 

After that, he had coffee with a colleague. They talked about fossils from a museum in Nairobi. Howard learned about new fossils that needed to be studied. This was a big chance for him. Because of the theft, he changed his plans. He decided not to go to a conference in Stockholm. Instead, he would find a way to visit the museum in Nairobi."
8,"Charles Spence eats many different foods. He is a professor at Oxford University in the UK. He has ice cream made from bee larvae at home. It looks like maggots, but it tastes a little like nuts and flowers. Spence and his team study how we taste food. They want to make eating bugs more normal. 

Spence's work helps big food companies and restaurants. He studies how we experience food. Many things can change how food tastes, like who we eat with, how food looks, and even the noise around us. In his book, The Perfect Meal, he shares interesting facts about food. For example, the first person to order food in a restaurant usually enjoys their meal more. Also, we eat more food when we are with other people.

Spence's lab is simple. It has soundproof rooms and old equipment. He keeps costs low so he can work with chefs who need help. Some of his work is paid for by big food companies. In the past, some people thought this kind of research was not real science. But now, it is important for universities to show their work helps people.

Spence helps food companies reduce salt and sugar in their products. This is good for customers because it helps them stay healthy. Many companies do this slowly so people do not notice the change. Spence found that if you tell people about the changes, they may not like the food as much.

Spence met famous chef Heston Blumenthal while working on a food project. They worked together to create a dish called ""Sound of the Sea."" Spence studies how sounds can change how we taste food. For example, high sounds can make food taste sweeter, while low sounds can make it taste bitter. Soon, an airline will play music that matches the food they serve.

At home, Spence has fun dinner parties. One time, they ate rabbit with the fur on the cutlery. Another time, they used colorful lights and headphones to see how they changed the taste of drinks. For Spence, home and food events are like his lab."
9,"Our brains are very busy today. We get a lot of information, like facts, rumors, and chatter. We need to find what is important and what we can ignore. We are also doing more things ourselves. Thirty years ago, travel agents helped us book flights, and salespeople helped us in stores. Now, we do these things by ourselves. We are trying to do many tasks at once, like taking care of our families, jobs, hobbies, and watching TV. Our smartphones help us with this.

But there is a problem. We think we can do many things at the same time, but this is not true. A scientist named Earl Miller says our brains are not good at multitasking. When we try to do many things, we switch quickly from one task to another. This is not efficient. Multitasking can make us feel stressed and confused.

When we try to focus on one task but have many distractions, it can lower our ability to think clearly. For example, if we do homework while watching TV, we do not remember the information well. It goes to the wrong part of our brain. Without distractions, we can remember better.

Making decisions while multitasking is also hard for our brains. Small decisions take up a lot of mental energy, just like big decisions. This can lead to making bad choices later.

Many people talk about email as a problem. We get too many emails, and it is hard to keep up. A child once said his father answers emails for a living, and this is true for many people. We feel we must reply to emails, but it is hard to do that and finish other tasks."
10,"In a zoo in Sweden, a chimpanzee named Santino broke concrete at night. He threw the pieces at visitors during the day. Was he being mean? In caves in the US, female bats help other bats that need help to give birth. Are they being kind? Fifty years ago, people did not think much about these questions. They believed animals just acted in ways that could be measured. They thought animals did not have feelings or thoughts like humans. 

But now, this idea is changing. Research on bats, chimps, rats, dolphins, and chickens shows that animals have feelings. This has led to new books about animal emotions, like Mark Bekoff’s ""Wild Justice"" and Victoria Braithwaite’s ""Do Fish Feel Pain?"". This has started a big question: Do animals have thoughts and feelings like us? 

Another question is about conscience, which is a sense of right and wrong. In a study with cows, those that opened a locked gate for food seemed happier than those that did not. If cows enjoy solving problems, what does this mean for eating beef? Some people agree with this idea, but others do not. 

Dr. Jonathan Balcombe, who wrote ""Second Nature,"" believes we should stop eating meat. He thinks this is a big change in how we think about ethics. Aubrey Manning, a professor, thinks we should think more about how animals think. He believes animals have simpler thoughts than humans. Professor Euan MacPhail thinks we should not put human feelings on animals. 

These ideas are hard to agree on because they are not just scientific questions, but also philosophical ones. It is very hard to define what consciousness is. Can we ever know what it is like to be a bat? 

Balcombe did an important study that showed starlings, a type of bird, can feel sad. In the study, some starlings lived in nice cages, and some lived in small, empty cages. When both groups were given bad food, only the starlings in nice cages ate. Balcombe thinks that living in a bad cage made the starlings feel negative about life. 

Balcombe, who works with animal rights groups, believes that in the future, people will look back and see how we treated animals as wrong. He says we cannot support animal rights while eating meat. 

If only Balcombe believed this, it might be easy to ignore him. But Professor Aubrey Manning agrees with him. He has written a book about animal behavior. He says we are changing how we think about animals again. In the past, people thought animals thought like us, but now we are seeing things differently. This is a complicated topic, and it is important to listen carefully to different opinions."
11,"Critical thinking is how we understand what we read or hear. Adrian West, a researcher, says that arguing can help us find the truth. Technology helps us store and process information, but it can also make it hard to think deeply. West mentions that we see a lot of poor thinking and opinions that can confuse us. More information does not always mean better understanding or decisions. 

Reading books has gone down a lot, and this may hurt our critical thinking skills. Patricia Greenfield, a psychology professor, believes that focusing more on videos and fast media makes it harder to think about one thing deeply. We do not yet know exactly how technology affects our thinking. 

Technology can be both good and bad. For example, some video games can help us think better, while reading online can improve our analysis skills. Greenfield says that reading helps our imagination and critical thinking, but many visual media do not give us time to think. This can lead to young people not reaching their full potential.

How we see technology affects how we think critically. James Paul Gee, an educational psychology professor, says that video games can be good for kids. They are fun and can help us learn. Some games teach us to make decisions and think critically in a way that feels real. 

In today’s world, as reading and math scores go down, we need to understand how technology affects our thinking."
12,"Matthew Crawford is a motorcycle mechanic. He used to work in an office but did not like it. He writes about how we should live. His first book talks about the good things about working with your hands. His latest book is about how to deal with modern life. 

One day, while shopping, he saw ads on a credit card machine while he was waiting. He realized that it is hard to avoid these ads. They take our attention away from what we want to think about. This makes it hard to remember conversations. People do not want to talk to strangers anymore because they are always interrupted.

Crawford says we see the world through things like video games and phone apps. These things show us what we want, but they can take over our lives. Many people complain about emails at work but still check emails in their free time. Studies show that just seeing a phone can make it hard to focus. 

Crawford believes that technology makes us more self-focused. We have many choices, and this makes it hard to control ourselves. People prefer to text instead of talking face to face. He thinks this is bad for society. 

He gives an example of a gym. In the past, there was one music player for everyone. Now, people listen to their own music with ear buds. The gym used to be a place to meet others, but now it is not. 

Crawford has two ideas to help. First, we need to reduce noise and distractions in public places. Second, he thinks we should do activities that connect us to the real world, like cooking or playing sports. These activities help us focus on real things and not just screens. 

He says that paying attention to one thing can help us pay attention to other things too. It is important to find ways to use our judgment and enjoy real experiences."
13,"Text: 

""What do you do for work?"" This is a common question. Many people answer it with a few words about their job. But if you are a philosopher, it can be harder to answer. Saying ""I am a philosopher"" can sound fancy. It feels better to say ""I study or teach philosophy."" Some people think philosophers know special truths. This is not true. Philosophers are just like everyone else.

Philosophers often think about life and how people live. A famous philosopher named Aristotle said that thinking about life is very important. Many people today do not agree with him, but philosophy is still seen as important for the mind. Another philosopher, Socrates, said that a life without thinking is not a good life. He meant that we should think about our lives and choices.

Thinking about our lives does not mean we need to read many books or be very smart. It means we should look closely at our daily experiences. We do not need to be alone to think about life. In fact, thinking about life can help us make better choices. 

However, many philosophers work in universities and do not talk to regular people. This makes philosophy seem far away from real life. Philosophers often write for other experts, not for everyone. Because of this, many people think philosophy is not for them. 

I sometimes call myself an ""ethicist"" because I study ethics, which is about what is right and wrong. But ethics is often seen as only about rules and laws. Recently, I feel this is not enough. Ethics also looks at social issues and what is fair. 

Ethicists ask important questions, like if downloading movies illegally is wrong (it is). We also think about responsibility and how we see art. Philosophy helps us understand our actions and beliefs. Sometimes we find out we already know the answer. Other times, we learn that our beliefs are hard to explain. By thinking about these ideas, we can help everyone."
14,"Food is important to many people, like food lovers, chefs, and those who enjoy eating. People often think about food and how it makes them happy. In the past, when philosophers talked about food, they usually meant something else, like learning or knowledge. Sometimes, they seemed to talk about food, but they were really discussing other ideas.

One famous philosopher, Epicurus, believed in seeking pleasure and avoiding pain. His name is now often linked to enjoying food and drinks. Many restaurants and food shops use his name because they think it will attract customers. Food is also social and cultural. The food we eat comes from history and is shared with our friends and family. Our communities help us grow and share food.

When food is ready, critics talk and write about it. Some people wonder why food critics are important. One philosopher said that tasting food is not a special skill; critics are just good at describing flavors. Most studies about how we perceive things focus on sight, not taste, which should change.

Food can also be beautiful. We often talk about art and music being beautiful, but not food. Some philosophers think that food deserves to be talked about in the same way as art because of modern cooking. However, food is eaten and gone, unlike paintings or music, which last over time.

There are many questions about food and ethics. We can ask what we should eat: organic, free-range, local, vegetarian, or non-GMO foods? Our answers show our beliefs. Philosophers like to discuss these questions about food.

Cooking at home is different from cooking in restaurants. Home cooks have a special duty to their friends and family. Everyone shares food and time together. Restaurant cooks have responsibilities to their boss and the food. Their kitchens are not open to everyone, and they work with colleagues, not friends.

A recent essay called ""Diplomacy of the Dish"" talks about how food can help people from different cultures connect. We can learn to enjoy other people's food and build friendships by eating together. The essay includes many interesting stories that make food philosophy fun to read."
15,"Rob Daviau is a game designer from the US. He makes special board games called ""legacy"" games. When he was a child, he played board games, but he thought they were not fun or challenging anymore. He wanted to make board games better. He asked himself if board games could have stories and if choices in one game could affect the next game.

He changed a classic game called Risk and made a new version called Risk Legacy. In this game, choices made by players can change the game forever. Players might have to tear up cards or change the game board. The game is played over several sessions, and players remember their past actions.

Rob also worked on a legacy version of another game called Pandemic. In Pandemic, players work together to stop diseases. His next game was called SeaFall. Pandemic Legacy was very popular, but SeaFall was a new challenge because it was not based on an old game. In SeaFall, players are sailors exploring a new world.

Designing legacy games is hard. Designers must think about all the choices players can make. They need testers to see how the game works. Jaime Barriga was a tester for SeaFall. He said it takes a lot of time to make the game right. Sometimes the game works well at first, but later it can break, and they have to fix it.

Rob did not think legacy games would be very popular. He thought only a few people would like them. But many players, like Russell Chapman, really enjoy them. He thinks legacy games are a big step forward in game design. Players like the excitement of learning new things in the game.

Another fan, Ben Hogg, said that even if players worry about changing the game, they still enjoy the adventure. He compared it to watching a movie. People like new experiences, just like in video games.

Rob Daviau wanted to tell stories through games. He once wanted to be a TV writer. Matt Leacock, who created Pandemic, said making legacy games is like writing a book. You need to know how the story starts and ends, but you also need to plan the details.

Rob is happy to see how others use his ideas, but he thinks players will soon want something new. Colby Dauch, who works for the company that published SeaFall, believes legacy games change how people think about board games."
16,"One night, an octopus named Inky escaped from his tank at the National Aquarium in New Zealand. He crawled across the floor and went into a small drain that led to the Pacific Ocean. This story was exciting and many people shared it online. 

People like to think that animals are like us. Octopuses are very smart. They can open jars, recognize faces, and even play. Dr. Frans de Waal studies animals like gorillas and chimpanzees. He believes that we often do not see how smart animals are. He says that animals can think about the past and future, feel empathy, and understand what others want. 

In the past, people thought animals were smart. For example, in medieval Europe, animals could be put on trial for crimes. Charles Darwin, a famous scientist, said that humans and animals are different, but not in a big way. 

In the 20th century, many people thought animals were not very smart. They believed animals only acted because of rewards or punishments. This was a time when humans were harming animal homes and not caring for them. 

Now, Dr. de Waal thinks we are starting to understand that animals are smarter than we thought. He says that animals have their own special skills. For example, squirrels can remember where they hide their nuts, while we need apps to find our phones. 

Inky’s story is popular, but Dr. de Waal is not sure if Inky really knew how to escape to the ocean. He did an experiment with monkeys to see if they feel envy. When some monkeys got cucumbers and others got grapes, the ones with cucumbers got very upset. This study showed that animals have feelings too. 

In the end, we are learning more about how smart animals really are."
17,"Text: 

Robots are becoming very important in our world. They are not just in stories anymore; they are in factories and other places. Many people think that robots will do a lot of the work that humans do in the next 50 years. But most people also believe their jobs will stay the same. This is not true. Robots will change many jobs.

For example, a company in Australia made a robot called Hadrian X. This robot can lay 1,000 bricks in one hour. Two human workers would take a whole day to do this. Another robot, Tally, helps in supermarkets. It checks if the shelves have enough products and if they are priced correctly.

Some people think robots will create new jobs for skilled workers, like technicians. But others worry that we need human skills at work. Dr. Jing Bing Zhang studies how robots will change jobs. He says that in two years, many robots will be smarter and work well with humans. In three years, big companies will have special people to manage robots.

Zhang also says that many jobs in robotics will not be filled because there are not enough skilled workers. He believes that people need to learn new skills to keep their jobs. 

New robots will also be made for homes. These robots will be able to talk and help us in ways we have not seen before. This is a big chance for companies, but it also brings challenges. We need new rules to keep people safe and protect their privacy.

With many jobs at risk, it is important to focus on education. Countries need more students in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) to stay strong in the future."
18,"Text: George Mallory was a mountaineer. He was asked why he wanted to climb Mount Everest. He said, ""Because it’s there."" This means he wanted to climb for fun and adventure. Many people wonder why anyone would want to climb mountains. 

A writer named Tejada-Flores wrote an essay called ""Games that Climbers Play."" He talked about different types of climbing, from climbing small rocks to big mountains. Each type has its own rules. 

Climbing can make people feel free, but it can also be hard. For example, being stuck in a tent during a storm is not fun. Some people think that having fewer choices while climbing can make life simpler and give a different kind of freedom.

Another climber, Joe Fitschen, asked a different question: ""Why do people climb?"" He thinks climbing is part of being human. We like to take on challenges, even if they are risky. 

A teacher named Brian Treanor wrote that climbing can help us learn important values like courage and respect for nature. He believes these values are important in our modern world.

Some expert climbers, Ebert and Robinson, said that climbing alone is harder and deserves more recognition than climbing with a team or using special tools. But this idea can be dangerous for some climbers.

Climbing can also be a way to feel calm and focused. Many climbers talk about being in the moment or feeling peaceful while climbing. This is similar to some ideas in Zen philosophy, which helps people find peace of mind. 

So, there are many reasons why people like to climb mountains."
19,"Alfred Brendel is a famous pianist. He played classical music for over sixty years. He was very smart and serious. He played many piano pieces and recorded them, but he did not teach many students. People who knew him saw that he could be fun, but he was usually serious in concerts. He studied a lot, traveled, and performed.

A few years ago, a young boy named Kit Armstrong came to one of Brendel’s concerts. Kit asked Brendel for piano lessons. At first, Brendel did not want to teach him because he had very few students. He thought it was not a good idea. But when he heard Kit play, he changed his mind. Kit was 14 years old and played very well. Brendel thought Kit was special and decided to teach him.

Now, Kit is 19 years old. He is always busy learning new things like languages, math, and computer coding. He also plays tennis and writes music. His mother is always with him to help. Brendel says Kit has a great memory and listens well when he teaches him. Kit understands quickly and can play what Brendel shows him.

Brendel is careful not to make big promises about Kit. He does not want people to expect too much from him. Some newspapers say Kit will be a great pianist, but Brendel thinks this is not good. Young musicians can play some things very well, but they need time to learn other things.

Now, at 80 years old, Brendel is happy in his life after performing. He did not want to be famous quickly. He wanted to achieve his goals by 50 years old. When he reached 50, he felt he had done many things but still wanted to do more. Even though he cannot play like before, he still thinks about music and enjoys his new life."
20,"When I was a child, I thought gardens were beautiful places. My grandad’s garden was by a river. It went down gently to the water. You could not touch the water, but you could hear it and the birds in the trees. I thought all gardens were like this – a nice and quiet place. 

Grandad’s garden was simple. He did not have a big greenhouse like some neighbors. Their greenhouses were made from old windows and plastic. At home, my dad was quiet. He was not serious all the time. He liked to say funny things. He often said, “It’s immaterial to me,” instead of “I don’t mind.” 

My dad did not finish school and became a plumber. He did not love plumbing, but it was his job. He was not very ambitious, but he and my mum thought about moving to Canada once. They never did. At home, he was good at fixing things. He could build bookshelves and cupboards very well. 

My parents only moved house once. But my mum liked to change the furniture a lot. Just when you got used to one chair, a new one would come. The biggest change was a piano. I wanted to like it, but it made me nervous. I liked the two brass candlesticks on it, but my mum said they were too fancy and took them away. I never got to play the piano, but my sister had lessons. When I asked my mum why I could not play, she said, “You’d never have practiced.”

I liked the river best of all places – more than moors or woods. I could imagine many things by the river. I would take a fishing net and wear old sandals. I walked along the riverbank looking for a good place to take off my sandals. I would look for fish in the water to catch. But after trying to keep them alive at home, I had to put them back in the river.

I wanted to leave school quickly, but it seemed hard. One day, my dad said, “There is a job for an apprentice gardener in the Parks Department. I thought you might like it.” In that moment, my dad surprised me. He might have wanted me to be a carpenter, but I think he hoped I would be happy as a gardener. Even if he did not like gardening, he saw how much I loved it."
21,"Lawrence MacEwen is on his island, the Isle of Muck, in Scotland. I am with him. The wind is very strong, and it feels like it could blow us off the cliff. But Lawrence is not worried. He has a sheepdog named Tie. The wind is loud, but Lawrence feels at home on his island.

Lawrence shows me around. He points to another island called Eigg. He says the island next to it is Rum, and it rains a lot there. I see dark clouds and rain on Rum. He also mentions another island called Soay. 

Suddenly, Lawrence says he needs to move his sheep. We walk down the hill. He tells me that the Isle of Muck is three kilometers long and one and a half kilometers wide. The geese here eat a lot of grass. The MacEwen family has lived on this island for 3000 years.

Lawrence calls Tie to help with the sheep, but Tie is not doing it right. Lawrence is disappointed. The MacEwen family runs the island together. Lawrence and his wife, Jenny, have a son named Colin and a daughter named Mary. Colin takes care of the cottages, and Mary runs the hotel with her husband, Toby. Mary’s two boys can play outside and sail in the summer. They go out and come back when they are hungry.

Life on the island is not always easy. There is electricity only sometimes. One night, I wait for the lights to come on. The next morning, I see Mary making breakfast with a flashlight. There is also no mobile phone service. Mary tells me that some people go to the hill to use their phones, but most just put them away. 

Today, a boat brings groceries and three musicians. They play music in the tearoom, and everyone enjoys it. That night, Lawrence tells me how he met Jenny. Her father bought a farm on Soay without seeing it. Jenny had to manage the farm, but she did not know much about it.

I sleep while it rains. I eat well because most of the food comes from the island. Mary sends me to get fresh fish from a fisherman named Sandy. I bring the fish back to Mary. By 7 pm, we eat the fish, and it is very good.

The next morning, I have to take a ferry to another island. Many ferries have been canceled because of bad weather. If my ferry does not come, I will stay on Muck for two more days. Part of me wants to stay longer, even without a phone."

The game design industry used to be for computer scientists and self-taught people. Many thought video games were just a hobby for young people. Now, the video game industry is taken seriously. It is not easy to get into this industry. Making video games, especially those based on movies, needs many people and a lot of skill. 

Jim Donelly, who works for an online games magazine, says it is hard to work in big companies. But the industry needs game designers. They need not just the big bosses but also people who design parts of the games. 

So, how can you start working in this industry? Many companies want people with a degree in computer science, but Jim thinks you should just make games. You need to show what you can do. Game design is not just a job; it is a way of life. 

Another expert, John Field, says it is not easy to do it alone. A good course in games can help you. Most game designers start as programmers or artists and then move up. They love all kinds of entertainment and art. They know that games are their passion. 

Connections are also important. To succeed in games, you need to meet people in the industry. 

The idea that only young boys play video games is changing. Now, many adults and families play games together. Smartphones have many new games through apps and social media. John believes there is a lot of room for growth in games. They are fun and can help us learn new things."
23,"Since I was a child, I wanted to play football. My dad helped me and encouraged me to play. I had a friend whose dad was very strict. He always said, ""You can’t do this, you can’t do that."" My friend stopped wanting to play football because of this. I am happy that I still love football. 

When I score a great goal, some people say it is just luck, but it is not. I have practiced a lot since I was a kid. You need to practice to score amazing goals. The best players in the world practice for many years. 

I learned how to play well. When I teach kids, I tell them to enjoy learning. At school, I played many sports like rounders, baseball, athletics, and basketball. I know school is important, but I only thought about football then. 

I want my son to enjoy learning too. We read him books, even if he is too young to sit still. I hope he does not just want to kick the books around. 

When I started my football career, my manager helped young players like me. He did not make a big deal about it, but we knew we had to do well. I scored in my first game, but we lost. A TV presenter said, ""You can’t win anything with kids."" This made us work harder. 

I trust my friends and family a lot. I have money, but it can cause problems. Some people say, ""I can’t believe your mother still works."" I help my parents with money. I paid off their house and bought them a car. My mom loves her job as a hairdresser, and I want to help my family. 

I have money, but it does not solve everything. After I stop playing football, I want to take a break and do things I could not do before. I want to go skiing right after I stop playing. I cannot do that now because if I get hurt, I cannot play football again."
24,"Text: 

We lived at Reef Point because of Sam Carter. Sam was my father’s agent in Los Angeles. He helped us find a cheap place to live. My father could not write anything in Los Angeles, and Sam was worried about losing money.

In the summer, the beach was empty because of the sea fog. Many people went to a nicer place called La Carmella instead of Reef Point. Only people who had no money or loved surfing came to Reef Point. But now, with the hot weather, many people were at the beach. 

My father worked hard every day to write a script. I often went to the beach with my dog, Rusty. When we first moved to Reef Point, we did not have a dog. Rusty came to us and would not leave. I tried to send him away, but he always came back. One day, I gave him some water. My father did not like Rusty at first, but he did not really try to chase him away.

Rusty loved the beach. He liked to dig and bring things to me. Sometimes he found things that were not his, like a sneaker or a beach towel. I had to give those back to their owners. Rusty also liked to swim with me, even though I could swim better and faster.

One day, my father went to Los Angeles to deliver his script. Rusty and I played in the sea all afternoon. As the sun began to set, it got cooler, and we watched the surfers. They had been surfing all day and did not seem tired. One surfer was very good. She made the others look clumsy. 

When she finished, she came to talk to me. “Hi! Why didn’t you join us?” she asked. “I don’t have a surfboard,” I replied. “You could get one,” she said. “I have no money,” I said. “You’re British, right? Are you visiting?” she asked. “No, I live here,” I answered. “Is your father American?” she asked. “No, he is writing a film script from a book he wrote.” “Really? What is his name?” she asked. “Rufus Marsh,” I said. “Oh! I know him! I read his book, Tall as the Morning.” She looked at me with interest. I felt happy because she was friendly and liked my father’s book."
25,"Violet Hetherington was in a long line at the dock in Southampton. She felt worried and asked herself, ""What have I done?"" Her friend Annie told her to arrive late to avoid waiting too long. But now, Violet was stuck in a long line to get on the Queen Caroline ship.

After some time, an announcement said there was a problem with the computers. People in line started to feel unhappy. They had paid a lot of money for this trip, and they wanted to enjoy it. Violet felt like she made a mistake coming on this cruise. She checked her bag for her phone but could not find it. This made her even more upset because she needed her phone to call for help.

Violet saw a nice couple behind her in line. She asked them if she could use their phone to call her son Harry. She left a message for him to ask their neighbor, Kristina, if she could check if Violet's phone was at home. If it was not there, Violet would have a hard time finding important numbers in New York.

Finally, the line moved, and Violet gave her travel documents to the worker. When she got inside the ship, it looked like a fancy hotel but not very nice. There were shiny decorations and crowded elevators. Violet felt squished in the lift as it went up, stopping at each floor to let people out.

When she reached the twelfth floor, she was happy to find her room had a balcony, just like she wanted. She had worried about this, but now she felt relieved. Violet had paid a lot of money for this trip to make sure she had a good time by the sea."
26,"John Maloof went to an auction and bought a box of old photo negatives. He wanted pictures for a book about Portage Park, a neighborhood in Chicago, USA. Instead, he found 30,000 photos by Vivian Maier, a street photographer. Maloof has collected many things from Maier's life, like her cameras, 2,000 rolls of film, 3,000 prints, and 100,000 negatives. He also has some old movies and audiotapes.

One morning, Maloof looked at all the things he found. He felt lucky. He said, ""When I bought this, I didn’t know what it was."" Maloof is a flea market seller and could have sold everything to someone else. Now, he and his friend Anthony Rydzon are trying to learn more about Maier’s life. They talked to families who knew her when she worked as a nanny and to people who developed her film.

Vivian Maier was born in 1926 in New York. She lived in France when she was a child. In 1951, she came back to New York and moved to Chicago in 1956 to work as a nanny. Maier was a private person but always had a camera. She wore big coats, wide hats, and strong shoes. Maren Baylaender, who knew her, said Maier took her camera on her days off and did not come back until late at night. Maier had strong opinions about movies and politics.

Maier loved theatre and movies. She was not very social, but she walked the streets with her camera and talked to people. She liked to document the world around her. Rydzon said, ""She was a true artist and followed her dreams."" Maier’s work was not for money. She took pictures of women, children, old people, and the poor.

Photography expert Larry Silverman said, ""Vivian has many interesting pictures."" He thinks she was influenced by other photographers. Maloof wonders if he will ever look through all the negatives he has in three big, fireproof cabinets. He did not care much about photography until he found Maier’s work. Now, he takes his own pictures inspired by her. He said, ""I realized there was so much more to this work than I thought."" Now, Maloof wants to share Vivian Maier’s name and make sure she is remembered in history."
27,"Eleanor Catton is a young writer from New Zealand. Her book, The Luminaries, is very successful. I talked to her in the UK when her book was popular. She was calm and friendly. She had just come from Germany and was going back to New Zealand the next day.

Eleanor told me a funny story. One time, at the airport, a man asked her to prove she was a writer. She showed him her book. He asked, “What is it about?” This is a hard question for a writer. 

The Luminaries takes place in New Zealand in the 1860s. There are many crimes, and twelve men are trying to solve them. The story is complicated. Eleanor wanted to write a murder mystery, but she found that the past made the story more interesting. Her book is very long, over 800 pages, because she wanted to give a good story to each of the 20 main characters.

When I asked her how it feels to be successful at a young age, she said it feels nice. She feels that people in New Zealand share in her success. She also said it can be annoying when people think her book is not deep or thoughtful.

Eleanor wanted to write the book in a special way. Each part of the book is shorter than the one before. This makes the story go faster. She said she wanted to create patterns in the book. If readers notice them, that’s good, but it’s not necessary.

Even with its special structure, The Luminaries is still an exciting murder mystery. Eleanor said she did not plan the whole story before writing it. She liked to write herself into difficult situations and then find a way out.

Eleanor also loves TV shows. I asked if she would like to write for TV. She thought that would be cool. She gets very excited when she talks about writing and New Zealand. She said being in a new place changes how she thinks about stories. 

For now, she will stay in New Zealand, and I hope it helps her write more great books."
28,"Jonny Kinkead is a man who loves guitars. When he was a boy, he played with a guitar and made things in his dad's garage. Now, for over forty years, he has made guitars by hand. Jonny says, ""I love the guitar. It is amazing that two pieces of wood can make beautiful music.""

Jonny learned to play guitar when he was eleven years old. At sixteen, he wanted a bass guitar. Instead of saving money, he decided to make one himself. He studied how different shapes and types of wood make different sounds. He had made model boats and planes with his brothers, so he knew how to build things. His dad taught him how to use tools. Jonny also fixed guitars for his friends.

Jonny's first bass guitar was good, but he did not think about making guitars as a job. He liked painting and sculpture too. After school, he studied architecture because he liked design. But halfway through, he left school. He realized that making guitars is like making art, but it is also something people can use.

For ten years, Jonny made guitars and cleaned windows to earn money. At first, he sold his guitars for the cost of materials. As he became known as a good guitar maker, he could charge more money. Even now, he says he does not make a lot of money. He can only make about ten guitars a year.

In the beginning, Jonny went to music festivals to show his guitars. He wanted musicians to try them and tell their friends. He also had to learn how to price his guitars. When he started, many people thought only American guitars were good. But now, UK-made guitars are also seen as good.

Jonny thinks new guitar makers today have an easier time. He believes they should take classes to learn. But he also thinks it is important to learn by trying and making mistakes. He says, ""Look at other instruments, see what works and what does not. If you learn from someone else, you may only learn one way. If you teach yourself, you can learn many things."""
29,"When people talk in English, they often start with the weather. A famous writer, Dr. Johnson, said that when two English people meet, they first talk about the weather. This is still true today. Many people wonder why English people talk about the weather so much. They think it is because English weather is interesting. 

An American writer, Bill Bryson, says that English weather is not very exciting. He thinks that in other places, the weather can be very dramatic, like tornadoes or big storms. But in England, the weather is usually calm. Another writer, Jeremy Paxman, disagrees with Bryson. He believes that English weather is interesting because it is always changing. 

I think both writers miss the real reason why English people talk about the weather. When they say things like, ""Nice day, isn’t it?"" or ""Ooh, isn’t it cold?"" they are not really asking about the weather. These phrases are just ways to start a conversation or fill a pause. 

Talking about the weather helps English people connect with each other. There are three main times when they use weather talk: as a greeting, to start a conversation, or when there is a quiet moment. This is why it seems like English people talk about the weather all the time. They might start with a weather greeting, then talk a little more about the weather, and return to it if the conversation stops. This is why many people think English people are obsessed with the weather."
30,"Alice Leader was in front of Hadrian’s Wall in Britain. She was with her class of 12- and 13-year-olds. She wanted to tell them how amazing it was that the Romans built this wall. The wall is 120 km long and 5 meters high. It was built about 1900 years ago. The students chose to visit the wall instead of going to Spain, Greece, or France. They wanted to know why the wall was built, but Alice felt she did not have good answers.

Alice could not find a good book about the wall and Roman times, so she decided to write one herself. She stopped teaching after 31 years and became a writer in 2001. She felt nervous but excited about this new job. Alice said teaching is like acting. It is hard work. Writing is different; it is fun but not as tiring. Her old teaching friends are jealous because she still talks to children through her stories.

Alice wants her books to be different from many other books for kids today. Many books are about sad things or are just fantasy, like Harry Potter. Alice’s books are not like that. She always taught English and History together. She loves to see when children go from being bored to being interested. She thinks it is her job to make learning fun.

Alice started writing because she felt she had time after her sons left home. Her head teacher suggested she take a writing course. At first, Alice did not want to go. But she had to send a story to join the course. She quickly wrote a story about a Roman couple and sent it in. She was accepted into the course. The other students liked her story and told her to publish it.

Alice asked her school head teacher for a year off to write her first book. Her husband, Zachary Leader, helps her with her writing. He reads her work and suggests changes. Alice likes to add more scenes to her stories. She thinks they work well together."
31,"To raise money for charity, a newspaper and a TV company asked two brothers, Jonny and Alistair Brownlee, to race. Jonny is older and a champion triathlete. They raced in the Yorkshire Dales in northern England. Jonny drove a car on the road, and Alistair rode a mountain bike across the land.

“I’m excited!” said Jonny. “I have never done this before. The views are beautiful, and I will be warm in the car.” Alistair was ready too, wearing warm cycling clothes. He said, “I have seen Jonny drive. I am not sure he will win. I might stop for tea!”

The race started at Semerwater lake and finished at Fleet Moss, which is very high. Jonny thought it would be easy for the car, but Alistair had to climb a steep hill. They quickly shook hands and started the race. Alistair rode fast on his bike, while Jonny drove the car.

Jonny’s car faced a problem right away. A big tractor was in the road. “Welcome to Yorkshire,” he said to the cameraman. “If Alistair wins, it’s because of this farmer!” After the tractor, Jonny drove on. Alistair was having a hard time. He had to get off his bike and carry it up the hill. Sheep watched him as he walked.

Finally, Alistair reached the top of the hill. The sun came out, and he started to ride fast. In the car, Jonny had to go slowly through narrow roads and a stream. He was trying to get to the finish line.

Neither brother knew who was winning. Jonny drove fast to the finish, and Alistair rode hard from the other side. When Alistair reached the finish line, he asked, “Is he here?” The crowd said no. He raised his arms and shouted, “Yes!”

A few minutes later, Jonny arrived in the car. “Well done,” he said to Alistair, but he looked sad. “I’m upset.”"
32,"Text: 

When you play on Centre Court at Wimbledon, it is very quiet. You bounce the ball on the soft grass. You throw it up to serve and hit it. You can only hear your own shots. The grass is nice, the place has a lot of history, and the players wear white. The people in the crowd are respectful. This quiet helps me play better. 

In a tennis match, I try to focus only on the game. When I win a point, the crowd cheers and claps. I hear them, but it feels far away. I don’t think about the fifteen thousand people watching me. I don’t even think about the millions of people watching on TV when I play Roger Federer in the 2008 Wimbledon final. This is the biggest match of my life. 

I always wanted to play at Wimbledon. My uncle Toni, my coach, told me it is the biggest tournament. When I was 14, I dreamed of playing there and winning. Before 2008, I played Federer and lost two times. In 2006, I was happy just to be there. Federer won easily. But in 2007, I was very sad. I knew I could have played better. I cried for half an hour after that match. Losing hurts, especially when you have a chance to win.

Toni usually does not comfort me, but after my loss in 2007, he told me not to cry. He said there would be more chances to play at Wimbledon. I felt like this was my last chance. I know that being a professional athlete is short, and I want to make the most of it. 

In 2008, I had another chance. I felt ready and confident. I learned from my loss the year before. The night before the final, I had dinner with my family and friends. We did not talk about the match because I was already thinking about it in my mind. I wanted to keep that space for myself until the match started."
33,"In April 1957, a young English woman named Jane Goodall came to Africa. She wrote home and said, ""I am living in the Africa I have always wanted."" Jane spent most of her life in Africa. She worked as a journalist, scientist, and activist. She became famous for her work with chimpanzees. 

In 1963, the National Geographic Society in Britain made her more famous by sharing her research in articles and TV shows. Jane wrote many books, including children's books and a popular book called ""In the Shadow of Man."" This book has been translated into 47 languages and is still available today. 

Jane Goodall is one of the most famous female scientists of the 20th century. Many stories have been told about her life, but they often focus on her adventures and not her real work. She has done important research on chimpanzees. Before her work, people did not know that chimpanzees eat meat or use tools. They also did not know that chimpanzees have feelings like humans and live in social groups similar to ours. 

Jane wrote a book called ""The Chimpanzees of Gombe,"" which is very important for studying chimpanzees. Her research in Gombe State, Nigeria, is considered one of the great scientific achievements. Jane changed how we study animals and how we think about ourselves as humans.

Even as a child, Jane showed her interest in animals. When she was five years old, she disappeared one day. Her family and the police looked for her. After a long search, she came back with straw in her hair. She had crawled into a henhouse to see how hens lay eggs. She stayed very still for five hours to find out. This was the start of her love for biology."
34,"Shirley Ford is a voice actor. In our first talk, she uses many funny voices. She can sound like a young boy, a tired mother, an old Scottish woman, and even a fast-talking alien. People know her voices from children’s TV shows and safety videos. Shirley says, “I just did a voiceover about back injuries. I had to learn many medical words quickly.”

Shirley explains that doing voiceovers is not easy. Many famous actors think they can do funny voices, but it is more than that. You must make the words exciting for people who cannot see you. Many well-known actors want to do voiceovers, but they often do not get the job because they are used to acting with their whole body.

After school, Shirley took a drama course. She wanted to be a regular actor. Sometimes, she sang for TV ads. One day, the man at the recording studio asked her to try out for a rabbit voice in a cartoon. She thought it was silly but tried it for fun. To her surprise, she got the part! Shirley found out she could do voices and liked voiceover work.

In her second film, she played the main character and also her brother and mother. Many women voice small boys and girls because their voices are higher. It is hard to find child actors, so companies often choose women instead. Shirley learned to make different sounds and watches children’s TV to get new voices.

Shirley enjoys working on cartoons the most. She also does educational videos and ads. She says, “It is hard to sound happy about something I don’t care about, but I learned to smile when I talk. It makes my voice sound bright.” When she works on cartoons, it feels like a holiday because she enjoys working with other actors.

There is a lot of competition for voiceover jobs. A good showreel, which shows what you can do, is very important. Shirley says, “It is good to have a strong showreel. There are agencies that help voice actors make them.” She believes she is successful because she works hard and does not give up. 

For people who want to be voice actors, Shirley suggests going to special workshops. She loves voices and becomes the characters she plays. Sometimes, if she does an American voice, she talks like that for hours or days. Her children are used to her speaking in different voices."
35,"People often ask me how I became a cartoonist. This is normal because many kids dream of being cartoonists, like they dream of being race car drivers. But most people stop dreaming and choose other jobs, like being a lawyer or making car parts. It seems silly to think you can make money by drawing funny pictures. But some people do it.

Not everyone becomes a cartoonist in the same way. Most cartoonists wanted to do this job for a long time. I loved comic strips as a kid, drew for my school, and was known as ""the kid who draws."" I studied graphic design in college. After I finished school, I showed my drawings to different companies. I was lucky to find a newspaper that wanted political cartoons. I drew some ideas, and they bought them. Soon, I was making enough money to live.

You don’t need a university degree or a lot of money to be a cartoonist. You just need your brain, your hand, and something to draw with. But it is not easy. It is better to have other skills too. I have done political cartoons, comic strips, and comic books. I have also written and designed. I take any job because I can learn a lot from all kinds of work. It helps to be smart and curious about the world.

Now, many cartoonists have to sell their own work. It is not enough to just draw. The better you are at selling your work, the more successful you will be. I have seen cartoonists who are not very creative but are good at business do better than very talented artists who do not know how to sell.

Some people worry too much about others stealing their ideas. They are scared to show their work. To protect your drawings, you can write a small ‘c’ for ‘copyright’ and put your name and the date next to it. But really, it is more likely that no one will care about your work. If someone does take your cartoon and it becomes popular online, it can be a good thing!"
36,"Twenty years ago, I was moving to a new house. I was cleaning and decided to throw away my electric guitar. My dad bought it for my 16th birthday. I usually don’t like to throw things away, so I felt bad. I took the guitar to the dump. A young man saw me and asked, “You are not going to throw that away, right?” I said yes, and he asked if he could have it. I said yes, and we went our own ways.

After that, I felt sad about giving it away. A few months ago, I got an email that changed my life. It was from a man named Keith Rushton. He said, “I have your electric guitar.” He found my guitar after it was sold many times. He saw my name on a label on the guitar and found me online. He contacted me through my work at a newspaper and wanted to sell it back to me. I was very happy and would have paid anything for it, but his price was fair.

My dad always put name labels on my things, even my guitar. My parents wanted me to learn classical guitar because it was popular in the 1970s. I loved the sound of it. It was nice and gentle. But I had trouble learning it, so I switched to electric guitar. At that time, punk music was popular, and anyone could be a rock star.

When I opened the box with my guitar, I remembered my birthday in 1978 when my parents gave it to me. The guitar felt smooth and smaller than I remembered. I held it and wanted to stand up to play it. My fingers remembered where to go. I felt a little pain in my fingers from pressing the strings. 

The electric guitar is not usually played alone. Now that I am learning it again, I want to form a band. My son is learning the saxophone, so maybe we can play together. There might be other people my age who feel the same way. We could call ourselves “The Regainers!”"
37,"Text: 

Many people are talking about sleep now. I wrote a book called Insomniac. It is about people who cannot sleep. I wanted to tell everyone that not sleeping is bad for our minds and bodies. People who have trouble sleeping know how important sleep is. It is good that people are paying more attention to sleep. 

But what about dreams? I do not hear much about dreams. When you wake up early, you lose sleep. You lose the time when you dream. This time is called REM, which means Rapid Eye Movement. We have the best dreams in this stage of sleep. A good sleeper spends about one-fourth of their sleep time in REM. If a person lives for 90 years, they will spend six or seven years dreaming.

When scientists take away REM sleep, people dream more the next night. This shows that dreams are important. In 1953, scientists found REM sleep. A famous psychologist, Sigmund Freud, said that dreams help us understand our minds. But later studies showed that dreams are not that simple. Now, scientists study dreams more for their physical reasons than for their psychological reasons. 

Robert Stickgold, a sleep scientist, says that dream researchers do not agree on many things. Dreams are important. A study by P.F. Pagel found that actors, writers, and directors remember and use their dreams better than other people. This shows that creative people use their dreams more. 

Stickgold says that dreams help us think in new ways. They help us connect old and new ideas. For example, when people wake up from REM sleep and think of a word, their ideas are more original than when they wake from other sleep stages. They think of surprising and creative ideas. 

I write better when I wake up from strong dreams. Even a bad dream can help me think better. On those days, I can write quickly. I do not know how it works, but it helps. 

Creativity is not just for writers or artists. We all need to think well in our lives. We need to dream to help us think creatively and solve problems with others. This is why dreams are important."
38,"Susie Ray left London twenty years ago. She moved to a small town by the sea in south-west England. In her studio, you can see empty frames on the walls and pictures of her two daughters. Susie is a copyist artist. She can paint famous artworks very well. When she finishes her paintings, she sells them quickly. Many people want her work. 

In her 30 years as a copyist, Susie has painted works by famous artists like Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh. Some people think her copies are the real paintings. The real paintings can sell for millions of pounds, but her copies sell for a few hundred to £12,000, depending on how much time she spends on them. 

Susie does not tell who her clients are, but they include art galleries and collectors. Some collectors want to show off their art. They might say they have a Van Gogh, but it is really a copy by Susie. Some collectors keep the real painting safe and show Susie’s copy instead. 

Susie is honest about her work. She tries to make her copies look real, but she signs her name on the back. It is illegal to sell a copy as the original. Susie knows people who do this, but she does not want to get in trouble. She is not very rich, but she is more secure now. 

Before being a copyist, Susie worked as an illustrator for a botanical garden. She learned to be very accurate in her work. She is happy she found a job that pays better. When young artists ask her for advice, she tells them to learn to draw well. 

Susie can draw many things, but she likes to copy French impressionist paintings the most. She thinks people think modern art is easy, but it is not. Impressionist artists painted quickly, but they were also very careful. 

Some people wonder why Susie does not make her own art. She has tried, but she feels her own paintings do not look as good. Susie is a perfectionist and wants to do her best."
39,"Ellen MacArthur loved the sea and wanted to be the fastest sailor. She loved sailing since she was a child. When she was on her boat, she felt very happy. But when she was on land, she felt bored and wanted to go back to the ocean. 

One time, she came in second place in a big race called the Vendée Globe. After the race, she showed me her small boat, Kingfisher. She lived there for 94 days. She planned everything carefully, even how many paper towels she needed. She had special food and a small stove. Her boat was very important to her, and she took good care of it.

Ellen thinks the world is like a boat. It is small and beautiful, but it can be damaged. She had a big change in her life when she went to South Georgia, an island in the south Atlantic. There, she helped with a bird study. This made her think about how we use the earth’s resources. She saw old whaling stations and felt sad. She thought we take too much from the earth and do not give back.

Now, Ellen talks about saving the planet. She says we cannot keep using coal, oil, and gas because they will run out. She wants people to reuse things instead of using them once. She visits factories and talks to people about how we can use resources better. 

Ellen started the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a charity that helps young people think about a better future. She misses sailing and the adventure of being at sea. But now, she feels that helping the planet is very important. She believes this work is more important than being the fastest sailor in the world."
40,"Jordan Romero is 13 years old. He wants to be the youngest person to climb Mount Everest. If he does this, he could be very famous. Many young people spend time on computers and games. Jordan wants to inspire kids to go outside and climb. 

Jordan's team is his father, Paul, and his mother, Karen. They call themselves ""Team Romero."" Climbing Everest is part of their goal. If Jordan climbs Everest and another mountain called Vinson Massif in Antarctica, he will be the youngest person to climb the Seven Summits. The Seven Summits are the highest mountains on each continent. Few people do this before they are thirty years old. Jordan has already climbed five of them and might finish before he turns 20.

Some famous climbers think it is not a good idea for a 13-year-old to climb Everest. They say young climbers may be strong, but they might not be ready emotionally. They also think young people do not have enough experience to climb safely. 

Paul, Jordan's father, knows about these opinions. He says, ""I hear the criticism, but I have to keep going. We think about the risks, but we believe our experience will help. Watching Jordan grow gives me confidence."" 

Paul also wants to know why Jordan wants to climb. He says, ""This is not about me. At first, Jordan wanted to do this later, but we thought, 'Why not now?' We talk to him to make sure he still wants to do it."" 

When asked why he wants to climb, Jordan says, ""I just focus on my goal."" 

Today, many people want to be the youngest or fastest to climb a mountain. This makes climbing more popular. Jordan has to share his adventure online and give interviews. He needs to show something exciting, like climbing Everest. 

Paul says, ""If Jordan comes home and wants to stop climbing and play basketball, we will stop this project and go to the gym."""
41,"When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, they are probably not listening to classical music. Many people know pop music groups, but they may not know who Brahms is. I am studying music at school, but my friends do not know much about classical music either. Most people do not buy classical music. Last year, only 3% of concert tickets were for classical music, and classical recordings sell very few copies. 

Why do fewer people like classical music now? Older people think teenagers spend too much time on TV and video games, but I don’t think that is the problem. Many teenagers do not find classical music interesting. Some teenagers do go to classical concerts, but they are not many. I play music in an orchestra, but I do not listen to much classical music. 

Teenagers like fast music. Classical music has many changes and takes time to understand. Pop music is simple and easy to listen to. It also talks about things that matter to teenagers. 

In the past, families played music together at home. Now, we can find any music online. You rarely hear classical music in shops. Some teachers say more people go to classical concerts now, but I think most of them are not teenagers. In my orchestra, we play in many places, but the audience is mostly older people. 

Some people say schools do not help teenagers like classical music, but many kids want to play classical music in their school orchestra. They practice a lot. They like playing classical music, but they do not listen to it for fun. When we want to relax, we listen to pop music."
42,"Bonnie Wyndham got out of her mother’s car and looked at Almonside School. She said, “I will make you sorry I came here,” but she said it nicely. Her mother was getting out of the car too, so she did not hear Bonnie. Bonnie didn’t mind if she did. Her mother knew how Bonnie felt. 

Mrs. Wyndham looked around. Almonside School was strange. It had many buildings hidden in the trees on a hill. It was confusing at first. Then she saw signs: Science block, gym, riding center… “Riding center,” Bonnie said, suddenly interested. “Headmaster’s study,” her mother said. “This way.” Bonnie followed her mother along a wide path between the trees. 

“I wish you would walk beside me, not behind me like a dog,” Mrs. Wyndham said tiredly, but she did not expect Bonnie to do it. A few minutes later, her mother was talking to Bonnie’s new headmaster in his study. Bonnie sat and waited outside the door. Suddenly, she jumped up. “Why should I just sit here?” she said to herself. “I will be thrown out soon anyway,” she said to the door. “So why not go now?” 

She left the building and went to the riding center. There was a nice old building for the horses and a big place for indoor riding. Bonnie looked around, but no one was there. She walked carefully to the horses. Bonnie respected horses. They were well taken care of. Almost every stall had a horse. She looked at each horse and thought about it. 

“I know what you are doing here,” she said to a small pony, touching its nose. Then she saw the next horse. “But aren’t you the best!” she said. He was brown with a little white. He looked lively, and Bonnie liked that. “I feel like we have met before,” she said, petting his neck. “In my dreams, I was riding you to win a big competition…” The horse’s name was Maverick. 

Bonnie wanted to ride him. “I wonder where I can find a bridle and a saddle,” she thought. The room with the riding gear was open. She was happy to find it. While she put the saddle on Maverick, she forgot about her mother and the headmaster. 

When she sat on the big horse outside, she felt like a queen. At her old school, they called her Queen Bee, and she laughed when she remembered. “You are the best horse I have ever ridden, Maverick,” she said. “I know about horses, even if I don’t know about other things.” 

She nudged him to walk, then to trot. “If I stay here, I think we can be great friends,” she said. She rode around the paddock. The ride was exciting, and a little breeze touched her cheek. She felt that Maverick trusted her, and she was sure he would jump well."
43,"Cody Simpson is a 15-year-old boy from Australia. He is a singer and has made many popular songs. Cody started playing guitar when he was six years old and wrote his first songs when he was seven. He loved swimming and surfing more than anything else when he was younger. 

When he was 13, he posted some videos of himself singing with a friend online. Many people liked the videos and wanted to see more. Cody recorded more videos at home, and people loved them. 

Cody was also a great swimmer. He trained hard and had good coaches. But then, music companies wanted him to sing. He had to make a big choice: stay in Australia and keep swimming or move to the US with his family to sing. Cody decided to move. 

He felt it was hard to choose what to do with his life at such a young age. He told his swimming coach and friends about his decision, and they were surprised. Cody is a quiet person and likes to stay humble. 

Cody and his family moved far away to follow his dream of being a singer. His family supports him but stays out of the spotlight. Cody thinks it is important to have good people around him. 

Sometimes, he worries about his little brother and sister. His brother is eight years old and travels with him. Cody thinks about how this affects his brother's life. But his family always tells him they support him. 

Cody believes that success comes from saying ""yes"" to big opportunities, even if it is scary. He is now visiting many countries and singing for many fans. It is a dream come true for him, but he knows it may not last forever."
44,"I jumped out of bed and looked out the window. I saw the river. There was a crack in the ice shining in the sun. I looked at the sandbags. They were there to stop the water from flooding when the ice melted. My back hurt because I helped lift the sandbags last week with many people from the town. 

I looked at the river. There was a dark patch of water from a factory. The ice was thin on the sides, but solid further down. I took off my pajamas and put on my kayaking wetsuit. I saw a boy on the other side of the river. I did not know him. He was trying to stand on the ice near the warm water from the factory. 

I zipped up my wetsuit and put on my kayaking jacket. I checked my pocket for my lucky silver chain. My grandfather gave it to me. Only my mom, my grandfather, and I know about it. I also have my grandfather's diary from his trip to South America. I read it before I sleep. 

I went to the kitchen. “Good morning, Rex,” my mom said. She smiled at me while I took a banana. “You are up early for Saturday. I will make brunch after your training. Be careful.” “Thanks, Mom,” I said. 

I walked down the hall and almost bumped into my tall grandfather. “Watch where you’re going!” he shouted. “Where are you going?” “Sorry, Grandpa. I’m going kayaking.” He should know that by now. 

“What is the point of training? You didn’t win the competition,” he said. His words hurt, but I took a deep breath. He went into the bathroom and slammed the door. My mom came to me with a kind smile. “Don’t mind him. He’s…” “...not himself right now,” I said. I wanted to say he always was like this, but I didn’t. 

When I was little, he was my hero. He showed me pictures of his adventures in a magazine. Those pictures are still on his wall with his medals. But I don’t go into his room anymore. I have my own trophies now. I hope to be in that magazine one day too. 

Mom smiled. “At least he is coming out of his room more. Have a good training, Rex. I admire your hard work, even in the cold!” I smiled back and peeled my banana. “It will be warmer in South America if I find sponsors for my trip.” She laughed and went back to the kitchen. 

I finished my banana and went outside to the boathouse."
45,"Mum took Jess by the arm. ""Come with me,"" she said. Jess went with her to the study. On the table, there was a painting by Grandpa. It was not finished. ""Do you know about this?"" Mum asked. Jess shook her head. ""I have never seen it before. I didn’t know he was painting.""

Jess looked at the picture. There was a river in it. It was not a river she knew. It looked strange and beautiful. The riverbank was very small and green. There were no animals, no birds, and no people in the painting. It felt right that way. Jess thought about autumn coming after summer.

Mum said, ""It has a name."" Jess could hear something in Mum's voice. It was not excited. Jess knew why. Grandpa never named his paintings. He just painted them. Mum turned the painting over and pointed to the words Grandpa wrote. Jess read them: ""River Boy."" The words felt important, but she did not know why.

Jess looked at Mum. ""There is no boy."" Mum said, ""Yes, it is strange. Maybe he will add the boy later. I asked him about it."" Jess said, ""Mum! You should not have asked."" Mum replied, ""I know, but I was curious. It is a special painting."" Jess knew what Grandpa would say. ""He would say it is not the artist's job to explain a painting. Each painting has its own meaning, like a poem. We either understand it or we don’t.""

Mum laughed and said, ""He would say if artists had to explain their paintings, they would never finish."" Mum hoped Jess might know something about the painting because she inspired Grandpa. ""Muse?"" Jess asked. ""Yes, someone who inspires an artist."" Jess knew this word. Grandpa often said it when she watched him paint. But she thought a muse was not a real person. 

""He does not need me to inspire him,"" Jess said. ""He has painted all his life."""
46,"This morning, I woke up and accidentally made a hole in my bedroom carpet. I didn’t mean to do it. I could have tripped over my bed and cut the carpet with Dad’s knife. That could happen, but I’m not saying it did. I just didn’t want to hurt the carpet. I didn’t wake up and think, “Today I will cut my carpet.” It seemed like a good idea at the time, but later I wondered why I thought that.

What I was really doing was trying to fit my corner cabinet into a corner. My grandma gave me this cabinet when she moved. It is small and painted white with pink and blue flowers. Grandma kept pretty things in it, and now I keep my shells and stones there. I was very happy when she gave it to me!

The cabinet is a corner cabinet, so it has to go in a corner. My bedroom is small and has only two corners. The big bedroom is for my parents, my sister Angela has the back room, and my brother Tom has the room over the garage. My room is very small, like a broom cupboard. 

Mum says when Angela goes to university, Tom can have her room, and I can have Tom’s room. But Angela is only fifteen, so I think I will be in my small room for a long time. I like my little bedroom. It feels cozy, like a nest. The roof is sloped, and the window is low.

The problem is, I don’t have many corners! My bed is in one corner, and my wardrobe is in the other. I tried to put Grandma’s cabinet in the space between the roof and the floor, but it was too tall. I thought, if I can’t cut the cabinet, maybe I can cut a hole in the carpet. It seemed like a good idea. Dad always tells us to “think outside the box,” and that is what I was trying to do!"
47,"The book ""The Borrowers"" is about a family of tiny people. They live in the walls and floors of a house. They take things from normal-sized people to survive. When I was asked to make a TV show from the book, I knew it would be hard. Many people love the book and have strong ideas about it. I looked at the original drawings to help me. The author wanted the show to show the Borrowers' view, not the humans'. This made filming more difficult.

The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans. So, when we filmed them walking or borrowing things, we had to be ten times further away than usual. The crew had to crawl on the ground and film from very low, about 15 centimeters high. They wore out many pairs of jeans! We only raised the cameras for special shots.

One big problem was making the shadows look right. We found a special way to do this. After the show, a famous director, George Lucas, asked me how I did it. We built only one set, the Borrowers' home under the floor. It had big objects to make the actors look small. It was very fun. I remember the coins; they were bigger than dinner plates and hard to lift. We often laughed while filming.

In the story, there is a scene where the Borrowers go down a drain. To film this, the actors had to go down a tunnel with hoses. They said it was very scary! I wanted the costumes to look right. I had them made from heavy material so they looked like doll clothes. This made it hard for the main actress to move. She could not sit down or take off her dress because it was sewn on every morning. The main actor wore trousers made from a rug because normal fabric looked too smooth. It was very hot during filming, and I don’t think they liked the costumes!

Most of the action away from the Borrowers' home was filmed in front of a blue screen. The actors had to pretend things were there. I drew pictures of every scene to show how they should look. I drew 2,000 pictures! We did not have enough money for special effects during the day, so I worked nights for three months. We had to work fast. Once, I filmed a whole scene and forgot to put film in the camera! But in the end, everything came together, and I think the show was good at showing the magic of the books."
48,"Mom stops the car at my new school, Palm Grove High School. She looks around, worried about journalists, but there are none. I know things will get crazy soon. People will smile and want to be my friend because of my dad. I tell Mom, “Everything will be fine.” She kisses my cheek, and I get out of the car. Now I am alone at this new school. But I wanted this. I wanted to leave my old life of traveling and tutors. I want to meet normal kids. 

I walk into the school office. “Hi, I need my schedule,” I say to the secretary. “What’s your name?” she asks. “Desert McGraw,” I reply. She looks confused. “Desirée?” she asks. “No, Desert,” I say again. She types my last name on her computer. “What grade?” she asks. “Eleventh,” I answer. She prints my schedule and gives it to me. My first class is English Literature. I like English, so that’s good. 

I look at the map to find my class. I don’t want to get lost. When I get to the door, the teacher is calling names. I quietly enter and sit at the back. A girl next to me smiles and says, “Nice shoes.” I look down at my fancy shoes and think, “Oh no, I shouldn’t have worn these.” “Thanks,” I say. 

The teacher calls my name, “Desert McGraw?” I say, “Here.” The teacher, Ms. Smigla, is nice. She talks a lot and gives us time to talk to each other. My new friend asks, “Why did you move here?” I think about telling her the truth, but I say, “My dad had to relocate.” “What does he do?” she asks. I say, “He’s an artist.” “Cool. I’m Becca,” she replies. She seems nice, and I hope to fit in here."
49,"Many people think that American teenage girls must do a lot of things. They should be the president of the Student Council, have a part-time job, help others, and do well in school. This is what it means to be a teenager in America today. Boys and girls cannot just go to school and be average. They must work hard and have big dreams. 

Kristen Loose, a teenager, says that many adults forget how much pressure teenagers feel. They have a lot of homework, tests, jobs, chores, and they want to have friends too. Even with all this stress, people still think teenagers are lazy or loud. Kristen thinks this is not fair. She says many people think teenagers only watch TV or use their phones all the time. 

Kristen uses her phone to help her with school and to stay in touch with people. She believes that phones help make life easier for teenagers. Now, students can do homework anywhere, not just at school. They can listen to lessons while going to school. 

Many teenagers wake up early, around 6 or 7 in the morning, and go to bed late, often after midnight. They have school, activities, family duties, and homework. They do not get enough sleep. A study found that only 20 percent of teenagers sleep the recommended nine hours a night. Some even fall asleep in school because they are tired.

Lindamarie Olsen, another teenager, says she has about 18 hours of free time each week. This is not much when there are 168 hours in a week. She does not spend her free time on social media or TV. Instead, she likes to help others. She believes that many people think teenagers only care about themselves. But for her, helping others is very important. 

In the future, teenagers will still be working hard and changing the world, just like they do today."
50,"The Earth to Sky Calculus Club is a group of teenagers who live in Bishop, a small town in the mountains of the US. This town is surrounded by nature. The club has sent over fifty balloons high into the sky, about 35 km above the Earth. They do this to learn about space and have fun.

One weekend in spring, I joined them as they prepared to send up a balloon. They wanted to see shooting stars. Shooting stars happen when a rock or metal from space falls into the Earth's atmosphere and makes a bright light. 

As it got dark, the teenagers attached a soft lunch box to the balloon. Inside the lunch box, there was a camera, a tool to measure how high the balloon goes, and a thermometer to check the temperature. They also put two GPS trackers on the outside of the lunch box to find it later. They used a gas tank to fill the balloon, which grew big like a small car. An older boy drove a long way to get the gas tank.

When it was time to launch the balloon, they counted down: ""Five, four, three, two, one!"" The balloon went up into the sky. Some of the kids ran with flashlights to see where it went. They felt excited and amazed as they watched it disappear into the night.

After the launch, most students went home, but a few stayed to watch for shooting stars. They lay on blankets and looked at the clear sky. I saw a boy fall asleep in his sleeping bag. One girl said, ""We're the only ones talking,"" and another girl whispered, ""I know."" Suddenly, a meteor flew across the sky.

As the balloon went up, it got bigger and bigger until it popped. A parachute helped the lunch box come back down safely. The next day, the students used the GPS trackers to find it. It was not easy to get back, but that was part of the fun. The lunch box usually lands in a remote area.

The leader of the group said, ""Recovering the lunch box is a big part of the project."" They had lost only two lunch boxes in 53 launches. This time, the lunch box landed 84 km away from Bishop. The team had to drive a long way to find it. They had to decide if they should drive or walk to get it, especially if it was on a high mountain or in a tall tree.

The leader said, ""These students know this area well. What seems dangerous to some is normal for others."" It took them 11 hours to find the lunch box. It was in a canyon, on a flat rock, near a waterfall. The camera did not catch any shooting stars, which was a little sad. But it gave them a chance to talk about science and share another adventure story."
51,"Chloe Morgan did not like science or Palaeontology when she was younger. This changed when she was fifteen. Her younger brother liked dinosaurs, and she helped him with a school project. She found an article about new dinosaur discoveries, and it excited her. She wanted to learn more about Palaeontology.

Chloe met a famous palaeontologist named Matt Cornelius. She was nervous to talk to him because he was well-known. But he was friendly and listened to her questions, which made her feel better.

Chloe thinks movies like Jurassic Park make people interested in dinosaurs, but they do not show palaeontologists correctly. She feels that movies often show palaeontologists as strange or funny people. In real life, her job is very different. She digs up dinosaur bones, works in labs, studies fossils, and writes about science.

Chloe also wants to share science with young people. She believes it is important for them to learn about science. Talking about dinosaurs can help children become interested in nature and science.

Chloe worked on a TV show called Walking with Dinosaurs. She helped make sure the dinosaurs looked right and were from the same time period. The show was successful because it showed real information about dinosaurs, which are different from those in movies.

Chloe thinks dinosaurs are still interesting because they make us curious. They remind us that there is still much to discover in the world. Palaeontology is like traveling back in time."
52,"When you travel by car with your family, you often ask, ""Are we there yet?"" Even if you are six years old, you know you are not there yet. When you arrive, it is not ""there"" anymore; it is ""here."" So, you should ask, ""Are we here yet?""

Parents hear this question many times on long trips. Kids might think it is hard, but it can be nice to sit in the back seat. You can watch movies, listen to music, or do puzzles. Your mom or dad is in the front seat, giving you juice and cookies and changing the radio.

But sometimes, things can get a little crazy. For example, my younger brother, Tim, might put his foot on my side of the seat. I do not like that, so I put my foot on his side. Soon, we are fighting, and our parents have to tell us to stop. They want us to stay in our own seats.

After a while, I try to read, but I feel something on my arm. Tim is blowing his breath on me. He is not touching me, so he thinks it is okay. This makes me angry, and we start fighting again. 

My dad has some funny ways to answer the question, ""Are we there yet?"" Sometimes he says, ""Yes, we are here. Get out of the car."" But we are still driving! Then he says, ""Maybe we are not there yet."" This makes us quiet for a bit.

You know you are really ""there"" when your parents get out of the car and walk away from you. So remember, if your mom and dad are still close enough to answer you, then you are not there yet!"
53,"John and Zuzi Morgan have opened a café in Oxford, UK. In their café, people can drink coffee, eat cake, and play board games. John and Zuzi want people to enjoy their time and come back again. Zuzi says they started this café because many people are busy with their phones and computers. They want to help people talk and have fun together.

The games in their café are called ""Eurogames."" These games have easy themes, like farming and building. One famous game is called The Settlers of Catan. In this game, players build homes on an island and trade things with each other. Everyone can play together and feel included.

Another popular game is called Pandemic. In this game, players work together to solve problems in the world. It was made by Matt Leacock, who loves board games. He remembers feeling excited about games as a child but sometimes felt disappointed when they were not fun. With help from his uncle, he tried to make better games.

Pandemic became very popular. It tells a story as you play, like a video game. Many people now play games on their phones, which makes them more open to playing board games too. 

Before, people played video games together in the same room. Now, many play online and do not see each other. Some of these people want to play games with friends in person again. In John and Zuzi's busy café, board games are not just for fun; they help people connect in real life."
54,"Jamie Scott is a musician from the UK. He has written many popular songs. His story shows that hard work and not giving up are important in music. Jamie's mother was a great singer and taught him to play the guitar. He only listened to a local radio station when he was young, which played music for older people. He did not hear new songs until he was 12 years old.

When he was a teenager, Jamie had to choose between playing tennis and making music. He was good at tennis but liked music more. At 17, he left school to become a performer. He worked with a friend who played guitar but did not want to be a performer. Jamie told his parents that he wanted to make music. His dad said he had 18 months to succeed, or he would need to find a job.

At 19, Jamie got a chance with a music publisher after writing one song. But the music labels wanted him to be a solo artist, so he had to stop working with his friend. Jamie found success as a songwriter instead of a performer. He had a hard time with a record label in the UK and then moved to a new label to make a new album. He did not become famous right away.

Jamie believes he has been in the wrong place at the wrong time as a performer, but he has been successful as a writer. He helps new artists write songs. He tells them it is okay to want their music to be popular. He wants to write songs that many people will love. Jamie is honest about wanting to write big hits. He knows he can do it well. When he works in the studio, he aims to create the best music for everyone to enjoy."
55,"Tony Connor is a new kind of celebrity. He is famous online, but many people do not know him. He is a ""street trials cyclist."" This means he jumps from hard places like roofs and walls to land safely in other strange places. People film his jumps and put them online.

I met Tony one Saturday morning at a BMX park. The local boys know him well. Many older people also come to see him and call him a ""legend."" After watching him, I agree. He is very brave and creative. Before each jump, he tells us what he will do. Sometimes, I think he cannot do it, but he always does!

Tony is famous, but he does not like being a celebrity. He says, ""I find it hard to talk to fans. I want to do things, not just talk about them."" This is funny because he is famous because of social media and cameras. He says, ""This technology helps me make money."" He feels that many people are always looking at their screens, and he does not like that.

Tony makes good money from his videos. He loves what he does, which used to be just a hobby. After many years of talking to athletes, I learned that two things help a child become a great athlete: energy and the ability to handle disappointment. These are very important, especially in risky sports. 

At the park, Tony fell a few times on easy things for him. But he got up and kept trying until he did it right. Some people think he is a hero, but others say he is reckless. Tony says, ""People who say this may care, but they do not understand. They have never tried riding a trials bike and do not know the sport. I get advice from experts to stay safe.""

Tony is careful about risks. He says, ""Some people are not scared, but they should be careful. I feel fear, but I find a way to go past it. I am not addicted to risk. I plan a lot and sometimes ride around to get ready before a jump. I know I must stay calm before I jump. If I focus, I will be fine."""
56,"Helen Skelton is a TV presenter. She has done many dangerous things to help charity. She ran a marathon in the desert and traveled down the Amazon river in a small boat. 

For her new challenge, Helen walked on a high wire. This wire was 66 meters above the ground, between two tall towers. There was no safety net. She wore a belt that was attached to another wire above her. To help her stay balanced, she used a long stick that weighed eight kilograms. 

Helen learned from a teacher who is good at high-wire walking. She already knew some circus skills, but high-wire walking was very different. She said, ""The training was a shock. I didn’t know I needed to be so strong."" 

Every day, her training started at 8 am. She ran up a steep hill, did exercises for one hour, and then practiced on the wire for another hour. She also learned how to fall safely on the wire. When she fell, it hurt a lot. But she knew she had to stay positive. If she got nervous, the wire would shake too!

On the day of the challenge, it was windy. Helen took deep breaths and moved slowly along the wire. The walk was 150 meters long and took her 15 minutes. Afterward, she said, ""That was the scariest thing I’ve done. I’m glad it’s over!"" 

But Helen is not done yet. She is planning her next charity project: to reach the South Pole by ski, kite, and bike."
57,"In 2006, Jeff Somers started a trip around the world on a penny farthing. A penny farthing is an old bicycle with one big wheel and one small wheel. Jeff had written a book about his travels in Canada in a very old car. He loved cars and worked on racing car engines. To save money, Jeff rode an old bicycle to work and used it to go to Amsterdam for vacation. 

Jeff says, ""That trip opened my eyes. I wanted to see the world by bike."" He did not want a normal bike. He wanted to build a special one. He thought a penny farthing was the craziest bike, so he went to a museum to learn how to make one. 

In 2001 and 2003, he tried to start his trip but had to stop because of a knee injury. Finally, in 2006, he began his journey. He traveled for three years and visited 23 countries on four continents. The best part of his trip was arriving in Tibet and seeing Mount Everest. 

Jeff met other cyclists who could ride up mountains, but he was happy with his penny farthing. People were very surprised to see it as he traveled. 

His worst moment was when he had to drink dirty water from a stream. He got very sick and stayed in a hostel for ten days without medicine. He had no money for a hospital or to go home. 

Even with these problems, Jeff says, ""If I could afford it, I would start traveling again tomorrow on my penny farthing."""
58,"I work at a university in the US. My team and I study water birds, especially the American black duck. We have a new tool called a ‘night-vision scope’. This tool helps us see the ducks at night! 

We are worried about black ducks because there are not many left. We do not know if there is enough food for them on the east coast. We have information about what they do in the day, but we do not know what they do at night. Now, with the night-vision scope, we can see clearly even when it is dark. This will help us learn more and take care of their home better.

Our work is hard. There are four of us, and we work six hours every day. We study ducks in different places. Sometimes, I have to take a boat to see the ducks and write down what I see. The weather can be difficult. Some nights are warm, but many nights are wet. It is very quiet, so I drink a lot of coffee to stay awake! 

We have only missed one day of work because there was too much snow. I like this work, even if it is hard. In summer, we will work in a laboratory and look at our results together. It will be hard to be inside, but it is important. I would not change this job for anything!"
59,"I have a very special job. People are surprised when I tell them what I do. I eat chocolate at work! My job is to make sure the chocolate is very good for customers. 

Every week, I get small pieces of chocolate from our factory. I taste them to check if they are good. I also taste the nuts and fruit we use in the chocolate. I choose the best ones to put in the chocolate. 

I have a kitchen next to my office. In the kitchen, I can make and taste new chocolate. I share samples with my coworkers, and they like it! My kitchen has many machines and ingredients. It is nice to have my own space at work. 

Every day is different. Sometimes I work in our food lab, and sometimes I travel to buy ingredients. I have a young family, so this can be hard. But I like that my job is not the same every day. 

People often ask me if I get bored of chocolate. I have worked with chocolate for a long time, and I still love it. I even eat chocolate at home in the evening!"
60,"Have you ever thought about what it is like to work in a circus? Sophia Grayson works at Circus Experience. This is a place where young people learn circus skills. She says many people like her course because they learn many things. They learn to juggle, throw and catch balls, and even do trapeze, which is flying in the air above an audience.

The course lasts one year. Students take more risks as they learn. Parents can come to some classes to see how their children are doing. Sophia says that circus performers should not do the same thing all the time. They need to keep their shows exciting. To be good in the circus, you must practice a lot. 

Another good thing is making friends with other performers and learning from them. Being fit is very important too. Circus artists train every day to stay strong. Training is important, but the best performers are those who want to succeed, have good ideas, and keep getting better.

Some people think circus performers get hurt a lot or only work a little each year. But the real challenge is thinking about the future. You can only travel and perform when you are young. After that, you need to think about other jobs. 

The course also teaches business skills. Many students start their own businesses around the world and share their stories. But Sophia warns that working in the circus is not a way to make a lot of money. “You usually do not get a regular salary. It is also very competitive, but it is a lot of fun!”"
61,"You may not know her name or face, but you have probably heard her many times. Mariam Hobson is a backing singer. This means she sings in the background to help the main singer. Some people think backing singers are not as good as lead singers, but that is not true. They are very talented! Mariam says, ""I love my job because I never know what I will sing when I go to the studio. It could be classical, jazz, hip-hop, or rock music. Sometimes, I even sing funny songs for radio or ads. Once, I was asked to sing like a fish underwater! I never argue; I just do my job.""

Mariam needs to be very good at music and learn quickly. Sometimes, there is no music sheet to read. She remembers her first time recording music for a film. It was hard because there were eight singers, and each one sang a different part. There was also an orchestra. She was scared because if she made a mistake, they would have to record everything again, and nobody likes that. Recording can take a long time.

One of her favorite jobs is recording for songwriters. Some new writers do not know what type of music is best for a female voice. When they hear Mariam sing their song, they can see how to make it better."
62,"Julie Deane started with little knowledge about fashion. She made a successful business selling ‘satchels,’ which are bags used by schoolchildren. Now, these bags are sold in famous shops and many celebrities use them.

Before she chose to sell satchels, Julie thought about other businesses, like cake decorating and party planning. She wanted to make the best choice. Some people told her that no one wanted satchels, but Julie believed in her idea. She worked with her mother, who had never worked before but was good at business. The design of the satchels came from children’s storybooks.

At first, Julie did not know much about fashion blogs, but they helped her business grow. She sold about one satchel each week. To get more attention, she sent satchels to fashion writers and hoped they would write about them. They did, and more people became interested. Now, Julie is excited to see which celebrity will be seen with a satchel next!

While other companies spend money on ads, Julie uses the internet to get ideas for new styles. There was a hard time when another company copied her design, so now she makes sure to trust her production team as much as her own staff. People who visit her office say it feels good to be there. There is a new factory, but it is the team that makes the place special."
63,"When Vicky Harmiston was a child, her parents let her and her brother Jamie choose what to do in their free time. Vicky liked to play many sports. She was a good swimmer, and her coach thought she could be a champion. But the swimming club was far from her home, so it was hard for her to train and do her schoolwork.

When they were teenagers, Jamie loved cycling. He bought a special bike and started to race. Vicky thought this was exciting and wanted to try it too. She says it was the best choice she ever made. Soon, she was cycling every day and doing very well. The track was close to her school, so it was easy for her to go to training after school.

Vicky had a great career in track cycling and won many competitions. When she was 28, she stopped racing. Vicky said, “I loved winning, but I got tired of it. When the fun stops, there is no reason to continue. Luckily, I found a new job.”

Vicky now works for a charity called CycleZone. “We help young people who do not like sports,” she says. “First, we teach them to ride a bike. We want them to believe in themselves. CycleZone is good because it brings young people together.”

The charity uses famous people to help them. Vicky says, “Some people think having a celebrity is not always good for a charity. They say celebrities want to be famous, and this can hide the real work of the charity. But if famous singers and actors can help, I think they should.”"
64,"Ana Ronson is a singer and songwriter from Ireland. Her parents did not play music, but there was always music in her home. Her grandfather played the guitar and taught Ana and her brother how to play.

Ana was very nervous the first time she sang in front of people at school. Her teacher had to help her off the stage. The teacher suggested that Ana join the school theatre club to feel more confident. After some time in the club, Ana sang happily with 50 other students at a concert.

A year later, her brother, who was in a band, asked her to write a song for them. Ana wrote her first song called ""Falling Stars"" in just three days. She liked it so much that she took a songwriting course with a professional. Even though she was the youngest student, she knew a lot about music. But Ana felt the teacher did not listen to her, so she wrote a song called ""Something to Say"" about this. She shared the song online, and many people loved it.

Joss Alton, who owns a music company called Isotope Music, came to ask Ana to join his company. At first, Ana was unsure because she did not know the company well and did not want anyone to tell her what to sing. But Joss said that would not happen. Soon after, Ana performed at a concert in Dublin organized by Isotope. All the tickets sold out quickly, and it was a great night.

Ana likes to write songs about real life, especially when things are not good. One of her favorite songs is called ""Decision."" It is about why her brother stopped singing for a while and how sad it made him. Ana hopes her fans will like her songs, but she wants to write about her own important experiences."
65,"Last year, I went on a great trip. I traveled by boat on a group tour along the west coast of Canada. My brother Harry had the idea. He is a journalist, like me, and he wanted to write about the trip. He loves boats, but I do not. I always wanted to visit this place because my great-grandparents lived there before they moved to Europe. I asked Harry many times if I could go with him, and he finally said yes!

A few days before we left, there were storms where we were going. But the weather was good for the days we would be there. I was busy at work and did not have time to plan. But Harry said he would take care of everything, so I felt better.

When we arrived in Canada, we met the group, packed our things into small boats, and started our trip. The guide said very few people live along that coast. In the morning, we only saw dolphins and birds. There were islands far away, but the fog made it hard to see. I looked at the pretty patterns our boat made in the water.

We often stopped to explore the beaches. We found many colorful fish in the rock pools. I did not know many of them. It was nice to forget about time. We always remembered to eat lunch and dinner, which we cooked together over campfires. At night, we slept on the boats. The beds were hard, but it felt good to relax.

When it was time to go home, I felt sad. I did not want to return to normal life. But I knew I would miss my family and friends. I was also excited to tell everyone about our adventures!"
66,"My dad was a basketball player in Germany. His dad was also a basketball player. When I was a kid, I went to see many of my dad's games. You might think I would love basketball, but I did not. I liked to tell my friends how good my dad was, especially when he won. But I often took a book to read instead of watching the games.

When I started secondary school, I was very tall. My sports teacher asked me if I wanted to train with the basketball team. I liked the training, but I thought I needed to get better before playing in a real game. The teacher believed in me more than I did. After some time, I agreed to play. A few weeks later, I played against another school. My mom and dad came to watch, and I felt nervous. But it was OK in the end!

For the next four years, I practiced every day and did well. I even joined an adult team before I moved to a sports academy in the USA when I was fifteen. The coach there trains Olympic players, and it was great to learn from him. But I did not like living far from my parents. At home, I could not spend much time with my friends because of training, so that was not a big change for me. I got used to my new life, and my English got better too!

I became a professional player when I was eighteen, three years after I arrived in the USA. I was taller than most players since I was fifteen, but I needed to get stronger. My coach knew a team that would take me while I was still in college, so I joined them and I have never regretted it."
67,"Seven years ago, I studied Tourism in college. My course was expensive, so I needed a part-time job. I decided to become a weekend tour guide in Chicago, my home city. I took visitors around the city and I was happy to see how much I liked it. Every time felt new and exciting!

After I finished my studies, I wanted to be a tour guide full-time. I thought it would be easy, but I learned that I needed to know a lot more. To be a full-time tour guide in Chicago, I had to answer many questions about the city, like its buildings, history, and public transport rules.

After a few months of hard work, I got my tour guide qualification. Being a tour guide is not just about facts. You need to be fun and tell interesting stories. You also need to handle problems, like if a place is closed or if the route changes. Tourists want to enjoy their tour, not hear about problems.

I want my visitors to be happy. If they are not, they might write a bad review online. Good reviews are very important because they help me get more customers. I try to make my tours fun and easy. Because I love my job, I usually get good reviews, and many people recommend my tours to others visiting Chicago."
68,"My name is Ella and I am 22 years old. Last year, I went to Thailand for two weeks with my sister Josie. Josie is five years younger than me, but we get along well. We went to help at a place for sick elephants. This place is called an elephant sanctuary. 

At first, I was worried because the other volunteers were older than us. It was also our first time doing this kind of work. But in the end, we had fun. One of our jobs was to collect food for the elephants. Elephants eat a lot of grass and banana plants, so this took a long time. Josie found it hard work, but I liked seeing the elephants eat. 

We also washed the elephants in the river with big brushes and soap. I had a lot of fun, even though I got wet! My favorite time was in the evening. We walked the elephants into the forest where they slept at night. 

All the volunteers stayed in the same house. Josie and I shared a small bedroom because she did not want to be alone. It was hot at night, but we knew it would be. The food was very good and did not have meat, which we do not like. 

After dinner, we all talked and played games. Now that we are back in the UK, Josie does not talk about Thailand much. But if someone asks her if she liked it, she says yes. I think she might feel a little sad because she missed her friends. But when she thinks about it, she knows she was lucky to go there. Maybe she will go back one day. I want to go back!"
69,"My name is Gina D’Costa. I have a flower shop in the UK. I sell flowers to many people. Some people buy flowers for friends or their homes. Hotels and offices also buy flowers. Sometimes, I help businesses by providing flowers for their pictures. Once, I decorated a castle with flowers for a wedding. It was a lot of work, but I was very proud.

My day starts at 4 a.m. I go to the market to buy fresh flowers. Most people are still sleeping, and my friends think I am crazy, but I love my job. It is often cold and dark, but I do not mind. The flower market is amazing, with flowers from many places. It is hard to choose flowers. My favorite color is pink, so I would choose pink flowers for myself. But I have to remember that other people want different flowers.

Not all flowers are available all year. I do not like to argue about prices with the flower sellers, but I have to do it. Flowers can be expensive, so I try to get the best price. 

At my shop, we look at customer orders and prepare vases with the flowers. Then, we make bunches of flowers and check the prices. Customers are often surprised by the prices, and I sometimes ask them to think again about what they want. Some people think this is too much work, but I enjoy making beautiful flower arrangements for the money someone wants to spend. I love my job!"
70,"My city has a modern cinema. It shows new films and kids' films on weekends. The cinema is close to my home. A year ago, I wanted to talk about films with friends after watching them. So, I started a film club with two friends!

We do not want to rent a cinema. Instead, we pick a new place in the city each month. For example, we used an old factory to show a film about Antarctica. It was very cold, and it made the film even better! Some places are free because the owners sell snacks. This helps us keep our prices low. We just want to cover our costs, not make money.

Each time we show a film, it gets easier. Now we have our own equipment. We can see how many tickets we sell online, so we do not worry about empty seats. There is still a lot to do, but it is great when people say they had fun.

Our website helps us a lot. We talk to other film clubs in the country. We visit them to see how they do things, but we love coming back to our club! We also started a blog because many people look for film information online. We put up some posters in cafés, but the best way to get people is when friends tell each other about us. 

The audience enjoys the fun activities we have with each film. Last month, we had a movie quiz, and everyone liked it!"
71,"Taking photos was my favorite thing to do when I was a child. When I was 15 years old, I wanted to make my hobby better. I decided to take one photo every day for a whole year. Many other young photographers did this too, but I thought it was a great idea.

After a few weeks, I put my photos on a website for young photographers. I wanted to make a photo diary and show my photos to others. I was happy to see that people liked my photos. I enjoyed taking pictures of many different things. Then, someone told me that if my photos had a common theme, my project would be better. I agreed and started to take more photos of nature, especially birds and the sky. 

Most of my photos were black and white. This was different from what other young photographers were doing because they took color photos. Sometimes, I doubted my project and almost gave up. But in the end, I believed in myself and became more confident in my style.

One day, I showed my project to my art teacher. She told me about a photography competition for young people. I entered some of my photos just for fun. I was so happy when I found out I won first prize! This moment was special for me. It was the first time I thought my photography was good, and I could be a professional photographer. Now, I have my own photography studio, and I am happy with my choice."
72,"I joined the National Youth Challenge (NYC) last year. I wanted to try new things like camping and sailing. In NYC, you can do many activities and learn new skills. There are different levels, from beginner to advanced. Adult volunteers, called ‘leaders’, help us. When you finish a level, you get a certificate.

At first, my leader said I should help at a local children’s club for two hours a week. I was not sure about this. I had gone to that club when I was eight, but I found it hard to make friends. I was shy, and the other kids already had friends. I stopped going after a few weeks. 

But I decided to try the challenge because I wanted my first NYC certificate. Soon, I loved going to the children’s club. It was more than just getting a certificate. When I finished the challenge, my NYC leader let me keep helping at the club because I made good friends with the children. Now, I go there for about four hours a week, and I always look forward to it.

Because of what I learned at the club, I want to go to college after school. I want to be a youth worker, someone who helps children. I never thought about this before. This has been my favorite part of NYC, and I have improved my communication skills while helping others. I have several NYC certificates now, and one is for camping!"
73,"I was born in Denver, USA. I started snowboarding when I was eight years old. My dad took me to the mountains, two hours from Denver. The hill was very steep, and my dad had to convince me to try snowboarding. I did not think to ask him if I could start, but he loved snowboarding and wanted me to love it too. He made it look easy, and I did well in the end.

After that, I loved snowboarding and got better. I started to compete when I was ten years old. Some people compete a lot and get bored, but I still love it. I like to win, and this helps me try harder. I enjoy not having a strict plan. One time, I was the first girl to get a perfect score at a local competition. I was surprised I could do it, but it made me believe in myself more.

In the summer, I train and study because there is no snow. I train every day, but I do not have to follow a strict diet like in winter. I also spend time with my friends. This helps me feel better when I cannot snowboard.

I think about my future. Snowboarding is very important to me, but I want to have another job too, just in case I cannot be a professional snowboarder or if I get hurt. I am thinking about becoming a doctor if I have time to go to college. I cannot imagine getting tired of snowboarding, but I know I cannot do it forever."
74,"When I was fifteen, I wanted what my friends had. I did not think about the future. I did not know what I wanted to do after school. One day, my best friend got a new phone for her birthday. I wanted a new phone too. My parents said I could have one if I paid for it myself. So, I decided to work part-time and save money. I am thankful to my parents for this. It taught me an important lesson.

I worked every Saturday in a café, but I did not like it much. My parents suggested I start my own small business. I saw my mum making necklaces, so I asked if I could try. I thought it would be hard, but it was easy! My friends thought it was boring, but I liked it. My mum showed me how to make pretty things at home with simple tools.

I sold my first necklaces to my friends and family. They said they liked them, but I was not sure. I wanted to know if other people would like them too. So, I rented a market stall with my mum. Many tourists came to my town, and they bought my necklaces for their families and friends. Soon, people from all over the country called to buy more. They thought we were a big company, but it was just me and my mum at the stall!

That made me believe my business could work. I decided to make a website. Since then, I have made a lot of money from my business, mostly online, but we still have our stall. It has been a lot of fun!"
75,"When Janine Stuart was 13 years old, she wrote a book called Being Amelia. This book became very popular. Being Amelia is partly about Janine’s life. In an interview, Janine said, “My father’s job made my family move a lot. I learned to make new friends. I know what it is like to be the new student in a class. This helped me write about Amelia, the main character, in her new school.” Some funny parts of the book are about Amelia’s home life and her older brother. Janine is an only child, so she used her imagination to write about having a brother.

Janine started her book one summer when she was bored at home. Her mother wanted to be a writer, and her teachers told her to write, too. So, writing was a good way to spend her time. The year before, she won a prize in a short story contest for young writers. This is why, when Janine finished Being Amelia and sent it to a publishing company, they wanted to read it right away. They loved it, and a year later, Janine’s book was in stores.

One review of Being Amelia says that even though the cover has happy teenagers, the characters face some hard problems. This makes readers believe in them. The reviewer thinks that even though Janine is young and her book is not very long, she is a better writer than many famous authors.

Janine is still getting used to being a famous writer. She said, “At first, I hid when people saw me in the street, but now it is OK. I want to help other young writers, but they need to find their own way. For me, I just need to spend time with my friends, and then I will have something interesting to write about!”"
76,"My name is Tom. I am fifteen years old. Three years ago, my family and I moved to a castle on a small island. My dad got a job to take care of the castle. He works for a group that looks after old buildings. He was happy to get this job, but we were not sure at first. We thought life on the island would be different. The castle is not as nice as our old home, and there is no school here.

After we moved, we got used to living on the island. The castle is not very pretty, but our apartment is nice. In summer, many visitors come to the island, and there are parties on the beach. In winter, we only see the other families who live here. There are not many teenagers, which is sad for me. The adults help each other with work on the island.

The biggest change for me is taking a boat to my old school every day. I like going on stormy days when there are big waves, but the boats do not run then. If I miss the bus to the boat, I miss the last boat home, and that makes me worried. When my friends come to visit, I always tell them to hurry!

The views are beautiful, especially when the sun sets over the sea. Some days it is very foggy, and you cannot see anything. But then, it can be sunny again in a few hours. It is amazing! We do have strong storms, and I sometimes worry if the castle will be okay. But I remember it has been here for many years, and it is still standing!"
77,"I live in a house in the countryside in Scotland. I love nature and animals. Six years ago, I started a new hobby – birdwatching! I went to the mountains in northern Scotland with my family. We saw many birds there. I watched them with my parents. They taught me how to know different types of birds and where to find them. It was amazing! 

After that, I joined a birdwatchers’ club for young people. My goal is to see 200 different types of birds. I am close to this goal because I have seen birds in other countries too. We look for places with birdwatching activities on our family holidays. I have been to Egypt and South America. I thought I would see my 200th bird there, but I didn’t. I learned that you need to be patient with birdwatching.

I made a video about my birdwatching challenge. Many teenagers liked it and said it looked fun. My teachers asked me to talk about birdwatching at school. I was nervous before I went on stage, but I remembered what to say. After I finished, my teachers said I did well. I might do it again next year!

I am lucky to live in the countryside. I know many teenagers in cities may not think about birdwatching, but there are many birds to see in green areas. I think birdwatching clubs should help more young people to enjoy this hobby. Everyone should connect with nature, no matter how old they are, and it doesn’t have to cost a lot of money."
78,"I started playing football when I was 7 years old. I would hurry home from school to play with other kids. I loved it, and I got better at it. My family thought I would stop playing like I did with other hobbies, but I didn’t. I wanted to play football professionally when I grew up. 

One day, I played in a local tournament. A referee saw me and told the manager of a women’s football club to watch me. The manager asked me to join her club. I was surprised because I didn’t know young girls could play in women’s clubs. But the manager liked me, and I started training with the big club when I was 13 years old. I got much better at football.

Some people were not sure I would be a star player, and this made me a little sad. But my coach told me to believe in myself. He let me play in an important match earlier than I thought I would. I ran very hard because I didn’t want to let my team down. Then, by chance, I scored the winning goal! I could hear my coach cheering for me, and after the game, my team carried me around the field. It was amazing! 

Since then, I have scored many more winning goals. Next month, my coach and I are having a football tournament for teenagers in my area. We want to get them interested in football and help them meet other players. They will see what it is like to play professionally and feel they can play for a good team if they work hard. I will tell them what my coach told me – there will be good times and bad times. I have been lucky and had very few bad times!"

In the UK and other countries, schools and universities want students to start doing research early in their studies. Research is not just for famous scholars or scientists. It is a way to learn and build skills. Research skills are helpful for studying and for jobs because they help us think about the world and our work.

As a student, you can help create knowledge. You do not just repeat what you learn; you ask questions. You might ask: Why? How? When? What does this mean? What if things were different? These questions are important for research.

Research can be simple or very complex. Simple research can be asking questions about everyday things. You have already done some research in your life. For example, you have asked questions for school projects or when you wanted to know how to do something, like fixing things at home or planning a holiday.

In college and university, you are expected to ask questions, think critically, and explore ideas. Some students may find this hard because in some cultures, knowledge is seen as fixed. They may think they should only listen to teachers and books. But in many places, including the UK and US, it is okay to question what you learn and who teaches it.

Thinking critically is very important in research. You should not just repeat what you read. You need to think about it, test it, and see if it makes sense. It is important to not just accept everything you are told without thinking."
80,"Cities are important places for ideas and creativity. In the past, people met in coffee houses in London to talk about science and politics. Today, in Paris, artists like Pablo Picasso discuss modern art in cafés. But living in a city can be hard. The same cafés that bring people together can also spread diseases. 

Scientists are studying how city life affects our brains. They found that living in a city can make us tired and less able to think clearly. One reason for this is that cities have less nature. For example, patients in hospitals get better faster when they can see trees from their windows. Even a little bit of nature helps our brains relax.

More people now live in cities than in the countryside. This means we are often surrounded by many strangers in busy places. This can be stressful for our minds. When we walk in a city, we have to pay attention to many things, like other people and traffic. This takes a lot of energy. 

Nature is different. It is easier for our brains to relax in natural places. This idea is called attention restoration theory. It means that being in nature helps our minds feel better. 

Many parks in cities, like Central Park in New York, help people escape from busy city life. Spending time in a park can make our brains work better quickly. 

Even though city life can be hard, cities are still places where new ideas are born. Research shows that crowded places can help people be more creative. So, while cities can be overwhelming, they also help people think of new things. The challenge is to find ways to enjoy the benefits of city life while also taking care of our minds."
81,"Where should we look for the mind? This is an interesting question. We usually think that thinking happens in our heads. Today, we have special machines that can see what happens in our brains. But I believe we should also think about what is outside our heads. Many things, not just our brains, help us think.

For example, in archaeology, we see that tools, decorations, and writing help people think and grow. This means that what is outside our heads can also be part of our minds. Many scientists study the brain by keeping people away from the things around them. This is good for studying the brain, but it makes us forget that we think with the world around us.

I do not want to say that the brain is not important. I want to show that the mind is more than just the brain. We should look at how our intelligence connects with culture and the things we use. I have a new idea called Material Engagement Theory (MET). This idea looks at how objects help us think. For example, when we make numbers from clay or use a stone to make a tool, these objects help our minds.

Think about a blind person using a stick. The stick helps the person feel and understand the world. The brain sees the stick as part of the body. This shows that our minds can change and grow when we use new tools. 

My idea is that the human mind is always changing. The things we use, like tools or phones, help us learn and understand our world. This is why humans create things more than any other animals. I call this metaplasticity. Our minds can change as we interact with the world. 

MET helps us understand how tools, from old stone tools to new smartphones, shape who we are and how we think. Technology that changes our minds is not new; humans have used it since we began."
82,"Text: 

Photography is an important invention. It has changed how we see the world. In the United States, photography became a big part of culture. It is used in many ways, like science, industry, and art. Many people think photography is one of the best contributions to art in the US.

Photography started in the mid-19th century. It was popular because it used machines, and people liked new technology. Just like trains and electricity made travel easier, photography brought images of the world into homes. 

The camera helps people show who they are. It allows families to keep memories, even if they are not always real. Photographs show everyday life and are a way to share what we see. A photograph is a record of what was in front of the camera. 

However, every photograph also shows the photographer's point of view. We might think we understand a photo because we know what it shows, but the meaning can be more complicated. A photograph does not speak for itself. It needs information, like a caption or where it is shown, to help us understand it.

To understand a photograph, we should think about why the photographer took it and how people first saw it. The same photo can mean different things in different places and times. 

Today, many artists use photographs in their work. For example, Andy Warhol used photographs in his art. Now, photography is seen as an important part of art, not just separate from painting."
83,"In 1890, William James was an American thinker and doctor. He helped start modern psychology. He said psychology is the ""science of mental life."" This means it studies how we think and feel. We all have thoughts and feelings, and we can understand them in ourselves and in others, like animals too.

William James thought human psychology has some basic parts: our thoughts, our feelings, and the world around us. Our understanding of these things is personal. It comes from our own experiences and may not always match scientific facts. Because of this, we often think we know why people act in certain ways. For example, we might think someone is sad or angry, or why they quit their job.

But sometimes, two people can see things very differently. Psychology tries to find the best answers to explain why people act the way they do. Psychologists help us tell the difference between our own opinions and what is true based on science. They study the mind and the brain, but they do not know everything about how the brain works. They learn more by watching how people behave.

Studying psychology is like solving a puzzle. Psychologists look for clues in people's behavior. They must observe carefully and measure things accurately. They also need to think logically about what they see. Psychology is complex, and understanding it requires special skills and ideas.

Psychology aims to describe, understand, predict, and change how people think and act. When psychologists reach these goals, they can help us understand our experiences better. Their work has helped in many areas, like teaching children to read, making machines safer, and helping people talk about their feelings when they are sad.

People have talked about psychological questions for a long time, but only in the last 150 years have they studied them scientifically. Early psychologists looked at their own thoughts to find answers, but this method has limits. Today, psychologists prefer to watch how others behave instead of just thinking about their own experiences."
84,"In a building in Michigan, USA, there is a special place called the Museum of Failed Products. This museum has many products that people did not want to buy. Some examples are A Touch of Yogurt shampoo and Breakfast Cola. The museum is owned by a woman named Carol Sherry. She believes that each product has a sad story about the people who made and sold it.

The museum is interesting because it shows that many products do not succeed. Many business leaders come to the museum, but they often do not keep samples of their own failed products. The museum started by a man named Robert McMath. He wanted to collect new products, not just the ones that failed. He began this in the 1960s. He learned that most products do not do well.

The museum shows how people often think positively about new products. They believe that every new product will be successful. Sometimes, even when a product is not good, people still spend money on it to try to make it sell. They do not want to talk about why it failed.

There is a popular idea called ""positive visualization."" This means if you think good things will happen, they will. But research shows that thinking too much about good outcomes can make people less motivated to work hard. For example, people who think they will have a great week at work often do not do as well.

Psychologist Carol Dweck talks about how people see failure. Some people think ability is something you are born with. They feel bad when they fail. Other people believe that ability can grow with hard work. They see failure as a way to learn and improve. Dweck compares this to weight training: muscles get stronger when they are pushed to their limits. Having a positive view of failure can make people happier, whether or not they succeed."

Everyone knows that sports teams like to play at home. But why is this? Many people think they know the answer. However, sports are changing a lot, and we need to think again about why home games are important. 

Two main things are making us question this: science and money. Scientists want to understand how players can do their best. They have many ideas about home games. People who pay the players also want to know why home games matter. If players are paid well, shouldn’t they play well anywhere?

What about the fans? Would it matter if a team like Manchester United played some games far away, in places like Asia? Yes, it would matter to fans in Britain. They believe their team needs their support and energy. Fans often think that when they cheer, their team scores. But they forget the times when their cheering did not help.

One thing that fans believe is true is that home fans also cheer for the referee. In a study, referees watched a game with crowd noise and another game without noise. The referees who heard the crowd were less likely to call fouls against the home team. This means referees try to avoid making the home fans angry.

Studies show that home advantage is getting smaller in many sports, but not by much. For example, in the 1890s, home teams in football won about 70% of the time. Now, they win about 60% of the time. One reason for this change is travel. Now, players travel in comfort, and hotels are much better.

Even with these changes, we still do not fully understand why home advantage is different in each sport. Basketball has the biggest home advantage, while baseball has the least. This might be because basketball is more about teamwork, while baseball is more about individual players.

Another interesting point is that players have more energy before home games. Studies show that their testosterone levels are higher before these games. This might be because they want to protect their home ground. 

In some recent games, teams that were not expected to win did very well at home. They showed great strength and did not give up. As one referee said, “It’s the law of the jungle out there.”"

Gary Player is a famous golfer. He said, ""The more I practice, the luckier I get."" This means that when he practices a lot, he gets better. Some people think this quote is very important for athletes and their coaches.

There is a big question about talent. Some people think you are born with talent, and others think you can learn it. Many believe that practice is more important than talent. A psychologist named Anders Ericsson said that to be an expert in something, you need to practice for 10,000 hours. Many books, like Malcolm Gladwell's ""Outliers,"" say that practice is the key to success.

But a writer named Epstein thinks differently. He says that we should not only look at successful people to understand why they are good. He travels to many places, like Kenya and Alaska, to find answers. In Alaska, he learns that the best sled dogs have a strong desire to win, which may come from their genes.

Epstein talks about two things: hardware (nature) and software (nurture). He believes both are important for top athletes. For example, if Usain Bolt grew up in the US, he might have played basketball instead of being the fastest man in the world.

Epstein also asks important questions about race and gender in sports. He wonders why we have separate competitions for men and women if practice is all that matters. Sometimes, the best questions are the simplest ones."
87,"Many children in rich countries feel lonely and unhappy. Jay Griffiths asks why this is happening. In her book, Kith, she says that children spend too much time inside, looking at screens like TVs and computers. They do not go outside to play in nature, like in the woods or by rivers. This is a big problem.

A study talked to children and found that many would be happier if they could go outside more. Older people often remember their childhoods fondly. They think they had more freedom to play outside, swim, and explore. They believe this was better than how children live today. However, they forget that they made rules to keep their children safe, which stops them from playing freely.

Griffiths writes about how parents worry about dangers outside. This worry makes them buy toys and gadgets to keep their children busy at home. She also talks about how some children are given medicine for being restless or have to wear goggles to play games. Some of these rules may not be very common, but Griffiths feels strongly about them.

She believes children should be free to explore and take risks. She says that children need to have small accidents to learn how to be safe. However, she does not explain how to let children have these small accidents. Not all children want to play outside or be wild. Some are shy or like to stay at home. It might not be fair to make all children play in the same way."
88,"I am a bio-psychologist. I have studied a lot. I am good at solving problems in my work and life. But school does not teach us how to solve all problems. Many problems need life experiences, not just school answers. 

Children learn a lot through play. All young animals, including humans, play. Animals that need to learn more play the most. For example, meat-eating animals play more than plant-eating animals because hunting is harder to learn. Monkeys play more than other animals because they need to learn more. 

Children play a lot because they have much to learn. Play helps children learn important skills. These skills are not taught in school. Children learn to think creatively, get along with others, and control their feelings through play. Creativity is very important for success in life. 

We need people who can think of new ideas and solve new problems. If we teach children to think creatively, they will be ready for the future. Some adults, called geniuses, keep their playful minds. For example, Albert Einstein said school almost made him lose his love for math and science. He found it again after school. He called his work “combinatorial play.” 

We cannot teach creativity, but school can make it harder for children to be creative. School often focuses on one right answer instead of children’s own questions. It is also important for children to get along with others and care about them. Children want to play with other children. Through play, they learn to be fair and kind, which they need in life.

Play is fun and voluntary. Players can stop playing whenever they want. To keep playing, everyone must be happy. Play is a very free activity. 

Today, school is harder. There are fewer breaks, more homework, and more pressure for good grades. Outside of school, adults often control sports and playtime. Children do not play freely as much anymore. This change has happened slowly but is very big. It is caused by many things, like parents’ fears and the idea that children learn better from adults than from each other.

Our children do not need more school. They need more play. If we care about children, we must let them play and explore. This will help them grow into strong adults ready for the future."
89,"In many countries, more young people in their twenties are using social media to find jobs. Websites like Twitter and LinkedIn help them connect with employers. This is easier than before when people had to stand outside offices with signs that said ""hire me."" But using social media can also lead to mistakes.

For example, a young man in the US tried to contact a marketing executive on LinkedIn. He thought she could help him find a job because she knew many important people. However, she was upset and did not want to share her contacts with someone she did not know. She rejected his request and wrote a mean message that many people saw online. This made others think about how to use social media for jobs.

Social media can be risky for job seekers who do not know how to use it well. Many young people have used sites like Facebook and Twitter for fun, but using them for work is different. When I was a teenager, social media was a way to escape from parents and teachers. It was a place to show off and be someone else. You could talk to someone online and then ignore them at school. 

Now, using social media for work is not the same. Just because many people liked your posts on Facebook does not mean you will get a job on LinkedIn. Young people need to understand that they must act professionally to impress employers. 

One common problem is that young job seekers often sound too casual or arrogant when they write to employers. This makes older people think badly of them. Many young people are actually worried about finding jobs, which is why they use social media.

So, how should you contact someone on a professional site? First, tell them who you are and how you can help them. This way, they are more likely to reply. Avoid sending the same message to many people, and be polite. Remember, social media can help you make good connections, but you need to use it carefully."

It is hard to know what will happen to newspapers in the future. Many people think newspapers will not last much longer. Since 2000, many newspapers in the UK have lost a lot of readers. In the USA, only 26 out of 100 people get their news from newspapers now. This is less than in 2001 when 45 out of 100 people did. Some people say that printed newspapers will be gone in 15 years. 

But history shows that old ways of getting news often stay around. For example, a journalist in New York said in 1835 that books and theaters would not be popular anymore, but they are still here today. Radio is still popular even with TV. Movies are still watched even with videos and DVDs. Even old music records are coming back.

Newspapers were once new too. It took a long time for them to become the main way to get news. This happened because it became easier to share news with many people. In the past, people did not think they needed news often. They only saw changes in the seasons or big events like floods or diseases. 

Now, we expect to get news all the time. Today, we can read news online whenever we want. We can choose what news we want to see. When something important happens, we can get updates very quickly. Online news can be changed easily if there is a mistake. 

But newspapers have rules about how they are made, and this can be hard. Online news is different because we can read it when we want. However, many news providers focus on being the first to share news instead of helping people understand it. 

In the past, news was shared in busy places like markets or pubs, where it was hard to know what was true. Now, we might be going back to that time. Newspapers have not always done a good job of explaining how the world works. They might disappear, or they might find a way to help us understand better."

Humans are used to living in the light of the sun. We are not like many animals that are active at night. These animals feel comfortable in the dark. But we have changed the night by adding a lot of light. This is called light pollution. 

Light pollution happens because of bad lighting. Instead of shining light down where we need it, light goes up into the sky. This makes the night bright and changes how animals live. For example, birds that fly at night can get lost in bright lights. They may fly around in circles until they fall down. 

A long time ago, in the year 1800, people in London used candles and lanterns. There were not many lights in the streets. The night was dark, and people could see the stars. Now, we have many lights, and we cannot see the stars as well. 

Light is very strong and can attract animals. Some birds sing at strange times because of the light. We need darkness to be healthy. If we do not have darkness, our bodies do not work well. 

In the end, light pollution affects us all. We have lost our connection to nature and the night sky. We forget how small we are in the universe when we live in so much light."
92,"A big company recently said it will not keep track of how much holiday time its workers take. The idea came from a smaller internet company that did the same thing. The founder of the big company got the idea from a happy email from his daughter. 

He said workers can take as much time off as they want, but they must be sure that their work is done and that their absence will not hurt the company or their jobs. This idea might work better in a small company where people know each other’s work well. In a big company with many workers, it can be hard to know if taking time off will be okay.

When people take a holiday, they usually have a lot of work waiting for them when they come back. This can make them feel guilty about taking time off. If workers feel guilty, they may not take enough holidays, which can make them stressed and less productive. 

In some companies, there is pressure to work late, and this can make workers feel they should not take holidays. If workers do not feel safe to take their holidays, they may not take the time they need to rest. 

Also, with technology, workers can get work messages anytime, which makes it hard to separate work time from free time. The smaller internet company started its new holiday policy because workers wanted to know how to balance work and time off. 

However, if there are no set working hours, workers may feel they always have to work. This can be bad for their health. Workers have the right to take holidays because rest is important for their well-being. 

I am not sure if this new holiday policy will really help workers take the time off they need."

Peer review is when experts check a scientific paper before it is published. This process is important because it helps to make sure that the research is good and correct. Sometimes, this review can take a long time, even up to a year. Some people think this is good because it helps keep the quality of research high. Others think it is too slow.

There are new ways to share research, like preprints. Preprints are drafts of papers that are shared online before they are reviewed. This helps scientists share their results quickly. Many scientists want their work to be published in well-known journals, but this can make them focus more on getting published than on the quality of their work.

Some scientists worry that if papers are published without review, there could be bad research, called ""junk science."" However, preprints allow other scientists to read and discuss the work right away. For example, a psychology professor shared her paper as a preprint. This way, the original authors could respond to her work, and everyone could see the discussion.

Preprint archives help scientists talk about their work with others around the world. They also allow scientists to share results that are not positive, which is important too. Sharing papers as preprints can help more people read and use the research. Overall, preprints can help scientists focus on the research itself, not just where it is published."
94,"When I ask my students what a poem is, they often say it is ""a painting in words."" But this answer does not make me happy. One day, I asked my students to pick an object and write about it. They had to write one paragraph like a scientist and another paragraph from the object's point of view. One student wrote about an oxygen mask. The mask helps people breathe in emergencies. This exercise made us laugh and talk about poetry.

When I was in school, I found poetry confusing. I thought poems were hard puzzles. After school, many people read fewer poems. Sometimes, a poem stands out because it is not like regular writing. It makes you want to read it, but you might feel let down because it is not what you expected. 

What do we want from poems? We want deep feelings, beautiful images, and clever thoughts. But for tears, we watch movies. For information, we read articles. Novels take us to new worlds, and music is special too. 

Poems can be unclear, which is like real life. But this does not tell us what a poem is. If you look up ""poem,"" it says it is a type of art that uses the beauty of language. The word ""poem"" comes from Greek and means ""a thing made."" So, what kind of thing is a poem? 

Some people say poems are like wild animals or machines. But these ideas can change how we think. Thinking about poems can help us see things differently. 

Songs can get stuck in our heads, just like poems. A poem on a page can have a strong impact, even if it looks like regular writing. The space around a poem could be used for something else, but it is there for a reason. 

A poem is written and rewritten, like a story or article, but it is not just for selling. Poems are special and can surprise us."
95,"I bought my first metal detector after I got married. It cost £70, which was a lot of money. My wife, Marion, was very happy when I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first trip. Over the years, I found many things like brooches and coins. I liked feeling connected to the past. 

After the gold ring, it took 40 years to find something that impressed Marion again. One rainy February afternoon, I had some time to search. I went to a place where I knew there were old farming tools. My detector beeped, and I found a piece of a metal wheel. Then it beeped again. I dug in the mud and found a round, golden ball. I was excited but tried not to get my hopes up. 

As I cleaned it, I saw it was a beautiful necklace called a torc. I remembered seeing a similar one in the British Museum. The torc is very old, from over 2,000 years ago. I took it to my car and looked at it all the way home. I washed it in my kitchen sink. 

I called Marion and said, “I have something for you.” When she came in, she asked, “What is it?” I told her it was a very old and rare piece of jewelry. We didn’t try it on because we didn’t want to break it. At night, I hid it in our wardrobe. I was worried about it being stolen, so I moved it under a floorboard in my office.

The law says I must tell the authorities about my find within 14 days. I wanted to enjoy the torc before I gave it up. I even took it to show a friend in the hospital. Finally, I took it to the council office. The person there was surprised when I put the torc on his desk. They confirmed it was real, and later it was sold to my local council. Now, it is in the British Museum in London. 

I got £350,000 from the sale, which I shared with the owner of the field. But the torc is more than just money. It is something I have saved for everyone. People ask me if I will stop using my metal detector now. But I still find brooches and coins interesting. Just like a fisherman who catches a big fish, I will keep searching for more treasures."
96,"Sleeping is one of my favorite things to do when I travel, but I don’t talk about it much. My friends like to share their busy travel plans with many activities, like visiting museums and hiking. I just smile and don’t say much. They might think it is strange that I like to take naps in the afternoon or sleep in nice beds in Italy.

When I traveled to Mexico when I was young, I was surprised that I slept more than 12 hours some days. There were loud birds outside, but I didn’t care. I felt relaxed and could sleep deeply. Without alarms and worries, it was easy to sleep. 

I think sleeping while traveling is special. When we travel, we see and hear new things. We take in new cultures and experiences. When we sleep, we process all these new things. That is why sleep feels different when we travel.

People often worry about jet lag, but I think it is more about getting used to new places. For example, in Trinidad, people wake up very early to avoid the heat. They take a break when it is hot and then enjoy the cool evening. Even though Trinidad is only one hour ahead of New York, it took me days to get used to their sleep schedule. When I finally did, I felt like I belonged there.

I remember one afternoon in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic. I had a big lunch with new friends in an apartment by the sea. After eating, we all felt sleepy and started to rest on hammocks and sofas. I understood why they had so many pillows. I joined them and took a nap. I learned about the siesta, a common practice in Latin America.

Travel sleep is also memorable. In new places, I enjoy the different smells and sounds while I sleep. If we want to enjoy our travels slowly, then sleeping is part of that. Maybe I should tell my friends that sleeping while traveling is important too."
97,"Mia was in her shop. A woman looked at herself in the mirror and asked, “What do you think? Be honest.” Mia picked up a nice hat with a bow. “I think this one looks best on you,” she said. The woman made a funny face and said, “But it is boring. Everyone will wear a hat like that at my daughter’s wedding. This hat will make me special.” She pointed to a small red and black hat on her head. “Yes, this is the one I want,” she said.

Mia smiled. She knew the woman would stand out at the wedding. Mia thought about her own daughter, Jen. It was Jen’s thirtieth birthday today. They were having a family party. Mia was happy to see Jen, Dan, and Luke. She was also excited to meet Jen’s friend, Tattie. Mia’s husband, Jeff, was not sure about Tattie. He asked, “What kind of name is that?” Mia said, “It’s short for Tatiana. I think it’s nice.” Jeff thought it was a strange name.

Jeff often said Mia was too polite. He would tell the woman in the shop that she was choosing the wrong hat. He would say a dustbin lid would look better on her. 

After an hour, Mia closed her shop and went home. It took her only forty seconds to get there. Four years ago, when Luke left home, Mia wanted to turn a barn into her hat shop. Jeff was not sure. He asked, “Do people really want hats?” But Mia knew many women wanted the perfect hat for special occasions. 

Mia was right. Her shop, Mia’s Hats, was a success. Women came from far away to try on hats. Mia made them feel welcome and encouraged them to bring their outfits. She also started selling handbags and jewelry."
98,"Lawrence Okoye is from London, but now he lives in Atlanta, USA. He is on a big journey in sports. He used to throw the discus in the Olympics, but now he wants to play American football. He has never played this sport before, but he might be chosen for a big team in the USA.

Lawrence came to Atlanta to train for the discus. He wanted to get ready for the world championships. He thought about American football when he was in school, but it seemed like a crazy idea. When he arrived in America, he saw that there were trials for the NFL (National Football League) in Atlanta. He decided to try out, even though he had never played before. 

When asked if he was nervous about trying out, he said no. He believes in himself. He did very well in the tests and drills, and people noticed him. He felt happy to be chosen as a good player. 

Lawrence knows he does not have much experience in American football, but he is ready to work hard. He is not worried about whether he will be picked for a team. He says many people think he will be chosen, but he is not too concerned. 

He remembers his last Olympic game when he did not do well, but he is proud that he made it to the final. He loves the discus and can go back to it if American football does not work out. Lawrence is trying to follow his dreams and make good choices in his life."
99,"I woke up on a plane flying east. It was morning, and I looked out the window. Below me, I saw brown and green land. It was September, but it was still summer in Siberia. I could not see any people. The view was beautiful with mountains, rivers, and forests.

My neighbor woke up and smiled. “Good morning, Robert,” he said with a Russian accent. His name was Sergei. He was a salesman from Moscow. He was going to sell safety clothes to miners. His English was not very good, and my Russian was not good either. But I used a dictionary to tell him I was going to Magadan in Siberia. I had a one-way ticket because I wanted to ride my bicycle back to England.

“But, Robert,” he said, “there is no road from Magadan. You cannot ride a bicycle.” I told him I thought there was a road, but not many people used it. “Alone?” he asked. “No, I will ride with my friend Al,” I said. “Just one friend?” he asked. “Yes, just one,” I nodded. Sergei looked worried and pointed outside. “Holodna,” he said, which means cold. I tried to show him with my hands that I had warm clothes, but I did not tell him I was on a tight budget. Most of my clothes were cheap. I was not sure if they would keep me warm, especially my big trousers that I bought for £10.

This adventure started in a classroom in Scotland. The room was full of tired students. The teacher was talking, and I was thinking about something important. Should I ask my friend Al to go on a bike trip? I decided to ask. I wrote a note: “Hi Al, Do you want to cycle across the Karakorum Highway between Pakistan and China this summer? Rob.” I passed the note to Al. He read it and wrote back, “OK.”

Now, six years later, I was going to meet Al in Siberia. I had been a geography teacher. The job was hard but interesting. I had long holidays to go on adventures. I visited Al twice during these holidays. After our bike ride in Pakistan, Al wanted to cycle around the world. He was taking on big challenges. This trip was the biggest one yet. Sometimes he thought it was too hard, but I admired him. He was having an amazing adventure and facing new challenges every day. He was proving people wrong who said he could not do it. He was doing something that scared him, and it made him feel alive."
100,"In The Red Bull Air Race, twelve pilots race through tall pylons. The pylons are between 15 and 25 metres high. The pilots fly very fast, up to 370 km per hour. I was invited to try this flying. 

Before my flight, I had to sign two papers. One paper said I was healthy. The other paper said I would take everything out of my pockets. Small things can be dangerous when flying. I learned that I should look at the horizon. The pilot would tell me where to look. I also had to promise to relax when flying upside down and enjoy the view.

Half an hour before the flight, I had a safety talk. I was told not to touch anything. When we started to fly, I was nervous. I had to keep calm and focused. If I panicked, it would be bad. 

The pilot, Dario, and I were in a very fast plane called the Zivko Edge 540. The plane took off and turned sharply to the right. I felt the air push out of my lungs. I looked at the horizon and held tight to my seat. For a moment, I felt very heavy. Then we flew straight again and turned left, going down fast. 

We flew close to the ground, between two pylons. We were going very fast, but I was excited. I got to fly the plane for two minutes, but my hands were shaking. Dario then did a barrel roll, which is a big turn in the air. I was okay, but I thought it was too much. 

At the top of a loop, we were upside down. I heard a voice say, “Relax, look up.” I looked up and saw fields. The flight was over in 10 minutes. It was easier than what the pilots usually do. When we landed, Dario ate sandwiches, but I could not eat for hours. That night, I dreamed about flying in loops."
101,"Doug Allan makes films about wild animals in cold places. If you have seen polar bears in a nature show, he may have filmed them. He likes it very cold, around -18C. Doug studied marine biology and was a diver. Diving was his first love, and he learned how to survive in cold places.

His big chance came when a TV crew came to Antarctica, where he was working. He helped them find good places to film. After two days, he realized he loved being a wildlife cameraman. He could travel, have adventures, and dive underwater. Now, he is a famous cameraman and has worked on many wildlife TV shows.

When Doug started 35 years ago, the cameras were not very good. It was hard to film. You had to remember what you saw. Now, with digital cameras, it is much easier. You can take many pictures and see them right away. In the past, filming was expensive, so you took fewer shots.

Doug has a lot of experience in cold places. He knows how to work on sea ice. He sometimes gets cold toes, but he likes the poles because there are no leeches or mosquitoes. Wildlife filming has many successes, but also mistakes. Once, he went to the Orkneys to film birds but could not tell which birds they were.

Recently, he got to film in Kong Karls Land, a place in the Arctic Ocean. It is very cold there, usually -32C in April. The wind is strong, and carrying cameras in deep snow is hard. After walking for five hours a day for 23 days, he only saw one mother bear and her cub. But on the 24th day, he felt like he was part of the bear world. 

He waited by a hole in the snow. After a long time, he saw a bear's nose, then its head. The bear came out and rested in front of him. It was exciting! Then, two baby bears appeared. Doug thought it was a special moment to see them.

Now, Doug wants to make a film about climate change in the Arctic. He wants to talk to the people who live there and see how it affects their lives. He believes it would be a great documentary."
102,"In 2004, Pen Hadow was the first person to walk to the North Pole alone. He did not get help on the way. It was very cold, and he had to swim in icy water and be careful of polar bears. Eight months later, he also went to the South Pole. Now, he is going back to the Arctic for a new adventure. This time, he will walk 1,000 kilometers to the North Pole with two friends. They will check how thick the ice is. No one has done this before, and it is very important for science. They want to learn about global warming and how it affects the ice.

When Pen was a child, a woman who worked for a famous explorer helped him become strong. She sent him outside in bad weather with few clothes. His father loved adventures in the cold, and Pen became very strong. Pen is married to Mary, who loves horses. She helps him with his polar guide business. Mary says she worries more about him when he is at home because he thinks about the Arctic.

Pen and Mary have two children. He finds it hard to leave them this time. When he left before, he told his son to take care of his mother and sister. His son took this very seriously and worried a lot. Pen thinks it was not fair to put that on him. So, he plans to talk to them less while he is in the Arctic. He does not want to remind them how far away he is.

Before he leaves, Pen is getting ready and checking his equipment. He knows it is hard to fix things in the cold. He will go with Ann Daniels, a famous polar explorer, and Martin Hartley, a photographer. They will have a team of six people to help them.

Pen is also thinking about his age. He will be 47 soon and feels he has not trained enough. He is worried about what he will have to do. He believes this trip is important for science and for everyone to understand what is happening in the Arctic Ocean. He wants to help people learn about it."
103,"I took a year off. I thought about what to do. Being an Olympian is special. I could write, work on TV, and talk to businesses and schools. But I wanted to compete again. I wanted to stay fit to try for the Olympics if I felt that way again. So, I joined marathons and triathlons. 

Then, I remembered Ben Fogle. He asked me, “Do you want to row across the Atlantic with me?” I love rowing. I missed it, but I was not ready to train every day. Still, I wanted some competition. I asked my rowing friends if they wanted to join the race, but they were not excited. 

If I joined the race, I wanted to win. But rowing with Ben might not help me win. However, being an underdog without pressure was interesting. I talked to Ben. He was going to join the race anyway and had found money for the entry fee and a boat. This made the race real. 

We talked about the costs. The boat and equipment would cost £70,000, which is a lot of money. We thought we had a good chance, but it would take work. I also had to think about losing money because I would be away from home. Speaking at business events is a good way to earn money after being a sportsman. People like to hear my story, but I find it hard to talk about the past without a new goal. 

Joining the race would mean I was doing something again: rowing across the Atlantic. I learned a lot while planning this. One big lesson was to be thankful for the easy life of a full-time athlete. Training for the Olympics was hard, but it was simple. I trained a lot, but I had a plan and help from doctors and dieticians. 

I worried about what people would think of me racing with a TV presenter. I thought they might think I just wanted to be on TV. But my worries went away as we prepared. The Atlantic Rowing Race is not just about rowing. It is also about the mind. 

Ben had done tough challenges before, but he could not row well. I was surprised by how little he knew about rowing, and he was surprised by my honesty. I could have been more patient, but I needed to tell him how much he needed to improve. I should have known this would be his level when I agreed to race with him."

A little over a year ago, I left my job to work with huskies in the Arctic Circle in Finland. I was 26 years old and wanted a change. I dreamed of cold, snowy places because I was tired of busy London. I found a small company run by Anna and Pasi in Finnish Lapland. They needed a husky dog handler for the winter. From December to February, they take tourists on sled rides with huskies. They started with six dogs, but now they have more than 100. They also have a second place called the 'wilderness farm,' which is simple and does not have running water. They told me I could join them for three months, but the work would be hard. I started packing my things.

On November 6, I flew to Finland. I looked at a page with pictures of more than 100 huskies. I was supposed to remember their names, but I felt nervous. I looked out the window instead. I thought about how winter was coming, and rivers were freezing.

On November 7, I took a bus north. The bus ride was beautiful. We drove through dark forests with snow on the trees. We stopped for reindeer on the road. I arrived at the farm at night. Anna gave me boots and sent me outside into the cold. She asked if I wanted to start working right away. I followed the barking sounds to the dogsheds. There were people getting the huskies ready for sledding. The dogs were very excited. I tried to say hello, but everyone was busy. I petted one of the quieter dogs. Then someone told me to get in the sled, and we started our ride in the dark.

On November 15, I began to learn how to be a husky guide. Anna asked if I was useful. I didn’t know. I had never driven a snowmobile or used an axe. But I had a driving license, which made me feel better. I learned the basics of dog-sledding quickly: lean into the corners, use both feet to stop, and hold the handlebar tight. But other tasks were hard. Feeding and giving water to the dogs was difficult because the water would freeze quickly. We had to make a warm soup of meat for the dogs.

By the end of my first week, I was tired and my muscles hurt from pulling heavy sleds. But I felt proud. I could chop with an axe, hammer a nail, and use a saw. I told my friends, ""I can do these things in the snow!"""
105,"On that day, Radcliffe ran very fast and finished the race. Many reporters came to talk to her about her amazing run. They said her time was good enough to compete in the men's marathon in Paris. The reporters asked her about emu oil, a special oil that helps heal injuries. Cathy Freeman, an Olympic champion, had told Radcliffe to use it after she hurt herself when she ran into a bike while training.

Radcliffe said she did not think much about her big achievement at that time. She felt it was just what she was supposed to do that day. She and her team decided not to set any limits for the race. They believed in ""no limits."" During the race, her husband Gary and her physiotherapist Gerard were in a car, listening to the race on the radio. After 16 kilometers, her agent worried that Radcliffe might not keep up her fast pace. Gerard was angry about this, but he understood that it was a risk.

With 800 meters left, Radcliffe thought she could finish in under 2 hours and 16 minutes. She had already run 41 kilometers very fast, but she still ran the last part in 2 minutes and 25 seconds. At the finish, she thought, ""I can run faster than that."" The race director, Dave Bedford, said he never thought anyone would run that fast for a long time. Radcliffe thought she would come back and do it again next year, but that did not happen.

After the race, everyone wanted to know how Radcliffe won against very skilled runners from East Africa. Gerard worked with Radcliffe a lot, helping her with her training. He said she could handle a lot of pain. He had to work very hard on her muscles and sometimes felt pain himself. Gerard would travel 13 hours to see Radcliffe, and when he arrived, her husband would say, ""Gerard, you're late, Paula is waiting."" There was no time for tea; Radcliffe wanted to start training right away.

Gerard spent so much time with Radcliffe that other athletes were not happy. When asked why no one has come close to her record, Radcliffe said she trained very hard, but there are other talented runners too. She thought Mary Keitany, a two-time London marathon winner, could do it. Radcliffe believed that runners should focus on their own race and not just on beating others. She always pushed herself to run hard, even when she was winning.

Radcliffe did not know it at the time, but that marathon was the best she would ever run. However, she inspired many women to start long-distance running."
106,"When my first cooking show, In Search of Perfection, started, I was nervous. I did not know if people would like it. There was a lot of talk about a food ‘revolution’ in Britain. I thought we made a good show that was different. I worried if people would enjoy cooking that included history and science. 

I watched the first show with joy and fear. I did not need to worry. The show was successful. This success helped me create other projects, like a book about my restaurant. Each project felt like a journey into the past or into cooking. I wrote many books in a series called ‘Perfection’. Each book went with a TV show of the same name. In these, I traveled to many places and met interesting people. 

My latest book is called In Search of Total Perfection. In this book, I travel around the world to meet amazing people, like a man who makes special pasta. These people have spent many years trying to make their food perfect. 

Perfection means different things to different people. Choosing which dishes to include in the show was hard. I knew some people would be upset if their favorite dish was not in the show. I could imagine people asking, “Where is steak and kidney pie?” But after a long meeting, my team and I made a list that included something for everyone. 

I believe everyone has their own idea of perfection based on their feelings and memories. Even though the book is called ‘Perfection’, I did not say the recipes were the best. I used my cooking skills and talked to many food makers to find out what makes these dishes good. 

The word ‘perfection’ means being perfect, but it also means trying new ideas and improving them. The TV show let me explore many foods and places I had never seen before. I was excited to learn about food and memories because I started my career in the same way. 

Finding the best ingredients took me all over the world. I had many adventures, like visiting a factory that was not making the right tomatoes and going to a dairy farm that was not good enough for filming. I tried many cooking techniques, like milking a cow and making ice cream, cooking chicken in a special machine, and almost burning my house while trying to make pizza."
107,"We were far from Marrakech when the van made a loud noise and went off the road into a field. It stopped moving. John got out and looked at the engine. He looked confused and said, “I don’t know what I’m doing.” Mum and John started to laugh. Bea was worried. She said, “We can’t stay here forever.” The field was big and had grass and many flowers, like poppies and daisies. I agreed with Bea, “No, we can’t stay here forever.” We got back in the van and waited for Mum and John to stop laughing. 

We watched John walk away to find someone who could help with the van. Mum lay on the grass and said, “Tell us a story.” Bea lay down too and said, “Tell us a story.” I told them about two birds I heard talking before we left London. They talked about breadcrumbs, other birds, and the weather. They even argued about a worm. Bea said, “That’s silly, no one understands bird language.” I felt sad and said, “I do.” But I didn’t sound sure. Bea called me a liar. I felt embarrassed. I wanted to ask Mum, but she was asleep in the sun.

John came back with three Moroccan boys. They helped us push the van to a hotel. Bea didn’t want to get out. The boys smiled and waved at her. We went into a café near the hotel. John said, “It’s a hotel, but it might be expensive.” Mum said, “We’ll just have some tea.” We sat in the shade. The tea was sweet and made from mint leaves. Mum said, “It’s like syrup.” 

We stayed at the café all day while John looked at the engine. When it got dark, he said, “It’s a miracle we got this far.” Mum made a bed for us outside in the hotel garden. It felt nice to sleep on the ground. John said, “I will have to tow us into Marrakech.” 

Later, we sat in a truck and watched our van being pulled behind. At first, Bea didn’t want to move, so John picked her up and put her in the truck. Now she sat in the front with the driver. I wondered how we would get home since our van had to be towed. I thought it would be easier to take a boat to London. Then I fell asleep."
108,"Lucy was at a welcome party in a hotel. She was talking to two other pianists. One was a guy from Tokyo, and the other was a girl from Europe. Lucy did not know the girl’s name well. They were both older than Lucy by about ten years. They spoke good English and talked about their music and travels. 

Lucy said, “I think I’m going to Tanglewood this summer.” This sounded impressive, but Lucy did not really want to go. She was busy with concerts and competitions. She missed a lot of school and was not officially a student anymore. Instead, she worked with tutors from the University of San Francisco. 

Lucy did not want to come to the Prague Festival. Only fifteen pianists her age could come from around the world. She was one of them. Her dad bought her a special necklace to celebrate. Her little brother, Gus, dreamed of being in the festival one day. Her teacher, Grace, took her out for dinner to plan her music pieces. 

Lucy did not apply to the festival. Her mom filled out the form and sent in a CD. Her mom said, “I didn’t want you to be sad if you didn’t get in.” Lucy thought her mom did not want her to say no. 

The guy from Tokyo asked, “How old are you?” Lucy said, “Fifteen.” He looked surprised. Lucy did not mean to show off. She just wanted to fit in. 

Liesel/Louisa, the girl, looked away and said she had to go talk to someone. The guy from Tokyo stayed and asked, “Have you ever been to Japan?” He had long hair, like many musicians. Lucy said, “Once, when I was eight.” 

Then, Lucy’s grandfather came to her. He said, “Lucy, let me introduce you to someone.” He took her away from the conversation. He told her not to be too friendly with the other pianists. Lucy said, “They are not the competition.” But her grandfather said, “Everyone is the competition.” 

He took her around the room to meet important people. Lucy smiled and nodded, but she only understood some of what they said. 

Later, in the elevator, her grandfather said, “You did well, Lucy. I’m proud of you. This festival is important, and people know who you are.” Lucy liked this. She liked being someone special, even if some people were jealous. 

Being a concert pianist did not make her popular at school. Even her best friend, Reyna, did not know or care about her music skills. But in places like this festival, Lucy felt she mattered."

“Dad said, ‘You spend too much time online. You need to go outside.’ I wanted to know more, so I read what experts say. They say that many teenagers who use social media have real friends, feel good about themselves, and learn important skills for the digital world.

Simon Miles, an expert, says social media is a big part of growing up today. Teenagers use it all the time, like a virtual youth club. It helps them connect with friends and deal with problems. 

Professor Keith Davidson, a psychologist, says that when you are a teenager, you ask, ‘Who am I?’ Social media can help you find out. You can share your favorite music or sports and see how others think. He says that teenagers who use social media are not selfish. It can be easier to talk online than in person, especially for shy people.

Professor Andrew Phillips studies how young people use social media. He thinks it helps quiet people with special interests find others like them. If you like a certain type of music and only a few people at school do, you can find a group online. This way, you can feel popular in a new way.

Pauline White, an expert in digital education, says that teenagers can find new interests online and create their own content. They make videos, podcasts, and blogs about what they like. She believes social media helps creativity. Photographers can share their photos, learn new skills, and connect with others.

She also says that knowing how to use social media is important for jobs. Businesses use social media to sell things. If you have many friends online, they can be customers for your product. 

Teenagers who use social media to be creative will benefit when they grow up and work. Jim Matthews agrees. He says that working with others online to create and share is a valuable skill today.”"
110,"When people think of a family vacation, they may not think of a long trip across many states in the US and Canada. But my parents wanted to have a fun summer vacation this year. My dad wanted to plan a big family trip. He said, “Not many people do this anymore.” My twin brother and I looked at each other and thought, “Maybe there is a reason for that!”

In mid-June, we packed our car with bags and food. I was excited but also worried about not having my own space for two weeks. We started our trip called “The Family Great American Road Trip.” We left our big house and drove for a long time.

We went west through Oklahoma. We had some adventures, like stopping for the night in a small town. We saw many stars in the sky but almost got blown off the road by a dust storm. We learned that cows have the right to cross the road!

The next day, we woke up early and drove again. We saw deserts and then mountains. Each day was different, but they all felt similar. We visited the Great Sand Dunes and then went to Pagosa Springs, Colorado. It smelled funny there, but it was nice.

As we drove, we saw many old and new things. We got stuck in traffic because of construction. We laughed when we saw big “CLOSED” signs at the Four Corners Monument. We passed many wind farms on our way to Yellowstone National Park. There, we saw bears and had to stop for them on the road. It was exciting!

We stayed in a very old hotel with no internet or cell phone service. But the views were beautiful. After watching a rainstorm from our hotel in Canada, we drove back home. My parents were right. You don’t need to go far away to have a great time.

When we got home, I was happy to be with my family again. We took many photos during our trip. I knew I would remember the fun surprises we had along the way."
111,"Rose Frost was sixteen years old. She was going to live with her grandmother, Daisy. Rose's family was separating for two years. Her father, Jeff, had a job in another country, and her mother, Dahlia, would go with him. Rose and her older sister, Amy, would stay in England. Amy was finishing her last year of school. She had a nice room at her college with a kitchen and a study area. Rose was moving to her grandmother’s house. 

Rose did not know her grandmother very well. She remembered some happy times when she was younger. Rose's parents were not happy about her living with Daisy, but Daisy wanted to help Rose. Rose was excited to live with her grandmother. Daisy was very social and liked to meet people. Rose thought she would have fun with her grandmother. 

Before moving, Rose talked to her mother. Rose wanted to be independent. She wanted to play music loud, invite friends over, and go out without asking for permission. Daisy understood this. Rose got a new mobile phone from her mother for emergencies. They agreed to trust each other. 

Rose was a good student and had good friends. In five weeks, she would start at a new school. This was her fourth school in five years, but she was ready for it. Rose felt this was a new start in her life."
112,"Charlotte Grainger is a young writer. Her teacher in primary school thought she might write a book one day. Charlotte wanted to write a book because it seemed like a big challenge. When she turned 13, she decided to try. Now, her book is going to be published.

Charlotte told her old teacher about her book. The teacher was surprised. She thought Charlotte would write a book when she was 30 or 40 years old. But Charlotte did not want to wait. She felt she could do it now.

I met Charlotte in her publisher's office. She is 15 years old. Her book is very good. It has a lot of action and is interesting. Charlotte is confident but also calm. She knows she is young and has more to learn.

When I asked her about the big ideas in her book, she said she wanted to ask important questions, not give answers. She thinks teenagers can understand a lot, but they are still learning. She wants to write about taking responsibility.

Charlotte thinks there are three types of teenagers in stories: the outsider who becomes accepted, the naïve teenager who knows little about the world, and the awkward teenager who has social problems. She feels there are not enough stories about normal teenagers. She believes that some writers make teenagers feel they do not know themselves, which can hurt their confidence.

Charlotte loves to read fantasy books. Some famous fantasy writers made her doubt her own writing. She wondered if she could write a good book like them. But she found a helpful book called How Not to Write a Novel. It taught her that if readers can guess what happens next, the story is not exciting anymore.

Charlotte's parents are both journalists. This helped her get her book published. Her father knew someone in publishing who read her book. She knows it is not easy for new writers to get their first book read. She feels lucky but also knows that writers must work hard to succeed."
113,"Gareth, our ski teacher, said, ""Remember, speed is good!"" We looked at the ski slope. Everyone was nervous. Then David, a guy who could ski well, went first. He skied fast down the slope and jumped. He flew up but then fell into the snow. Gareth said, ""Speed can be tricky."" 

I was not good at freestyle skiing. I liked to practice turns in the snow, but I did not do tricks like other kids. My parents took us to a ski training center in the US. It had a big indoor area with trampolines and ski jumps. We practiced jumping into foam cubes, which was not like skiing outside.

After practicing inside, we went outside to ski. Gareth said, ""You need to land in the right place."" If you land in the wrong place, it hurts. At first, I was scared to jump. My legs did not want to go fast, and I landed in the wrong spot. I did not fall, but it was hard.

On the second day, we practiced on trampolines. I thought I would not like it, but it was fun to bounce. We learned how to know where our bodies were in the air. I needed to get better at this. 

We went back to the mountain to ski again. I had some problems, but finally, I landed correctly. I felt very proud! But on my last jump of the day, I skied fast, jumped, and landed well. Then I saw my skis sliding down the slope without me!"
114,"Imagine you are on a rollercoaster at a fun park. You feel scared and hold on tight. The ride stops, and then it goes up slowly. After a moment, it drops down fast, and your stomach feels funny. You go quickly forward, turn left, and then go upside down. You scream because you are scared. But you chose to go on this ride, just like many other people do every year.

Fun parks are very popular. They have many exciting rides. Many people work hard to make these rides safe and fun. They are engineers and designers. They want to make rides that are thrilling but also safe for everyone.

A rollercoaster designer is a special job. It is not easy. Designers must make sure people feel excited but not scared for their safety. They also want to make new and interesting rides. Many ideas for rollercoasters were made a long time ago, but they still use them today.

I talked to some experts about rollercoasters. They said it is important to mix feelings of fun and safety. They want people to feel like they are having a great time but also safe. The story of the ride, like a space adventure or a jungle chase, is also important to make it exciting.

Even with new technology, the real experience of riding a rollercoaster is still the most important part. People will always love the feeling of the ride itself."
115,"At 25 years old, Miranda Ellington is a successful choreographer. She makes dances for many theatres and dance groups. Sometimes, she still dances herself. I asked her why she does both jobs. She said, ""Dancing again helps me remember what it is like to be a dancer. It can be hard when choreographers give many orders."" As a choreographer, she teaches young dancers. She likes working with them because they are open to new ideas. ""Young dancers want to learn and succeed. They listen to feedback, even if it is tough. Sometimes they question me, and I like their honest thoughts.""

When Miranda starts with a new group, she focuses on the dance steps and the music. ""Even if I don’t like a piece of music, I still create a good dance for it. If dancers do not like the music, it can be hard, but I must find a way to make it work. I wish I could try different music to make rehearsals more fun. But now, I work on big shows where the music is already chosen.""

Miranda does not want to stay with one place. ""I like meeting new people. But each theatre and school has different ways of working. I must change how I work each time I go somewhere new. This helps me not to get stuck in one way.""

We talked about a new documentary about ballet dancers and choreographers. Miranda said, ""Some documentaries look nice but are not real. This one shows the true life in a dance company. There is a scene where a young dancer gets many corrections. I smiled because I understand her struggle. It is hard to watch, but it is real. People do not see how much work ballet takes.""

I asked Miranda what makes a great dance show. She said, ""It is when everything works well together – the music, costumes, lights, and dancers. We may not be perfect, but aiming high is good for the audience. Sometimes, the dance is great, but the costumes can be distracting, and that is disappointing.""

Miranda has done many types of work. I asked if she is a modern dance choreographer or a ballet expert. She replied, ""People want to label you, but I don’t understand why. I don’t want to only focus on one thing. For now, I want to learn and try many different things."""
116,"A friend asked me why I travel when I can watch everything on TV. I said that TV is great, but it is better to go outside and see new things. This talk gave me an idea for a fun trip. I made a film to tell people to turn off their TVs. 

A friend was giving away his old sofa. I took it and put wheels and cables on it. I used seatbelts to hold it on my shoulders. I put my bags on the sofa and slept on it at night, even on the beach one night. Some friends helped me pull the sofa and cheered me on. 

I have walked a lot in the past, but this was different. I walked a long way on busy roads. I could stop at cafes and relax on the sofa with a drink instead of sitting on a rock. I often told people, “No, I am not doing this for charity, and I am not training for a marathon.” When someone asks me about my weekend, I like to tell them how I pulled a sofa 100 miles in southern England instead of talking about TV shows. You can see the film on my website."
117,"When I read about swimming trips in the sea around small Greek islands, I was very happy. I had never been on a group trip before. My brother was busy, so I thought a group holiday would be good for me. The man at the Greek port looked surprised when I asked for a ticket for one person because many families go to the islands. I told him I would not be alone for long; I would join ten other people to swim around the small islands. He still looked confused, but he smiled and let me on the boat.

Before we started, our group sent emails to each other, but we did not have much time to talk before our first swim. Our guides told us that a support boat would help us, and they showed us how to talk to it. We swam a short distance to split us into speed groups, and then it was time for our first long swim of 1.5 km. I was nervous. I had trained in my local pool and swum in rivers, but I had never swum long distances in the sea.

Soon, the waves got bigger, and I was at the back of the slow group, not where I wanted to be. I saw faster swimmers moving ahead like dolphins. I wanted to finish this swim, and I was very happy when I did it by myself. 

The next days were the same: jumping in, swimming at a good speed, and stopping to look at the beautiful views. As the swims got longer, I swam faster and enjoyed it more. I did not need the support boat much. I can’t wait to come back next year!"
118,"Being a flight attendant is not easy, but it is a great job. I have traveled to many places, like the US and Australia. I work with nice people, have a lot of free time, and my job is never boring. This is good for a young person like me!

When I was a child, I went to a school far from my family. I flew alone to go to school and come back home. Sometimes, I felt lonely. I asked the flight attendants if I could help them serve food to the passengers. Some said yes. 

Later, when I wanted to change my job from banking, I remembered this. I went to an interview for the flight attendant job. There were many young people there, and many of them were also changing jobs. I practiced what to say before the interview. I talked about my skills and my past work, not just that I liked to travel. Because of this, I got the job!

I think this job is good for many people. There are many reasons to like it, but free flights are not the best part. Most airline workers work very hard. We have a saying: ""No one is finished until everyone is finished."" It feels like a big family. Even if we do not see each other all the time, we are still close.

When I am not working, I do not take work home. If I have a difficult passenger, which is rare, I know the flight will end soon, and I will not see them again!"
119,"At the summer camp where I work, I like to see the children do things they did not think they could do. Most children can swim and play table tennis before they come here, but rock climbing is new for many of them. Some children feel nervous, but with a little help, they try and they all reach the top. This makes them very happy.

At the start of the week, some children miss their homes. It is not the little ones who miss home the most; it is the children who are ten to thirteen years old. We do not let them use their mobile phones all the time. We tell them they can call home after lunch. When they ask again after dinner, we say it is too late to call now, and they can do it tomorrow. Most children feel better in a few days, and at the end of the week, they thank us because they had a great time.

Sometimes, it is not just the children who feel lonely. Some parents call a lot to ask how their child is. This is not needed. Often, their child is busy playing games or doing other fun things, so we tell the parents to call back later.

We also get some children who come dressed in new, expensive clothes. These children sometimes argue when we ask them to change into something more comfortable, but soon they understand why."
120,"Text: 'Rock the Planet is a musical show. It started in London last year. Before that, it was in the USA for five years. In the USA, it won ‘Best Musical’ four times! 

In London, it was hard to find actors. The UK has rules about how many shows young actors can do each week. In the USA, they can do more shows. So, they needed more actors in London. The director found many talented actors in the UK. They just won their first ‘Best Musical’ award!

The theatre in London is big, and it is full every night. People want to hear the songs from America. I met Jamie, who is 11 years old and acts in the show. He said, ‘It’s great that I get paid to play, especially with a nice guitar.’ 

Jamie told me that the young actors are busy. They have school lessons at the theatre. He misses his old school friends. His whole class came to see the show. The theatre gives special ticket prices for schools. They loved the show, and that made Jamie feel good. His parents come when they can, but tickets are expensive.

I told Jamie I also play guitar. He found a spare guitar and invited me to play with him and the other actors. We played a song called Days. I was happy when I got it right. I was impressed by Jamie’s skills. 

The young actors are already musicians, but they had never played in a band before. They found it easy to play together. Jamie said the hard part was to look natural when they first performed. They were so focused that they forgot to smile!

The show will be in London for another year, and it is very good to see.'"
