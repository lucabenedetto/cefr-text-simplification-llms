1,"Some time ago, a website warned about the dangers of public check-ins, which are online posts about where you are. The website's message was clear: while you might think you are just sharing your location, you are also letting many people know where you are, including those you might not want to meet. This reflects a growing understanding that sharing everything online can have negative effects. The internet offers many exciting opportunities to share our lives with a global audience, which can lead to wealth and fame. However, we often realize too late that this sharing can be risky and overwhelming.

But don’t lose hope. There is guidance from early internet users who explored these challenges before us. In the beginning days of the web, they faced many difficulties, losing jobs and friends while dealing with the temptations of fame, long before social media existed. These early bloggers experienced what many of us are now going through. It’s important to learn from their experiences.

In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started posting on the web, which was mostly used by graduate students and scientists. The web was created at CERN, a physics lab in Switzerland, to help researchers share their work. Hall saw a chance to share his own life. He created a personal website filled with stories, photos, and art. In January 1996, he began a daily blog, attracting many readers who were fascinated by his boldness. Hall was open about everything; no topic was off-limits. While some might see this as attention-seeking, there was also a creative and artistic side to his work.

However, one day, visitors to Hall’s site found it replaced by a video called Dark Night. He shared that he had fallen in love, but when he wrote about it online, he was told to choose between his blog and his relationship. He felt that sharing his life online made people distrust him. The blog ended, but the issue remains: sharing online can be fun, but if you think it will make people want to be around you, you might be disappointed.

In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a young woman in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job at a software company. One day, a colleague sent her blog link to the company’s vice presidents, including some she had criticized, which led to her losing her job. Experts call this the “online distribution effect,” which means people often say things online that they wouldn’t say in person. However, the internet is not a separate world; our online actions can have real-life consequences. Ignoring this can lead to serious mistakes.

Armstrong’s story had a happy ending. Although she was upset and stopped blogging for a while, she eventually got married and started a new blog about her family. Today, she is successful as a “mommy blogger,” and her writing supports her family. Once known for her online mistakes, she has learned to share her life more carefully. What Armstrong teaches us is important: the internet allows us to say anything, but that doesn’t mean we should."
2,"Some scientists recently started a campaign to warn people about a low-budget film called *What the Bleep Do We Know?* This film mixes documentary and drama to suggest that there is much we do not understand about our universe. While scientists can sometimes be arrogant, even the most confident physicist would not claim to know everything about the cosmos. However, some scientists felt it was important to warn the public about the film, calling it everything from ""atrocious"" to ""very dangerous."" This made me curious to see the movie.

At first, I didn’t understand why there was so much concern. Various scientists made simple statements about how new discoveries show that the universe is stranger than we thought. But when the film started discussing some of these discoveries, I began to see the reason for the fuss. One claim was that water molecules can be influenced by thoughts. I had heard about a Japanese researcher who suggested that the shape of a water molecule could change based on the feelings of people nearby. However, the film only showed pictures of ice crystals that looked beautiful when someone spoke kindly to them and ugly when exposed to negative emotions. Many people find this kind of evidence convincing, but scientists often respond with skepticism.

I understand their point. The idea that thoughts can affect water is fascinating and could suggest new forces in the universe. But before we get too excited, we need solid proof that this effect is real. Beautiful pictures of crystals are not enough. The real issue is that the movie's claims were not strange enough. For example, water molecules might have properties linked to a mysterious energy that is causing the universe to expand. This idea is supported by decades of research from scientists around the world.

In reality, discoveries are being made that show the universe is indeed stranger than we ever imagined. Astronomers have found that the universe is made of an unknown type of matter and is driven by a mysterious force called ""dark energy."" On a more practical level, neuroscientists have discovered that our awareness of events happens about half a second after they occur, a delay we don’t notice because our brains edit it out. Anthropologists believe they have found where modern humans first appeared and how they spread across the world. Some theorists even suggest there are connections between life on Earth and the fundamental design of the universe.

Despite what some may think, science is not close to being complete. In fact, we seem to be further from knowing everything than ever before. Many natural phenomena may never be fully understood. The ideas of chaos and quantum uncertainty show that there are limits to what we can know. Some of the world’s top physicists are trying to create a ""Theory of Everything"" that would explain all the forces and particles in the universe with one equation. Overall, many of us believe that the universe can be described in one word: incredible."
3,"To put it simply, I find writing novels challenging, but writing short stories is a joy. If writing novels is like planting a forest, then writing short stories is more like planting a garden. Both activities work together to create a beautiful landscape that I love. The trees provide shade, and the wind makes the leaves rustle, sometimes turning them a bright gold. In the garden, flowers bloom, and their colorful petals attract bees and butterflies, showing the change of seasons.

Since I started my career as a fiction writer, I have often switched between writing novels and short stories. My routine is this: after finishing a novel, I want to write short stories; after completing a group of short stories, I feel ready to focus on a novel. I never write short stories while working on a novel, and I don’t write a novel while working on short stories. The two types of writing may use different parts of my brain, and it takes time to switch from one to the other.

I began my career with two short novels in 1975, and from 1984 to 1985, I started writing short stories. I didn’t know much about writing short stories back then, so it was difficult, but I found the experience very memorable. I felt my fictional world expand, and readers seemed to enjoy this different side of me as a writer. One of my early works, “Breaking Waves,” was included in my first short-story collection, Tales from Abroad. This marked my beginning as a short-story writer.

One of the joys of writing short stories is that they don’t take long to finish. Usually, it takes me about a week to shape a short story (though I can revise it many times). This is different from the long commitment needed to write a novel, which can take a year or two. For me, writing a novel can feel endless, and I sometimes wonder if I will make it through. So, writing short stories gives me a needed change of pace.

Another nice thing about short stories is that you can create a story from the smallest ideas—like a thought, a word, or an image. Often, it feels like jazz improvisation, where the story takes me in unexpected directions. Plus, with short stories, you don’t have to worry too much about failing. If an idea doesn’t work out, you can just accept it and move on. Even great writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver didn’t write a masterpiece every time. This thought comforts me. You can learn from your mistakes and use that knowledge in your next story.

When I write novels, I try to learn from both my successes and failures in writing short stories. In this way, short stories serve as a kind of experimental space for me as a novelist. It’s hard to experiment the way I want to within a novel, so without short stories, writing novels would be even more challenging.

My short stories are like soft shadows I have left in the world, faint traces of my thoughts and feelings. I remember exactly where I placed each one and how I felt at that moment. Short stories are like guideposts to my heart, and it makes me happy as a writer to share these personal feelings with my readers."
4,"At its most basic level, science is related to philosophy, and at its most practical, it helps to cure diseases. Science has made our lives easier but has also posed threats to our existence. It tries to understand everything from tiny ants to the vast universe, but it often struggles to do so. Science has influenced poets, politicians, philosophers, and even frauds. Its beauty is often seen only by those who study it deeply, while its dangers are often misunderstood. People have both overestimated and underestimated its importance, and the mistakes made by scientists are sometimes ignored or exaggerated.

The history of science is full of conflict. Established ideas are often changed or completely rejected, similar to how new music styles are sometimes mocked before becoming popular. The battle between old and new ideas in science is rarely respectful. Scientists can be jealous and angry, and conflict is a big part of scientific history. This book will show science as a collection of ideas that have changed not just science itself but also many areas of human thought. While science has practical benefits, this book will focus more on the ideas behind it, appreciating their beauty and being ready to question them. We must recognize both the creativity and the limitations of human understanding.

Science is always changing. There is always a scientist somewhere challenging the ideas of another. Most of the time, these changes do not disturb society too much. However, sometimes, they can shake our established beliefs. For example, in the 17th century, science described the universe as a giant clock. Three hundred years later, physics began to question this idea, leading us to a complex understanding where our observations can change what we see, and we still do not fully understand our basic concepts.

Some people think that the changing nature of scientific theories shows that science cannot explain the universe. However, these changes usually help us understand and predict nature better. For instance, Isaac Newton explained much more than the ancient Greek thinker Aristotle, and Albert Einstein explained even more than Newton. Science may make mistakes, but it continues to progress. 

At the end of the 19th century, many physicists believed there was not much left to discover in physics. Then came major breakthroughs like radioactivity, X-rays, the electron, and many new particles, as well as concepts like quantum mechanics and relativity. Biology has also made significant discoveries. Today, some people claim that a complete theory explaining everything about the universe is close to being found. 

Science is not just a harmless activity. In the last 200 years, we have moved from simply observing nature to controlling it in some ways. This has sometimes upset the balance of nature in ways we did not fully understand. It is important for everyone, not just scientists, to understand scientific advances because they will shape the world our children will live in. Science is now a key part of how humanity thinks about and shapes its future. The decisions made in science can impact budgets, health, and even the future of life on Earth."
5,"From around 2015, after many years of growth, major publishers began to notice that ebook sales had stopped increasing or even decreased in some cases. This raised doubts about the future of ebooks in the publishing industry. One publishing executive anonymously admitted that the excitement around ebooks may have led to poor investments, causing his company to lose faith in the value of printed books. Despite the clear idea that digital and print books can exist together, the question of whether ebooks will replace print books still comes up. Whether people are trying to predict or dismiss this idea, it is interesting that the possible disappearance of books continues to spark our imagination and create strong discussions.

Why is this idea so strong? Why do we see the relationship between ebooks and print books as a battle, even when evidence shows they can coexist? The answers to these questions go beyond ebooks and reveal much about our mixed feelings of excitement and fear regarding change and innovation. In my research, I have explored how the idea of one medium replacing another often appears with new technologies. For example, when television was invented, many believed that radio would disappear. However, radio survived by finding new ways to be used, like listening in cars or during commutes.

The idea that books might disappear is not new either. As early as 1894, people thought that the phonograph would replace books with what we now call audiobooks. This pattern has repeated many times. Movies, radio, television, hyperlinks, and smartphones have all been said to threaten print books as sources of culture and entertainment. Some people worried that the end of books would lead to a decline in culture, while others exaggerated the benefits of ebooks in a digital future. 

The idea of the death of books often appears during times of technological change. This narrative reflects our hopes and fears about new technology. To understand why we react this way, we need to recognize that we form emotional connections with different media as they become important in our lives. Many studies show that we develop strong feelings for objects like books, televisions, and computers, even naming our cars or getting frustrated with our laptops. Therefore, when new technology, like e-readers, appears, it not only brings economic and social change but also forces us to rethink our relationship with something that has been a big part of our daily lives. As technology evolves, we often miss what we used to know and no longer have. This is why industries often grow around older products and technologies.

For example, when the printing press spread in 15th-century Europe, people began to seek out original manuscripts. The change from silent to sound movies in the 1920s made people nostalgic for the older style. The same happened when photography changed from analog to digital and from vinyl records to CDs. Similarly, e-readers have led to a new appreciation for the physical qualities of traditional books, even their unique smell. This should comfort those who worry about the future of print books. However, the idea of disappearing media will continue to be an interesting story about the power of technology and our fear of change. 

One way we cope with change is by using familiar stories, like those of tragedy and endings. These stories are easy to remember and share, and the narrative of the death of the book reflects both our excitement for the future and our fear of losing parts of our familiar world—and ultimately, ourselves."
6,"For a year and a half, I woke up every weekday at 5:30 AM. I brushed my teeth, made coffee, and wrote about how some of the greatest thinkers of the last four hundred years managed their time to do their best work. I focused on the everyday details of their lives, like when they slept, ate, worked, and worried. My goal was to show a different side of their personalities and careers, presenting them as people with habits like everyone else. 

The French writer Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin once said, ""Tell me what you eat, and I shall tell you what you are."" I believe, ""Tell me what time you eat, and if you take a nap afterward."" This book is somewhat simple; it looks at the conditions for creativity rather than the creative work itself. However, it is also personal. The novelist John Cheever believed that even a business letter reveals something about the writer. 

I wrote this book to explore questions I face in my own life: How can you do meaningful creative work while making a living? Is it better to focus entirely on one project or to work on it a little each day? When time is limited, do you have to give up things like sleep or a clean house, or can you learn to do more in less time? I don’t claim to answer these questions, as some may only be resolved through personal compromises. Instead, I provide examples of how many successful people have dealt with similar challenges. 

The book is called Daily Rituals, but it really focuses on people’s routines. Routines can seem ordinary and thoughtless, but they can also be powerful tools for managing limited resources like time, willpower, and optimism. A good routine helps organize our mental energy and can protect us from being influenced by our moods. The psychologist William James believed that having good habits allows us to focus on more interesting tasks. Ironically, he struggled with procrastination and sticking to a schedule himself.

This book began during a moment of procrastination. One Sunday, while trying to write an article for a small architecture magazine, I found myself cleaning my workspace and making coffee instead of working. As a ""morning person,"" I am very focused in the early hours but not as productive later in the day. To feel better about this, I started looking online for information about other writers’ schedules. I found many interesting stories and thought it would be great to collect them, which led to the Daily Routines blog I started that day and now this book.

The blog was informal; I shared descriptions of people’s routines from biographies and articles. For the book, I gathered a much larger and better-researched collection while keeping the variety of voices that made the blog enjoyable. I let my subjects speak for themselves through quotes from their letters, diaries, and interviews. In some cases, I summarized their routines from other sources. I want to acknowledge that this book would not have been possible without the research of many biographers, journalists, and scholars. I have listed all my sources in the Notes section for those interested in further reading."
7,"Howard became a palaeontologist because of a change in interest rates when he was six years old. His father, who was careful with money and had a big mortgage, said that their planned holiday to Spain was no longer possible. Instead, they rented a chalet on the English coast. One rainy August afternoon, Howard found an ammonite on the beach. He had always wanted to be a palaeontologist, and by the end of university, he knew what kind he wanted to be. He was not interested in dinosaurs or the Jurassic period; instead, he was fascinated by the very beginnings of life and the ancient creatures found in grey rocks.

As he finished his doctoral thesis, he worried about finding a job. He believed in his abilities but knew that deserving a job does not always mean getting one. When a position for an Assistant Lecturer at Tavistock College in London opened up, he applied, but did not expect much. On the day of his interview, the professor who was supposed to lead the panel had a fight with his wife, drove his car into a gatepost, and ended up in the hospital. The interview went on without him, and a colleague who did not like Howard’s former professor took his place. This colleague helped Howard get the job, even though Howard was surprised by this unexpected support.

At first, Howard was grateful but later learned the truth about how he got the job. He felt a bit disappointed because he wanted to believe he was chosen for his skills. However, what mattered most was that he had the job and could do the work he loved. He often thought about how organized his professional life was, where he could plan and achieve goals, compared to the chaos of personal life, where strangers could unexpectedly change everything.

One day, Howard's briefcase, which contained notes for a lecture, was stolen at an Underground station. Angry, he returned to college, called to postpone the lecture, and reported the theft. After that, he went for a coffee and met a colleague who was with a curator from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. During their conversation, Howard learned about a new collection of fossils that needed to be studied, which would be a great opportunity for him. Because of the theft, he changed his plans. He decided not to go to a conference in Stockholm or take students on a field trip to Scotland. Instead, he would find a way to visit the museum in Nairobi."
8,"Charles Spence is a professor at Oxford University in the UK, and he is known for trying unusual foods. For example, he has ice cream made from bee larvae at home, which he says tastes a bit like nuts and flowers. Spence and his team are working on making eating bugs more acceptable. His research focuses on how our senses work together to create the flavors we experience. This research influences what we eat and drink, from large food companies to high-end restaurants.

Spence studies many factors that affect our taste, such as who we eat with, how food is presented, and even the color and weight of plates and cutlery. In his book, ""The Perfect Meal,"" co-written with Betina Piqueras-Fiszman, he shares interesting facts about eating. For instance, the first person to order in a group usually enjoys their meal more, and we tend to eat 35% more food when dining with one other person, and 75% more with three others.

Spence's lab is simple and not very modern. He uses basic equipment and soundproof booths for his experiments. By keeping costs low, he can work with chefs who cannot afford research on their own. Much of his funding comes from a large food company. In the past, university research funded by companies was often looked down upon, but now it is seen as valuable because it shows that research can have a real impact.

Spence is helping food brands reduce salt and sugar in their products, which is important for keeping customers healthy. Surprisingly, many companies make these changes slowly so that customers do not notice. Spence explains that when people know about these changes, they focus more on the taste and often do not like it as much.

Spence first met famous chef Heston Blumenthal while working on a project for a food company. At that time, people thought combining science and food was strange, but Spence believed it could change how people think about food. Their collaboration led to the creation of a dish called ""Sound of the Sea,"" which uses sound to enhance the dining experience.

Spence has found that different sounds can change how we taste food. For example, high-pitched music can make food taste sweeter, while lower sounds can make it taste bitter. Soon, airlines will match music with the food they serve. Last year, a brand even released an app that played music while ice cream melted, but they did not match the music to the taste, which is often a missed opportunity.

At home, Spence's dinner parties are quite unique. One time, they ate rabbit with the fur still on the cutlery, and another time, they used remote-controlled lights. They have even experimented with sounds and different drinks to see how they affect taste. For Spence, home, shops, food events, and conferences are all part of his research into food and flavor."
9,"Our brains are working harder than ever. We are bombarded with facts, false information, chatter, and rumors, all pretending to be useful information. We have to sort through this to find what we really need to know and what we can ignore. At the same time, we are doing more tasks ourselves. Thirty years ago, travel agents booked our flights and salespeople helped us in stores. Now, we do most of these things on our own. We are trying to manage many responsibilities, including our lives, families, jobs, hobbies, and favorite TV shows, often with the help of our smartphones. These devices have become part of our busy lives, filling every free moment with tasks.

However, there is a problem. Although we believe we are multitasking—doing several things at once—this is a misleading idea. Earl Miller, a neuroscientist at MIT, explains that our brains are not designed to multitask effectively. When we think we are multitasking, we are actually switching quickly between tasks. Each time we switch, it costs us mentally. Instead of being expert jugglers, we are more like amateur plate spinners, moving from one task to another and worrying about what we might drop.

Even though we feel productive, multitasking actually makes us less efficient. It increases stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline, which can lead to confusion and unclear thinking. Multitasking creates a desire for constant stimulation, rewarding our brains for losing focus. The prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain we need to stay focused, is easily distracted by new things, like shiny objects that attract babies.

Just the chance to multitask can harm our ability to think clearly. Glenn Wilson, a former psychology professor, calls this problem ""info-mania."" His research shows that trying to focus on a task while seeing an unread email can lower our IQ by almost 10 points. The cognitive losses from multitasking are even worse than those caused by being tired. Russ Poldrack, a neuroscientist at Stanford, found that learning while multitasking sends information to the wrong part of the brain. For example, if students do homework while watching TV, the information goes to a part of the brain for skills instead of the part for facts, making it harder to remember later.

Additionally, multitasking often involves making decisions, like whether to reply to a text or ignore it. Decision-making is tough on our brains, and small decisions use the same mental energy as big ones. After making many small choices, we can end up making poor decisions about important matters.

In discussions about information overload, email is often mentioned as a major issue. It’s not that email itself is the problem, but the overwhelming amount of messages we receive. When asked what his father does for a living, the son of a neuroscientist said, ""He answers emails."" This reflects a common truth: we feel we must respond to emails, but it seems impossible to do that and accomplish anything else."
10,"In a zoo in Sweden, a chimpanzee named Santino spent his nights breaking concrete into pieces to throw at visitors during the day. Was he being mean? In caves in the US, female bats help other fruit bat mothers if they can’t find the right position to give birth. Are they being kind? Fifty years ago, these questions were not considered important. Animals had behaviors that led to measurable results, and scientists focused on those results. The idea that animals have thoughts, feelings, and moral values was seen as sentimental. However, this view has started to change. Research on the behavior of bats, chimps, rats, dolphins, and chickens has begun to explore animal emotions, which were once a taboo subject. This change has influenced popular science books like Mark Bekoff’s ""Wild Justice"" and Victoria Braithwaite’s ""Do Fish Feel Pain?"". 

This shift has sparked a debate that may never be fully answered: do animals have consciousness? This leads to another important question about conscience, which is a person’s sense of right and wrong. In a recent experiment with cows, those that opened a locked gate to get food showed more happiness—by jumping and kicking—than those that had the gate opened for them. If cows enjoy solving problems, what does this mean for how we produce and eat beef? While the observations are clear, their meaning is debated. Dr. Jonathan Balcombe, author of ""Second Nature,"" believes the logical response to this research is to stop eating meat. He thinks humanity is close to a major change in ethics, similar to the end of slavery. Aubrey Manning, a professor at Edinburgh University, believes we should reconsider how we view animal intelligence, suggesting that animals have a simpler understanding of the world than humans. Professor Euan MacPhail thinks we should avoid attributing human feelings to animals. 

These three views may never agree because the main issue is not just scientific or moral, but philosophical. Since defining consciousness is very difficult, can we ever truly understand what it is like to be a bat, as philosopher Thomas Nagel asked? Balcombe describes an important experiment showing that starlings, a type of bird, can become depressed. In a study at Newcastle University, starlings were divided into two groups. One group lived in spacious, comfortable cages, while the other lived in small, empty cages. Both groups learned to eat tasty worms from one box and avoid unpleasant worms from another. However, when only unpleasant worms were offered, only the starlings in the comfortable cages would eat. Balcombe concluded that living in a bad environment made the starlings pessimistic about life. 

Balcombe, who has worked with animal rights groups, has a strong opinion. He believes that just as we now look back at racism with disgust, we will one day feel the same about how we treat animals. He argues that we cannot support animal rights while eating meat. If he were the only one with this view, it might be easy to ignore him. However, Professor Aubrey Manning shares similar beliefs. Manning has written a textbook on animal behavior and says we are seeing a shift in how we think about animals. In the past, some believed animals thought like humans, but now we are moving in the opposite direction. This is a complex topic, and it is important to listen carefully to different academic opinions."
11,"Critical thinking is a way to engage with what we read or hear to understand it better. Adrian West, a research director at the Edward de Bono Foundation in the U.K., notes that people often believe that arguing helps us find the truth. While technology helps us store and process information, there are worries that it also changes how we solve complex problems and makes it harder to think deeply. West points out that we are exposed to a lot of poor-quality thinking and popular opinions, which can overwhelm our ability to reason. Surprisingly, having more information does not always lead to better knowledge or decision-making. 

According to the National Endowment for the Arts, fewer people are reading literature, and this decline is speeding up. Patricia Greenfield, a psychology professor, believes that focusing more on visual media may be hurting our critical thinking skills. She says that people are more focused on real-time media and multitasking instead of concentrating on one thing. However, there is still no clear answer on how technology affects critical thinking. 

Technology has complicated the way we think, and researchers can no longer rely on old beliefs. It is easy to see technology as either good or bad, but the truth is that it can be both, depending on how it is used. For example, a computer game might help or hurt critical thinking. Reading online can improve analysis skills, but constantly clicking on links can prevent deeper thinking. Greenfield, who studied over 50 research papers on learning and technology, says that technology changes how we think. She explains that reading helps develop imagination and critical thinking, while visual media like video games and TV do not engage the imagination in the same way. 

However, she also found that visual media can improve some types of information processing. Unfortunately, most visual media do not give us time to reflect or think deeply. As a result, many young people may not reach their full potential. How society views technology affects how we think about critical thinking. This is especially clear when looking at video games and learning. James Paul Gee, a professor of educational psychology, argues that video games are not always bad for kids. In fact, they can be a great learning tool. Evidence shows that playing video games can help children develop better reasoning skills. Games like Sim City and Civilization teach decision-making and analytical skills in ways that feel real. These games also allow players to explore ideas that they might not be able to in real life. 

In today’s digital world, as reading and math scores drop, it is important to examine how technology affects our thinking and analysis."
12,"When Matthew Crawford is not writing about how we should live, he works as a motorcycle mechanic. He chose this job after feeling unhappy with office work and his role in social policy. His first book praised the value of manual jobs, while his latest book discusses how to deal with modern life. He was inspired to write it when he noticed advertisements appearing on a credit card machine while he was shopping. Crawford realized that these distractions are hard to avoid. What we want to think about at any moment is personal, but we often cannot choose this because of things we do not even notice. It is becoming harder to think clearly or remember conversations. To avoid constant interruptions, people tend to isolate themselves and stop doing simple things like talking to strangers. Crawford points out that we increasingly experience the world through things like video games and apps, which often try to manipulate us. These distractions reflect our desires but can take over our lives.

Crawford is not alone in his concerns. Many office workers complain about emails but still spend their free time checking them. Studies show that just seeing a phone can distract us, which many of us have experienced during boring dinners. While there is no scientific proof yet that our attention spans have changed, it is clear that we are more aware of other things we could be doing. Some people think this problem is caused by technology, but Crawford believes that technology has made it easier for us to focus on ourselves. With so many choices, it is hard to control our attention, which affects our social lives. For example, we might prefer to text a friend instead of talking to them in person. By only interacting with digital representations of people, Crawford warns that we might lose something important in our society.

He also gives an example from his gym. In the past, there was one music player for everyone, which sometimes caused disagreements. Now, people listen to their own music with earbuds, and the gym has lost its social atmosphere. Real connections often happen through disagreements, like discussing different music tastes.

Crawford suggests two solutions. First, we need to reduce noise and distractions in public spaces. More importantly, he believes we should engage in skilled activities to connect with the world in a more meaningful way. He mentions cooks, ice hockey players, and motorcycle racers as examples of people who deal with real materials and situations. No digital experience can replace the feeling of a hockey puck on ice or the gravel under a motorcycle tire. These activities require good judgment and the ability to interact with others.

Crawford argues that when we engage with the real world, we see that manufactured experiences are not as fulfilling. This does not mean everyone should become a chef, but it is important to use our judgment in daily life. There are many benefits to this approach, including professional satisfaction. Constantly fighting distractions can be tiring and make it harder to focus on what is important. In contrast, paying attention to one thing can help us pay attention to other things as well."
13,"Text: 

""What do you do for a living?"" This is a common question in small talk, and we often define ourselves by our jobs. However, if you are a philosopher like me, it can be a bit more complicated. Saying you are a philosopher can sound pretentious. It feels better to say you study or teach philosophy, but calling yourself a philosopher might make people think you claim to know some special truth. This idea is not true; philosophers are just like everyone else, but this stereotype makes me think twice before answering.

One reason this stereotype exists is that philosophers are seen as people who judge others and value intellectual life. The Greek philosopher Aristotle believed that a life of contemplation, or philosophical thinking, was the best kind of life. While few modern philosophers agree with this, philosophy is still often linked to deep thinking. Another Greek philosopher, Socrates, said that ""the unexamined life is not worth living,"" meaning that simply accepting what society says can lead to an unsatisfying life. Our ability to reflect on the world helps us take control of our lives and make our own choices.

However, living an examined life does not mean you have to read many philosophical books or dedicate your life to deep thinking. It simply means paying more attention to the everyday experiences that shape our lives to make sure they are meaningful. You don’t have to be a wise person living away from society to evaluate life fairly. In fact, examining life can be very practical and should involve sharing knowledge, as it is important for a good life.

Another reason people misunderstand philosophers is that academic philosophy has become more distant from real-life experiences, especially for those without formal training. This is not entirely the philosophers' fault; university funding and evaluations are often linked to expensive academic journals. Because of this, philosophers have fewer chances to share their ideas with anyone outside their small group of experts. For many people, philosophy can seem disconnected from reality. While some philosophers used to challenge this view, many have accepted it. The academic environment has created a separation, and as philosophy has focused on specific technical debates, it has become harder for those outside the field to understand.

I sometimes call myself an ""ethicist"" because most of my work is in ethics, which is the part of philosophy that looks at human actions. Recently, I have felt that this title does not fully describe my work, as ethics is often linked to formal rules and laws. There is a new development in philosophical thinking: applied ethics, which examines the fairness of specific social practices. The role of an ethicist today is to decide if certain actions are ""ethical"" or acceptable. These are important questions that I often explore.

However, philosophy is more than just this. A typical discussion might start by asking if illegally downloading movies is unethical (it is) and then move on to questions about responsibility, our views on art, and the effects of consumerism. In this way, philosophy can help people think more deeply about the actions and behaviors that shape their lives. Sometimes we might confirm what we already know; other times, we may find that our beliefs are hard to defend. Either way, by examining these ideas, we can benefit everyone."
14,"Food lovers, chefs, and anyone who enjoys food might think that thinking deeply about what and how we eat can make eating more enjoyable. However, throughout history, discussions about food in philosophy have often been less important than other philosophical topics. When philosophers talk about eating, they usually use it as a way to discuss something else, like gaining knowledge. Sometimes, there are discussions that seem to be about food, but when we look closer, we see they are actually about different, but related, ideas.

One interesting example is the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus, who believed in seeking pleasure and avoiding pain in many areas of life. Although he talked about various pleasures, his name has become closely linked to enjoying food and drink. You can see this in the names of restaurants and food websites that use his name, likely hoping to attract customers by connecting to a famous philosopher.

Food is also a social and cultural experience. The food we eat comes from history and is shared with people in our communities. These communities help us by providing dining partners and the systems needed to grow and distribute food. We interact with food more often and in more important ways than with other products, making it a clear topic for philosophical discussion.

Once food is prepared, critics begin to talk and write about it. But why do these critics have such a special role? One philosopher pointed out that tasting food is not a special skill; rather, good food critics are just better at describing flavors. This area of taste has not been studied much in philosophy, as most research has focused on how we see things. This should change.

Another important aspect of food is its beauty. We often describe paintings or music as beautiful, but we rarely talk about the taste of food in the same way. Some philosophers believe that, with the growth of modern cooking, food deserves to be discussed in terms of beauty, just like art or poetry. However, food is consumed when we enjoy it, unlike art, which remains after we experience it. Because of this, it is incorrect to think of food as something that can be considered beautiful in the same way as lasting art.

There are also many ethical questions related to food. For example, we can ask what we should eat: organic, free-range, locally grown, vegetarian, or non-genetically modified foods? The answers often reflect our ethical beliefs, and philosophers will always question why we choose what we do. This kind of academic discussion about food is important.

Another topic is the difference between cooking at home and in restaurants. Home cooks have a special responsibility to their guests because of their personal relationships. In a home kitchen, everyone comes together to share food and companionship. In contrast, professional cooks have responsibilities to their employers and the food itself. Their kitchens are not open to everyone, and their relationships are more about colleagues than friends.

A recent essay called ""Diplomacy of the Dish"" looks at how food and dining can help connect different cultures. This happens in two ways: first, we can learn to appreciate others by enjoying their food, and second, we can build personal connections with people from other cultures by sharing meals. This practice has a long history in international relations. The essay includes many interesting examples and stories that make this part of food philosophy engaging for readers."
15,"Rob Daviau, from the US, creates ‘legacy’ board games. He felt that the traditional board games he played as a child were not exciting or challenging enough, so he began to think about how board games could change. He wondered if they could have a story and if choices made in one game could affect future games. He took a classic game called Risk and made a new version called Risk Legacy. In this game, decisions made during play have lasting effects. Players might have to tear up cards, mark the board, or open packets with new rules at important moments. The game is played over several sessions, and players’ past actions become part of the game’s story. Daviau said, “You could point to the board and say: ‘Right here! You did this!’”

Later, he was asked to work on a legacy version of Pandemic, a very popular cooperative board game where players try to cure diseases. His next project was a game called SeaFall. While Pandemic Legacy was very well received, SeaFall was seen as a true test of the legacy format because it was the first game that did not follow an earlier version. Set in the age of sailing (16th to mid-19th century), players become sailors exploring a new world. Designers of legacy board games must think about all possible player choices to keep the story from falling apart. To do this, they use testers to see how the games will play out. Jaime Barriga, a tester for SeaFall, said, “It takes a lot of time. The first few games might go well, but then after a few more games, it can start to break. Then you have to go back and fix everything.”

Legacy board games were not expected to become very popular. When Daviau was developing the idea, he thought it would appeal to only a small group of people. He said, “I thought it was different and pretty good, but it’s weird and breaks many rules. I thought I would be known as the guy who did this strange project.” However, many players, like Russell Chapman, loved the idea. He believes it is one of the biggest improvements in game design in years. He said, “It’s a new level of commitment, intensity, and excitement. There’s nothing more thrilling for a board gamer than learning a new game, and you get that constantly with legacy games.”

Another fan, Ben Hogg, said that the excitement of an unfolding story was more important than worries about how long the game would last. He mentioned that people usually don’t watch the same movie twice in a row. “You’re buying into an experience,” he said. “It adds a storytelling aspect similar to video games.” The legacy format is inspired not only by video games but also by the popularity of episodic TV shows. While in college, Daviau wanted to be a television writer but later moved into advertising and game design. Still, he loved telling stories. Matt Leacock, the creator of Pandemic, compared the legacy design process to writing a novel. He said, “You need to know how you want it to end and have a good idea of where to start, but you also need more than just an outline.”

Daviau feels proud of his work but is curious to see how others will use the idea. He also thinks that gamers will soon want something new. Colby Dauch, the studio manager for the publisher of SeaFall, is not so sure. He believes the legacy format has changed how people think about board games."
16,"One night not long ago, an octopus named Inky escaped from his tank at New Zealand’s National Aquarium. He crawled across the floor and squeezed into a narrow drain that led to the Pacific Ocean. This story was exciting and was shared widely online. Many people enjoy stories of animals escaping, like those of rats and llamas, because they like to think of animals as being similar to humans. Octopuses are especially interesting because they are very intelligent and look very different from us. They can open jars, recognize faces, use coconut shells for protection, and even play in complex ways.

Some people think that comparing animals to humans is not scientific. However, Dr. Frans de Waal, who studies primates like gorillas and chimpanzees, believes that it is actually unscientific to ignore the human-like qualities of animals. He calls this idea ""anthropodenial."" After studying many years of research on animal intelligence, he shows that animals can do many things that we thought only humans could do, like remembering the past and future, showing empathy, and understanding what others want.

In the past, people believed that animals were smart enough to be put on trial for crimes. Even in the 1800s, many scientists looked for similarities between human and animal intelligence. Charles Darwin, who changed how we see our place in the world, said that the difference between human and animal minds is one of degree, not kind. However, in the 20th century, the focus shifted to seeing animals as simple machines that only respond to rewards and punishments. This view made it hard for people to believe that animals have complex thoughts and feelings.

Dr. de Waal thinks we are starting to change our views about animal intelligence. He believes that we are beginning to see that animal thinking is similar to human thinking, even if they are not the same. He notes that there is a lot of new information about animal intelligence available online. The best tests for animal intelligence consider the unique skills of each species. For example, squirrels may not do well on human memory tests, but they can remember where they hid their nuts.

In her book, The Soul of an Octopus, naturalist Sy Montgomery suggests that if an octopus were to test human intelligence, it might look at how well we can change the colors of our skin. If we failed, the octopus might think we are not very smart. Dr. de Waal is not completely convinced that Inky's escape was a happy ending. He believes it is unlikely that Inky knew how to find the drain to the ocean. However, he understands that stories like Inky's help people appreciate animal intelligence.

He once conducted an experiment to see if capuchin monkeys can feel envy. When some monkeys received cucumbers (which they like) and others received grapes (which they like even more), the monkeys with cucumbers became upset when they saw their friends getting grapes. This study was published in a scientific journal, but what really made people believe the findings was a short video of the experiment released ten years later. This shows how our understanding of animal minds is still developing."

Robotics, once just a part of science fiction, is now becoming a major change in technology, similar to what happened during industrialization. Robots have been used in car manufacturing and other industries for many years, but experts believe we are about to see a big increase in their use in many areas. Many people think that robots will take over most jobs done by humans in the next 50 years. However, about 80% of people also believe their current jobs will still exist in the same way during that time. This shows a common belief that our jobs are safe, but they are not. Every industry will be affected by robots in the coming years.

For example, an Australian company called Fastbrick Robotics has created a robot named Hadrian X that can lay 1,000 bricks in one hour. This job would take two human workers a whole day or more. Another example is a robot called Tally, developed by a startup in San Francisco. Tally moves around supermarkets to check that products are in stock and correctly priced, rather than cleaning the aisles.

Supporters of robotic automation say that robots cannot yet fix or program themselves, which could lead to new, skilled jobs for technicians and programmers. However, critics warn that we should not forget the importance of human skills in the workplace. They believe society is not ready for the changes that will come from reducing human interaction.

Dr. Jing Bing Zhang, an expert in robotics, studies how robots are changing the workforce. His recent report predicts that in two years, nearly one-third of robots will be smarter and able to work safely with humans. In three years, many top companies will have a chief robotics officer, and some governments will create laws about robots. In five years, salaries in the robotics field will rise by at least 60%, but many jobs will remain unfilled because there aren’t enough skilled workers.

Zhang says that automation will affect lower-skilled workers, which is unfortunate. He believes these workers should not wait for the government to protect their jobs but should find ways to retrain themselves. People can no longer expect to do the same job for their entire lives.

At the same time, advances in technology will lead to new types of robots for consumers, such as robots that can walk and interact with us in our homes. This presents a great opportunity for companies, but it also brings challenges, like the need for new rules to keep us safe and protect our privacy.

With many jobs at risk and a global employment crisis approaching, it is important to focus on education to prepare for the future workforce that will include robots. Developed countries need more graduates in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) to stay competitive."
18,"Text: George Mallory, a famous mountaineer, is said to have answered a reporter's question about why he wanted to climb Mount Everest with, ""Because it’s there."" This response reflects a common curiosity: why do people take part in such dangerous activities? Mallory's answer might inspire some to pursue their dreams and face the unknown. It also suggests that the main reason for climbing could simply be for adventure and enjoyment.

In 1967, Bolivian writer Tejada-Flores wrote an important essay called ""Games that Climbers Play."" He identified seven different climbing activities, or ""games,"" ranging from climbing on boulders to scaling high mountains, each with its own rules. He argued that the way climbers approach a climb—like how much equipment they use—depends on the rules of that specific game. Over the years, this idea has become popular in climbing discussions in the West, appearing in climbing magazines and casual conversations.

Many climbers love the feeling of freedom that climbing gives them. However, climbing can also be very limiting. For example, being stuck in a tent during a storm is not what most people think of as freedom. This creates a paradox in climbing. Yet, some argue that having fewer choices can simplify a climber's life, which can also feel like a form of freedom.

When asked ""Why climb?"", US rock climber Joe Fitschen suggests a different question: ""Why do people climb?"" He believes that climbing is part of our nature; humans are built to take on challenges and test their limits, even if it involves risks. Therefore, the joy we find in climbing is more about our biology than logical reasoning.

US academic Brian Treanor also contributed to this discussion. He argues that climbing can help develop important qualities like courage, humility, and respect for nature. While he acknowledges that not all climbers show these qualities, he believes they are especially important in today's risk-averse society. Climbing, then, can have practical benefits by helping people develop traits that allow them to thrive in everyday life.

Another interesting idea is that climbers who do not depend on others or technology must be fully committed to succeed. Expert climbers Ebert and Robinson stirred some debate by claiming that climbs done independently are more challenging and deserve more recognition than those completed with large teams or with the help of tools like bottled oxygen. However, this view may encourage some climbers to take unnecessary risks.

We can also explore climbing outside of the Western perspective. Many climbers report experiences of being fully present, or ""in the zone."" The physical effort of climbing, the focused meditation during a climb, and the intuitive problem-solving involved are all key aspects of the activity. Some argue that climbing techniques are similar to those used in Zen philosophy, which aims to achieve a state of perfect peace. This offers another perspective on why people are drawn to climbing."
19,"Over the past sixty years, pianist Alfred Brendel became a leading figure in classical music. He was known for being serious and intellectual, focusing on important European piano works. Although he wrote and performed a lot, he taught very few students. Those close to him saw a fun side to his personality, but this was rarely shown during his concerts. His life was a constant cycle of studying, traveling, and performing.

About four or five years ago, a young boy named Kit Armstrong approached Brendel after one of his concerts and asked for lessons. At first, Brendel did not take this request seriously. He had very few students and did not see a reason to start teaching now. He quoted another famous pianist, saying, “You don’t hire a mountain guide to teach a child how to walk.” However, he was impressed by Kit, who was around 14 at the time. Brendel listened to him play and thought, “I have to make time for him.” Kit played beautifully from memory, and Brendel recognized his rare talent.

As Brendel steps back from the public eye, Kit is starting to make a name for himself. Brendel is careful, worried that Kit might burn out too quickly. Now 19, Kit is always busy, learning new languages, studying math, writing computer code, or playing tennis, all while his mother keeps a close watch on him. He also composes music. Brendel believes that writing music helps Kit learn to read it better. He noticed Kit has an incredible memory and can read music well. More importantly, Kit listens carefully to his own playing and understands Brendel’s instructions.

Brendel is cautious about raising expectations for Kit. He dislikes when newspapers call Kit the next great pianist of the 21st century, as this can create pressure. He knows that while Kit can play some pieces very well, he still needs time and experience with others. It would be unfair for critics to expect perfection from him.

Now at 80 years old, Brendel shows a softer side in his retirement. He reflects on his youth, saying he never wanted to be famous quickly but hoped to achieve certain goals by the age of 50. When he reached 50, he felt he had accomplished most of those goals but still wanted to do more. Although he no longer has the physical strength to perform, he continues to think about music and enjoys this new phase of his life."
20,"When I was a child, I thought gardens were beautiful places. My grandad’s garden was by a river and sloped gently down to the water. Although you couldn’t reach the river, you could hear the water and the birds in the trees. I believed all gardens were like this – peaceful and a place to escape. 

Grandad’s garden was simple. He didn’t have a fancy greenhouse like some neighbors, who used old window frames and patched them with plastic where the glass was broken. At home, my father was often quiet and reserved. He had a sense of humor and enjoyed using phrases like “It’s immaterial to me,” even though “I don’t mind” would have worked just as well. Deep down, he might have felt disappointed with his life. He left school without qualifications and became a plumber, which he didn’t love. He wasn’t very ambitious, although he and my mother once thought about moving to Canada, but it never happened. 

My father was skilled at home projects. He could build bookshelves or cupboards very well. My parents only moved house once during their marriage, but my mother loved changing the furniture. Just when you got used to one chair, another would appear. The biggest change was when a piano came into the house. I wanted to like it, but it intimidated me. I only liked the two brass candlesticks on it, but my mother said they were too fancy and they disappeared while I was at school. I was never allowed to play the piano; my sister took lessons instead. When I asked my mother why I didn’t get the chance, she simply said, “You’d never have practiced.”

Of the three places to explore – moors, woods, or the river – I always chose the river. I could imagine a different world there. With a fishing net over my shoulder and old sandals on my feet, I would walk along the riverbank looking for a good spot to take off my sandals and search for fish. After some failed attempts to keep the fish alive in the backyard, I returned them to the water.

I wanted to leave school as soon as possible, but it seemed unlikely until one day my father said, “There’s a job for an apprentice gardener in the Parks Department. I thought you might be interested.” In that moment, he surprised me. He might have preferred if I became a carpenter, but I like to think he believed that I could succeed as a gardener. Even though he didn’t like gardening himself, he had seen my enthusiasm for plants and flowers grow over time."
21,"Lawrence MacEwen is crouching down on his Scottish island, the Isle of Muck, and I am doing the same. A strong wind from the Atlantic threatens to blow us off the steep cliff at our feet and into the ocean below. MacEwen’s sheepdog, Tie, comes close, and his owner gently strokes him. Despite the howling wind, MacEwen feels completely at home on his island. 

He shows me around the area. He points to the north and shouts, “That island is Eigg. The one to the west is the Isle of Rum, which gets twice as much rain as we do.” I see dark clouds pouring rain on Rum’s tall mountains. “Just beyond Rum is the island of Soay.” 

Suddenly, MacEwen says, “I have sheep to move,” as rain starts to come our way. We walk down the slopes, and he tells me more about the island: Muck is three kilometers long and one and a half kilometers wide; its geese eat a lot of grass; and the MacEwen family has lived here for 3,000 years. 

While herding the sheep, Tie, the sheepdog, is not doing a good job. “Away to me, Tie. Away to me,” MacEwen calls, meaning the dog should go to the right. Instead, Tie runs straight through the flock, causing confusion. “Tie,” MacEwen says with disappointment. The dog looks ashamed. 

The Isle of Muck is mostly run by the MacEwen family. Lawrence and his wife, Jenny, manage the farm; their son Colin takes care of the island cottages; and their daughter Mary runs the island hotel, Port Mor, with her husband, Toby. Mary and Toby enjoy that their two boys can explore the island and sail small boats during the summer. “They go out the door and come back only when they’re hungry,” Mary says. 

However, life on the island has its challenges. For example, electricity is only available part of the time. On my first evening, I wait for the lights to turn on. The next morning, I see Mary preparing breakfast by flashlight. I also have to deal with no mobile phone service. “You can get reception on the hill,” Mary tells me. “Most people last a couple of days without their phones and then just put them away.” So, I do the same. 

Everything on Muck feels wonderfully surprising. A boat arrives today with groceries and three musicians who come off carrying their instruments. Their concert in the island’s tearoom is a big success, with the islanders tapping their feet to the music. 

That night, sitting by a warm fire while it rains outside, Lawrence tells me how he met Jenny. “Her father saw a small farm on the Isle of Soay in a newspaper and bought it without even visiting. He had never been to Scotland. Jenny was sent to manage it.” Did Jenny know how to run a farm? “She had good typing skills,” he replies. 

I go to bed listening to the rain and wake up to more rain. But I eat well, as almost all my food comes from the island. Mary sends me to fisherman Sandy Mathers for fresh fish. I carry it back through the village and deliver it to Mary at the kitchen door. By 7 pm, our fish is on the table, and it is delicious. 

The next morning, I worry about my ferry ride to the next island. Many ferries had been canceled in the past two months because of rough seas. If my ferry doesn’t come, I would be stuck on Muck for two more days, which, secretly, I would not mind at all."
22,"The game design industry used to be mostly made up of computer scientists and self-taught individuals. It was often seen as just a hobby for young people, but now it is taken seriously. This change may surprise some, but experts in the industry are not surprised. However, getting into this field is not easy. Creating video games based on new movies requires many team members and a lot of skill and hard work.

Jim Donelly, a spokesperson for an online games magazine, explains that it is difficult to make progress in large companies or to influence major games. Still, the industry needs game designers more than ever. This includes not just high-level directors but also those who design specific systems and game elements.

So, how can someone enter this competitive industry? Many companies prefer candidates with a degree in computer science, but Jim believes that the most important thing is to make games. He says, ""You won’t get a job if you haven’t created something."" Game design is more than just a job; it is a way of life that requires creativity and practice.

Another expert, John Field, agrees that while ""just doing it"" is important, it is more complicated than that. Many people want to work in games, but few meet the industry's requirements. It takes creativity, technical skills, vision, and the ability to adapt to changes in the industry.

Can you succeed on your own? John says it is possible but challenging. A good postgraduate course in game design can provide valuable support and guidance. Most game designers start as programmers or artists and work their way up. They are interested in various forms of entertainment and have a passion for the arts and culture. They may have worked for a few years after graduation but have realized that games are their true passion. They are not just fans; they are excited about the future of games and understand the growing variety in the industry.

Networking is also important. Many people overlook this, but making connections can help you advance in the gaming world, just like in other fields.

The stereotype of young boys playing video games has changed. Now, video games attract a wider audience, including families who enjoy interactive consoles. Smartphones have also introduced many new games through apps and social media. John believes there is a lot of potential for growth in this area. ""Games have become popular for larger audiences and are also a great way to learn,"" he says, seeing many opportunities for the future."
23,"Since I was a child, I have always wanted to play football. My dad encouraged me to play, but he never forced me, and I appreciate that. I had a friend whose dad was very demanding. He always told his son what he could and couldn’t do. My friend could have been a good player, but he lost interest in football and hasn’t played since. I’m happy that I didn’t have the same experience, but I know things could have been different.

When I score an amazing goal from far away, people often say it’s just luck, but it’s not. I have practiced taking long shots since I was young. You can only score great goals by practicing. The best players in the world have natural talent, but they also practice for many years. Sometimes, I see young players colliding with each other, but I was taught the right techniques. When I teach kids, I always emphasize the importance of enjoying learning new skills.

At school, I played many sports, from rounders and baseball to athletics and basketball. I know now that a good education is important, but back then, football was my main focus. The teachers were doing a good job, but I didn’t realize it at the time. I want my son to have a different experience. We are already trying to read him books, even though he is too young to sit still for long. I hope that his habit of kicking the books around doesn’t mean he will be like me in that way.

At the start of my professional football career, the manager made sacrifices so that younger players like us could join the first team, but he never made a big deal about it. He didn’t gather us and say, “This is your big chance,” but we all knew we had to prove ourselves. I scored in the first game of the season, but we lost. A well-known TV presenter said, “You can’t win anything with kids.” This made us realize how much we needed to improve. We had some doubts, but we believed in ourselves as a team despite his comments.

I rely a lot on my close friends and family. However, having a lot of money can sometimes create problems. For example, people often ask me why I let my mother keep working. I have helped my parents financially by paying off their house loan and buying them a car last Christmas. My family is strong, and I think they would be upset if they felt they should rely on me completely. My mom doesn’t earn much as a hairdresser, but she loves her job. On the other hand, I enjoy using my money to help those around me.

I have more money than people think, but it doesn’t solve all my problems. After I stop playing football, I plan to take a year off or even longer to do things I haven’t been able to do. I want to go skiing the day after I retire. I can’t do that now because if I were to break a leg while skiing and couldn’t play football again, I wouldn’t be insured."
24,"It was because of Sam Carter that we lived at Reef Point. Sam was my father’s agent in Los Angeles. He offered to help us find a cheap place to live because my father was having a hard time writing there. They did not get along at all, and my father couldn’t write anything sellable. Sam was worried about losing his clients and money.

During the summer, the beach was mostly empty because sea fogs often covered the sun. Reef Point was not a popular spot for day visitors. The road to it was not very inviting, and a nicer resort called La Carmella was nearby. Most people chose to stay there if they had some money. Only those who were broke or really loved surfing would come to Reef Point. But now, with the hot weather, many people were around, and there were lots of activities.

My father was busy every day trying to finish a script by a deadline, and he was in a bad mood. While he worked, I often went to the beach with a book and my dog, Rusty. When we first moved to Reef Point, we didn’t have a dog, but Rusty decided to stay with us. I tried to send him away, but he kept coming back. One morning, I felt sorry for him and gave him some water. My father threw a boot at him, but he didn’t really mean it. Rusty knew this and got closer.

I asked my father, “Who does he belong to? He thinks he belongs to us.” My father replied, “You’re wrong, Jane. He thinks we belong to him.” Rusty loved the beach and liked to dig things up and bring them to me. Sometimes he found things that didn’t belong to him, like a new sneaker or a bright beach towel, and I had to return them to their owners. He also loved to swim and always wanted to join me, even though I could swim much faster. Luckily, he never got discouraged.

That day, after swimming, my father went to Los Angeles to deliver his script. Rusty and I spent the afternoon together in and out of the sea. As the sun began to set, it got cooler, and we watched the surfers. They had been surfing all day and didn’t seem to get tired. One surfer caught my attention. She was very skilled and made the others look clumsy. When she decided to finish for the day, she rode in on a final wave.

“Hi,” she said, “why didn’t you join us?” 
“I don’t have a surfboard.” 
“You could get one.” 
“I don’t have any money.” 
“You’re British, right? Are you visiting?” 
“No, I live here.” 
“Is your father American?” 
“No. He came here to write a film script based on a novel he wrote.” 
“Really? Have I heard of him? What’s his name?” 
“Rufus Marsh.” 
“You mean, Tall as the Morning?” I nodded. 
“I read that book from start to finish.” 

She looked at me with new interest, and I realized that people were friendly but only showed real interest when I mentioned Tall as the Morning."
25,"Violet Hetherington stood in a long line at the Southampton docks, waiting to board the Queen Caroline. The line was outside the ‘Departures’ area, and no one was moving. Her friend Annie, who was experienced in traveling, had told her it was better to arrive late to avoid waiting too long. But this time, Annie's advice was wrong. 

After some time, an announcement came over the loudspeakers saying there was a problem with the computer system. This news made the passengers unhappy. Some tried to stay patient, while others became frustrated. They had paid a lot of money for this cruise, and it was supposed to be a special experience. Violet felt like she had made a mistake by coming on this trip. 

As she searched her bag for her phone, she realized it was missing. This was more frustrating than the long wait. Without her phone, she couldn’t call the taxi company to see if she had left it in the cab, since all her contacts were stored in it. Her son Harry often warned her to be more careful with her things. 

In the line behind her, a friendly couple offered to help. Violet asked to borrow their phone to call Harry. She left a message for him to ask their neighbor, Kristina, to check if her phone was at home. If it wasn’t, she would have trouble finding important numbers in New York. Part of her felt relieved about the missing phone, but she didn’t tell Harry that. He often thought he was wiser than her, while her younger son, Daniel, was more understanding of her mistakes.

Eventually, the line moved, and Violet handed over her travel documents at the boarding window. However, her mood worsened when she entered the ship’s foyer, which looked like a cheap hotel with shiny fake wood, fancy chandeliers, and busy carpets. 

She followed the signs to the elevators, which were crowded with tired passengers. As the lift moved up, it stopped at each floor, letting people out until Violet finally reached the twelfth floor. She was relieved to find that her room had the balcony she had requested. She had worried about what to say if it didn’t. Ignoring Annie’s advice to wait for a better deal, she had decided to pay the highest price she could afford to ensure a nice view of the sea."
26,"When John Maloof bought a box of old photo negatives at an estate auction, he had no idea he was about to discover the mystery of Vivian Maier. Maloof was looking for pictures to include in a book about the Portage Park neighborhood in Chicago, USA. Instead, he found 30,000 images taken by Maier, a street photographer known for her amazing ability to capture interesting moments. Since then, Maloof has built a collection of Maier’s life and work. In his home attic, he keeps her cameras, 2,000 rolls of film, 3,000 prints, and 100,000 negatives, along with many 8mm movies and audiotapes.

One morning, Maloof looked around at all this and realized he was on the edge of something special, which happened by chance. “When I bought all this, I had no idea what it was,” he said. “I could have easily sold it all to someone else.” For a while now, Maloof and his friend Anthony Rydzon have been piecing together details about Maier’s life. They reached out to local families who had hired her as a nanny and spoke with people from the shop where she developed her film.

Maier was born in 1926 in New York and spent much of her childhood in France. In 1951, she returned to New York and moved to Chicago in 1956 to work as a nanny. Maier was a private person who often dressed in large coats, wide-brimmed hats, and sturdy shoes. “On her day off, she would have her camera around her neck and we wouldn’t see her again until late at night,” said Maren Baylaender, whose husband employed Maier to care for his daughter. “She was private but had strong opinions about movies and politics.”

Maier knew a lot about theater and films. Although she was not very social, she would walk the streets with her camera and talk to people, some of whom she interviewed on audiotape. She seemed to be very dedicated to her “second job” of documenting the world around her. “She was a true artist who followed her dreams,” said Rydzon. “Nothing stopped her.”

Maier’s work is a pure form of art; she did not create it for money. Her photos often focus on women, children, the elderly, the poor, and abstract subjects. “What is interesting about Vivian is that she has so many captivating pictures,” said photography expert Larry Silverman. He sees influences from other photographers in her work and wonders if she developed her own style or borrowed ideas from others.

Maloof often thinks about whether he will ever go through all the negatives, which he keeps in three tall, fireproof cabinets. The interesting part is that he had no real interest in photography until he found Maier’s work. Inspired by her architectural photos, Maloof started taking his own pictures. “As I improved as a photographer and revisited her work, I realized that the cityscapes were not what mattered to her. It was the people, the street scenes, and the overall composition,” he said. “There was so much more to her work than I thought, and I realized I was sitting on something more important than I ever imagined. Now our goal is to make her name known and get Vivian Maier into the history books.”"
27,"When a novel is called ambitious, it often means it has not fully succeeded. However, this is not the case with Eleanor Catton’s book, The Luminaries. I interviewed her in the UK when her book was very popular, and she seemed calm, especially for someone in her twenties. She had just arrived from Germany and was flying back to New Zealand the next day. She shared a story about being stopped at passport control and asked to prove she was a writer. She pressed her novel against the glass, and the official asked, “What’s it about?” This is not an easy question for an author.

The Luminaries takes place in New Zealand during the 1860s, where a series of crimes have happened, and a group of 12 men has come together to solve them. The story becomes very complex. Catton intended to write a murder mystery, not a historical novel, but she found that the past allowed for more complications and misunderstandings for her characters. The book is over 800 pages long because she wanted to give each of the 20 main characters a good amount of attention.

When I asked her how it feels to be so successful at a young age, she responded thoughtfully. She said it feels nice coming from a small country because everyone feels part of the success. She received a lot of support from people back home. However, she finds it annoying when people think her book is not a serious philosophical work.

Catton explained that she wanted to write the book in the shape of a spiral, with each part being half the length of the one before it. This means the story speeds up as it goes along. I asked if it matters whether readers notice these patterns. She said she wanted to create a book with structural patterns that readers could discover if they wanted to, but that they were not essential to enjoy the story.

Despite its unique structure, The Luminaries is still an exciting murder mystery with a captivating plot. Surprisingly, Catton did not plan the entire story in advance. She would write herself into difficult situations and then see how creatively she could get out of them. One of her goals was to make the book enjoyable for readers.

We also discussed her love for television dramas, which often have cliff-hangers, different viewpoints, and dialogue. I asked if she would be interested in writing for TV. She said that could be interesting. Her excitement was clear as she talked about her writing and New Zealand. She mentioned that being in a different place changes her imagination and understands why writers leave New Zealand for more populated areas to be around more people. For now, though, New Zealand will remain her home, and I hope it inspires her to write many more novels."
28,"As a boy, Jonny Kinkead spent his time either building things in his dad’s garage or playing the guitar. For the last forty years, he has made a living by handcrafting steel-string acoustic guitars. He says, “I’m still amazed by the guitar. How can two pieces of wood create such beautiful sounds? Different types of wood make different sounds, and that still fascinates me.”

Jonny learned to play his brother’s guitar when he was eleven. At sixteen, he wanted to learn the bass guitar. Instead of saving money for one, he decided to build it himself. He studied how different shapes and types of wood affect sound and how to put them together. Although the bass was the first instrument he built, he and his brothers had been making model boats and planes for a long time. Their father taught them how to use tools, and Jonny had also been fixing instruments for his friends.

Jonny’s bass guitar turned out well, but he didn’t think about making guitars as a career at that time. He was also interested in painting and sculpture. After finishing school, he chose to study architecture at university because it involved design. However, halfway through the course, he dropped out because he felt too different from the others. He realized that guitar-making was a form of sculpture that involved creating sound, and he thought it might be a more practical career than pure art since people actually use the guitars.

Since then, Jonny has made guitars for a living. For the first ten years, he worked part-time cleaning windows to earn extra money. He sold his first guitars for just the cost of materials, but as he became known as a skilled guitar-maker, he could charge more. Even now, almost forty years later, he says he is “still scratching a living.” He can only make about ten guitars a year, which limits his income.

In the early years, Jonny focused on getting his name out there. He attended music festivals on weekends, letting musicians try his guitars and encouraging them to talk about him. He also had to learn how to price his instruments, which was not easy for him.

Jonny believes it is easier for new guitar-makers in the UK today. When he started, many people thought only American-made acoustic guitars were good. UK-made guitars were not seen as valuable, even though there have always been good instrument-making courses in the UK. Now, however, the quality of handmade guitars from the UK is recognized.

Jonny thinks that valuable skills can be learned in classes, and he encourages new instrument-makers to take these courses. However, he also believes that learning through experience is important. He says, “You should look at other instruments, see what works and what doesn’t, and try different things. If you make the back too thin or too thick, the sound won’t be good. If you learn from someone else, you might only learn one method, but if you teach yourself, you learn everything.”"
29,"Any discussion about English conversation usually starts with the weather. Following this tradition, I will mention the famous saying by the 18th-century writer Dr. Johnson: ""When two Englishmen meet, their first talk is of the weather."" This saying is still true today, just as it was over two hundred years ago. However, many people who write about this topic either stop here or try to explain why the English are so interested in the weather, but they often fail. They make a mistake by thinking that when English people talk about the weather, they are genuinely interested in it.

For example, the American writer Bill Bryson points out that English weather is not very exciting. He says that in England, we do not have extreme weather events like tornadoes or monsoons, which are common in other places. Therefore, he finds it strange that the English are so focused on the weather. On the other hand, the English broadcaster Jeremy Paxman disagrees with Bryson. He believes that English weather is interesting because it is unpredictable. He says that while we may not have tropical storms, living on the edge of an ocean means we can never be completely sure about the weather.

I believe that both Bryson and Paxman are missing the main point. Our conversations about the weather are not really about the weather itself. Instead, talking about the weather is a way for English people to connect with each other. For example, when someone says, ""Nice day, isn’t it?"" or ""Ooh, isn’t it cold?"" they are not really asking for information about the weather. These phrases are just polite greetings or ways to start a conversation.

In fact, talking about the weather serves a social purpose, similar to how monkeys groom each other to bond. There are specific situations where weather talk is used. Some people think that English people talk about the weather all the time, but that is not true. There are three main situations for weather talk: as a simple greeting, as a way to start a conversation, or as a fallback topic when there is an awkward silence. 

This means that while it may seem like English people talk about the weather a lot, it is often just a way to keep the conversation going. An English conversation might start with a weather greeting, move to more weather talk to break the ice, and then return to weather talk when the conversation slows down. This is why people from other countries, and even some English writers, think that the English are obsessed with the weather."
30,"Alice Leader was standing in front of Hadrian’s Wall in Britain, explaining to her class of 12- and 13-year-olds how amazing it was that the Romans built a wall that is 120 km long and 5 meters high about 1900 years ago. The students were excited about this trip, choosing it over more popular destinations like Spain, Greece, or France. However, they wanted to know why the wall was built, and Alice felt she didn’t have good answers. Unable to find a historical novel that would help her explain life at the Wall during Roman times, she decided to write one herself.

After teaching for 31 years, Alice started her new career as an author in 2001. She felt nervous but excited about this big change. “Teaching is like acting; it’s a performance every day and very demanding. Writing is thrilling and less tiring. My former colleagues envy me because I still connect with children through my stories,” she said. Alice wants her novels to fill a gap in children’s fiction. “Many young adult books today focus on negative experiences. They are well-written but often dark, or they are complete fantasy, like Harry Potter. My books are different.”

Alice always taught English and History together, using stories like the Tale of Troy to make lessons more interesting. She loves the moment when a child goes from being bored to being interested. “I enjoy having bored children because it challenges me to engage them,” she explained. She sees her writing as a continuation of her teaching. 

The idea to write her first novel came when she realized she would soon have an empty nest as her two sons were leaving home. Her head teacher suggested she take a creative writing course, which surprised her. “I had been teaching for 25 years, and I didn’t want to spend my summer on a course I thought I didn’t need.” Before joining the course, she had to submit a piece of her writing, which she only learned about a few days before it started. “I quickly wrote a story about a Roman couple and their baby-to-be.” After three hours and 30 pages, she sent it in and was accepted.

During the course, her classmates reviewed her work and encouraged her to publish it. With only 8,000 report cards as proof of her writing skills, she asked her head teacher for a year off to write her first novel. Alice’s husband, Zachary Leader, is a critic and editor, and his help was crucial in editing her book. “My mother-in-law thinks we are rival authors, but I believe we work well together. He improves what I write, changing sentences and suggesting better words, while I tend to add more scenes. That’s the difference between a fiction writer and an editor.”"
31,"To raise money for charity, a newspaper and a TV company challenged brothers Jonny and Alistair Brownlee, who are champion triathletes, to compete in a special race. This race would have Jonny racing in a car on the roads, while Alistair would race on a mountain bike across the countryside. The race took place in the beautiful and hilly Yorkshire Dales in northern England. 

As they prepared to start, Jonny expressed his excitement, saying, “I’ve never done anything like this before! These roads have beautiful views, and it’s very cold, so I’ll be warm in the car.” Alistair, dressed in warm cycling clothes, was also eager. He joked about Jonny’s driving skills, saying, “I might just stop for a cup of tea halfway up.”

The race began at Semerwater lake and would finish at Fleet Moss, Yorkshire’s highest road, which is about 350 meters high. While the car could handle the distance easily, Alistair faced a tough start with a steep hill. They quickly shook hands and started the race. Alistair sped off on his bike, while Jonny got into his car and drove away. The big question was who would reach the finish line first.

Jonny’s confidence quickly faded when he encountered a giant tractor blocking the road just 15 seconds into his drive. He complained to the cameraman, “If Alistair beats me, it’s all down to this farmer!” After getting past the tractor, Jonny continued driving, while Alistair struggled with the steep hill. He had to get off his bike and carry it up the slope, passing walls and fences, while sheep watched him curiously.

Finally, Alistair reached the top of the hill. With the sun shining and open land ahead, he started to pick up speed. Meanwhile, Jonny faced more challenges on the narrow roads of the local villages. He had to slow down to get through a very tight corner and a stream on the road. Once he was clear of the last village, he raced straight towards the finish line.

Neither brother knew how close they were to each other. As Jonny sped down the final stretch to Fleet Moss, Alistair was racing across his last field and back onto the road. He pushed hard, and just as he reached the finish line, he slammed on the brakes. Looking up, he asked the crowd, “Is he here?” When they said no, he raised his arms in celebration, shouting, “Yes!”

A few moments later, Jonny arrived in his car and stepped out. “Well done,” he said to Alistair, feeling disappointed. “I’m gutted.”"
32,"The silence is what you notice when you play on Centre Court at Wimbledon. You bounce the ball quietly on the soft grass, toss it up to serve, and hit it, hearing only the echo of your own shots. The well-kept grass, the rich history, the old stadium, the players in white, and the respectful crowds all create a peaceful atmosphere that helps you focus. This silence is good for my game. The hardest part of a tennis match for me is to block out everything except the game and the point I’m playing. When a point ends, the silence is broken by applause, cheers, and people shouting my name. I hear them, but it feels distant. I don’t think about the fifteen thousand people watching me closely or the millions watching around the world as I play Roger Federer in the 2008 Wimbledon final – the biggest match of my life.

I had always dreamed of playing at Wimbledon. My uncle Toni, who has been my coach since I was young, taught me that this is the most important tournament. By the time I was 14, I was sharing my dream with friends that I would play there one day and win. Before 2008, I had played and lost to Federer twice in the finals. The loss in 2006 was not too hard for me; I was just happy to have made it that far. Federer won easily, but I didn’t mind much. However, losing in 2007 was very painful. I knew I could have played better, and it was my mind that let me down. I cried for half an hour in the dressing room after that match. Losing is always hard, but it hurts more when you have a chance to win and you lose it.

Toni, who is usually very tough on me, surprised me by saying there was no reason to cry and that there would be more chances at Wimbledon. I told him he didn’t understand; I felt this was my last chance to win. I know how short a professional athlete's career can be, and I want to make the most of it. Every moment is important, but some moments are more important than others, and I had let a big one slip away in 2007. There was nothing Toni could do to make me feel better. But he was right in the end. Another chance came in 2008, just one year later. I felt confident that I had learned from my previous loss and that this time my mind would be strong. 

The best sign that I was ready was my belief that I would win. The night before the final, at dinner with family, friends, and my team, we didn’t talk about the match. I didn’t tell them not to mention it, but they understood that I was already focused on the game in my mind. From that moment until the match started, that space in my head was mine alone."
33,"In early April 1957, a young and idealistic Englishwoman named Jane Goodall arrived in Africa. In her first letter home, she wrote, ""I am living in the Africa I have always longed for."" She would spend most of her life in Africa, working as a citizen, journalist, scientist, activist, and environmentalist. 

In 1963, Jane became famous when Britain’s National Geographical Society published articles and made documentaries about her research on chimpanzees. Her fame grew with her own writing, including popular children's books and the bestselling book ""In the Shadow of Man,"" which has been translated into 47 languages and is still available today. Jane Goodall is one of the most celebrated female scientists of the 20th century, second only to Marie Curie. However, her fame sometimes overshadows her real achievements.

Many articles and interviews tell her life story, but they often focus on her as a young girl seeking adventure or as a privileged woman who wanted to live with wild animals. These images do not fully represent her important work. Jane Goodall should be recognized as a leading zoologist and a pioneer in her field because of her extensive research and the influence of her students in biological sciences. 

She changed our understanding of chimpanzees, showing that they have social and emotional lives similar to humans. Before her work, people did not know that chimpanzees ate meat or used tools. She discovered that chimpanzees have emotions like ours and that they have unique cultural traditions in their communities across Africa. Her book, ""The Chimpanzees of Gombe,"" published in 1986, is considered the most important work on chimpanzee research.

Jane Goodall's long-term study of wild chimpanzees in Gombe State, Nigeria, is regarded as one of the great scientific achievements of the Western world. She changed how we study animals and how we view ourselves as humans. 

Even as a child, Jane showed signs of her future as a biologist. In the autumn of 1939, when she was just five years old, she disappeared one day. The police and her family searched for her. After a long search, she returned, covered in straw. When her mother asked where she had been, Jane explained that she wanted to know how hens lay eggs. To find out, she had hidden in a henhouse for five hours until a hen laid an egg. This curious nature was an early sign of her future career in biology."
34,"During our first hour-long conversation, Shirley Ford talks to me using the voice of a playful 8-year-old boy, the boy’s tired mother, a funny elderly Scottish woman, and a very fast-talking alien. Her voices are familiar to viewers of children’s TV shows and cartoons, as well as people who have seen computer programs about health and safety. “I just did a voiceover about back injuries,” she says, “so I had to learn how to say many medical terms quickly.” 

Shirley explains what it takes to do voiceovers. “Many actors, even famous ones, think they can do funny voices, and many probably can,” she says. “But there is more to it. You have to bring the script to life for an audience that can’t see you. You wouldn’t believe how many well-known people want to do voiceover work. Producers invite them to auditions because of their fame, but often they don’t get the roles because they are used to acting with their whole bodies.”

After school, Shirley joined a drama course, hoping for a traditional acting career. During the course, she occasionally worked singing jingles for TV ads. “One day,” she says, “the man who ran the recording studio suggested I try out for the voice of a rabbit in a cartoon. It seemed silly – I hadn’t studied drama to play rabbits – but I tried it for fun and surprisingly got a major role.” Shirley discovered she could do voices and that voiceover work might be her path. “Things just happened for me,” she says. “In my second film, I was lucky to play the main character, her brother, and her mother.”

Adult female actors often provide the voices for young boys and girls because their voices are lighter than those of male actors. Hiring child performers involves complicated procedures and many forms, which production companies prefer to avoid. Shirley has learned to create different sounds and collects new voices by watching children’s TV. 

Cartoons are the best part of her job, which also includes educational videos and vacuum cleaner ads. “Those are tough because you have to sound excited about something you don’t care about, but my experience helps,” she says. “I’ve learned that the trick is to smile while you talk – it makes your voice sound bright and cheerful. When I have days doing animation work, it feels like a holiday; interacting with other actors makes a big difference.”

The competition for voiceover work is strong, and having a good showreel – a recording that shows what the artist can do – is very important. “It’s worth investing in a strong showreel,” Shirley says. “There are agencies that help voiceover artists create them.” She believes she has reached the top of her profession through hard work as much as talent. “Whether it’s making your showreel and taking it to film and TV companies, advertising agencies, and recording studios, or just practicing your voices, it’s all about setting goals and not giving up.”

For anyone thinking about a career in voiceovers, Shirley suggests attending “specialist workshops – they cover all types of voiceover.” She also believes a love for human sound is essential, describing herself as obsessed with voices and becoming the characters she performs. “If I’ve been in the studio doing a specific American voice, for example, it can take over me, and I’ll be speaking like that for hours or even days afterwards,” she says. “My children have grown up hearing their mom talk in completely different voices.”"
35,"People often ask me how I became a cartoonist. This is understandable because cartooning is a job many children dream about, like being a race car driver. However, most people eventually give up these childhood dreams and choose more practical careers, like being a tax lawyer or making car parts. The idea that you can earn a living by drawing simple pictures, like those in high school notebooks, seems silly at first. But some people do make a living this way.

Not everyone becomes a cartoonist in the same way, but most have wanted to do it for a long time. For me, I had a typical childhood for a cartoonist. I loved comic strips, contributed to school publications, and was known as ""the kid who draws."" I studied graphic design in college and, after graduating, I showed my illustrations to different companies. I was lucky to find someone at a newspaper who needed political cartoons about local issues. I created some ideas, and they bought them. Soon, I was making enough money to support myself.

You don’t need much to become a cartoonist. You don’t need a university degree, a lot of money, or even to be a great artist. You just need your brain, your hand, and something to draw with. However, if it were that easy, there would be as many cartoonists as there are teachers. While the technical skills needed to be a cartoonist are low, it is still a challenging job. You should only try to become a cartoonist if you feel you cannot do anything else. It is much easier to get a regular job that pays the bills and allows time for family, home repairs, and hobbies.

The more skills you have, the better chance you have of making a living from your art. I have created political cartoons, comic strips, and comic books. I have also worked as a writer, caricaturist, and designer. I take on all kinds of work because you can learn a lot, even from jobs you don’t really want to do. It helps to be intelligent, well-read, and curious about the world.

Now, let’s talk about the business side of being a cartoonist. In the past, many cartoonists could find regular jobs with different newspapers and magazines. But those days are fading. Today, cartooning is often an entrepreneurial activity, which means you not only have to create the work but also sell it. The more comfortable you are with selling, the more successful you will be. I have seen many cartoonists with average creativity but strong business skills do much better than those who are very talented but lack other skills.

It surprises me how often I meet people who have never sold a cartoon but are afraid someone will steal their ideas. Some are so worried that they won’t even let others see their work! Legally, to protect your work, you just need to draw a small ‘c’ for ‘copyright,’ put a circle around it, and write your name and the date next to it. But honestly, it is more likely that no one will be interested in your work. If someone does steal a cartoon and it becomes popular online, it is not a disaster – it could actually be a lucky break!"
36,"Twenty years ago, I was moving to a new house and cleaning out my things. I decided to throw away an electric guitar that my dad had given me for my 16th birthday. It was a nice, black guitar made in Japan. I usually hate getting rid of things, so I was surprised that I wanted to throw this guitar away. I took it to the dump and was about to leave it there when a young man approached me, looking confused. He asked, “You’re not going to throw that away, are you?” I told him I was, and I started to feel regret. He asked if he could take it, and I said yes. After that, I felt sad about my decision for a long time.

A few months ago, I received an email that changed everything. I remembered a story about a man who lost his wedding ring in the ocean and found it years later in a fish he was eating. That’s how I felt when I opened the email from a guitar dealer named Keith Rushton. He told me, “I’ve got your electric guitar.” It had been sold many times since the young man took it from me. Keith found my name and address on a label on the guitar. He realized the information was probably old, but he used my name to find me online. He eventually contacted me through the newspaper I work for and offered to sell it back to me. I was so emotional that I almost cried. I would have paid anything for it, but his price was very fair. I had forgotten that my dad always put name labels on my things, including the guitar. I could imagine my dad laughing at this strange situation.

My parents wanted me to learn classical guitar because it was popular in the 1970s. I loved the sound of it; it was calming and gentle. Unlike the violin, it didn’t sound bad when a beginner played it. But I struggled to improve, so I switched to the electric guitar and played easier songs. This was also the time of punk music, when anyone could be a rock star, even if they weren’t great musicians.

When I opened the box that Keith sent me and took out my old guitar, I suddenly remembered my birthday in 1978 when my parents gave it to me. Holding it again felt amazing; it was smooth and smaller than I remembered. I sat down to play, but then I wanted to stand up and put the strap over my shoulder because that’s how electric guitars are played. My fingers remembered where to go. I couldn’t explain the chords I wanted to play, but my hands just knew what to do. My fingers felt the familiar pain of pressing down the strings to play a chord. 

The electric guitar is not really meant to be played alone. Now that I’m learning it again, I think I should form a band. My son is learning the saxophone, so maybe we can play together. Or perhaps I can find other people my age who have had similar experiences. We could call ourselves “The Regainers!”"
37,"There has been a lot of discussion about sleep recently. When I wrote my book, Insomniac, about people who cannot sleep, I felt like I was one of the few warning others about the dangers of not getting enough sleep. Lack of sleep affects our minds, bodies, and moods. People who struggle with sleep understand how important it is. It is good that sleep is finally getting the attention it deserves. However, I wonder about dreams. I haven’t heard much about them in these discussions. We often lose our dreams when we wake up early. The last hour or two of sleep we miss is mostly REM sleep, which is when we have the most vivid dreams. A good sleeper spends about a quarter of their sleep time in REM. Over a lifetime of 90 years, a person will spend around six or seven years in REM sleep. When researchers prevent people from having REM sleep, they tend to have more REM sleep the next night to make up for it. This suggests that dreams serve a purpose.

When REM sleep was discovered in 1953, many agreed with psychologist Sigmund Freud, who believed that understanding dreams was the best way to understand our minds. However, later research showed that it is not that simple. The focus of dream studies shifted from psychological reasons to physical ones. Currently, there is not much agreement among dream researchers, according to Harvard sleep scientist Robert Stickgold. 

Dreams are important. At a meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Society, P.F. Pagel from the University of Colorado Medical School shared a study showing that actors, writers, and directors remember and use their dreams better than others. He concluded that the use of dreams increases with a person's interest in creativity. It makes sense that filmmakers have a strong connection to their dreams because films are very dream-like. But I wonder if only creative people benefit from their dreams. Don’t teachers, software designers, and politicians also need to think creatively?

Stickgold explains that dreams help us connect ideas in new and surprising ways, using knowledge from our past and present. Dreams may help us discover new patterns and combinations that break our usual ways of thinking. For example, Stickgold found that when people are woken from REM sleep and asked to respond to a word, their answers are more original than when woken from other sleep stages. They come up with unexpected ideas that make sense in a unique way. This is what creativity is about, according to Stickgold. 

I find that I write better after having intense dreams. Even a difficult dream, or one I can barely remember, seems to help me think more clearly. On those days, my ideas come out so quickly that I can hardly keep up with typing. I don’t know exactly how it works, but it does seem to help. Creativity is not just for writers or artists. We live in a complex world, and everyone needs their brains to work well. We all need to think creatively and flexibly in our relationships with colleagues, family, and friends. This is why dreaming is important."
38,"Twenty years ago, Susie Ray moved from London to a small coastal town in south-west England. When you enter her studio, you see a beautiful view of the sea and several empty frames on the walls, along with happy photos of her two daughters. Susie is a well-known copyist artist, skilled at recreating famous paintings from the past. She can copy the rich colors of early 20th-century impressionist art and the detailed work of 16th-century Caravaggio. It’s surprising that she doesn’t keep any of her own work. “I don’t have any of my own around,” Susie says. “As soon as I finish them, they go.” 

Susie is in high demand. Over her 30 years as a copyist, she has painted works by many great artists, including Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh. Her copies are so accurate that art experts sometimes mistake them for the originals. While the original paintings can sell for millions, her copies sell for a few hundred to £12,000, depending on how much time she spends on them. Susie doesn’t reveal most of her clients, but they include galleries and private collectors. Some collectors are true art lovers, but others are more interested in status. One famous buyer likes to show off his “Van Gogh” painting, which is actually a copy by Susie. “Many famous people pass off my copies as originals,” she says. “That’s their choice.” Some collectors keep the original in a bank safe and display Susie’s copy instead to save on insurance.

Susie is honest about her work. When she copies a masterpiece, she tries to make it look as real as possible because she believes it’s important to respect the original artist. However, she always signs her name on the back of the canvas. Selling a copy as the real thing is illegal, and even though she knows people who have done that, she has never been tempted. Those who make fake art often get into trouble. Susie admits she isn’t rich and has faced challenges, but her situation is better now, and she doesn’t want to risk her reputation.

Before becoming a copyist, Susie worked as an illustrator for a botanical garden after earning her art degree. She earned very little money during that time, but it helped her develop her skills and love for plants. She learned to be very precise and to get things right on the first try. She has no regrets about that job, but she is happy to have found something more financially rewarding.

When younger artists ask Susie for advice, she emphasizes the importance of learning to draw accurately. She has studied a lot to reach her level of skill. She can draw plants, create perfect copies of 15th-century art, and reproduce 20th-century abstract art, but she now focuses on French impressionists, especially Manet, Cezanne, and Degas. Susie believes many people think modern art is easy, but she explains that impressionists painted quickly and freely while also being very careful, which makes it challenging to replicate.

Given her talent, it seems strange that Susie doesn’t create her own original art. Isn’t art about self-expression? Couldn’t a Susie Ray original be worth more than a copy? She explains that her work is the result of years of training and hard work, and she earns a good living from it. She has tried to create her own art, like oil paintings of fishing nets, but they ended up looking like photographs—fine, but not better than that. It’s like living on simple food after enjoying meals from a top chef. Susie is a perfectionist, and that drives her work."
39,"During her racing career, Ellen MacArthur cared most about the sea and being the fastest on it. Since she was a child, sailing had been her great passion. She felt a strong connection with the boats that took her around the world; they worked together as one. When she returned to land, everyday life felt unimportant. People would ask her about the race, but she quickly wanted to be back on the ocean, challenging nature, even in places that had almost defeated her.

After finishing second in the Vendée Globe, a solo round-the-world race, she showed me the small, stuffy cabin of her boat, Kingfisher. This was her home, workplace, and survival space for 94 days. She explained how carefully she planned everything, even counting the exact number of kitchen paper rolls she would need. Preparation was crucial for her. She proudly displayed her unappetizing stock of foil-wrapped, freeze-dried food, a small gas stove, and neatly organized medical supplies. Her ability to keep the boat clean was as impressive as her sailing skills. The boat was her entire world, and she took care of it because her life depended on it.

Now, Ellen views the world as a boat: a small, beautiful, and fragile thing with limited resources. A key moment for her was a trip to South Georgia, a remote island in the South Atlantic, where she helped with a bird survey on albatrosses. This experience made her reflect and see things differently. The many abandoned whaling stations served as a warning to her. She felt that humans often take what they want and move on without thinking.

When I visited Ellen's office, she was finishing a heated conference call. She explained why we need to act now to protect the planet. ""We are not making more coal, oil, or gas. They are valuable resources we have only once. We need to find ways to use them wisely."" Initially, her message was negative—encouraging people to use less—but she later realized there was a more positive approach. Now, she focuses on reusing materials, like reusable industrial carpet tiles.

For the past three years, she has been visiting factories, mines, and power stations, discussing our dependence on non-renewable resources with government and business leaders. ""I will never be an expert,"" she says, ""but I love learning. I couldn't ignore the current situation. Compared to sailing, this feels much more important. It’s about finding how my voice can be most helpful.""

Ellen also started the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a charity that helps young people rethink and design a sustainable future through business and education. ""I do miss the adventure of being at sea,"" she admits. ""It defines who I am. You feel connected to everything around you, and you don’t have time to feel lonely. You focus on records, practical matters, and survival. My new message is not as simple as saying, 'I want to be the fastest around the world.' I may have been the fastest, but this work is more meaningful than anything I’ve ever done."""
40,"Jordan Romero is 13 years old and wants to be the youngest person to climb Mount Everest. If he succeeds, he could become very famous. He hopes to inspire other young people to explore the outdoors instead of just playing on computers and video games. Jordan's climbing team includes his father, Paul, and his mother, Karen. They call themselves ""Team Romero."" Climbing Everest is just one part of their goal. If Jordan climbs Everest and Vinson Massif in Antarctica, he will be the youngest person to climb the Seven Summits, which are the highest mountains on each continent. Very few people achieve this before they turn thirty. Jordan has already climbed five of these mountains and might finish before he becomes a teenager.

I spoke to several experienced Everest climbers, and none of them thought it was a good idea to take a 13-year-old up the highest mountain in the world. They agreed that Jordan might be physically strong enough, but they were unsure if he had the emotional strength needed. They also questioned whether he had enough experience to make good decisions while climbing safely.

The Romero family has heard these opinions before. Paul says, ""I know there is criticism, but I can’t focus on it – we have a lot to do. We think about the risks, but we believe our experience as climbers will help us. Watching Jordan grow gives me confidence. He is getting stronger and more mature."" 

I also wonder about Jordan’s reasons for wanting to climb. Is it just his father's ambition? Paul insists, ""This project isn’t about me trying to become famous through my son. At first, Jordan thought about doing this later in life, but we decided, ‘Why not now?’ We talk to him often to make sure he still wants to do it.""

When I ask Jordan what he enjoys about this challenge, he says, ""I just focus on achieving my goal."" In the past, not many people cared about being the youngest or fastest to climb a mountain or sail an ocean. Today, every adventure is shared online, and every climb is seen as a chance to break records. This creates a challenge for Jordan. While some people think that focusing on achievements takes away from the enjoyment of climbing, if Jordan wants to inspire others, he needs to engage with the media. This means blogging, taking photos, and giving interviews. He needs to do something impressive, like climbing Everest.

Paul adds, ""If Jordan comes home tomorrow and says he wants to stop climbing and play basketball instead, we will end this project and go to the gym."""
41,"When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, it’s likely they are not listening to classical music. Most people can name many pop groups, but if you ask my friends about Brahms, they usually don’t know who he is. I just started studying music, but my classmates know as little about classical music as other teenagers do. If you don’t know who created the music, you probably don’t own any of their recordings. This is sad for classical music fans. Last year, only 3% of concert tickets sold were for classical music, and the average classical album sells only 300 copies. It’s hard to believe.

So, why is interest in classical music declining? Older people often blame our love for TV and video games, but I don’t think that’s the reason. The truth is that classical music doesn’t attract most people, especially teenagers, who are the main buyers of music and concert tickets. I know some teenagers who enjoy classical concerts, but they are few. Even though I play in an orchestra, I’m not a big fan of classical music. I like many styles, but my classical music collection is probably close to that 3% figure.

Why don’t teenagers like classical music? First, the pace and rhythm of classical music, with its many mood changes, can be hard for us. We prefer fast talking, playing, and thinking. Experts say we can only pay attention for about three minutes, which is too short for most classical pieces but just right for pop songs. Pop music is simple and easy to listen to, while understanding classical music takes time and focus. Also, pop music often talks about issues that matter to teenagers, while classical music usually does not.

The way we listen to music has changed too. In the past, families would play music together at home, and playing an instrument was important. Now, you can find any music online, but classical music is rarely part of our daily lives. When was the last time you heard classical music in a store? One of my teachers says that more people are attending classical concerts now, but I doubt many of them are teenagers. In my orchestra, we play classical music in many places, but when I look at the audience, I mostly see older people. I don’t know why middle-aged people like classical concerts more, but I do know that if your parents love something, you might want to avoid it.

Some people say schools are to blame for teenagers’ lack of interest in classical music, but many kids are excited to play classical music in their school orchestras. They come early to practice and stay late to rehearse. They enjoy classical music when they perform, but it’s not their favorite music otherwise. The two activities have become separate. When we want to relax, we usually choose pop music."
42,"Bonnie Wyndham got out of her mother’s car and looked at Almonside School. “I’ll make you sorry I’ve come here,” she said with a smile. Her mother was getting out of the other side, so she didn’t hear Bonnie, but Bonnie didn’t mind. Her mother already knew how she felt. Mrs. Wyndham looked around. Almonside was a strange school, with buildings hidden among the trees on a hillside; it looked confusing at first. Then she saw signs: Science block, gymnasium, riding centre… “Riding centre,” Bonnie said, suddenly interested. “Headmaster’s study,” her mother replied. “This way.” Bonnie followed her mother along a wide path between the trees. “I wish you’d walk beside me instead of following me like a dog,” Mrs. Wyndham said tiredly, but she didn’t expect Bonnie to do so.

A few minutes later, her mother was talking to Bonnie’s new headmaster in his study, while Bonnie waited outside the door. Suddenly, Bonnie stood up. “Why should I just sit here?” she thought. “I’ll be thrown out soon anyway, so why not get it over with?” She left the building and went to the riding centre, following the sign. There was a nice old building for the horses and a large indoor riding area. Bonnie looked around, but there was no one there. She approached the horses with respect. They were well cared for, and she could see that right away. Almost every stall was occupied, and she walked along, looking closely at each horse. “I know what you’re doing here,” she said to a small pony, gently touching its nose. 

Then she saw the next horse and stopped. “But aren’t you the best of the lot!” she exclaimed. He was brown with a bit of white. He looked lively, which Bonnie liked. “I feel like we’ve met before,” she said, stroking his neck. Above the stall was his name: Maverick. She suddenly wanted to ride him. “I wonder where I can find a bridle and a saddle. They can’t be far away.” Bonnie was happy to find that the room with the riding equipment was unlocked. While she was busy putting a saddle on Maverick, she forgot all about her mother and the headmaster. 

When she finally sat on the big horse outside, she felt like a queen, in control of everything she could see. Her nickname at her old school had been Queen Bee, and she laughed as she remembered it. “You’re the best horse I’ve ever ridden, Maverick,” she said with admiration. “I really mean it because I know about horses, even if I don’t know much else.” She nudged him to walk, then to trot. “If I stay here, I think you and I could be great friends,” she said. She rode around the paddock, feeling the rhythm of the movement and the breeze on her face. She could tell Maverick trusted her, and she felt sure he would jump well."
43,"I have met Cody Simpson before, and I have always been impressed by his quiet confidence. The 15-year-old from Australia has already released many successful songs. So, how did a relaxed surfer end up performing in front of thousands of fans? Cody explains, “I first picked up a guitar when I was six and started writing songs at seven.” He remembers that swimming and surfing were more important to him at that time. “I was 13 and in high school when I posted a few videos online,” he says.

These videos changed everything. He started by sharing a video of himself and a friend singing at a school concert. Fans began to comment online, asking for more videos. Cody, who had recorded more songs at home, was happy to share them. The response was amazing. 

Cody was also a talented swimmer. He trained hard with great coaches and focused on his sport. But then record labels showed interest in him, and he faced a tough choice: stay in Australia and keep swimming or take a big risk by signing a deal and moving with his family to the US. Cody decided to take the chance. “It was very hard for me, especially at such a young age, to choose a career. Can you imagine being 12 or 13 and trying to decide what you want to do for the rest of your life?” He had to tell his swimming coach and friends that he was moving to America. “It surprised most people. I’m kind of the quiet kid,” he recalls, remembering their shocked faces. “I’m very modest, and I think it’s important to stay that way in this crazy industry.”

So, Cody packed his bags and moved with his family to the other side of the world, giving up one dream to chase another. Although his family stays out of the spotlight and is not directly involved in his career, they support him from behind the scenes. Cody believes it’s important to have a close group of good people around you to stay grounded.

Of course, everyone has moments of doubt. “Sometimes when I’m alone, I think, ‘How does my decision affect my little brother and sister?’ My little brother is eight years old, traveling the world and doing school on the road; he doesn’t have a normal life,” Cody admits. “I worry about how this affects him, but my family always reassures me that they support me in everything I do.”

Success in any career comes from being willing to say ‘yes’ to your big opportunity, even if it feels scary. “Everything happened so fast and unexpectedly,” Cody says. “Now, I’m visiting countries I never thought I would see and performing in front of hundreds of thousands of fans. It’s something many people dream of and try to achieve. But I know it won’t last forever.”"
44,"I jumped out of bed, pulled back a corner of the bedroom curtain, and looked down at the river. A new crack in the ice sparkled in the morning sun. I shaded my eyes and looked upstream at the sandbags that were there to stop the buildings from flooding as the ice melted. My back still hurt from lifting the sandbags last week. I had worked long hours with most of the adults in town to help. My grandfather didn’t seem to notice my efforts. 

With one hand on the curtain, I looked at the stretch of dark water created by the release pipe from the wood factory in Milltown. There were fragile ice shelves on both sides, and solid ice further down the river. As I took off my pajamas and put on my kayaking wetsuit, I saw a boy on the other side of the river. I didn’t know him. He was trying to balance on an ice shelf near the warm water from the factory. I zipped up my wetsuit and grabbed my kayaking jacket. I checked the pocket for my lucky silver chain, which my famous grandfather brought back from South America. Only my grandfather, my mom, and I know about this chain. I also have his diary from that trip, which I keep under my pillow and read before I sleep. I touched the chain again and went to the kitchen.

“Good morning, Rex,” my mom said with a smile as I took a banana from the counter. “You’re up early for a Saturday. I’ll make brunch after your training. Be careful.” 

“Thanks, Mom.” I walked down the hallway and almost bumped into my tall grandfather as he came out of his room. 

“Can’t you watch where you’re going?” he shouted. “Where are you going?” 

“Sorry, Grandpa. I’m going kayaking.” It was obvious from my wetsuit, and he had seen me kayak every morning. I tried to ignore his anger, but it was getting harder. 

“What’s the point of training? You didn’t win the competition,” he said. His words hurt, but I took a deep breath and counted to three. He walked away and slammed the bathroom door. My mom came over with a sympathetic smile. 

“Don’t mind him. He’s…” 

“...not himself right now,” I finished for her. I wanted to say he had always been like this, but I tried to be kind to him. When I was younger, he was my hero. He showed me photos of himself in National Geographic magazine, and those old photos still hang on his wall with his medals and trophies. But I don’t go into his room anymore. I have my own trophies to look at, and maybe one day, my own picture in National Geographic. Still, a part of me wants to stay loyal to him, even though he is grumpy.

My mom smiled. “At least he’s coming out of his room more. Have a good training session, Rex. I admire your determination to keep going, even in this cold weather!” 

I smiled back as I peeled my banana. “It’ll be warmer in South America if I find sponsors for my expedition.” She laughed and went back to the kitchen. I finished my banana and went downstairs. Stepping into the backyard, I hurried to the boathouse."
45,"Mum grabbed Jess by the arm. ""Come with me,"" she said. Jess followed her into the study. On the table, leaning against the wall, was an unframed painting. It was clearly one of Grandpa's works, but it looked different from his usual style and was obviously unfinished. 

""Do you know anything about this?"" Mum asked. Jess shook her head. ""I've never seen it before. I didn't know he was working on anything."" She looked closely at the painting. It showed a river that took up most of the picture; it was not a river she recognized and might not even be real, just a fantasy. The painting was strange and beautiful in a haunting way. The riverbank was barely visible, with just a hint of green that was easy to miss, drawing the eye into the pale water and towards a hidden sea. There were no animals, birds, or people in the painting, and it felt right that way. It seemed like there was no place for living things in this distant scene. Still, she found it fascinating, thinking about autumn coming after a long summer.

Mum spoke again. ""It has a name."" There was something in her voice that showed her excitement, but Jess noticed it was also a bit distant. Jess understood why. Grandpa never named his paintings. He just painted them and let others figure them out. Mum turned the painting over and pointed to the words Grandpa had written. Jess read them aloud: ""River Boy."" The words felt strangely important to her, but she didn't know why. 

Then she noticed something else. She looked at Mum. ""There is no boy."" 

""Exactly. It's strange, isn't it? For him to be so specific. But maybe he will add the boy later since he hasn't finished it yet. I made the mistake of asking him about it.""

""Mum! You should have known better.""

""I know, but I couldn't help it. It's such an unusual painting, especially with a name. You can guess what he said.""

Jess didn't need to guess. She knew Grandpa's response. ""He told you it's not the artist's job to explain a painting because each one has its own life and language, just like a poem. We either understand it or we don't. And he said painting is hard enough without having to explain it to everyone...""

""… every ignoramus,"" Jess added.

""Right. He said if artists had to explain their work to everyone who asked, they would never get anything done. And he said...""

Mum interrupted, laughing. ""Something like that. Anyway, I was hoping you might know something about this painting since you seem to inspire him.""

""Inspire?"" Jess asked.

""Yes, someone who motivates an artist."" Jess understood the word. Grandpa often used it when she watched him paint, but he usually meant that the muse wasn't helping him that day or that he needed to be nice to the muse because he had a tough part to work on. He never suggested that the muse was her. In fact, she always thought he meant some kind of goddess, not a real person. It was hard to imagine anyone, even a goddess, influencing someone as strong-willed as Grandpa. 

""He doesn't need me to inspire him,"" she said. ""He's been painting all his life."""
46,"When I woke up this morning, I didn’t plan to cut a hole in my bedroom carpet. I’m not saying it was an accident, but it could have been. For example, if I had tripped over the bed with Dad’s Stanley knife in my hand, the blade might have gone into the carpet and made a big hole. I’m not saying that happened, just that it could have. I didn’t wake up thinking, “Today I will cut a hole in my carpet.” It just seemed like a good idea at the moment, as things often do. Later, I wondered why I thought that, but by then it was too late. This happens to me quite often. 

What I was really trying to do was find a way to fit my corner cabinet into a corner. Gran gave me the cabinet when she moved to a flat. It’s very cute! It’s small, painted white, with pink and blue flowers around the edge, and it has tiny glass doors. Gran used to keep china ornaments in it, like shepherdesses and old-fashioned ladies. Now, I keep my collection of shells and interesting stones there. Gran knew I loved her corner cabinet, and I was so happy when she gave it to me!

The problem is, it is a corner cabinet, which means it has to fit in a corner. I only have two corners in my bedroom because it’s the smallest room in the house, shaped like a wedge of cheese. The big front bedroom is for Mum and Dad, the back one is my sister Angela’s, the little one over the garage is my brother Tom’s, and my room is the size of a broom cupboard. Mum says when Angela goes to university, Tom can have her room, and I can have his. When Tom goes to university, I can choose any room. But since Angela is only fifteen, I think I will be stuck in my small room for a long time. 

I don’t really mind; I like my little bedroom. It’s cozy, like a nest. I love the sloping roof and the window at floor level. The only problem is the lack of corners! My bed is in one corner, and my wardrobe is in the other. I tried to fit Gran’s cabinet into the space between the roof and the floor, but it was just a little too tall. Then I thought, if I can’t cut anything off the cabinet, why not cut a hole in the carpet? It seemed like the obvious solution. Dad calls this “lateral thinking.” I thought he would be pleased with me because he always tells us to “think outside the box.” And that’s exactly what I was doing!"
47,"The novel ""The Borrowers"" tells the story of a family of tiny people who live secretly in the walls and floors of a house. They ""borrow"" things from normal-sized people to survive. When I was asked to direct a TV version of the book, I knew it would be difficult to meet people's expectations. Fans of the book have strong opinions about how it should be done. I used the original drawings from the book a lot because I wanted to avoid criticism from fans.

The author wanted the series to show the story from the Borrowers' point of view, not from the humans'. This made filming more complicated. The most important thing was to get the size right. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans, so when we filmed them walking across a room or going on their borrowing missions, we had to be ten times further away than usual. The crew had to crawl on the ground and film from no higher than 15 centimeters to capture the Borrowers' perspective, which meant they went through many pairs of jeans!

We only raised the cameras for aerial shots. One big challenge was to create the right shadows when combining the tiny Borrowers with the normal-sized background. We developed a special technique for this. After the series aired, famous director George Lucas called to ask how we did it. The only permanent set we built was the Borrowers' home under the floor, filled with giant objects to make the actors look small. It was very surreal. When I asked the actors to carry giant items like oversized scissors, they really got into it. I remember the coins being bigger than dinner plates and hard to lift, which often made the crew laugh.

In the story, there is a scene where the Borrowers are swept down a drain. To film this, the actors had to go down a tunnel with hoses, and they found it so scary that they didn’t need to act. I also wanted to get the costumes right, which has been a problem in other TV versions. I had the costumes made from heavy canvas so they looked like doll clothes. This made it hard for the lead actress to move; she couldn’t sit down during breaks and had to be sewn into her dress every morning. The lead actor's trousers were made from a rug because normal fabric would have looked too smooth. Unfortunately, it was very hot during filming, and I don’t think they appreciated my attention to detail!

Most of the action away from the Borrowers' home was filmed with the actors in front of a blue screen on an empty set. It was challenging for them to react to things that weren’t really there. I had to draw pictures of every scene to show how they should look, and by the end, I had done 2,000 drawings. They weren’t perfect, but they worked. We didn’t have enough budget for special effects studios during the day, so I worked nights for three months. We had to work quickly; I once filmed a whole scene before realizing there was no film in the camera. But in the end, everything came together, and I think the series successfully captured the magic of the books."
48,"Mom stops the car at the corner of my new school, Palm Grove High School. She looks around nervously, expecting to see journalists, but there are none. I know that soon, things will get crazy. There will be fake smiles, people pretending to be my friends, and requests for free concert tickets from my dad. “Everything will be fine,” I tell her. She kisses her fingertip and touches my cheek before I get out of the car. Then she drives away, leaving me alone in this new school and situation. But this is what I wanted. I wanted to escape my old life of touring and private tutors. While the rest of the band is here for recording, we are staying for good. I wanted to come to this school to meet real kids. I imagined kids with normal parents, like a mom who works in an office or a dad who mows lawns. That would be so cool and normal.

I walk into the school office. “Hi, I need my schedule, please,” I say to the secretary. “Name?” she asks, looking unfriendly. “Desert McGraw.” “Desirée?” she asks, leaning closer. “Desert,” I repeat. The secretary looks confused. “Oh,” she says, typing my last name on her computer. That’s good because not many people recognize my last name since my dad uses a stage name. “What grade?” she asks. “Eleventh.” “One second, it’s printing,” she replies. Then she hands me my schedule. English Literature is my first class. Great! I like English. But I will be late because it’s in Room 214 on the second floor. I studied the map last night so I wouldn’t look lost.

When I reach the door, I hear the teacher calling names. “Aurelio Gonzalez.” “Here.” I slip in quietly and sit at the back of the class. The girl next to me smiles and looks at my outfit—just jeans and a T-shirt. “Nice shoes,” she whispers. I look down at my fancy shoes with flowers. Oh no, I shouldn’t have worn these. “Thanks,” I say. The teacher pauses and calls my name, “Desert... McGraw?” “Here,” I reply. The teacher, Ms. Smigla, smiles and talks a lot. She gives us our course outlines and tells us about the books we will read this year. Then she lets us socialize, which is great.

“So why did you move here?” my new friend asks. I have a few options for my answer. Should I say I wanted a normal life away from cameras and reporters? Or should I say what my dad thinks? He said, “We need a change, Desert, and this is the perfect place to record the new album. Energy, color, culture... just what our last album needed.” I think he just wants to relax at the beach. Why else would they choose a studio so close to the sand? “My dad had to relocate,” I tell her. Yes, it’s easier to lie. “What does he do?” she asks. I know everyone will find out eventually, but I want some time to pretend to be normal. “He’s an artist,” I say, playing with my backpack zipper. “Cool. I’m Becca, by the way.” She doesn’t seem to care much. That’s good."
49,"Not only is the average American teenage girl expected to be the president of the Student Council, but she also needs to have a part-time job, volunteer, and do well in all these areas. This is what it means to be a teenager in America today. Boys and girls cannot just go to school and be average; being average is not enough anymore. People think that not having big ambitions is a sign of laziness. 

Kristen Loose, a teenager, says, “Adults often forget how much pressure we have. We have a lot of homework, tests, after-school activities, jobs, chores, and responsibilities at home, all while trying to have a social life.” Even though these stresses are normal for teenagers today, negative stereotypes still exist. Many people in the media describe teenagers as lazy, disrespectful, rebellious, loud, reckless, and self-centered. While some of these traits may be true for a few, many believe it is unfair to label all teenagers this way.

Kristen Loose thinks that many people wrongly assume teenagers spend most of their time watching TV or using their phones. She admits she often has her phone nearby, but she uses it for important things, not just for fun. For teenagers, their phones are tools that help them manage their lives. They are expected to have quick access to information and to be reachable at all times, which can make it seem like they are addicted to their phones. With smartphones, tablets, and social media, students can do their homework anywhere, and schoolwork now requires their attention all day and night.

Many teenagers start their days around 6 a.m. or 7 a.m. and often finish their activities after midnight. Their days are filled with school, after-school activities, family responsibilities, and homework. They often get less than the recommended nine hours of sleep each night. A survey by the US National Sleep Foundation found that only about 20 percent of teenagers get enough sleep. Additionally, 28 percent of teens said they fall asleep in school about once a week because they are too tired.

Teenager Lindamarie Olsen believes that after all her activities, she has about 18 hours of free time each week. With 168 hours in a week, 18 hours is not much. Olsen does not spend her free time on social media or watching TV; instead, she focuses on volunteering. She says, “People think teenagers only care about themselves, but my favorite part of the week is volunteering. I love helping others and making a positive impact in my school and community.”

In 20 years, the stereotype of teenagers may change, but they will continue to challenge these ideas and make a difference in the world. There will always be new generations of students who are making their mark before they even finish school."
50,"The teenage members of the Earth to Sky Calculus Club live in Bishop, a mountain town in the US, surrounded by wilderness east of the Sierra Nevada mountains. In recent years, this group has launched over fifty balloons to the edge of space, about 35 km above the Earth. This project combines science and adventure, which is likely why teenagers want to join. I visited them one weekend in late spring as they prepared to release a high-altitude balloon to record shooting stars. Shooting stars happen when a rock or piece of metal from space enters the Earth's atmosphere, creating a bright trail of light.

As it got dark, the teenagers attached a soft insulated lunch box to the bottom of the balloon. Inside the box were a camera, an instrument to measure altitude, and a thermometer to check temperature changes during the ascent. They also placed two GPS trackers on the outside of the lunch box to help find it later. A gas tank, donated by a supporter from another state, was used to inflate the balloon, which grew to the size of a small car. An older boy made a seven-hour trip to get the gas tank, but he didn’t mind. For these kids, that’s just part of the experience.

Finally, it was time for lift-off. They counted down, “Five, four, three, two, one,” and the balloon started to rise. Some of the teenagers ran after it with flashlights, trying to keep it in sight as it floated into the dark sky. There was a quiet moment filled with wonder before the balloon disappeared.

After the launch, most students went home, but a few stayed to watch the shooting stars. They lay on blankets on the mountainside, looking at the clear sky, which was surprising so close to the busy city of Los Angeles. I saw a boy climb into a sleeping bag and quickly fall asleep. One girl whispered, “We’re the only ones talking.” Another girl replied, “I know.” Suddenly, a meteor shot across the sky.

As the balloon rose, the air pressure decreased, causing it to expand until it popped with a loud bang. A parachute helped the lunch box land safely back on Earth. The students planned to find it the next day using the GPS trackers. Retrieving it was not easy, but that was part of the fun. There is little inhabited land around Bishop, so the lunch box usually lands in remote areas. The group’s leader said, “Recoveries are a big part of the program.” They had only lost two lunch boxes in 53 launches. He added that this experience helps them learn about the landscape in a way they wouldn’t normally.

On this occasion, the lunch box landed 84 km west of Bishop. To reach it, the recovery team had to drive south of the Sierra and then back up the western side of the mountains. They had to decide whether to drive or walk, as it could be dangerous if the lunch box landed on a high peak or in a tall tree. The leader noted that these students are familiar with the Eastern Sierra, so what seems wild to some is just a normal part of life for them.

In the end, it took them 11 hours to find the lunch box. It was in a canyon, on a flat rock, near a waterfall. Unfortunately, the camera did not capture any shooting stars. While this was disappointing, it gave them a chance to discuss atmospheric waves and how they might behave above mountains. It also became another exciting story to share with anyone who asked."
51,"Chloe Morgan admits that she was not very interested in science, especially Palaeontology, until she was fifteen. Her interest began by chance when her younger brother was excited about dinosaurs, a phase many children go through. Although she had ignored this interest before, she helped him with a science project and found an article about recent discoveries in Palaeontology that amazed her. She realized she wanted to pursue this field.

Chloe recalls meeting her first professional palaeontologist, Matt Cornelius, who was already well-known despite being young. She felt nervous at first, worried he might think she was just an annoying kid. However, she felt more comfortable when he showed patience and listened to her questions.

When discussing how palaeontologists are shown in movies and TV shows, Chloe expresses her frustration. She acknowledges that films like Jurassic Park have increased public interest in dinosaurs, but they often misrepresent palaeontologists. She feels they are usually portrayed as either strange geniuses or socially awkward people, which does not reflect the reality of their work.

Chloe explains that her job is very diverse. She spends time digging up dinosaur bones, working in laboratories to analyze fossils, and writing scientific articles. Although it is not her main job, she also believes it is important to communicate scientific findings to the public, especially to young people. She wants to inspire them to learn about science and the natural world, starting with dinosaurs.

Chloe was involved in the TV documentary Walking with Dinosaurs, where she helped ensure the accuracy of how dinosaurs were portrayed. She found it easy to work on the project because there were few mistakes to correct. The documentary attracted viewers of all ages and presented dinosaurs in a way that was more realistic than in movies like Jurassic Park.

Chloe believes that dinosaurs continue to fascinate us because they represent the explorer in all of us. They spark our imagination and the desire for discovery. In a world that feels smaller, dinosaurs remind us that there is still much to learn, and Palaeontology allows us to explore the past."
52,"When you travel by car with your family, even if you are six years old, you probably know that you are not “there yet,” even if you keep asking, “Are we there yet?” The truth is, once you arrive, it’s not “there” anymore; it’s “here.” So if you think you might be “there,” you should really be asking, “Are we here yet?” 

I’m sure no one wants to be “there” more than the parents who hear that question over and over on long trips. Think about it: wouldn’t you rather relax in the back seat, with nothing to do? You could watch DVDs, listen to music, or do puzzles while enjoying the beautiful views outside the window. Meanwhile, one of your parents is in the front seat, giving out juice boxes and cookies, changing the radio, and making sure everything goes smoothly.

But then, something can happen that ruins the peace. In my case, it’s usually my younger brother, Tim. He might put his foot on my side of the seat. I can’t let that happen, so I put my foot on his side. Soon, he’s all over my space, and a fight starts. Our parents have to reach back to separate us while driving, telling Tim to stay in his own seat. This calms things down for a bit, and we can enjoy the scenery again.

Later, when I’m trying to read, I feel a draft on my arm. The window isn’t open, so where is it coming from? Tim is next to me, quietly blowing air in my direction. He’s not touching me, so he thinks he’s being clever. This makes me angry, and soon he gets yelled at again, causing more chaos in the car. 

Over the years, Dad has come up with ways to handle us in the back seat. When we ask, “Are we there yet?” he often says, “Yes, we’re here. Get out of the car.” But when we point out that we are still on the highway, he replies, “Oh, then maybe we’re not there yet.” This usually keeps us quiet for a while. 

You can tell when you finally arrive because the adults quickly get out of the car and move away from the kids who have bothered them for hours. So remember: if your parents are still close enough to answer your question, the answer is no, you are not there yet."
53,"John and Zuzi Morgan have opened a café in Oxford, UK, where people can enjoy coffee, cake, and play board games. They hope that customers will love the experience and want to come back. Zuzi explains their motivation: “There is so much technology today. Everyone is busy with their phones and gadgets. We wanted to bring people together in a way that doesn’t involve screens. It’s natural for people to connect and communicate.”

The games played in their café are called ‘Eurogames’. These games often have gentle themes, like farming and building landscapes. The first Eurogame was The Settlers of Catan, created by German designer Klaus Teuber. In this game, players build settlements on an island and trade resources, keeping everyone engaged until the end. This idea was improved in ‘co-operative’ games, where all players work together to win or lose as a team, which encourages more social interaction. One popular co-operative game is Pandemic, designed by North American Matt Leacock. In Pandemic, players work together to solve global problems. Leacock was inspired by a Eurogame called Lord of the Rings, which is based on the famous book. He remembers feeling scared and excited while playing it with friends, and he wanted to create a game that gave everyone a good experience, whether they won or lost.

Leacock’s love for board games started when he was a child. He enjoyed receiving games as birthday gifts but often felt disappointed when they didn’t meet his expectations. With help from his uncle, he began to redesign games to make them better. Pandemic became very successful, and its follow-up game included a lot of storytelling. Leacock explains that it is similar to video games because players develop characters, learn new rules, and the game’s story changes as they play.

Interestingly, the growth of the video game industry has helped the popularity of modern board games. Many people now play games on their smartphones, making them more open to playing board games too. Ben Hogg, who works for a game company, says, “Everyone plays mobile games now. Most people with smartphones have at least one game they enjoy.” 

For a while, video games allowed some social interaction, like playing together in arcades or on the couch. However, as multiplayer games moved online, players became more distant from each other. This led some people to seek out board games to play with others in person. 

At John and Zuzi's busy café, it is clear that tabletop gaming has become more than just entertainment. In our increasingly online world, games are now a way to connect and share experiences directly with others, and this trend is likely to continue."
54,"Jamie Scott has written and produced some of the biggest hits in the UK in recent years. His story shows that endurance and persistence are very important in the music business, even if your career starts with many challenges. He says his mother was an amazing singer who encouraged him to play the guitar. The only radio station he listened to at home was for middle-aged people, which influenced his music taste as he grew up. He was 12 years old when he first heard a modern song. Around the same time, he had to choose between playing tennis, which he did at a national level, and music. He spent his lunchtimes in the school music room learning songs on the piano. He said, “I was doing well in tennis, but it was not what I wanted to do for my whole life. It was just too much hard work.”

At 17, he left school to pursue a career as a performer. He formed a duo with a friend who was a good guitarist but did not share his passion for performing. Jamie remembers telling his parents, “This is what I want to do. I have been writing lyrics in economics class and playing the piano every day while others were outside.” His father gave him 18 months to succeed; if he didn’t, he would need to find a job. After some close calls with record labels, he was signed by a music publisher at 19 because of one song. However, the record labels wanted him to be a solo artist, so he had to part ways with his friend.

Eventually, he found success behind the scenes rather than on stage. After a tough time with a UK record label, he asked to leave and joined another label to release a new album. However, fame and success did not come easily. He said, “I feel like I’ve been in the wrong place at the wrong time for most of my artist career, but as a writer, I’ve been in the right place at the right time.” Writing for other artists is where he truly found his success. He believes he is one of the main writers in the UK that labels turn to for new artists. He helps launch their careers and sometimes has to explain that aiming for chart success is not something to be ashamed of. He asks them, “Don’t you want 10 million people streaming your music next month?” He believes they should create something amazing that will also sell well.

It is refreshing to hear someone in pop music speak openly about wanting to write big hits. Jamie is not arrogant; he simply knows he wants to write number one songs and has the talent to do it. Instead of worrying about what others think, he focuses on his goals. He says, “When I go into the studio with someone, we need to aim for global success and write the best music for next year. It’s not just about what’s cool; we want to create classic modern pop songs.”"
55,"Tony Connor is a new kind of celebrity. He is very popular online, but many people, like me, may not know him because we don’t watch videos of people doing bike stunts. He is known as a ‘street trials cyclist.’ This means he jumps from difficult places, like roofs or walls, to land safely in other tricky spots. He films these stunts and shares them online.

When I interview him, we meet at a BMX park on a Saturday morning. The local kids know who he is, and some older people come to greet him, calling him ‘an absolute legend.’ After watching him perform, I agree with them. At first, I was a bit doubtful, but I am impressed by his bravery, creativity, and willingness to take risks. Before each stunt, he explains what he plans to do, and sometimes I can’t believe he will succeed. When I compliment him, he seems uninterested and a bit sad. Even though he is famous online, Tony says he doesn’t like being a celebrity. He finds it hard to connect with fans. He understands the importance of talking to them, but he prefers to focus on doing his stunts.

This is interesting because his fame comes from social media and the small cameras that help create this content. He says, “This technology allows people like me to earn money.” However, he feels that many people are always filming themselves or looking at screens, and he doesn’t fully agree with that.

Tony makes a good living from his videos, which is impressive because, in the past, this would have just been a hobby. After many years of interviewing top athletes, I have learned that two important things help a child become a great competitor: energy and the ability to handle disappointment. These qualities can be more important than talent and help someone keep going even after failures. In risky sports, it is especially important to have mental strength.

Even at the park, Tony fell a few times on what he thought were easy but new challenges. He just got back up and kept trying until he succeeded. Not everyone sees Tony as a hero. Some people think he is reckless and takes too many risks. He responds, “Those who criticize me may care, but they don’t understand. They probably have never tried riding a trials bike and don’t know much about the sport. They don’t realize I get advice from experts to reduce risks.”

Tony is careful about the risks he takes. He explains, “People are different. Some are never scared, and they shouldn’t be doing these sports. It’s important to know the dangers. Others can’t overcome their fear, while some of us can. I feel fear but find a way to move past it. I’m not addicted to risk; I spend a lot of time planning and preparing. Sometimes, I ride around for a while to get ready before trying a new stunt. I know I must stay calm before I jump. If I fully commit, I will be fine.”"
56,"Television presenter Helen Skelton has taken on many dangerous challenges for charity, such as running a marathon in the desert and traveling down the Amazon River in a small boat. For her latest challenge, Helen walked on a high wire, which is a long, thin piece of metal, 66 meters above the ground, between two towers of an empty power station. There was no safety net; she only had a belt around her waist connected to another wire above her. To help her balance and avoid falling, she used a long stick that weighed eight kilograms. 

Helen trained with an expert high-wire walker. Even though she had some circus skills, she found that high-wire walking was very different. “The training was a shock,” Helen said. “I didn’t realize how strong I needed to be. Every day started at 8 am with a run up a steep hill, followed by an hour of exercises, and then another hour practicing on the wire. I also had to learn how to fall onto the wire so I could keep going if I slipped. Every time I fell, it hurt a lot. But I had to stay positive: if I got nervous and started shaking, the wire would shake too!”

On the day of the challenge, it was windy, and Helen calmed herself by taking deep breaths as she moved step by step along the wire. The 150-meter walk took her 15 minutes. “That was the scariest thing I’ve done,” she said afterward. “I’m glad it’s over!” Despite this experience, Helen is already planning her next charity project: to reach the South Pole by skiing, kiting, and biking."
57,"In 2006, Jeff Somers started a journey around the world on a penny farthing, which is an old-fashioned bicycle with one large wheel and one small wheel. Before this, he had written a book about his travels in Canada using a 50-year-old car. He loved motorsport and worked building racing car engines. To save money, Jeff rode an old bicycle to work and also used it for a holiday in Amsterdam. He said, ""That trip opened my eyes,"" and decided he wanted to see the world by bike. 

Instead of using a regular touring bike, Jeff wanted to build his own. He thought the most interesting bike would be a penny farthing, so he visited a museum to learn how they were made. After two attempts in 2001 and 2003, which ended because of a knee injury, he finally began his journey in 2006. He traveled for three years, visiting 23 countries on four continents. The highlight of his trip was reaching Tibet and seeing Mount Everest. 

Although he met other cyclists who could ride up mountains, Jeff never regretted using his penny farthing. He noticed that the further he traveled from home, the more surprised people were by his bike. However, he faced a tough moment when he had to drink dirty water from a stream, which made him very sick. He spent ten days in a hostel without medicine and had no money for a hospital or to return home. 

Despite these challenges, Jeff now says, ""If I could afford it, I would start traveling again tomorrow on my penny farthing."""
58,"I work at a university in the US with my team to learn more about water birds, especially the American black duck. We have just started using a new tool called a ‘night-vision scope’ that helps us see the ducks in the dark! We are concerned about black ducks because their numbers have decreased a lot, and we are unsure if there is enough food for them on the east coast. We know a lot about what they do during the day, but we don’t have information about their nighttime activities because we didn’t have the right equipment. This new scope will give us clear images, even on nights without a moon, so we can learn more and make better decisions about protecting their habitat.

Our work is challenging. There are four of us, and we each work six hours a day. We have studied ducks in different places, and I have had to take a boat to some locations and write down every duck I see. The weather has been difficult – some nights are warm, but most of the time it is rainy. It is so quiet that I have needed a lot of coffee to stay awake! We have only missed one workday because the snow was too deep for our special vehicles. I enjoy the challenge, especially when I think about the summer, which will involve long hours in a laboratory analyzing our results together. It will be hard to be indoors, but it is necessary. I wouldn’t change this experience for anything!"
59,"Whenever I tell people about my job, they often find it hard to believe that it exists. But I’m serious! I spend my workdays tasting chocolate! Tasting is very important to ensure that customers receive perfect, high-quality chocolate from my company. Every week, I get samples, which are small amounts of chocolate from our factory, and I check them for taste, texture, and smell. I also taste the raw materials we use, like nuts and fruit, to choose the best ones for our chocolate. 

Next to my office, I have a kitchen where I can test and taste the products I create, and I share samples with my colleagues to keep them happy! My kitchen is filled with machines and ingredients that I can experiment with. It’s great to have a private space to go to during the day. No two days are the same in this job. Sometimes I work in our food lab, and other times I travel abroad to buy raw materials, which can be challenging since I have a young family. However, I enjoy the variety and lack of routine in my job, although I think the chocolate is the best part!

People often ask me if I ever get bored of chocolate. I’ve worked with it for a long time, and I’ve never felt tired of eating it. In fact, I often go home and enjoy more chocolate in the evening!"
60,"Have you ever thought about what it’s like to perform in a circus? Sophia Grayson works at Circus Experience, a place that teaches young people circus skills. She says her course is popular because it teaches many skills, such as juggling, throwing and catching balls or even fire, and trapeze, which is about flying through the air in front of an amazed audience. 

In the year-long course, students gradually take more risks in each class, and parents can come to some classes to see how their children are doing. Sophia explains, “To have a career in the circus, performers need to avoid doing the same thing all the time. It’s important to keep performances exciting and full of action. If you want to be successful in the circus, you must keep practicing. Another great part of this job is making friends with other performers and learning from them. Staying fit is also very important. Circus artists, like athletes, train every day to stay strong. Training is essential, but the best performers are those who want to succeed, have creativity, and always work on improving their skills. 

People often think that circus performers are likely to get injured or that they only work for a short time each year. However, the real challenge is thinking about the future because you can only perform while you are young, and then you need to think about other options.” The course also teaches business planning. Many former students have started their own businesses around the world and are happy to share their experiences. However, Sophia warns that this is not a job for making a lot of money! “The work usually does not provide a regular salary. It’s also very competitive, but it’s a lot of fun!”"
61,"You may not know her name or face, but you have probably heard her many times. Mariam Hobson is a professional backing singer. This means she sings in the background to support the main singer. Many people think backing singers are not as good as lead singers, but that is not true – they often have to be even better. People like Mariam are the real stars of the music industry!

“What I love about my job is that when I enter the recording studio, I never know what I will be asked to sing,” she says. “It could be classical, jazz, hip-hop, or rock. Sometimes, it might even be a funny song for a radio station or an advertisement. I am often surprised by what producers ask for. Once, I was asked to sing like a fish underwater! But I never complain; I just do my job!”

“Excellent musical skills are very important for my work, as well as the ability to learn quickly. There is often no sheet music to follow. I will never forget my first time recording background music for a film. It was very complicated because there were eight of us, each singing a different part, along with an orchestra. I was scared because if I made a mistake, we would have to record everything again, which nobody likes. Recording sessions are already long enough!”

“One of my favorite jobs is recording for songwriters. Less experienced writers sometimes do not know which musical range is best for a female voice. By listening to me sing their song, they can figure out how to improve it.”"
62,"Julie Deane started her business with only basic knowledge of fashion, but she successfully created a line of ‘satchels’—traditional bags used by schoolchildren. These satchels are now sold in famous shops and are popular among many celebrities. Before deciding to sell satchels, Julie considered different business ideas, like cake decorating and party planning. She wanted to make a careful choice instead of just going with her first idea. 

When she chose to sell satchels, not everyone supported her. Julie recalls, “Many said there was no demand for them – but I was convinced.” She involved her family from the beginning, working with her mother, who had never had a career but had a natural talent for business. The design of the satchels was inspired by children’s storybooks. 

Although Julie was not familiar with fashion blogs at first, they became important for her success. Initially, she sold about one satchel a week. To create interest, she sent satchels to fashion writers, hoping they would write about them in their blogs. They did, and interest in her products grew, along with the speed at which her company produced the satchels. Now, Julie enjoys waiting to see which celebrity will be seen with a satchel next!

While other companies spend money on online ads, Julie uses the internet community to get ideas for new styles, keeping her products fresh and exciting. There was a difficult time when another company copied her satchel design to sell similar products. Because of this, she now makes sure she trusts her production team as much as her own staff. Visitors often comment on the positive atmosphere in her offices—people enjoy working there. There is now a new factory, and while the buildings are important, it is the team that makes it a special place."
63,"When Vicky Harmiston was a child, her parents let her and her brother Jamie choose how to spend their free time. Vicky enjoyed doing many different sports. She was a good swimmer, and her coach thought she could become a champion. However, the swimming club was far from her home, making it hard for her to balance training with schoolwork. 

As teenagers, Jamie, who loved cycling, bought a special racing bike and started competing. Vicky found this exciting and decided to try cycling too. She believes it was the best choice she ever made. Soon, she was cycling every day and doing very well. The track was close to her school, so it was easy for her to attend training sessions after school. Vicky had a successful career in track cycling and won several competitions. When she turned 28, she retired from competitive cycling. Vicky said, “For years, I loved winning, but I started to feel tired of it all. When the excitement goes away, it’s not worth it anymore. Luckily, I found a new career.”

Vicky got a job with a charity called CycleZone. “We work with young people who have never enjoyed sports,” she explains. “The first thing we do is teach them to ride a bike. We want them to believe in themselves and their abilities. CycleZone does a great job of bringing young people together so they feel part of a larger group.” The charity uses celebrities to promote their work. Vicky says, “Some people think celebrity support is not always good for a charity. They believe celebrities do it for their own benefit, which can distract from the charity’s real work. But if famous singers and actors can help, I think they should.”"
64,"Singer-songwriter Ana Ronson grew up in Ireland. Even though her parents were not musicians, there was always music in their home. Her grandfather played the guitar and taught Ana and her brother how to play. The first time Ana sang in front of an audience was at school, and she was so nervous that her teacher had to take her off the stage. This teacher suggested that Ana join the school theatre club to help her gain confidence. After some time in the club, she happily sang with 50 other students at a concert at the end of the term.

A year later, her brother, who was in a band, asked her to write a song for them. Ana wrote her first song, called ""Falling Stars,"" in just three days. She enjoyed writing so much that she signed up for a songwriting course with a professional songwriter. Even though she was the youngest student, she knew more about music than many of the others. However, Ana felt that the teacher did not listen to her, which inspired her to write a song called ""Something to Say"" about her frustration. She shared this song online, and it became very popular. She was thrilled when people commented that they loved it and found new meanings in the lyrics each time they listened.

Joss Alton, the owner of a recording company called Isotope Music, traveled from the other side of Ireland to invite her to join his company. At first, Ana was unsure because she did not know much about Isotope and did not want anyone telling her what to sing. However, Joss convinced her that this would not happen. Soon after, she performed at a concert in Dublin organized by Isotope, and all the tickets sold out quickly. It was an amazing night.

Ana prefers to write songs about difficult times rather than happy moments because she feels she has more to express. One of her favorite songs is ""Decision,"" which is about why her brother stopped singing for a while and how unhappy it made him. While she hopes her fans will enjoy her music, her goal is to write about personal experiences that are important to her."
65,"Last year, I went on an amazing trip. I traveled by boat on a guided group tour along the west coast of Canada. It was my brother Harry’s idea. He is a journalist, like me, and wanted to write articles about the trip. He loves boats, but I don’t share that interest. However, I had always dreamed of visiting this area since I saw it on TV as a child. I knew it was where our great-grandparents had lived before moving to Europe. So, I kept asking Harry if I could join him until he finally agreed!

A few days before we left, there were storms in the area we were going to. Luckily, the weather forecast for our trip was good, with calm seas. I was busy at work and didn’t have much time to prepare, but Harry promised he would take care of everything, so I stopped worrying.

After arriving in Canada, we joined the group, packed our supplies into small boats, and set off. The guide told us that very few people live along that coast now. On our first morning, the only other living creatures we saw were dolphins and birds. We could see islands in the distance, but the early-morning fog made it hard to see far, so I focused on the beautiful patterns our boat made in the water.

We often stopped for hours to explore the rock pools on the beaches. They were full of colorful fish, many of which I didn’t recognize. It was nice to forget about how fast or slow the day was going. We always remembered to have lunch and dinner, which we cooked together over campfires. At night, when we fell asleep on the boats, even though the beds were hard, it felt like a stress-free life!

When it was time to leave, I felt sad. How could I go back to normal life? But I knew I would miss my family and friends if I stayed. I was also excited to tell everyone at home about our adventures!"
66,"My dad was a professional basketball player in Germany, just like his father before him. When I was a kid, I went to many of his games. You might think that watching so many matches would make me love basketball, but it did the opposite. I enjoyed telling my friends how good my dad was, especially when he won, but I often brought a book to read instead of watching the games.

When I started secondary school, I was still two years away from being a teenager, but I was already two meters tall. Because of my height, my sports teacher asked if I wanted to train with the basketball team. I liked the training, but I thought I needed to improve my skills before playing in a real match. However, my teacher believed in me more than I believed in myself. After some time, I agreed to play, and a few weeks later, I found myself in a game against another school. My parents watching made me more nervous, but it turned out fine!

For the next four years, I practiced every day and did really well. I even joined an adult team before moving to a special sports academy in the USA when I was fifteen. The coach there trained Olympic basketball players, and it was amazing to work with him. However, I didn’t enjoy living far from my parents at first. At home, I hadn’t spent much time with friends because of all the training, so that part wasn’t too different for me. Eventually, I got used to my new life, and my English improved quickly too!

I became a professional player at eighteen, three years after arriving in the USA. I had been taller than most players in the professional league since I was fifteen, but I needed to gain weight to match my height. My coach knew a team that would take me while I was still in college, so I joined them and have never regretted it."
67,"Seven years ago, I was studying Tourism at college, but I needed a part-time job because my course was expensive. After thinking about different options, I decided to train as a weekend tour guide in my home city, Chicago, USA. I took visitors around the city and was surprised by how much I enjoyed giving tours. I saw the city I had lived in my whole life from a new perspective, and it felt exciting every time!

After I finished my studies, I chose to become a full-time tour guide. I thought it would be easy, but when I looked into it, I realized I needed to learn a lot more to get a license. All tour guides in Chicago must answer many questions about the city, including its architecture, history, and public transport rules. After several challenging but interesting months, I earned my tour guide qualification and registered as an independent guide.

Being a tour guide is not just about knowing facts or keeping track of the group. You also need other important skills. You should be entertaining and tell interesting stories. Most importantly, you must be able to handle unexpected situations, like if a place you planned to visit is closed or if the route changes. Tourists want to enjoy a well-organized tour, not hear about problems or what they are missing.

I need to ensure that visitors are happy with my tours, or they might leave a negative review online. Like most tour guides, I know that good reviews are very important because they attract more customers. That’s why it’s essential to make tours fun and stress-free. I believe that my enthusiasm and energy in my job help me get good reviews, and many visitors recommend my tours to others coming to Chicago."
68,"My name is Ella, and I am 22 years old. Last year, I went to Thailand for two weeks with my sister Josie. Even though she is five years younger than me, we have a good relationship. We went to volunteer at an elephant sanctuary, which is a place where people care for sick and rescued elephants. At first, I was unsure if we would get along with the other volunteers because they were all older than us. We were also nervous since it was our first time doing something like this. However, we ended up having a great time.

One of our main tasks at the sanctuary was to collect food for the elephants. Elephants eat a lot of grass and banana plants, so this took most of our day. Josie found it very hard work, but I thought it was worth it to see the elephants enjoying their meals. We also helped wash the elephants in the river with big brushes and soap. I had a lot of fun doing this, even though I got wetter than the elephants!

The part of the day I looked forward to the most was the evening. By moonlight, we led the elephants into the forest where they would sleep. All the volunteers stayed in the same house. Josie and I shared a small bedroom because she didn’t want to be alone. It was hot and humid at night, but we expected that. The meals were delicious and did not include meat, which we both don’t like. After dinner, all the volunteers and staff would spend the evenings talking and playing games.

Now that we are back in the UK, Josie doesn’t often talk about Thailand. But when someone asks her if she enjoyed her time at the sanctuary, she says she loved it. I think she might be a little upset with herself for not enjoying it fully because she missed her friends. However, when she thinks back on the experience, she realizes how lucky she was to go there. Maybe she will go back one day – I know I will!"
69,"My name is Gina D’Costa, and I own a flower shop in the UK. We sell flowers not just to people for their homes or gifts, but also to many different customers. Hotels and offices often use flowers in their reception areas, and we sometimes provide flowers for businesses to use in their advertising photos. Once, I even decorated a castle with flowers for a wedding. It was a lot of work, but I was very proud of what we accomplished.

My day starts at 4 a.m. when I go to the market to buy fresh flowers. Most people are still asleep at that time, and my friends think I’m crazy, but I love what I do. It can be cold and dark, but I don’t let that bother me. The flower market is amazing, with flowers from all over the world. The sights and smells make it hard to choose. If I were picking flowers for myself, I would choose pink ones because it’s my favorite color. However, I have to remember that my preferences are not always what my customers want. Not all flowers are available all year, so I can’t always find what they ask for.

I don’t enjoy arguing about prices with the flower sellers, but it’s part of the job. Flowers can be expensive, so I try to get the best price I can. When I return to the shop, we look at customer orders and prepare vases with the flowers I bought. Then, we create flower arrangements and calculate the costs. Customers are often surprised by the prices, and I sometimes have to ask them to reconsider their choices. Some people might think this is too much trouble, but I enjoy finding the best flowers for the budget someone has. That’s what selling is about, and I wouldn’t want to do anything else!"
70,"My city has a modern cinema that shows the latest films and many kids' movies on weekends. It is close to my home, but a year ago, I felt something was missing – the chance to talk about a film in detail with others after watching it. So, I started a film club with two friends! We decided not to rent a cinema. Instead, we choose a different place in the city each month. For example, we rented an old factory to show a film set in Antarctica. It was very cold, which made the atmosphere perfect for the film, and it was amazing! Some places we use are free because the owners sell snacks during the film, allowing us to keep our prices low. We are happy to cover our costs and not make a profit. Each time we show a film, it gets easier, especially now that we have our own reliable equipment. We can also see how many tickets we’ve sold online, so we don’t worry about empty seats anymore! There is still a lot to do, but when people of all ages tell us how much they enjoyed the experience at the end, it feels great. Our website has been very helpful, and we are now in touch with other film clubs across the country. We have visited them to learn how they do things, but it’s always nice to return to our own club! We also started a blog because we know most people look online for film information instead of reading local paper reviews. We have tried putting up posters in cafés, but nothing is as effective as people telling their friends about us. The audience loves the special activities we organize with each film – last month, we had a movie quiz that everyone enjoyed."
71,"Taking photographs was always my favorite activity when I was a child. When I turned 15, I wanted to improve my hobby, so I decided to start a special project: I would take one photograph every day for a whole year. Many other young photographers had done this before, but I thought it was a great idea, so I began.

After a few weeks, I decided to share my photos on a website for young photographers. I wanted to create a photo diary and show my work to others. I was surprised to find that people liked my way of seeing and photographing things. I enjoyed taking pictures of many different subjects. Then, someone suggested that if my photos had a common theme, my project would be even better. I agreed and started focusing on nature, especially birds and the sky.

Most of my photos were in black and white, which was different from what many other young photographers were doing, as they were taking color photos. Because of this, I sometimes doubted my project and almost gave up. However, I learned to trust my feelings and became more confident in my style and choices.

One day, I showed my project to my art teacher. She told me about a national photography competition for people my age, so I entered some of my photos just for fun. I will never forget the moment when the judges announced that I had won first prize. I was so happy because my project meant a lot to me. It was the first time I realized that my photography might be good, and that I could work as a professional photographer. Now, I have my own photography studio, and I have never regretted my choice of career."
72,"I joined the National Youth Challenge (NYC) last year because I wanted to try new activities like camping, sailing, and public speaking. In the NYC, you can take part in different activities that help you challenge yourself and learn new things. There are levels from beginner to advanced, and adult volunteers called ‘leaders’ run the programs. When you finish each level, you receive a certificate.

When I first joined, my leader suggested that I help organize activities at a local children’s club for two hours a week. I was unsure about this because I had joined that same club when I was eight and found it hard to make friends. I was shy, and the other kids already had their own friends, so I stopped going after a few weeks. However, I decided to take on the challenge because I wanted my first NYC certificate. 

Soon, I started to enjoy spending my free time at the children’s club. It became more important to me than just getting the certificate. After I completed the challenge, the NYC leader allowed me to continue volunteering at the club because I had built good relationships with the children. Now, I go there for about four hours a week, and I always look forward to it.

Because of what I learned at the children’s club, I have decided that after I finish school in three years, I want to go to college to become a qualified youth worker, someone who works with children. I had never thought about this career before joining the club. This experience has been my favorite part of the NYC, and I have improved my communication skills while helping others. I now have several NYC certificates, and one of them is for camping!"
73,"I was born in Denver, USA, and I started snowboarding when I was eight years old. My dad took me to a mountain resort about two hours from Denver. The hill looked very steep, and my dad had to convince me to try snowboarding. I was too young to ask him if I could start, but he loved snowboarding and wanted me to enjoy it too. He made it look easy, and eventually, I did well. Soon, I fell in love with the sport and got better at it. I began competing when I was ten. Some people enter many competitions and get bored, but my passion for snowboarding and winning has grown as I’ve aged, which motivates me to work harder.

I like not having a strict plan, and sometimes this works out well. For example, I became the first female to score a perfect 100 at a local competition. I didn’t think I would try the jumps that earned me that score until I actually started. This achievement made me trust my abilities more. In the summer, I focus on training and studying since there’s no snow. I train every day, but I don’t have to follow a strict diet like I do in winter. I also spend a lot of time with my friends, which helps me cope with not being able to do what I love.

I need to think about my future. Snowboarding is a big part of my life, but I know it’s important to have other options in case I don’t become a professional snowboarder or if I get injured. I’m considering becoming a doctor if my active lifestyle allows me to study at college. I can’t imagine getting tired of snowboarding, but I know I can’t do it forever."
74,"When I was fifteen, I wanted everything my friends had, and I never thought about the future. For example, I didn’t know what I wanted to do after school. One day, my best friend got a new phone for her birthday, and I wanted one too. My parents said I could only have it if I paid for it myself, so I decided to get a part-time job and save money. I am very thankful to my parents for this because it taught me an important lesson.

I worked every Saturday in a café, but I didn’t enjoy it much. My parents suggested I start my own small business instead. I had seen my mum making necklaces, so I asked if I could try that. I was surprised to find it easy, even though it looked complicated when I watched my mum. My friends thought it sounded boring, but I was excited about it. My mum showed me that I could create something nice at home with simple tools and materials.

I sold my first pieces of jewellery to my friends and family as soon as I finished making them. They said they loved them, but I thought they were just being nice. Even though I was happy they bought them, I still needed to know if they would be popular with other people. The only way to find out was to rent a market stall with my mum. There are many tourists where I live, and they bought a lot of my jewellery to take home to their families and friends. Soon, we started getting calls from all over the country from people wanting to buy more. They thought we were a big company with many workers, but it was just me and my mum at the market stall!

That was when I realized my business could succeed, and it was time to create a website. Since then, I have made thousands of pounds from my business, mostly online, but we still have our stall too. It has been a lot of fun so far!"
75,"When Janine Stuart was just 13 years old, she wrote a novel called Being Amelia, which became very popular. The book is partly based on Janine’s own life. In an interview, Janine explained, “Because my father’s job made us move around a lot, I learned how to make new friends easily. I know what it feels like to be the new student in a class, which helped me write about Amelia’s experiences in a new school. Some of the funniest parts of the book are about Amelia’s home life, especially her relationship with her older brother. Since I am an only child, I had to use my imagination to create that.” 

Janine started writing her novel one summer when she was bored at home. Her mother always wanted to be a published author, and her teachers encouraged her to write, so it felt natural for Janine to spend her time this way. The year before, she won a short story competition on a young writers’ website. This is why, when she finished Being Amelia and sent it to a publishing company, they were eager to read it. They loved the book, and a year later, it was available in bookstores.

One review of Being Amelia points out that even though the cover shows happy teenagers, the characters face real challenges, which makes them believable. The reviewer noted that even though Janine is still young and her book isn’t very long, she has shown that she is a better writer than many other bestselling authors. Janine is still adjusting to being a famous writer: “At first, I would hide when people recognized me in the street, but now it’s fine. I want to give advice to other young writers, but they need to find what works for them. For me, I just need to spend time with my friends, and I will soon have something interesting to write about!”"
76,"My name is Tom, and I am fifteen years old. Three years ago, my family and I moved into a castle on a small island. This happened because my father was invited to manage the castle. He works for a group that takes care of historical buildings and keeps them open for visitors. He was happy to get this opportunity, but it took some time for the rest of us to agree that he should take the job. We were worried about what life on the island would be like. We knew the castle might not be as comfortable as our warm home across the water, and there was no school nearby.

However, after we moved, we quickly adjusted to life on the island. The castle is not very beautiful, but our apartment in it is comfortable. In the summer, the island is lively with many visitors, and there are often beach parties. In winter, we mostly see the other families who live here, but there are not many teenagers, which I had hoped for. The adults help each other and work hard to fix things on the island.

The biggest change for me was taking a boat every day to my old school. I looked forward to the stormy days with big waves, but the ferries do not run then! I also learned that if I miss the bus to the harbor after school, I will miss the last ferry home, which is stressful. So, when my friends come to visit, I always tell them to hurry! But we often enjoy amazing views, especially when the sun sets over the sea. Some days, it is so foggy that you can’t see anything, but then it can change to bright sunshine in just a few hours, which still surprises me even after living here for a while.

Of course, we do have terrible storms, and I sometimes wonder if the castle is strong enough to stay safe. But then I remember it has been here for centuries and is still standing strong!"
77,"I live in a house in the beautiful countryside of Scotland. I have always loved nature and wild animals. Six years ago, I started a new hobby: birdwatching! I went to the mountains in northern Scotland with my family, where we saw many birds in their natural homes. I spent hours watching them with my parents, who taught me how to recognize different bird species and find the best places to see them. It was amazing! After we returned home, I joined a local birdwatchers’ club for young people. My goal is to see 200 different bird species, and I am almost there. During family holidays abroad, I have seen birds from other countries too. We always look for places with birdwatching activities so I can add new birds to my list!

I have been to Egypt, and last summer we went to South America, where I thought I would see my 200th species. I was not too disappointed when it didn’t happen because I learned that patience is important in this hobby. I made a video about this challenge and many teenagers liked it and said it looked like a fascinating hobby. When my teachers saw it, they asked me to give a presentation about birdwatching at school. I felt nervous just before I walked onto the stage, knowing that the whole school and my friends were watching me! I relaxed only after it was over, and the teachers said I had prepared well and they enjoyed it. I might even do another presentation next year!

I feel lucky to live in the countryside. I understand why many teenagers in cities might not think about becoming birdwatchers, but there are many birds to see, especially in green areas. I believe birdwatching clubs should try to attract more young people to this hobby. Everyone should connect with nature, no matter their age, and it doesn’t have to be expensive."
78,"I started playing football when I was 7 years old. I would hurry home from school to play with other kids. I loved it, and after some time, I became a good player. My family knew I often got excited about new hobbies and then lost interest, so they thought I would do the same with football. But that never happened. I even dreamed of playing football professionally when I grew up. 

The chance came sooner than I expected. I played in local tournaments, and one of the referees saw that I was a talented player. He asked the manager of a professional women’s club to watch me play. After that, she invited me to join her club. At first, I couldn’t believe it – I didn’t know young girls could join women’s clubs. But the manager was impressed, and I started training regularly with a big club when I was just 13 years old. I improved a lot after that. 

However, some people still doubted that I would become a star player, which made me a little sad. But my coach encouraged me to be myself and to believe in my abilities. He even let me play in one of the club’s championship matches earlier than I expected! I ran harder than ever because I didn’t want to let my teammates down. Luckily, I scored the winning goal! Even with a large crowd, I could hear my coach cheering for me, and after the match, my team carried me around the pitch. It was amazing! 

Since then, I have scored many more winning goals. Next month, my coach and I are organizing a football tournament in my area. The goal is to get teenagers interested in football and to give them a chance to meet other players from my club. It will show them what a professional environment is like and encourage them to believe they can play for a top team if they work hard. My advice to them will be the same as my coach gave me – there will be good times, but also some bad times. I’ve had very few bad times, though, so I feel lucky!"
79,"One of the most interesting changes in education in the UK and around the world in recent years is the push for new students to get involved in research as early as possible. This change shows that research is not just for famous scholars at old universities or scientists who are discovering new things, but it is also a natural way to build knowledge and skills. Research skills will help you not only in your studies but also in your future job, as they teach you how to think about the world and how to approach your work.

As a student, you contribute to knowledge. You do not just learn and repeat what others say; you create new knowledge. Creating knowledge starts with asking questions instead of just accepting things as they are. You might ask: Why? How? When? What does this mean? What if things were different? How does it work in this situation? What should we think about the facts, opinions, or beliefs we are given? Why is this important? These questions are at the heart of what we call research.

Research can be seen as a range of activities. On one end, there is complex, groundbreaking research done by highly trained experts, which leads to significant changes and new knowledge. However, research can also start from simple questions and everyday inquiries. This type of research involves careful work, asking thoughtful questions about issues, following leads, and making practical suggestions.

Most students have always been researchers in some way. You have likely done some research for school projects or answered questions at work since you started. You have asked questions that led you to investigate topics that interest you. You have also developed research skills when planning a holiday, growing plants, fixing things at home, training your dog, finding the right music system, or shopping online.

In college and higher education, you are expected to have a curious mind, identify problems and questions, critically explore and evaluate information, and create your own responses and knowledge. Some students may find this challenging because, in some cultures, knowledge is seen as fixed, and learning comes from listening to teachers and texts. It may feel disrespectful to question established knowledge or authority, and you might think you should be told what is important to learn.

However, in higher education in the UK, US, much of Europe, and Australia, questioning established knowledge and authorities is encouraged. This process of inquiry and knowledge creation can seem overwhelming. Critical thinking is especially important in research. The research done by others is valuable for students, academics, and future jobs, but we need to engage with it, think critically, and test it. We should not just accept everything we read as true; instead, we must analyze it to see if it is logical and supported by evidence. We should avoid blindly trusting the facts and information we receive from others."
80,"Cities have always been important places for ideas and discussions. In the 18th century, coffee houses in London were popular spots where people talked about science and politics. Similarly, in modern Paris, cafés on the Left Bank were where artists like Pablo Picasso shared their thoughts on art. However, living in a city can be challenging. The same cafés that encouraged conversation also helped spread diseases like cholera, and even Picasso eventually moved to the countryside.

Today, cities are known for their creativity, but they can also feel overwhelming and unnatural. Scientists are now studying how city life affects our brains, and the findings are concerning. While it has been known that city life can be tiring, new research shows that living in cities can actually make us think less clearly. One major reason for this is the lack of nature in urban environments. Studies have shown that hospital patients heal faster when they can see trees from their windows. Even small views of nature can help our brains relax and improve our thinking.

As more people live in cities than ever before, we are surrounded by concrete and many strangers instead of open spaces. This crowded environment can have serious effects on our mental and physical health and change how we think. For example, when walking down a busy street, our brains must pay attention to many things: other people, traffic, and confusing street layouts. These everyday tasks can drain our mental energy because cities are full of distractions that require us to constantly focus and redirect our attention.

This idea is explained by attention restoration theory, developed by psychologist Stephen Kaplan. He suggested that being in nature can help restore our ability to focus. Natural environments have things that naturally attract our attention without causing stress, unlike loud noises like police sirens. In nature, our minds can relax and recharge.

Long before scientists studied this, philosophers and landscape designers warned about the negative effects of city life and sought ways to bring nature into urban areas. Parks, like Central Park in New York, provide a break from city life and can quickly improve brain function. While many people look for ways to boost their mental performance, such as energy drinks or office redesigns, simply taking a walk in nature may be the most effective solution.

Given the many mental challenges of city living, we must ask: Why do cities keep growing? Even in our digital age, cities remain centers of creativity. Research from the Santa Fe Institute shows that the same crowded features of cities that can hurt our attention and memory also promote innovation. The close social interactions in cities are key to their creative energy. Just as the crowded streets of 18th-century London led to new ideas, the busy environment of 21st-century Cambridge, Massachusetts, supports its success in technology.

The challenge is to find ways to reduce the negative effects of city life while keeping its unique advantages. After all, there will always be times when people feel tired of nature and long for the excitement of the city."
81,"**Where Should We Look for the Mind?**

This question might seem strange: we usually think that thinking happens inside our heads. Today, we have advanced brain imaging techniques that support this idea. However, I believe we should not limit the study of the mind to just the brain or the body. There is a lot of evidence, from ancient times to now, showing that objects and tools also play a role in how we think. 

From an archaeological perspective, items like stone tools, jewelry, carvings, clay tokens, and writing systems have been important in human evolution and the development of our minds. Therefore, what is outside our heads might also be part of our minds. 

It is easy to connect the mind with the brain because most of what we know about the mind comes from studying people without the objects they usually use. This is practical for neuroscientists who need to use brain scans. However, this approach often overlooks the fact that much of our thinking happens with the help of things around us. 

I do not want to deny the importance of the brain in thinking, but I want to emphasize that the mind is more than just the brain. It is useful to explore the idea that human intelligence extends beyond our bodies into culture and the material world. This is where my new theory, called Material Engagement Theory (MET), comes in. 

MET looks at how objects can become extensions of our minds and bodies. For example, when we make numbers from clay or use a stone to create a tool, we are engaging with the material world. This theory also examines how these interactions have changed over time and what those changes mean for our thinking. 

Consider a blind person using a stick. Where does this person’s self begin? The connection between the blind person and the stick shows how minds and objects can be linked. The stick helps the blind person to feel and understand their surroundings, and the brain treats the stick as part of the body. 

This example reminds us that human intelligence can adapt and change by using new technologies. I see the human mind as a work in progress, always evolving. Regardless of what form the “stick” has taken throughout history—whether it’s a simple stone tool or a modern smartphone—its main purpose is to help us explore and understand our environment. 

For humans, tools are not just for survival; they satisfy our curiosity. This unique ability to engage with material culture explains why humans create things and how those things shape our minds. I call this idea metaplasticity, meaning our minds are flexible and change as we interact with the world around us. 

I want to emphasize the importance of material objects in understanding the mind. MET provides a new perspective on how different types of material culture, from ancient tools to modern devices, have influenced who we are and how we think. While the idea of technology changing our minds may sound futuristic, humans have been using such tools since the beginning of our existence."
82,"Few inventions have changed our way of understanding the world as much as photography. This is especially true in the United States, where photography quickly became part of everyday life, from practical uses to art and entertainment. Historians believe that photography is one of the greatest contributions of the US to the visual arts. This is a big statement, but it shows how important photography has become in American culture. To understand its impact, we need to look at its beginnings in the mid-19th century.

Why was photography so attractive? First, it was a mechanical process that matched the growing interest in technology. Just like steam power and railroads made communication and travel easier, photography brought the wonders of the world into people's homes in a very immediate way. Second, the camera became a popular tool for showing one's identity in a country where personal and national identities were always changing. Third, the camera helped families create a record of their lives, even if that record was somewhat idealized. Finally, the realistic nature of photographs matched the trend towards realism in American art.

Every photograph draws attention to something specific, showing what the photographer wants us to see. Because photographs are made by machines, they are records of events, people, and things, which gives them a sense of objectivity. However, since each photograph is taken by a person, it also carries a personal point of view. We might think we understand a photograph because we recognize its subject, which is why photography is often called a ""universal language."" But the meaning of a photograph is more complicated than that. 

No image speaks for itself; it is always presented with some context that affects how we understand it, like a caption in a newspaper or its placement in a gallery. To understand a photograph historically, we need to consider its purpose and the culture it comes from: Why did the photographer take the picture? How did people first see it? The same image can have different meanings depending on where and when it is viewed.

For a long time, the importance of the camera to artists was not well known, but today it is clear. In recent decades, artists like Andy Warhol have used photographs in their work in many ways. In summary, photography has become an essential part of art, working alongside painting and shaping our ideas of representation before the camera was invented."
83,"In 1890, William James, an American philosopher and one of the founders of modern psychology, defined psychology as the ""science of mental life."" This definition is still relevant today. Everyone has a mental life, which means we have some understanding of what this term means. Although we can study mental life in animals like rats and monkeys, it is still a complex idea. James focused on human psychology, which he believed included basic elements: thoughts, feelings, the physical world, and a way of knowing about these elements. Our knowledge is mostly personal and comes from our own experiences, which may or may not align with scientific facts.

Because of this, we often make judgments about psychological issues based on our own experiences. We act like amateur psychologists when we share opinions on complicated topics, such as whether brainwashing works or why people behave in certain ways, like feeling insulted or unhappy. Problems can arise when two people understand things differently. Formal psychology aims to provide methods to determine which explanations are most likely correct in different situations. Psychologists help us separate subjective thoughts, which can be biased, from objective facts.

Psychology, as defined by William James, focuses on the mind and brain. While psychologists study the brain, they do not fully understand how it works in relation to our feelings, hopes, and behaviors. It is often difficult to study the brain directly, so psychologists learn more by observing behavior and forming hypotheses about what happens inside us. A challenge in psychology is that scientific facts should be objective, but the mind's workings are not easily observable. We can only infer them from behavior, similar to solving a crossword puzzle by interpreting clues.

Psychology aims to describe, understand, predict, and control the processes it studies. When these goals are met, psychology can help us understand our experiences and apply findings to real life. Psychological research has been useful in many areas, such as improving reading methods for children, designing safer machines, and helping people express their feelings when they are emotionally distressed.

Although psychological questions have been discussed for centuries, scientific investigation of these questions has only occurred in the last 150 years. Early psychologists used introspection, or self-reflection, to find answers. They aimed to identify mental structures, which is still important today, but introspection has limitations. As Sir Francis Galton noted, it only allows us to see a small part of what the brain does automatically. William James compared trying to understand the mind through introspection to quickly turning up the gas to see how darkness looks. Today, psychologists prefer to base their theories on careful observations of others' behavior rather than on their own experiences."
84,"In a storehouse in a regular business park in Michigan, USA, there is a unique collection known as the Museum of Failed Products. This museum, owned by a company called GfK, displays products that were taken off the market because very few people wanted to buy them. The owner, Carol Sherry, believes that each product has its own sad story related to the designers, marketers, and salespeople involved.

What is surprising is that this museum exists as a successful business. You might think that any good manufacturer would keep a collection of their failed products, but many executives who visit the museum show that this is not common. They often avoid thinking about their failures and do not keep samples of their unsuccessful products. The museum was started by Robert McMath, who originally wanted to create a library of consumer products, not just failed ones. Since the 1960s, he began collecting every new item he could find. He did not realize that most products fail, which led to his collection being mostly made up of unsuccessful items.

Today’s culture of optimism may contribute to the products in the museum. Each product likely went through meetings where people did not see that it would fail. Even if they did, marketers might invest more money into a failing product to try to save face. Little effort is made to understand why these products failed, and people involved often choose not to talk about it.

This focus on positivity is also common in the self-help industry. One popular idea is ""positive visualization,"" which suggests that if you imagine good outcomes, they are more likely to happen. Research by neuroscientist Tali Sharot shows that our brains may be wired to see the chances of success as higher than they really are. People who are mentally healthy often have a more optimistic view of their ability to influence events compared to those who are depressed.

However, how effective are these positive thoughts about the future? Psychologist Gabriele Oettingen and her team have studied this question. Their findings are surprising: thinking too much about how well things could go can actually reduce people's motivation to reach their goals. For example, people who were encouraged to imagine having a very successful week at work ended up achieving less.

Psychologist Carol Dweck explains that our experiences with failure depend on our beliefs about ability. People with a ""fixed mindset"" believe that ability is something you are born with, while those with a ""growth mindset"" think that ability can develop through effort and challenges. Fixed-mindset individuals find failure very frightening because it shows they did not meet expectations. For instance, a sports star who thinks of himself as naturally talented may not practice enough to succeed. On the other hand, growth-mindset individuals see failure as a sign that they are pushing their limits. Dweck compares this to weight training, where muscles grow stronger by being challenged. Overall, having a growth mindset is a healthier way to approach life, regardless of whether it leads to success."
85,"Everyone knows that sports teams have an advantage when they play at home. But why is that? Many people think they understand, but professional sports are changing quickly, and what we used to believe is now being questioned. Two main factors are challenging the idea of home advantage: science and money. Sports scientists want to find out what helps players perform their best, and they have come up with many theories about home advantage. At the same time, those who invest money in sports want to know why home advantage is still important. If players are paid well, shouldn’t they feel comfortable playing anywhere?

This raises a question for fans. Would it matter if a team like Manchester United played some of their home games far away, like in the Far East, to reach more fans? It would matter to British fans who believe their team needs their support and loyalty. Fans often confuse the order of events; they think that when they cheer, it leads to a goal. They forget the many times they cheered but no goal was scored.

However, there is one common belief among fans that science seems to support. Home fans not only cheer for their team but also direct a lot of their noise at the referee. In a well-known study, referees watched a match with crowd noise and another version without sound. The referees who heard the crowd were less likely to call fouls against the home team. This suggests that referees try to avoid making calls that would upset the home crowd, rather than just doing what the crowd wants.

Recent studies show that home advantage has decreased in all major sports, but not as much as expected. For example, in the early years of the Football League in the 1890s, home teams won about 70% of the points, while today they win about 60%. One reason for this change could be travel. In the past, traveling was difficult, but now players travel in comfort, and if their hotel isn’t good enough, the club will find them a better one. Stadiums also look more similar now, losing some of their unique character.

Despite these changes, the reasons for home advantage are still unclear. Different sports have different levels of home advantage. Basketball has the highest home advantage, followed by football, while baseball has the least. This might be because baseball focuses more on individual matchups rather than teamwork. In team sports like basketball, players rely on each other, and playing at home boosts their confidence.

Another interesting point is that players’ testosterone levels are higher before home games, which might relate to a natural instinct to protect their home ground. In recent Rugby World Cup games, underdog teams won at home against stronger opponents, showing the power of home advantage. As one referee said, “It’s the law of the jungle out there.”"
86,"""The more I practice, the luckier I get,"" said golfer Gary Player about fifty years ago. This saying is popular among many dedicated athletes and their coaches. The reason is clear. First, there is some debate about who originally said it, as many golfers from that time have been suggested. Second, the meaning is not straightforward. Player did not mean ""lucky"" in a real sense; he was being ironic. His true message was: ""The more I practice, the better I become."" 

However, there is a limit to this idea. The question of where that limit is, or if it even exists, relates to the nature versus nurture debate. This debate discusses whether talent is something we are born with or something we develop through practice. It is not really a balanced debate; nurture has clearly won. The idea that practice is more important than natural talent in sports, music, business, and other areas comes from psychologist Anders Ericsson. He is known for the theory that anyone can become an expert in any field with 10,000 hours of practice. This theory has inspired many popular books, including Malcolm Gladwell's ""Outliers,"" as well as ""Talent Is Overrated"" and ""Bounce: The Myth of Talent and the Power of Practice."" All these books generally agree that practice is the most important factor, suggesting that 10,000 hours of practice is enough to make someone an expert.

However, as Epstein discusses in his interesting book, this idea is often not true. He points out a major problem in much of the research on what makes people excellent: it usually focuses only on successful individuals. He asks if there are better ways to understand why some people have certain abilities while others do not, and how to separate natural talent from factors like environment, support, opportunity, and determination. 

Epstein travels around the world, from Kenya to Sweden and the Caribbean to the Arctic, to find answers. In Alaska, he discovers that the drive and desire of sled dogs in a tough race may be influenced by their genes, suggesting a link between genetics and traits we think are voluntary. This raises the question: can determination be a choice, or is it partly genetic, as seen in the case of the huskies? 

This complexity is important. Epstein makes a distinction between ""hardware"" (nature) and ""software"" (nurture), agreeing that both are necessary for elite athletes. He does not deny the importance of training or environment. For example, he suggests that if Usain Bolt had grown up in the US, he might have become a good basketball player instead of the fastest man in history. However, he also looks at cases where genetics play a significant role that cannot be ignored. He also discusses race and gender, asking, ""If only practice matters, why do we separate men and women in sports?"" Sometimes, the best questions are the most obvious ones."
87,"A recent international report shows that many children in rich, industrialized countries feel lonely and unhappy. Jay Griffiths asks a simple question: why are today’s children so unhappy? In her new book, Kith, she explains that these children spend too much time indoors, stuck in front of screens like televisions and computers, and have lost touch with nature – the woods, mountains, rivers, and streams. She believes this is the main problem.

A follow-up study interviewed some children to understand their feelings better. The children did not express a strong desire for new technology; instead, many said they would be happier if they could spend more time outside. Older generations often remember their own childhoods fondly, recalling how they explored nature, swam in ponds, and built forts. They believe this was healthier than the protected lives of today’s children. However, they often forget that they created these protective environments for their kids, avoiding risks like building forts in old sheds.

Griffiths’ book includes strong arguments about the fear parents have regarding outdoor dangers and how this fear benefits the toy and gadget industry, which sells products to keep children entertained at home. She also criticizes trends like giving medication to restless children or requiring safety goggles for playground games. While it’s unclear how common these rules are, Griffiths expresses her frustration passionately.

However, Griffiths sometimes goes too far with her ideas and ignores important counterarguments. At one point, she even compares the treatment of children today to a form of racism, which seems extreme. She tends to have a romantic view of children, believing they are naturally good and creative, but this view may not reflect reality, especially when dealing with energetic groups of young kids.

One of the main ideas in her book is that children should have the freedom to explore and take risks. Griffiths argues that children need to experience small accidents to learn how to handle bigger dangers later. However, she does not explain how to create these safe accidents. Additionally, not all children may want the adventurous lifestyle she admires. What about those who are shy, prefer staying at home, or are more cautious? Perhaps the real issue is that society often tries to fit all children into the same mold, whether by keeping them too safe or pushing them too hard to explore."
88,"I am a research bio-psychologist with a PhD, which means I have studied a lot. I am good at solving problems in my work and life, but this skill does not come only from my education. Many life problems cannot be solved with complicated formulas or memorized answers from school. They need judgment, wisdom, and creativity that come from real-life experiences. For children, these experiences often happen through play. 

My recent research focuses on how important play is for children's development. All young mammals, including humans, play, and those who have the most to learn tend to play the most. Carnivores, like lions, play more than herbivores, like cows, because hunting is harder to learn than grazing. Primates, like monkeys, play more than other mammals because they rely more on learning than on instincts. Children, who have a lot to learn, play more than any other young primates when they are allowed to.

Play is a natural way for both adults and young mammals to learn. The most important skills children need to live happy and productive lives cannot be taught in school. These skills are learned and practiced through play. They include thinking creatively, getting along with others, cooperating, and controlling emotions. Creativity is essential for success in today’s economy. We no longer need people who just follow instructions or do simple calculations. We need people who can ask new questions and solve new problems. If we can encourage creative thinkers, we will have a strong workforce.

However, we cannot teach creativity directly. School can sometimes take away creativity by focusing on fixed questions and answers instead of encouraging children to ask their own questions. It is also very important for children to learn how to get along with others, care for them, and cooperate. Children naturally want to play with each other, and through play, they learn social skills, fairness, and morality, which are important for their future.

Play is voluntary, meaning players can choose to stop whenever they want. If they cannot quit, it is not really play. Players understand that to keep the game fun, they must make sure everyone is happy. This ability to quit makes play a very democratic activity.

Unfortunately, school has become more stressful. There are fewer breaks, more homework, and greater pressure for high grades. Outside of school, organized sports have taken the place of spontaneous games. Supervised playdates have replaced unsupervised neighborhood play, and adults often feel they need to step in instead of letting children solve their own problems. These changes have happened slowly but have had a big impact over time. They are caused by various social factors, including parents' fears, warnings from experts about dangers, less connected neighborhoods, and the belief that children learn more from adults than from each other.

Our children do not need more school; they need more play. If we care about our children and future generations, we must change the negative trend of the past fifty years. We need to give childhood back to children. They should be allowed to play and explore freely so they can grow into strong adults ready for an unpredictable future."
89,"In many countries, more young people in their twenties are using social media to find jobs. Websites like Twitter and LinkedIn allow them to connect directly with potential employers, which is much easier than the old way of standing outside an office with a sign saying ""hire me."" However, this increased access also means there is a higher chance of making mistakes.

For example, a young job seeker in the US reached out to a senior marketing executive on LinkedIn. This executive had many important contacts, and the job seeker thought she might help him. But the executive was upset by the request. She felt it was wrong to share her contacts with someone she didn’t know. Instead of just rejecting his request, she sent a harsh and sarcastic message that became very popular online. Many people were shocked by her response, and she might regret how she handled the situation. However, if this incident makes young people think more carefully about using social media for work, it could actually help them.

Social media can be risky for job seekers who don’t know how to use it properly. Many young people are making mistakes. Ironically, social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter have been a big part of young people's social lives for years. When older generations were teenagers, social media was a way to escape from parents and teachers. It was a place to show off and create a different image of themselves. You could have long conversations online and then ignore the same person at school. With the right pictures and songs on Facebook, you could seem like a more interesting person overnight. 

However, using social media for professional networking is very different. For some young people, the line between personal and professional use is not clear. They may still think that being bold and confident online is a good idea. Just because many people liked your posts on Facebook doesn’t mean you can impress employers on LinkedIn. Young people need to understand that the rules of social networking have changed, and they must meet employers’ expectations to succeed in the job market.

One common complaint from employers is that young job seekers are too casual in their messages and come off as arrogant. This reinforces the idea that young people feel entitled. In reality, many young people are struggling to find jobs, which is why they are using social media. This perception of arrogance can hurt their chances, even if they have the skills and motivation to be valuable employees.

So, how should you contact someone on a professional networking site? First, clearly introduce yourself and explain what you can offer them, like doing some research or helping in another way. This approach increases your chances of getting a positive response. Avoid sending generic messages, and keep your tone respectful to leave a good impression. Remember, social media can be a great way to make important connections, but it requires careful use to avoid being ignored."
90,"Anyone who claims they can accurately predict the future of newspapers is either lying or mistaken. The numbers show that newspapers are in trouble. Since 2000, the circulation of most UK national daily newspapers has dropped by 30 to 50 percent. According to the Pew Research Centre in the USA, only 26 percent of Americans now get their news from newspapers, down from 45 percent in 2001. Many people confidently say that printed newspapers will disappear within 15 years. However, history shows that old forms of media often survive. 

For example, in 1835, a journalist in New York claimed that books and theater were finished and that newspapers would become the most important source of information. Yet, theater has survived alongside newspapers, cinema, and television. Radio has also thrived during the television era, and cinema has continued to do well despite the rise of videos and DVDs. Even vinyl records have made a comeback, with online sales increasing by 745 percent since 2008.

Newspapers were once a new form of media themselves, but it took centuries for them to become the main source of news. This change happened in the mid-19th century when new technologies like the steam press, railways, and telegraphs made it possible to produce and distribute news quickly. People began to expect regular updates about the world around them, which was a new idea compared to earlier times when life was seen as more predictable and cyclical.

Before the 19th century, journalism was not a full-time job that could support a living. Even then, many people did not see the need for regular news updates. The fixed schedule and format of newspapers can be limiting. In contrast, online news allows readers to choose when and how they want to access information. Advanced search engines and algorithms help us find news that matches our interests. When major news events happen, online news sources can provide real-time updates. Mistakes can be corrected quickly, and there are no space limits for stories.

However, many news providers seem focused on being the first to report news rather than helping people understand it. This creates confusion, similar to how news was shared in medieval times, where truth often mixed with rumors and misunderstandings. Newspapers have not always done a great job of explaining how the world works. They may be facing extinction, or perhaps, as the internet adds to our feeling of living in a chaotic world, newspapers will find a way to help us gain wisdom and understanding."
91,"If humans were truly comfortable under the moon and stars, we would walk in the dark happily, just like many animals that thrive at night. However, we are daytime creatures, with eyes that are made for sunlight. This fact is deeply rooted in our genes, even if we don’t often think about being daytime beings, just like we don’t think about being primates or mammals. This is important to understand because it explains what we have done to the night. We have changed the night by filling it with artificial light. This control is similar to building a dam on a river. While there are benefits to this, it also leads to problems known as light pollution, which scientists are just starting to study.

Light pollution mainly comes from poor lighting design that allows artificial light to shine into the sky instead of focusing it down where it is needed. Bad lighting brightens the night, changing the light levels that many living things, including us, have adapted to. When artificial light spreads into nature, it affects important life activities like migration, reproduction, and feeding.

For most of human history, the term ‘light pollution’ would not have made sense. Imagine walking towards London on a moonlit night around 1800, when it was the most populated city in the world. Nearly a million people lived there, using candles, torches, and lanterns for light. Only a few homes had gas lighting, and there were no public gaslights in the streets for another seven years. From a distance, you would have been more likely to smell London than to see its faint glow.

We have brightened the night as if it were empty, but that is far from the truth. There are many nocturnal species among mammals. Light is a strong force in nature, attracting many species to it. Scientists have observed that songbirds and seabirds can be ‘captured’ by bright lights, circling around them until they fall. Birds that migrate at night often crash into brightly lit tall buildings, and young birds on their first journey are especially affected. Some birds, like blackbirds and nightingales, sing at odd hours because of artificial light.

It was once believed that light pollution only bothered astronomers, who need to see the night sky clearly. While most of us may not need a perfect view of the stars for our work, we still need darkness. Rejecting darkness is pointless. It is just as important for our health as light is. Changing our natural sleep and wake cycles can lead to health problems. The regular pattern of waking and sleeping is a biological reflection of the natural light changes on Earth. These patterns are so essential to our existence that disrupting them is like changing our center of balance.

In the end, humans are just as affected by light pollution as frogs living near a bright highway. By living in our own artificial light, we have disconnected ourselves from our natural and cultural roots – the light of the stars and the natural rhythms of day and night. Light pollution makes us forget our true place in the universe and the vastness of our existence, which is best understood against the backdrop of a dark night filled with the Milky Way above us."
92,"The founder of a large international company recently said that his business will stop tracking how much paid holiday time employees take. This decision seems to be inspired by a similar policy from a smaller internet company. The founder mentioned that he got the idea from a cheerful email from his daughter, which many newspapers have shared. However, this way of announcing the change feels like an attempt to make a serious policy seem friendlier.

But is this idea practical? The internet company has 2,000 employees and offers one service, while the multinational corporation has 50,000 employees and many different services, such as finance, transport, and healthcare. The idea of ""take as much time off as you want"" might work better in a smaller company where employees know each other's workloads. In a big company, it is hard to be sure that taking time off won’t hurt the business or their careers.

The founder said employees can take as much leave as they want, as long as they feel completely sure that their team is up to date on all projects and that their absence won’t harm the business. But is it really possible to be that sure? No matter how much work someone finishes before a holiday, there will always be more work waiting when they return. This means that employees might feel guilty about taking time off, which can lead to stress. If workers don’t take enough leave, it could lower their productivity over time.

There may also be pressure from coworkers and office gossip about who is taking time off and for how long. In many companies, especially in the corporate world, there is a culture of working late, which could lead to a situation where employees feel they cannot take holidays, especially if they want to get promoted. If the security and rights that come with regular leave are taken away, employees might feel they cannot take the time off they need, fearing they will seem lazy.

This policy could create a situation where workers feel stuck and do not take their entitled leave. They might still use their legal rights as a guideline, making the new policy pointless. Modern technology allows employees to receive work messages anytime and anywhere, which makes it hard to separate work from personal time. The internet company started its unlimited leave policy because employees wanted to know how to balance this new way of working with the old time-off rules.

However, having no set working hours can lead to a situation where every hour could be considered working time. Employees might feel they are always being watched by their employer, which can lead to stress and unhealthy self-discipline. Employment laws exist for a reason: workers have the right to a minimum amount of paid leave because rest is important for their mental and physical health. The benefits of unlimited leave, like better morale and creativity, can happen without sacrificing worker well-being. Therefore, I am not convinced that allowing employees to take as much holiday as they want is truly the goal or will be the result of this policy."
93,"Journal-based peer review is the process where experts in a field evaluate a scientific research paper before it is published. This process is seen as a way to ensure the quality of research. It is believed to help prevent the publication of flawed or nonsensical papers, and scientists often mention it positively when speaking to the media or the public. However, reviewing a paper can delay its publication by up to a year. Is this delay worth it to ensure the trustworthiness of published research? The answer is both yes and no. 

The current state of scientific publishing is changing. While I still believe that all papers should go through some form of review before being published, I see that things are shifting. The increasing use of preprints—drafts of papers shared online without peer review—plays an important role in this change. Preprints allow researchers to quickly share new findings so that others can read, critique, and build on them. 

Publishing in journals has become more about gaining recognition and advancing careers, which has affected both authors and reviewers. The competition for publication in prestigious journals encourages scientists to produce high-quality work, and these journals do publish excellent research. However, the pressure to publish in top journals can lead to shortcuts, where important data is left out to make the research look better. Reviewers are often more focused on whether a paper is good enough for a specific journal rather than its overall quality. For top journals, the decision can depend on how relevant or newsworthy the research is, rather than just its scientific merit.

These issues are well-known, but many people are hesitant to change the current system. However, as biologist Ron Vale recently suggested, preprints could offer a solution because they do not require a major change from the existing system. Although preprint archives have existed for twenty years, they have not been widely accepted. This slow adoption is partly due to scientists' conservative nature and the misconception that journals will not accept papers that have been posted as preprints. There is also a concern that publishing papers without peer review could lead to the spread of poor-quality research, but this has not happened so far.

Preprints may not be peer-reviewed, but authors understand that their work will be open to critique and discussion from a global community of reviewers. For example, psychology professor Tanya Elks shared her experience of critiquing a published paper. In the traditional peer review system, the original authors could block critical papers, or if they were not chosen as reviewers, they might complain about misrepresentation. By posting a preprint, both sides could share their views openly, allowing readers to assess the quality of the arguments. 

Preprint archives facilitate informal scientific discussions that used to happen only between individuals. They can also provide a platform for sharing negative results, which are often overlooked by journals focused on new discoveries. Additionally, being on preprint archives increases the chances that papers will be read and cited by others, showing the effectiveness of sharing research this way. By embracing the internet's culture of openness and collaboration, preprints can help shift the focus back to the quality of the research itself, rather than where it is published."
94,"When I ask my literature students what a poem is, they often say it is ""a painting in words."" However, this answer usually does not satisfy them or me. One day, I asked a group of students to choose an object and write two paragraphs about it. The first paragraph was a scientific description, and the second was from the object's point of view, titled ""Poem."" One student wrote about an oxygen mask, saying it may look strange or scary, but it helps people breathe in emergencies. This unusual choice helped the class understand how poetry works in a unique way. 

In school, I found poetry confusing. I thought every poem was a silly puzzle that made it hard to understand feelings. After school, many people pay less attention to poetry. Sometimes, a poem stands out because it is not continuous prose. It challenges you to read it, but often you feel let down by its simplicity or difficulty. Still, you feel good for trying. 

What do we want from poems? We might expect them to express deep feelings, beautiful images, or clever humor. While this is true, we often turn to movies for tears, articles for information, novels for escape, and music for enjoyment. However, one important quality of poetry is its ambiguity, which reflects the uncertainty of everyday life. 

If you look up ""poem"" in an online encyclopedia, it will lead you to ""poetry,"" defined as a form of literary art that uses the beauty and rhythm of language. This definition is fine, but it does not capture the essence of the word. ""Poem"" comes from the Greek word ""poí?ma,"" meaning ""a thing made,"" and a poet is someone who makes things. So, what kind of thing is a poem? 

Some poets compare poems to wild animals, which are unpredictable, or to machines, which are precise. However, these comparisons can break down when examined closely. The real value in trying to define a poem lies in the discussion it creates. Whether you see a poem as a machine or a wild animal, this debate can change how you think about both. It encourages us to see ordinary things in new ways. 

We can easily think of poems as mental objects, especially since song lyrics often stick in our minds. The combination of words and melody has a strong impact, similar to schoolyard rhymes like ""Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt me."" But sometimes, words can hurt, just like sticks and stones. 

When you see a poem in a newspaper or magazine, it can have a powerful effect, even though it is just ink on paper like the prose around it. The empty space around the poem could have been used for a longer article or an ad. A poem is created through writing and rewriting, just like an article or story, but it is not usually made to be sold. Publishers promote poetry collections, but few expect them to make money. A poem exists for its own sake, and because of its unique place in a magazine or book, it can still surprise us, even if just for a moment."
95,"I bought my first metal detector shortly after I got married. At that time, £70 was a lot of money, and I could have used it for something practical for our home. However, my wife, Marion, was impressed when I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first outing. Over the years, every brooch and coin I discovered brought me joy because it made me feel connected to the past. But after the gold ring, it took 40 years before I found something that impressed Marion again.

One dull February afternoon, I had a couple of hours free and a place in mind to search. It was raining, so I chose a nearby spot where I knew there were old farming tools. When my detector first beeped, I found a piece of a metal wheel. Then it beeped again. I tried to ignore it, but I couldn’t walk away without checking. I dug down about half a meter and lay in the mud when I saw a rounded, golden ball. I had found brass curtain rails before, so I tried not to get my hopes up. But as I cleaned it off, it turned into a thick, beautifully designed loop. I stopped and stared, remembering to breathe. I had seen something like this before—the Great Torc, which is in the British Museum. It’s a famous piece from Iron Age Britain, over 2,000 years old. A torc is a beautiful necklace made of gold and silver, with gold rings at each end, just like the one I found.

I took it to my car and kept looking at it on the passenger seat during the drive home. I rinsed it in my kitchen sink, which was probably the only cleaning it had since ancient times. “Marion!” I shouted, “I have something for you.” As I admired my find, I heard my wife come in and stop. “What is it?” she asked after a moment. I told her it was a very old and rare piece of jewelry. We didn’t try it on because we were afraid of damaging it. At bedtime, I hid it in our wardrobe. We had never been robbed, but I felt anxious. So, I got up, unscrewed a floorboard in my office, and hid it there.

The law says that I must report such finds to the authorities within 14 days. I wanted to enjoy the torc as much as I could before giving it up. I even took it in a plastic bag to show a friend in the hospital. Finally, I brought it to the council office in the same bag. The registrar was talking to someone when I placed the torc on his desk. He turned around, stopped talking, and was amazed. The torc was confirmed as authentic and later sold to my local council. It is now in the British Museum in London. The £350,000 from the sale was shared between the owner of the field and me. 

But the torc means more to me than just money. I feel like I have saved it for the nation. People often say, “Now that you’ve found something so amazing, will you stop detecting?” But I still find brooches and coins interesting. Besides, if a fisherman catches a big fish, he doesn’t stop fishing—there’s always a chance of catching an even bigger one tomorrow."
96,"Sleeping is one of my favorite parts of traveling, but I don’t talk about it much because I feel a bit guilty. When my friends share their carefully planned trips, filled with activities like visiting museums and hiking, I just smile and don’t say much. What would they think if they knew that my travel plans often include long naps during afternoon rainstorms and lazy mornings in comfortable beds? Better sleep is one of the nice benefits of traveling. 

When I visited Mexico's Yucatán coast in my early 20s, I was surprised by how many hours I spent sleeping—more than 12 hours most days. There were many noisy birds nearby, but it didn’t bother me. Away from home and my own bed, surrounded by new smells and sounds, I could sleep deeply and enjoyably. Without alarm clocks and responsibilities, sleep comes more easily. 

I believe that sleep is not just a break from traveling; it is part of the travel experience. When we travel, we expose ourselves to new sights, sounds, and cultures. All this new information fills our minds, and when we sleep, we process it. This is why sleep can feel so much more intense while traveling. 

People often worry about jet lag, but I think the challenges I face after long trips are more about adjusting to new cultures than just time differences. For example, on the Caribbean island of Trinidad, people wake up early to avoid the heat, slow down around 10 a.m. when the sun is strong, and then become active again in the cool evening. Even though Trinidad is only one hour ahead of New York, it takes me days to get used to the island's different sleep patterns. When I finally adjust, I feel like I have truly arrived.

I remember one afternoon in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic, when I had a big lunch with new friends in an apartment overlooking the beautiful Caribbean Sea. After eating, we all felt sleepy, and one by one, my friends went to relax on hammocks and sofas. I realized why they had so many pillows around. I took some for myself and joined them. I had heard about the Latin American tradition of the siesta, but that day I really experienced it. I shared not just sleep, but a piece of Dominican life.

Travel sleep has another great quality: I remember it. Being away from my usual routine, I enjoy the new smells, textures, and sounds that fill my mind while I sleep. If the idea of ‘slow travel’—enjoying every moment instead of rushing—is what makes a modern traveler aware, then what is slower than sleep? Maybe I should stop feeling embarrassed about my love for sleep while traveling and tell my ambitious friends that travel sleep is an important part of the experience too."
97,"The woman turned away from the mirror and asked, ""What do you think? Please be honest."" Mia picked up a medium-sized hat that was soft and had a nice layer of gauze and a silk bow. ""I still think this one looks best on you,"" she said diplomatically. The woman wrinkled her nose and made a face that made her look like a bulldog. ""But it’s so boring,"" she replied. ""Every other woman will wear a hat like that at my daughter’s wedding. This beautiful little hat will help me stand out."" She sighed and touched the red and black mini top hat on her head. ""Yes, this is the one I want,"" she decided. 

Mia knew she couldn’t change the woman’s mind. With a smile, she agreed that the woman would indeed stand out at the wedding. Mia then thought about her own daughter, Jen. Today was Jen’s thirtieth birthday, and they were having a family gathering. It had been a while since they had all been together, and Mia was excited to see Jen, Dan, and Luke. She was also looking forward to meeting Jen’s friend, Tattie, whom they didn’t know anything about. When Jen called last week to ask if she could bring Tattie, Mia’s husband, Jeff, had quickly reacted. ""Tattie? What kind of name is that?"" he asked. ""It’s short for Tatiana,"" Mia explained. ""I think it’s nice."" Jeff replied, ""It sounds very pretentious."" He didn’t like anything that seemed showy or fancy. He also didn’t understand Mia’s polite way of speaking. He would have told the woman in the shop that she was choosing the wrong hat and might have even said that a dustbin lid would look better on her. ""The problem with you, Mia,"" he often said, ""is that you’re too polite."" 

An hour later, Mia closed her shop and entered her home, Medlar House, which was just a short walk from her work. Four years ago, when Luke, their youngest child, moved out, Mia decided to turn the unused barn next to their house into a bright space for her business. Jeff was doubtful. ""Do you really think people want to buy hats?"" he asked. But Mia knew from her friends that many women struggled to find the perfect hat for special occasions, so she was sure there was a demand. She was right. From the first day, after Jen helped her create a website, Mia’s Hats became successful. Women traveled from far away to visit her shop in Little Pelham, where she created a relaxed and welcoming atmosphere. She let customers try on as many hats as they needed to find the right one. She encouraged them to bring their outfits to make sure everything matched. Recently, she also started selling handbags and costume jewelry."
98,"It’s a long journey from London to Atlanta, and now in his new American home, Lawrence Okoye reflects on his incredible sports journey. He feels confident but is also surprised by how far he has come, from competing in the Olympic discus final to possibly starting a new career in American football. Even though he has never played American football before, it looks like he might be chosen for one of the major teams in the USA.

In Atlanta, Lawrence is still figuring out what his new position involves. The idea that a 21-year-old beginner from London could be selected for one of the biggest teams in American sports seems unbelievable. However, Lawrence is known for proving people wrong. He was offered a place at Oxford University to study law but decided to focus on training for the discus instead, after previously playing rugby. Within 20 months of starting discus training, he became the fourth-best discus thrower in the world.

Lawrence originally went to Atlanta for warm-weather training for the discus, preparing for the world championships. He says, “Yes,” when asked if he is really considering a big NFL contract. He had thought about American football before, but it was only when he arrived in the USA that he decided to give it a try. After arriving, he learned about the NFL trials in Atlanta. Even though he had never played the game, he felt confident enough to apply for the trials. 

When asked if he was nervous about competing against experienced players, he replied, “No, not at all. I don’t get nervous for many things.” Although he doesn’t talk a lot, he is sure of his abilities. His performance in various tests showed that he was the most impressive player. “I was very happy to hear that,” he said, showing a rare moment of pride.

However, he is also cautious. He has no experience in American football, so how can he make it onto an NFL team? He says, “From what coaches have told me, I have all the qualities needed. It’s just about how hard I work.” When asked if he will be relaxed while waiting to hear if he has been selected, he said, “I will be. There’s no pressure on me. Many people say I will definitely be chosen, but I’m not too worried.”

This calmness might come from his disappointing experience in the Olympic discus final, where he finished last. He seems to have moved on from that moment and is proud that he qualified for the final with a great last throw. “That was an amazing day,” he says. “The final didn’t go as I wanted, but that’s part of sports. I can always return to it.”

After his Olympic disappointment, some people thought he had let that experience affect him. Lawrence does not want to comment on that. The minimum salary for an NFL player is over $400,000 a year, so the financial reasons are clear. Lawrence has switched from rugby to athletics and now to American football. With all his physical talents, wouldn’t it be better to focus on just one sport? He replies, “I understand why someone would say that. I’m trying to achieve something I’ve dreamed about since I was a kid. If it doesn’t work out, I can go back to the discus, the sport I love. Every decision I’ve made has been thought out.”"
99,"We had been flying east all night, and I woke up to see that it was already daylight. Looking out of the window, I saw the empty landscape below. The dark shades of brown and green made me feel better because, even though it was mid-September, it still looked like summer in Siberia. There were no signs of people, just mountains, streams, and forests stretching to the horizon. I shook my head. My neighbor woke up and smiled at me sleepily. “Good morning, Robert,” he said, saying my name with a slow Russian accent. Sergei was a salesman from Moscow, flying to the remote areas to sell safety clothing to local mining companies. His English was almost as poor as my Russian, but with a dictionary, I managed to tell him that I was going to the far-eastern Siberian city of Magadan with a one-way ticket because I planned to ride my bicycle back home to England. 

“But, Robert,” he said, “there is no road from Magadan; you cannot ride a bicycle.” I explained that I believed there was a road, even if not many people used it now. “Alone?” he asked, pointing at me. “No, I will be riding with a friend called Al.” “Just one friend?” “Yes, just one,” I nodded. Sergei still looked unsure and pointed outside, saying “Holodna” (cold). I tried to convince him by using hand gestures to show that I had a lot of warm clothes, but I didn’t mention that I was on a tight budget. Most of my clothes and gear were bought at low prices. I wasn’t sure if they would be good enough, especially my big postman’s over-trousers that I bought for £10.

It all started in a lecture hall in Scotland. That morning, the hall was full of tired students. Some were taking notes without much energy. The lecturer was speaking on and on. I was thinking about a dilemma: Should I ask him or not? “Well, why not?” I wrote a note: “Hi Al, Do you want to cycle across the Karakorum Highway between Pakistan and China this summer? Rob.” Al, my old school friend, was sitting in front of me. I tapped him on the shoulder and passed the note. He tried to read my handwriting, wrote something back, and passed it to me. I held my breath while I read it: “OK.” 

Six years later, I was going to join Al in Siberia. I had been working as a geography teacher. Although I didn’t have full control of my classes, the job was often challenging, rarely boring, and fulfilling. Plus, there were long holidays to go on adventures. Twice since I started teaching, I had used these holidays to meet Al. He had caught the adventure bug after our bike ride through Pakistan and decided to cycle around the world instead of teaching. Since our first ride together, Al had taken on bigger challenges. This round-the-world bike trip was his biggest yet. Sometimes he thought the ride would break him. Even though it sounded tough, I envied him. He was having an amazing adventure, facing new challenges every day, proving the doubters wrong. He was doing something that scared him almost every day, and it made him feel alive."
100,"In The Red Bull Air Race, twelve pilots compete by flying through tall pylons that are between 15 and 25 meters high. They make sharp turns, barrel rolls, and loops while flying at speeds of up to 370 km per hour. I was invited to experience what it feels like to be part of this race. 

An hour before my flight, I had to sign two forms. The first one confirmed that I was healthy, and the second one stated that I would empty my pockets because small objects can be dangerous during the flight. I learned that I needed to stay oriented and that ""the horizon is your best friend."" The pilot would tell me where to look. I also had to promise to relax and enjoy the view when flying upside down.

Half an hour before the flight, I received a safety briefing. I was told not to touch anything during the flight. As we were getting ready to take off, I was nervous. I had to keep my legs up, avoid touching the important steering pedals, and not rest my hands on any switches. I decided that I would not relax and enjoy the flight, even though I knew I needed to stay calm and focused to survive the experience.

When we started to accelerate down the runway, I felt anxious. Dario, the pilot, and I were in the Zivko Edge 540, one of the fastest acrobatic planes in the world. The plane took off, and just two seconds later, we made a sharp turn to the right. I felt the air push out of my lungs. I looked at the horizon, tensed my body, and gasped as I sank into my seat. For a moment, I felt like I weighed 6.2 times my normal weight. Then we leveled out and made another sharp left turn, diving down. 

We were now just 10 meters off the ground, aiming for a small space between two pylons. We passed them at 400 km per hour, and I felt a rush of excitement, but then we made another sharp turn. I was allowed to fly the plane for two minutes, but my hands were shaking so much that the plane shook too. Dario spoke to me, but I couldn’t hear him. Instead of answering, he did a barrel roll, turning the plane completely upside down. 

“Are you okay?” he asked. “Yes,” I replied. “Have you had enough?” “No,” I lied. Then he did a loop, flying up and over in a full circle. I know many people would find this thrilling, like riding a rollercoaster, but I thought it was too much. At the top of the loop, while we were upside down, I heard a voice saying, “Relax, relax, look up.” I looked up and saw some fields below us.

The flight lasted about 10 minutes, and it felt easy compared to what the pilots experience during races. As soon as we landed, Dario took out some sandwiches and started eating. I didn’t eat for hours, and that night, I kept dreaming about doing loops in the air."
101,"Doug Allan films wild animals in cold places. If you have ever been impressed by videos of polar bears in a nature documentary, it is likely that he filmed them. He says his ideal temperature is -18°C. Allan trained as a marine biologist and commercial diver. Diving was his first love, where he learned how to survive in cold environments. His big opportunity came when a TV crew arrived in Antarctica, where Allan was working, to make a wildlife documentary. ""I ended up showing the crew around, and after 48 hours, I realized that being a wildlife cameraman was perfect for me: travel, adventure, and underwater work,"" he explains. Now, he is a top cameraman and has worked on many important TV wildlife series.

""When I started, not many people had been to Antarctica. There were people who focused on coral, elephants, and chimpanzees. I became known as the 'cold man.' It felt like there were so many amazing moments waiting to be filmed."" When he began 35 years ago, the camera and communication technology were very basic. ""It is much easier to film today. Back then, if you shot something, you had to remember it. Now, with digital technology, you can film a lot and see it right away. You had to think about what shots you needed next and what you missed. You filmed less because film was very expensive. Today, you can have too much footage.""

""My experience in cold conditions is valuable. I know how to handle it. I have spent so much time on sea ice that it feels as easy as crossing the street. I do get cold toes, but the poles are healthy places. There are no leeches, diseases, or mosquitoes."" Allan says that wildlife filming has many successes, but also failures and embarrassing moments. Once, he was in the Orkneys to film kittiwakes, but he could not identify the birds.

Recently, Allan got permission to film for a major TV series in Kong Karls Land, a group of islands in the Arctic Ocean. He knew it would not be easy. This area is home to polar bears and is only for the bravest or most foolish. In April, it is usually -32°C, the wind is strong, and carrying cameras through deep snow is very difficult. After walking for five or more hours a day and watching polar bear dens for 23 days, Allan had only seen one mother bear and her cub. However, on day 24, he felt like he was part of the bear world, moving and sensing like a bear. 

""We find a new hole and wait. We shuffle, hop, bend, stretch, and run to stay warm. After five hours of watching, I catch a quick glimpse that I almost miss. But the camera is focused on the hole, and my eye is on the viewfinder. After a few seconds, I see an unmistakable black nose. The nose becomes a muzzle, then a full head, and in less than a minute, she has her front legs out and is resting on the snow. She looks at me but is not scared. Just as I think it can't get better, she slides down the slope, seemingly enjoying herself,"" he recalls. Then, two cubs appeared at the den entrance. ""Clearly, it’s their first view of the world. It’s showtime on the slopes, and we have front-row seats.""

Now, Allan wants to make his own film about climate change in the Arctic, talking to the people who live there and see its effects firsthand. He believes he could create an extraordinary documentary."
102,"In 2004, Pen Hadow became the first person to walk alone to the North Pole without getting supplies along the way. This journey involved swimming in extremely cold water, dealing with frostbite, and facing polar bears. Just eight months later, he reached the South Pole too. Now, he is back in the Arctic, getting ready for an even bigger adventure. Explorers like Pen are confident and determined. This time, however, the mission is very important. Pen and two colleagues will go on a three-month, 1,000-kilometre trek to the North Pole to measure the thickness and density of the ice. No one has done this before, and the results will be crucial for scientists. This research will show how global warming is affecting the ice in the polar regions.

Pen was prepared for this kind of work from a young age. His father’s old nanny, who had worked for the famous polar explorer Scott of the Antarctic, helped toughen him up by sending him out into harsh weather with very few clothes. His father also inspired him with a love for adventures in cold places, and Pen developed great physical strength. He is married to Mary, who loves the outdoors too. She helps run his polar guide business and worries more about him when he is at home than when he is on an expedition. Once, she even raced against him in a mountain event, finishing an hour ahead of him. Pen and Mary live in the countryside with their two children. 

Pen admits that it is harder to be away from his family this time. When he last went on an expedition, his children were very young, and he made a mistake when saying goodbye. He told his son to take care of his mother and sister, which put too much pressure on the boy. This time, Pen plans to have little contact with them while he is in the Arctic because he believes that calling them will remind them of how far away he is. In the days before he leaves, he is carefully preparing his equipment. He knows that once he is on the ice, it will be very difficult to fix anything or do anything complicated.

Joining him on this expedition will be Ann Daniels, a leading polar explorer, and Martin Hartley, the expedition photographer. They will have a support team of six people who will fly in supplies. Pen feels that being part of a team can be stressful for him, and he is also worried about his age. He will turn 47 soon and feels he hasn’t trained as much as he should have. He often finds that organizing things takes more time than he expects, which makes him anxious about the challenges ahead.

Pen believes that this mission connects exploration with the search for knowledge, just like explorers in the past. He admits that reaching the North Pole was mainly a personal goal and didn’t help many people outside the adventure community. This time, however, scientists will benefit from the data they collect, and they want to involve as many people as possible in understanding what is happening in the Arctic Ocean. Pen feels that their skills, which might seem unusual, are now very important and useful to society."
103,"Text: 'I took a year off. What was I going to do? Being a successful Olympian is amazing. I had the opportunity to do more writing, TV work, and speak to businesses and schools. Although these activities were great, I didn’t have anything competitive to focus on. I wanted to stay in shape so I could compete for an Olympic spot if I felt inspired again. So, I signed up for marathons and triathlons. That should have been enough, but I kept thinking about Ben Fogle’s invitation: ‘Do you want to row across the Atlantic with me?’ I have always enjoyed rowing and the feeling of the boat moving through the water. I started to miss that feeling, but I wasn’t ready to train every day. Still, I wanted some kind of competition. I asked some of my rowing friends if they wanted to join the race, but they weren’t very excited. I knew that if I entered the race, even though it was called an adventure, I would want to win. Would rowing with Ben give me the best chance to win? No. But being an underdog without pressure was appealing. I contacted Ben. He was going to join the race anyway and had managed to gather the large entry fee and deposit for a boat, making the race a real possibility. We discussed the other costs; the boat and equipment would cost £70,000, which is a lot of money. We thought we had a better chance than most, but it would still take effort to secure it. Besides the race costs, I also had to think about the money I would lose by being away from home. Speaking at business conferences is one of the best ways to earn money as a retired athlete. It feels good that people are interested, but I find it hard to talk about my past achievements without a new goal. Joining the race would mean I wouldn’t just talk about what I did before; I would actually be doing something again: rowing across the Atlantic. I learned a lot while planning this adventure, but one of the biggest lessons was to appreciate the easy life of a full-time athlete. My preparation for the Olympics was tough, and my life was focused on getting in the best shape. Looking back, it was quite simple. Yes, I trained almost every day, but the training program was clear, and I had doctors and dieticians to help. I was worried about how people would see me racing with a TV presenter. I thought it might look like I just wanted to be on TV, and I should have chosen a better partner to win the race. However, my worries faded as we prepared. The Atlantic Rowing Race is about more than just rowing; it’s also about mental strength. Ben had completed the difficult Marathon des Sables, spent time at sea, and lived on a deserted island. But he couldn’t row well. I was surprised by how little he understood about rowing, and he was shocked by my lack of patience. I could have been more understanding, but I felt it was important to tell Ben how much he needed to improve. I should have realized that this was his level when I agreed to race with him.'"
104,"Just over a year ago, I left my job in London to work with huskies in the Arctic Circle in northern Finland. At 26, I felt restless and dreamed of cold, beautiful landscapes. I found a small company run by Anna McCormack and her husband, Pasi Ikonen, in Finnish Lapland. They hired me as a husky dog handler for the busy winter season. From December to February, they take tourists on sled rides pulled by huskies across the snow and ice, for trips that can last from one hour to five days. They started with six dogs, but now they have more than 100. They also took over a second property called the 'wilderness farm,' which is a simple place with unreliable electricity and no running water. They told me I could join the team for three months, but I needed to know that the work would be hard and physical. I started packing right away.

On November 6, while flying to Finland, I stared at a page with over 100 pictures of huskies. I was supposed to memorize their names, but I felt distracted and nervous. Instead, I looked out the window and saw winter coming, with rivers freezing over.

On November 7, I took a bus north through dark forests filled with snow-covered trees. We stopped for reindeer crossing the road. I arrived at the farm after dark, and as soon as I walked in, I was given a pair of boots and sent outside into the cold. Anna asked if I wanted to be thrown in at the deep end, and I followed the sound of barking to the dogsheds. There, I saw people running around, getting the excited huskies ready for sledding. I could barely introduce myself because everyone was too busy. I petted one of the quieter dogs, but then someone told me to get in the sled, and I almost fell in. With a command, we took off into the dark, using only a headlamp for light.

By November 15, I was starting to learn how to be a husky guide, but first, I faced some tough questions about my skills. Anna asked if I was useful, and I wasn’t sure. I realized I didn’t have much experience: I had never driven a snowmobile, done woodwork, or used an axe. But when someone asked if I had a driving license, I nodded, feeling relieved. 

I quickly learned the basics of dog-sledding: lean into the corners, use both feet on the brake to stop, and never let go of the handlebar. However, other tasks were challenging, like feeding and watering the dogs in freezing temperatures. Water would freeze quickly, so we had to make a 'soup' of meat in hot water for them. By the end of my first week, I was overwhelmed with instructions, and my muscles ached from pulling heavy sleds and being pulled by excited huskies. But I felt proud. I emailed my friends, saying, ""I can chop with an axe, hammer a nail, and use a circular saw—in the snow!"""
105,"On that day, as Radcliffe ran past the finish line, reporters gathered to understand her amazing performance. They noted that her time was fast enough to qualify for the men's marathon at the world championships in Paris. Curious journalists asked her about a special natural treatment called emu oil, which Olympic gold medalist Cathy Freeman had suggested to help Radcliffe recover from an injury caused by an accident during her training.

Radcliffe said that she didn’t fully realize how big her achievement was at the time. Looking back, she understands it was a significant moment, but she felt it was just what she was meant to do that day. She and her team had decided not to set any limits on their goals, following the motto: no limits.

During the race, Gary Lough, Radcliffe's husband and coach, was in a car with her support team, listening to the radio coverage. Gerard Hartmann, her physiotherapist, was also with him. After 16 kilometers, Radcliffe's agent worried that she might not be able to keep up her fast pace and could drop out of the race. Hartmann was angry at this concern, but he understood that someone who didn’t know how fit Radcliffe was might think it was risky to start so quickly.

With 800 meters left, Radcliffe started to think about her time. She realized she could finish in under 2 hours and 16 minutes if she ran the last part in less than three minutes. After running 41 kilometers at a fast speed, she managed to sprint the final distance in 2 minutes and 25 seconds. At the finish, she thought, ""I can run faster than that."" She remembered the race director, Dave Bedford, saying he never thought anyone would come close to that time for a long time. Radcliffe thought, ""I will come back and do it next year,"" and she really believed she could.

Unfortunately, that did not happen. After the race, everyone wanted to know how Radcliffe, who had an unusual running style, had beaten the skilled East African runners. Hartmann had worked with Radcliffe for weeks, giving her daily training sessions to help her manage the 250-300 kilometers she ran each week. He said, ""I've worked with 63 Olympic medalists, and no one could handle that level of pain like her. She would make me work hard, and I would have to ice my thumbs afterward because I was in so much pain.""

Hartmann described traveling 13 hours from his home in Ireland to Radcliffe's training base in France, only to be greeted by her husband saying, ""Gerard, you're 15 minutes late, Paula's waiting."" There was no time for a friendly greeting; Radcliffe was ready for a two-hour training session. ""Paula would push you to your limits, and that’s what made her so good."" 

Hartmann dedicated so much time to Radcliffe that his other athletes became jealous. When asked if she knew why no one has come close to her record, Radcliffe said, ""Not really. I trained very hard, but there are more talented people out there. I thought Mary Keitany, a two-time London marathon winner, would do it."" She explained that maybe people are more focused on competing against each other than on improving themselves. 

She added, ""That mental attitude of never slowing down, even when you are winning, probably helped me. I never thought, 'I can relax now,' it was always about pushing myself as hard as I could."" Radcliffe did not realize it at the time, but that marathon was the peak of her career. She would never run that fast again, but she inspired many women to take up long-distance running."
106,"When my first cooking show, In Search of Perfection, was released, I was unsure how viewers and critics would react. At that time, there was a lot of talk about a food ‘revolution’ happening in Britain. I believed we had created a series that truly contributed to this change, but I still worried: would people like a cooking show that included not just techniques but also history, memories, and science? I watched the first episode feeling both happy and nervous. I didn’t need to worry. The show became very successful, leading to many other interesting projects, including a book about my experiences at my restaurant. Each project felt like a journey, whether into the past, the mind, or cooking techniques.

I later wrote several books in a series called ‘Perfection’, each one linked to its own TV show. In these books, the journey was often physical, involving travel and planning. The latest book, In Search of Total Perfection, takes you around the world to meet amazing artisans, like a man who creates golden pasta that tastes better than any other. These artisans have spent years chasing their own ideas of perfection. 

Perfection is very personal. Even choosing which dishes to include in the series was difficult, and I knew I would disappoint some people by leaving out their favorites. I could imagine them asking, “Where’s steak and kidney pie and bread and butter pudding?” However, after a long meeting with the TV production team, we finally created a list that included something for everyone. This experience confirmed my belief that everyone has their own idea of perfection, shaped by their emotions, memories, and experiences.

Despite the book’s title, I knew I wouldn’t claim that the recipes were the best or final versions. I believed that by using my cooking skills and scientific knowledge, and by talking to food producers, artisans, chefs, and their customers, I could identify what made these dishes special. The dictionary defines ‘perfection’ as being perfect, but it also means improving through constant practice. It’s about trying new ideas and changing them until you create something unique.

The TV series allowed me to explore many foods, people, and places I had never seen in restaurants before. I was excited to discover how food connects to memories, as I started my career in a similar way. Finding the best ingredients took me around the world. I had many adventures, like visiting a canning factory that was processing the wrong type of tomato and going to a dairy farm that was so far from perfect that we had to stop filming there! While perfecting each recipe, I ended up hand-milking a cow and using dry ice to make ice cream, cooking chicken in a hospital machine, and almost burning my house down trying to get my oven hot enough for a real Neapolitan-style pizza."
107,"We were still a long way from Marrakech when the van made a loud noise, swerved off the road into a field, and stopped. John got out and opened the hood. He looked at the engine for a long time with his hands in his pockets, looking serious. “Actually, I have no idea what I’m doing,” he finally said, and he and Mum started to laugh. Bea was worried, “We can’t stay here forever,” she said. The field went on for miles, filled with grass and many flowers like poppies and daisies. “No, we can’t stay here forever,” I agreed, because it was best to support Bea. We got back into the van and waited for Mum and John to stop laughing. We watched John get smaller as he walked away to find someone who could help with the car. Mum lay down on the grass. “Tell us a story,” she said. Bea lay down next to her. “Go on, tell us a story.” So, I told them about how the day before we left London, I heard two birds talking. I shared everything they talked about: breadcrumbs, other birds, the weather, and an argument over a worm. “That’s silly, no one understands bird language,” Bea said. My eyes felt wet. “I do.” But I didn’t sound very sure. “Liar.” I felt embarrassed. How could I be lying if I remembered everything? The more I thought about it, the less sure I became. “Mum…?” But she had fallen asleep in the sun. 

John came back with three Moroccan boys who helped us push the van down the road to a hotel. Bea didn’t want to get out. The boys didn’t mind; they waved and smiled at her through the back windows. We followed John into a café that was not far from where our van was parked. “It’s a hotel,” John whispered. “It might be a bit expensive.” “We’ll just have some tea,” Mum said, and we sat in the shade. The tea was made from mint leaves and was very sweet. Mum looked into the pot. “It’s like syrup in there,” she said. We stayed at the café all day while John looked sadly at the engine. “I guess it’s a miracle it got us this far,” he said as it started to get dark. Mum took out blankets and made a bed for us in the hotel garden. It felt nice to sleep on the ground. “I’ll have to get us towed into Marrakech,” John said from the other side of Mum. 

Half an hour later, we were in a truck watching our van being pulled behind with John driving. At first, Bea didn’t want to move, so John picked her up and put her in the truck. Now she sat in the front with the driver. I kept thinking about how we would get home now that our van had to be towed everywhere. I thought it might be easier if we could take a boat straight to London. Then I must have fallen asleep."
108,"Lucy was at a welcome party in a hotel ballroom, talking to two other pianists who were also at the Prague Classical Music Festival. They were older than her by about ten years. One was a guy from Tokyo, and the other was a girl from a European city named Liesel or Louisa. They spoke good English and discussed the music they were playing and their recent travels. 

“I think I’m doing Tanglewood this summer,” Lucy said, trying to sound impressive. However, she didn’t really want to go to the Tanglewood festival. She often felt overwhelmed by the concerts and competitions that took her around the world, making her miss so much school that she wasn’t officially enrolled anymore. Instead, she worked with tutors from the University of San Francisco. 

Lucy hadn’t even wanted to come to the Prague Festival, which only accepted fifteen pianists her age from around the world. She was one of the lucky few chosen from thousands of applicants. At the celebration, her dad gave her a white-gold necklace with an L pendant to congratulate her, and her little brother Gus dreamed about being at the same festival one day. Her teacher, Grace Chang, took her out for a special dinner to plan her music pieces. The truth was, Lucy hadn’t applied herself; her mother had filled out the form and sent in a CD. “I didn’t want you to be disappointed if you didn’t get in,” her mom had said. Lucy thought her mom just didn’t want her to say no. Back then, she believed that causing trouble was the worst thing to do, so she didn’t think about trying to back out.

The guy from Tokyo leaned in, surprised. “Tanglewood?” he asked. “Yeah.” “How old are you?” “Fifteen.” He looked at Liesel/Louisa, who said, “Wow.” Lucy didn’t mean to brag; it was hard to know when she was sharing her achievements or showing off. “It’s just part of this new youth-spotlight thing they’re trying…” Liesel/Louisa then looked across the room and said she had to go talk to someone. The guy from Tokyo stayed and asked, “Have you ever been to Japan?” He had long, messy hair, like many musicians, to show they were cool. “Once, when I was about eight,” Lucy replied. 

Just then, Lucy's grandfather came over. “Lucy, let me introduce you to someone,” he said, pulling her away. “And don’t get too friendly with the competition.” “They’re not the competition,” Lucy replied. “Everyone is the competition,” he insisted. He took her around the room, making her talk to important people. Lucy smiled and nodded, understanding only part of the conversations.

Later, in the elevator to their suite, her grandfather said, “You did well in there, Lucy. I’m proud of you. This is an important festival, and people are talking about you. They all know who you are.” Lucy liked that. Being recognized felt good, even if some people were jealous or thought she was too young for the attention. Being a concert pianist didn’t earn her respect from her school friends. Even her best friend, Reyna, didn’t know or care that she could play a difficult Rachmaninov piece. But in places like this, Lucy felt she mattered."
109,"""It's not good for you to spend so much time online. You need to get out into the real world,"" said Dad. It’s hard to argue with him, so I decided to look into what experts say about this topic, and I found it quite interesting. Research shows that most teenagers who use social media have many real-life friends, a strong sense of identity, and are learning important technical skills for the digital world.

Simon Miles, an e-safety expert, says that social networking is now a big part of growing up. Teenagers don’t just use media like adults do; they live in it. This isn’t necessarily good or bad – it depends on how you use it. 

How does our social networking compare to what our parents did when they were young? Jim Matthews, a social media analyst, says it’s like the modern version of hanging out at a youth club, where parents used to share jokes and gossip. He believes it helps teenagers build their identity away from their parents and learn to handle teenage issues with their friends.

Psychologist Professor Keith Davidson explains that adolescence is a time for figuring out who you are. Social networking can help with this by allowing you to share your interests, like music or sports, and see different perspectives from others. Research shows that active social networkers are not as self-centered as those who don’t use social media. He adds that for shy people, communicating online can be easier than face-to-face, allowing them to practice social skills in a less stressful way.

Professor Andrew Phillips is studying how young people use social networking sites. He believes these sites can help quiet individuals with specific interests connect with others who share those interests. For example, if you’re one of the few people in your school who likes a certain type of music, finding an online group can help you feel less alone and even popular in that context.

Pauline White, a digital education expert, shared that young people who find new interests online and join networks of similar individuals are truly making the most of social networks. She thinks social networking is becoming a creative outlet, with teenagers making videos, podcasts, and blogs about their interests. Photo-sharing sites are also changing how creativity is shared, allowing photographers to connect, learn, and exchange images, which can help them in their future jobs.

She points out that every business uses social media to promote itself, and understanding how it works is important. For instance, if you create a product and have 1,000 friends on social networks, they could all be potential customers. Linking these networks can build your customer base.

Matthews agrees that teenagers who use social networking creatively will benefit when they enter the workforce. He highlights that many sites offer opportunities to collaborate with others to create and share content, which is a valuable skill in today’s job market."
110,"When people think of a relaxing family vacation, they might not imagine a long trip across nine western states in the US and a Canadian province. However, my parents were not looking for a quiet holiday when they planned our summer vacation this year. My dad seemed determined to create what he thought was the perfect family bonding experience. He and my mom often said, “Not enough people do this anymore,” while my twin brother and I exchanged worried looks, thinking there might be good reasons for that!

In mid-June, we packed our car with suitcases, coolers, and a mix of clothes for any weather. I was excited but knew I would miss my privacy for the next two weeks. Still, I had some ideas to cope. With barely enough space left for us, we began our “Family Great American Road Trip.” Leaving our big home for smaller places for the next five thousand miles made me wonder what we had gotten into.

We drove west through the Oklahoma panhandle. Even though we were still close to home, we had our share of adventures. We stopped for the night in Oklahoma, under a sky full of stars, after almost being blown off the road by a dust storm. We quickly learned that cattle have the right-of-way on the road!

The next day, we woke up early and continued our journey. The desert changed to mountains, and the days started to blend together, but each adventure was still unique. We left our footprints in the Great Sand Dunes and then went to Pagosa Springs, Colorado, where we noticed a strong smell of sulfur. As we climbed to our next stop, we realized that the roads marked for Jeeps were best for Jeep drivers.

Every place we visited showed a mix of old and new. Dealing with construction traffic became normal. We laughed when we saw the big “CLOSED” signs at the Four Corners Monument. On our way to Yellowstone National Park, we saw many wind farms and watched the sunset over bear habitats near the roads. We experienced “bear jams,” where traffic would stop to let bears cross, and we had a close encounter with one bear and a worried park ranger, which created unforgettable memories.

As we drove, life back home felt far away, and even the old hotel we stayed in, which had no internet or cell phone service, couldn’t dampen our excitement. The hotel was a creaky, rustic building that was 95 years old, but the views were amazing. After watching a rainstorm from our hotel in Canada, we headed back south. My parents were right; you don’t need to travel to a faraway place to find something special.

Returning home was a mix of happiness and sadness, but at least I didn’t argue with my brother during our one hundred hours on the road! We had three thousand photos from our journey to look through and remember. I knew that the best memories would be the unexpected and spontaneous moments we shared."
111,"Rose Frost was sixteen years old and was going to live with her grandmother, Daisy. Rose's family was separating for two years. Her father, Jeff, had a job overseas, and her mother, Dahlia, would join him. Rose and her older sister, Amy, would stay in England. Amy was finishing her last year of school and would live under the care of the college Head. It was important for Amy to stay, and she was happy to have the best room at the college, which had its own kitchen and study area. She also enjoyed free Internet and phone access. Jeff and Dahlia would keep an eye on Amy, whether she liked it or not. 

So, Rose was moving to her grandmother’s house. She only had vague memories of her grandmother and had never met her grandfather. When Daisy offered Rose a place to stay, her parents were not excited about it, but Daisy was happy to have Rose with her. Rose didn’t fully understand why her parents didn’t get along with her grandma, but there had been a disagreement in the past, which meant Rose spent her summers away from Daisy. The last time Rose saw her grandmother, she was only ten years old, but she remembered those times fondly. Dahlia said living with Daisy would be interesting. Daisy was very social and loved to bring people together. Rose could expect dinner invitations, coffee mornings, and shopping trips soon, which made her smile. Daisy was not a typical old lady; she seemed to go to more social events than anyone else.

Before the move, Dahlia and Rose had a serious talk. Rose was sensible and mature for her age. She knew about healthy eating, staying fit, and getting enough sleep. But this time, Rose wanted one thing: her independence. Living with Daisy would meet her needs, but Rose wanted to play music loudly, invite friends over, and go out without asking for permission every time. She felt she could be trusted to do these things. She didn’t want to be reminded about homework or staying out late, and she didn’t want to be taken everywhere by her grandmother. Daisy understood.

Dahlia gave Rose a new touch-screen mobile phone with a video camera for emergencies only, which made Rose very happy. They all agreed that it would be about trust. Daisy would trust Rose to make good decisions, and Rose would trust Daisy not to be too controlling. If either of them crossed a line, they would talk about it again. Rose was not a wild child. Her few school friends were similar, so her school reports were always good, and her exam results were excellent. 

In five weeks, Rose would start at a new school, meet new friends, and begin her life again. This would be her fourth senior school in five years, so she felt experienced. At least she knew this would be the last time, as she would be starting her final two years of school. For Rose, it was a new beginning, a new piece in the puzzle of her life."
112,"Charlotte Grainger shares that her primary school teacher was the first person to think she might write a novel. She felt that writing a book was a big challenge and thought it would be a great achievement. When she turned 13, she decided to try writing a novel. Now, that novel is about to be published. When she told her former teacher about it, her teacher was surprised. The teacher had thought Charlotte would write a book when she was 30 or 40, but Charlotte didn’t understand why she should wait to do something she was good at.

It was a winter afternoon when I met Charlotte in her publisher's office. I knew I was going to interview a 15-year-old girl about her book, but I was still surprised to see a teenager there. The book is a significant achievement; it is exciting and well-written. The only thing that shows it was written by a teenager is the age of the main character. A public relations representative was with us in case Charlotte needed help, but she didn’t. Charlotte is confident, smart, and steady, which keeps her from being overly confident.

Charlotte understands that she is still young. When I asked her about the complex moral questions in her book, she said, “I was trying to ask big questions, not answer them. I don’t have many life lessons to share with my readers.” She believes that her age does not limit her understanding of the world, but she also doesn’t think she is very wise. She was interested in the theme of taking responsibility.

Charlotte has a theory about how teenagers are often misrepresented in books. She believes there are three types of teenagers in novels: the outsider who becomes accepted, the naïve teenager who knows little about the world, and the awkward teenager who struggles socially. She found it frustrating to read about these character types. “What if you’re basically fine? There aren’t many stories about characters who are not inadequate in some way. Some writers unintentionally suggest that teenagers can’t know who they are because they lack experience, which can hurt their self-confidence.”

Charlotte has always loved reading famous fantasy authors, but their books almost discouraged her from writing. “They explore deep topics about psychology and life. I wondered if I needed to write like that to create a good book and if I was capable of it.” However, she found a helpful book called How Not to Write a Novel, which taught her that if readers can guess what will happen next, the suspense is likely gone.

Some might say that having parents who are journalists helped her get her novel published. Her father knew someone in publishing, which helped her get her book read. Charlotte recognizes her good luck because it is hard for any new writer to get someone to read their first novel. “Every aspiring writer needs support and a bit of luck, but after that, you are on your own. Ultimately, writers succeed or fail based on their talent, so I don’t take anything for granted,” Charlotte concludes."
113,"""‘Remember, speed is your friend, not your enemy,’ said Gareth, our instructor, as we looked down the ski slope. ‘Now, who wants to go first?’ The group looked nervous. Then David, who had some experience with freestyle ski-jumping, stepped forward and skied down the slope towards the jump. He went up the ramp quickly and flew into the air, but something seemed wrong. We held our breath. He landed hard, lost both skis, and flipped into the snow. ‘Remember,’ Gareth said kindly, ‘speed can be unpredictable.’ 

I started to think that maybe freestyle skiing wasn’t for me. On past skiing holidays, I had enjoyed practicing turns in the snow, but I wasn’t like those teenagers who did tricks on ramps and half pipes. I thought it looked fun, but I was afraid of looking silly if I tried to join them. Then my parents decided we would have a winter holiday at a freestyle skiing training center in the US. The center had a big indoor area with trampolines and ski jumps covered in artificial snow. Students practiced their tricks and landed in foam pits, which didn’t really prepare us for the real slopes.

After practicing indoors, we went outside to try our skills. ‘Progression is inevitable!’ the center’s slogan said. Gareth explained that before places like this, inexperienced ski jumpers would just go down the slopes without any training. He warned us, ‘If you land on the knuckle, you’ll be in trouble.’ The ‘knuckle’ is the flat area behind the jump before the slope goes down to the landing zone. If you land in the zone, you keep moving forward, which is safer. If you land on the flat, you stop suddenly, which hurts. That’s why speed is important.

At first, I found it hard to ignore my fear and go fast towards the jump. My legs seemed to slow down as I got closer, and I often landed on the knuckle. I didn’t fall, but by midday, I felt exhausted. ‘You need to control the jump, not let it control you,’ Gareth advised. 

On the second day, we started on the trampolines again. I thought I would dislike being indoors while looking at the snowy mountains, but bouncing on the trampolines was fun. Some exercises mimicked the moves we would make while ski-jumping, while others helped us learn ‘aerial awareness’ – understanding what our bodies were doing while in the air. Gareth gave us tips, and I realized I needed to improve my aerial awareness. I was only aware of the moment before take-off and then suddenly found myself in the foam cubes.

We returned to the mountain to try again. There were more mistakes, but eventually, I landed properly. Gareth was as happy as I was, and for a moment, I felt proud of my achievement. But that feeling didn’t last long. On my last run of the day, I forced myself to keep my speed up as I approached the jump. I flew into the air and landed correctly in the landing zone. Then I noticed both of my skis sliding down the slope, no longer attached to my feet."""
114,"Imagine you are on a rollercoaster at an amusement park. Your hands are sweaty with fear, and you hold tightly to the safety harness. The ride stops suddenly, and you take a deep breath as the carriage slowly climbs up. Then, there is a quick drop, and your stomach feels like it’s in the air. You move fast, turning sharply left and then upside down. Your senses are overwhelmed, and you scream in fear. But you chose to be there, just like millions of others who pay to enter theme parks.

It is interesting to think about how amusement parks, with their thrilling rides, have become a big business. To create the excitement that visitors want, there are many teams of creative engineers and designers working behind the scenes. The job of a rollercoaster designer might sound like something a child would dream of, but it is actually very challenging. Designers must find the right mix of fun and fear while keeping riders safe. They also need to come up with new ideas to keep people coming back.

While many people believe that rollercoasters are getting more intense, most of the techniques used today were actually developed by a US designer named John Miller in the early 1900s. During that time, there were fewer safety rules, and some rides were quite extreme, which made some passengers uncomfortable. Now, designers have to work within the limits set by specialized ride manufacturers.

I spoke to three experts about rollercoasters. Professor Brendan Walker, a “thrill engineer,” explained that the skill lies in putting all the parts together. Dr. John Roberts, a member of the Royal Academy of Engineering, added that it is important to quickly switch between feelings of excitement and safety so that riders feel thrilled but not scared. 

To create an amazing ride, the teams must develop a strong story, like a space adventure or a jungle chase, that matches the ride’s features, such as height, twists, and drops. However, Professor Walker noted that, like in many creative fields, experience and intuition are key. Jeff Hornick, a senior director in theme park development, agreed that it helps to be passionate about thrills to understand what riders want and to test the rides before they open.

I asked the experts if rollercoaster designers would use new technologies like virtual reality. Walker said we shouldn’t expect too much from it. He explained that while virtual reality can enhance the experience, the real excitement comes from the physical ride itself, which will continue to be the main attraction for many years."
115,"At 25, Miranda Ellington has already done a lot as a choreographer, creating performances for many theatres and dance companies. She also dances occasionally. I wonder why she manages to do both activities in her busy life. She explains, “Dancing again reminds me of what it’s like to be in the studio, following the orders of strict choreographers, which can be tense and frustrating. Choreographers sometimes forget how hard it is to rehearse all day.”

As a choreographer, Miranda teaches and enjoys working with young dancers. She says, “Beginners are often open to new ideas. Working with them can be easier than with professionals because they are willing to take risks. They want to succeed but don’t yet know their strengths and weaknesses. This makes them more open to criticism, although they might still question me sometimes, and I appreciate their honest feedback.”

When Miranda starts with a new group, she focuses on the dance steps, following the music. “There might be music I don’t like, but I still create the best dance routine for it. If dancers don’t respond well to a certain piece, it can be frustrating, but I have to find solutions. I can’t just choose a new piece of music. I wish I could experiment more and switch to different pieces to improve the mood during tough rehearsals. Unfortunately, I often work on big productions where the music is already decided and cannot be changed.”

Miranda believes in making connections with new people. “It’s important to meet new contacts, but I have to remember that each theatre and school has different methods and styles. I need to adapt my way of working each time I go somewhere new, which helps me avoid becoming too set in my ways.”

We discuss a recent documentary about professional ballet dancers and choreographers. Miranda says, “There have been glamorous documentaries in the past that were misleading. This one tries to show the real life inside a dance company. There’s a scene where a young dancer receives many corrections, and I smiled because I recognized that struggle. She knows she’s not getting it right but can’t make her body do what’s needed. It’s hard to watch, but it’s real. People often underestimate the hard work and dedication required in ballet.”

I ask Miranda what makes a great dance production. She replies, “It’s when everything comes together – the music, costumes, lighting, and dancers. Perfection might be too much to expect, but aiming high is appreciated by audiences and can help cover up some mistakes. I’ve been part of productions where the dance steps were great, but the costumes or props were distracting, which is disappointing.”

With her wide range of work, I wonder how she sees herself: is she a modern dance choreographer or a ballet specialist? She says, “People want to label you, and I don’t understand that. There’s a trend to focus on becoming an expert in a narrow area, but I don’t follow that. Maybe one day I’ll be known for one thing, but for now, I want to explore more.”"
116,"A friend once asked me why I travel when I can see everything on television. I agreed that there are amazing things on TV, but I think it’s better to go out and experience the world. This conversation inspired me to take a fun four-day trip and make a film to encourage people to turn off their TVs. 

A friend was getting rid of his old sofa, which became the main part of my film. I added three wheels and some cables to it and attached old seatbelts to carry it. I put my luggage on the sofa and even slept on it at night, including one night on the beach. Some friends joined me, helping to pull the sofa and motivating me to keep going. 

I have done many walking trips in recent years, but this was very different. It was the longest distance I have ever walked, and I walked on main roads. This allowed me to stop at roadside cafés and relax on the sofa with a cappuccino instead of sitting on a rock with my sandwiches blowing away in the wind. 

I often had to tell people, “No, I’m not doing this for charity, and I’m not training for a marathon.” When someone at work asks about my weekend, I prefer to share how I dragged a sofa 100 miles across southern England rather than talk about the latest TV show. You can watch the film on my website."
117,"When I read about guided swimming trips around some small Greek islands, I felt excited. I had never tried organized group trips before. My brother, who I usually travel with, was busy, so I thought a group holiday would be a good idea. The man at the Greek port looked surprised when I asked for a single ferry ticket because the islands are popular with families. I explained that I wouldn’t be alone for long; I would be joining ten others to swim around the small islands. Although he still looked confused, he smiled and let me on the boat.

Before we started, our group had exchanged emails, but there was not much time to talk before our first swim. Our guides told us that a support boat would follow us the whole time and showed us how to communicate with it. We did a short swim to divide us into speed groups, and then it was time for our first real swim of 1.5 km. I was nervous. I had trained in my local pool and swum in rivers, but I had never swum long distances in the open sea. Soon, the waves became bigger, and I found myself at the back of the slow group, which was not where I wanted to be. I watched the faster swimmers move ahead like dolphins. However, I wanted to finish this first distance, and I was very happy when I finally did it on my own.

The next days followed a routine: jumping in, finding a comfortable speed, and stopping to enjoy the beautiful views. As the swims got longer, I also got faster and enjoyed them more. I felt like I didn’t need the support boat anymore. I can’t wait to come back again next year."
118,"Being a flight attendant is not easy, but it has many rewards. Since I started this job, I have traveled to many places, from the US to Australia. I work with amazing people, have plenty of time off, and my life is always interesting, which makes it a great job for someone young like me!

As a child, I went to a boarding school far from my family, so I often flew alone when school started and ended. Sometimes I felt lonely, so I asked the flight attendants if I could help serve meals to passengers, and some of them let me. This experience stayed with me when I wanted to leave my banking job and find a new path.

At the interview for the flight attendant position, there were many young people, and many of us were hired. Most of us had good qualifications and were changing careers. Before the interview, I practiced what to say. I didn’t just say I loved to travel, like everyone else. Instead, I talked about my skills and past work experience, and that helped me get the job!

I would recommend this job to anyone because there are many benefits, but the free flights are not the best part. Most airline staff work very hard, and there is a saying: “no one’s finished until everyone’s finished.” It feels like a big family. Even if we don’t see each other all the time, we are still close.

When I’m not working, I don’t have to take my job home with me. If I do have to deal with difficult passengers, which doesn’t happen often, I know the flight will end soon, and I probably won’t see them again!"
119,"At the summer camp where I work, I really enjoy watching the children succeed at things they never thought they could do. Most of the children already know how to swim and play table tennis before they arrive, but rock climbing is a new experience for many of them. Some kids feel very nervous at first, but after some encouragement, they agree to try, and in the end, they all reach the top. This makes them feel great.

At the beginning of the week, some children miss their homes. It is not the youngest ones who feel this way the most; it is usually the ten- to thirteen-year-olds. We do not allow them to use their mobile phones all the time. First, we tell them they can call home after lunch. When they ask again, usually after dinner, we say it is too late to call and suggest they do it tomorrow. Most children feel better after a couple of days, and by the end of the week, they all come to thank us because they have had a wonderful time.

Sometimes, it is not just the children who feel lonely. We also have parents who call frequently to ask how their child is doing, which is often unnecessary. Their son or daughter might be busy playing games or doing other activities, so we have to tell the parents to call back later.

We often see a certain type of child who comes to camp, usually dressed in expensive new clothes. These children often argue when we ask them to change into something more suitable, but soon they understand why it is important."
120,"'Rock the Planet' is a musical show where the actors also need to be good musicians. It opened in London last year after being very successful in the USA for five years, where it won the title of 'Best Musical' four times! However, putting on the show with an all-British cast was not easy. In the UK, there are more rules about how many performances young actors can do each week compared to the USA, where they can perform more often. Because of this, they needed twice as many actors in London. Fortunately, the director found many talented actors in the UK, and they have just won their first 'Best Musical' award.

The theatre in London is larger than the one in the USA, and it has been full every night, with many people wanting to hear the songs that became popular in America. I met Jamie, an 11-year-old actor in the show. He said, ""It’s amazing that I get paid to play, especially with a beautiful and expensive Gibson guitar."" He shared how busy the young actors are, saying, ""We have regular school lessons at the theatre. The teacher is great, but I miss my old school friends.""

I asked Jamie what his classmates thought of the show. He replied, ""My whole class came! The theatre offers special ticket deals for schools. They loved it, which made me feel really confident. My parents come when they can, but it’s expensive for them."" When I mentioned that I also play guitar, Jamie found a spare one and invited me to play with him and the other young actors. We played a song called 'Days,' which I didn’t know before. Jamie helped me learn it, and I felt proud when I finally got it right. I was impressed by Jamie’s skills and wished I could play like him. I was just trying to keep up and was glad the show’s director wasn’t there to hear my mistakes!

Although the young actors were already musicians, some playing several instruments, none had played in a band before. Luckily, they found it quite easy. Jamie said the hardest part was looking natural when they first performed together because they were so focused that they forgot to smile! The show will be in London for another year, and it is definitely worth seeing."
