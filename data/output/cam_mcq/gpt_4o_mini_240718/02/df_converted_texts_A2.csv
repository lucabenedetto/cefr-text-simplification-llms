1,"A while ago, a website talked about the dangers of public check-ins. Public check-ins are when you tell everyone online where you are. The website said that when you say, ""I’m at this place,"" you are also telling many people where you are, and some of them might not be people you want to meet. This shows that sharing everything online can have bad sides. 

The internet gives us many chances to share our lives with many people. We can share our stories, photos, and feelings. But sometimes, we can get lost in this sharing. It can feel sad, but we should not give up. There are lessons from people who used the internet a long time ago. 

In January 1994, a 19-year-old student named Justin Hall started sharing his life online. At that time, the internet was mostly for students and scientists. Hall wanted to share his life, so he created a blog. He wrote about everything and shared many photos. In 1996, he began posting every day, and many people started to read his blog. 

One day, people went to his blog and found a sad video instead of his usual posts. Hall had fallen in love, but when he wrote about it, his partner said he had to choose between the blog and their relationship. Hall chose his partner, but he felt that sharing his life online made people not trust him. 

In 2002, a woman named Heather Armstrong had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job. One day, a coworker sent her blog link to their bosses, and she lost her job because of it. This shows that what we say online can have real-life consequences. 

Armstrong was sad and stopped blogging for a while, but later she got married and started a new blog about her family. Now, she is very popular and makes money from her writing. 

The important lesson is that while the internet lets us say anything, we should think carefully before we share."
2,"A while ago, some scientists started to warn people about a low-budget movie called What the Bleep Do We Know? This movie mixes real-life facts and stories to show that there is a lot we do not understand about our universe. Scientists can be a bit proud, but even the most confident ones do not say they know everything about the universe. Some scientists felt they needed to warn people about the movie, calling it “atrocious” and “very dangerous.” This made me curious to watch it.

At first, I did not understand why the movie was so important. Some scientists talked about new discoveries that show the universe is stranger than we thought. But when the movie talked about these discoveries, I started to see why people were interested. One claim was that water molecules can be changed by our thoughts. I had heard about a Japanese researcher who said that the shape of water could change based on how people feel. The movie showed pictures of ice crystals that looked beautiful when people were happy and ugly when people were in a bad mood. Many people find this idea interesting, but scientists often say, “Give me a break.” 

The idea that water can be affected by thoughts is amazing, but we need real proof. Pretty pictures are not enough. The movie did not go far enough with its claims. For example, scientists have found that water molecules have special energy linked to a force that is making the universe grow. This idea comes from many years of research, not just a few nice pictures. 

Scientists have discovered that the universe is made of a strange kind of matter and is pushed by something called “dark energy.” There are also amazing discoveries happening on Earth. For example, scientists found that our brains take about half a second to understand what is happening around us. Anthropologists believe they have found where modern humans first lived and how they spread around the world. Some scientists think there is a connection between life on Earth and the design of the universe.

Science is not finished. In fact, we are learning that many things in nature are more complicated than we thought. New ideas like chaos and quantum uncertainty show that there are limits to what we can know. Some of the best scientists are trying to create a “Theory of Everything” to explain all the forces and particles in the universe. But many of us believe that the universe is best described with one word: incredible."
3,"Writing novels is hard for me, but writing short stories is fun. Writing a novel is like planting a big forest, while writing a short story is like planting a small garden. Both are important to me. In the forest, the trees give shade, and the wind moves the leaves, which can turn bright gold. In the garden, flowers bloom, and their colors attract bees and butterflies. 

Since I started writing, I have often switched between novels and short stories. After I finish a novel, I want to write short stories. After I finish a group of short stories, I want to write a novel. I never write short stories while writing a novel, and I never write a novel while working on short stories. Writing these two types of stories uses different parts of my brain, and it takes time to change from one to the other.

I began my career with two short novels in 1975. Then, from 1984 to 1985, I started writing short stories. I didn’t know much about writing short stories, so it was hard, but it was a great experience. I felt my imagination grow, and readers liked this new side of me. One of my first short stories, “Breaking Waves,” was in my first collection called Tales from Abroad. 

One great thing about writing short stories is that they don’t take long to finish. Usually, it takes me about a week to write a short story, but I can change it many times. Writing a novel takes a year or two, and it can feel very long. Sometimes, I wonder if I will finish. So, writing short stories is a nice change for me. 

Another good thing about short stories is that you can create a story from small ideas, like a thought or an image. Writing a short story feels like playing jazz music, where the story goes where it wants. Also, if a short story doesn’t work out, it’s okay. Not every story has to be perfect. Even famous writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver have stories that are not great. This makes me feel better. 

I learn from my mistakes in short stories and use that knowledge when I write novels. Short stories help me try new things that I can’t do in a novel. Without short stories, writing novels would be harder for me. My short stories are like soft shadows I have left in the world. I remember where I wrote each one and how I felt. Short stories show my feelings, and I am happy to share them with my readers."
4,"Science is a way to understand the world. It can help us find cures for diseases and make our lives easier. However, it can also create problems. Science tries to explain many things, from tiny atoms to the universe. It has influenced many people, including poets and politicians. 

Sometimes, people do not understand science well. Some think it is very important, while others do not. Scientists often disagree with each other. They change their ideas when they find new information. This can be hard for society because it challenges what we believe. 

This book will talk about important ideas in science. We will look at how these ideas have changed how we think. Science has practical uses, but we will focus on the ideas themselves. Science is always changing. There is always a scientist who finds something new that changes what we thought before. 

For example, in the 1600s, scientists thought the universe worked like a big clock. Later, new ideas made us think differently about how we see the universe. Some people believe that science cannot explain everything, but new discoveries often help us understand more. 

In the past, scientists thought they had learned everything important. But then they discovered things like radioactivity and the electron. Science has also made big discoveries in biology. 

Today, some people believe we are close to finding a complete explanation of the universe. Science is important because it affects our lives. We are not just watching nature; we are changing it. This can sometimes cause problems we do not understand. 

Everyone should pay attention to science because it will shape the future for our children. The choices we make in science can affect many things, like health and the environment. Science is not just for scientists; it is important for everyone."
5,"From around 2015, many big book publishers noticed that sales of ebooks were not growing anymore. In some cases, sales even went down. This made people question if ebooks would be important in the future. One publishing executive said that the excitement about ebooks might have led to bad investments, and his company lost trust in printed books. 

Even though it seems that ebooks and printed books can exist together, people still ask if ebooks will replace printed books. This question is interesting and makes people talk a lot. Why do we think of ebooks and printed books as being in competition? The answers to these questions are not just about ebooks; they show how we feel about new technology and change.

In my research, I found that people often think one type of media will replace another when new technology comes out. For example, when television was invented, many people thought radio would disappear. But radio found new ways to be used, like in cars and factories. The idea that books might disappear is not new either. In 1894, some people thought that phonographs would replace books with audiobooks.

Many times, people have said that new things like movies, radio, and smartphones would end printed books. Some believed that if books disappeared, culture would suffer. Others thought ebooks would be much better. The idea that books might die often comes up when new technology appears. This shows our mixed feelings about change.

We feel strong connections to different types of media, like books and computers. Studies show that we can even name our cars or get upset with our laptops. When new technology, like e-readers, comes out, it changes our relationship with things we love. As technology changes, we often miss what we used to have. This is why some people still want older products.

For example, when the printing press was invented in the 15th century, people wanted original handwritten books. When movies changed from silent to sound in the 1920s, people felt nostalgic for silent films. The same thing happened when photography changed from film to digital and from vinyl records to CDs. E-readers have made people appreciate the feel and smell of printed books even more.

This should make people feel better about the future of printed books. However, the idea that books might disappear will continue to be a popular story about technology and our fear of change. One way we deal with change is by telling stories that are easy to remember, like stories of loss. The story of the death of the book reflects both our excitement for new things and our fear of losing what we love."

For a year and a half, I woke up every weekday at 5:30 in the morning. I brushed my teeth, made coffee, and wrote about how great thinkers from the last four hundred years did their best work. I wanted to show how they organized their days to be creative and productive. I wrote about their daily lives, like when they slept, ate, and worked. I hoped to show their personalities and habits.

A famous French writer, Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, said, “Tell me what you eat, and I shall tell you what you are.” I say, “Tell me what time you eat, and if you take a nap.” This book is about how people create, not just what they create. It is also personal. The writer John Cheever said that even a business letter shows something about you. 

I have questions that I think about in my own life: How can you do meaningful work and also make money? Is it better to focus on one project or to work a little each day? When there is not enough time, do you have to give up things like sleep or a clean house? Or can you learn to do more in less time? I do not have all the answers, but I want to show how many successful people faced similar challenges. 

The book is called Daily Rituals, but it is really about people’s routines. Routines can seem boring, but they can help us use our time and energy better. A good routine can help us stay focused and avoid distractions. The psychologist William James said that good habits can help us think about more interesting things. 

Ironically, William James was a procrastinator and had trouble keeping a schedule. I started this book because of my own procrastination. One Sunday, I was trying to write a story for work but ended up cleaning my desk and making coffee instead. I am a morning person and work best in the early hours. That afternoon, I looked online for information about other writers’ schedules. I found many interesting stories and thought it would be good to collect them. This led to the Daily Routines blog and now this book.

In the blog, I shared people’s routines from biographies and articles. For the book, I gathered more information and tried to keep it interesting. I let the people I wrote about share their own words from letters and interviews. I also summarized some routines from other sources. This book would not be possible without the help of many biographers and researchers. I have listed all my sources in the Notes section for further reading."
7,"Howard wanted to be a palaeontologist since he was six years old. When he was a child, his father said they could not go on holiday to Spain because of money problems. Instead, they went to a beach in England. On a rainy day, Howard found a fossil called an ammonite on the beach. He always wanted to study ancient life.

When he finished university, Howard knew he wanted to study the very early life forms, not dinosaurs. He worked hard on his research for his doctorate. He was worried about finding a job after he finished. He felt confident in his skills, but he knew that sometimes good people do not get good jobs.

When a job opened at Tavistock College in London, Howard applied right away, but he did not expect much. On the day of his interview, the professor who was supposed to help him had a fight with his wife and got into an accident. He could not attend the interview. Another professor, who did not like the first one, took his place. This professor helped Howard get the job, even though Howard did not know him.

Howard was surprised and thankful to get the job, but later he learned that it was not just because of his skills. He was a little disappointed but happy to have the job he wanted.

Howard liked his work because he could plan and do his research. However, his personal life was sometimes chaotic. One day, someone stole his briefcase with his lecture notes at a train station. He was very upset and went back to the college. He called to postpone his lecture and reported the theft. After that, he had coffee with a colleague who was visiting from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. 

During this meeting, Howard learned about a new collection of fossils that needed to be studied. This was a big opportunity for him. Because of the theft, he changed his plans. He decided not to go to a conference in Stockholm or take students to Scotland. Instead, he would find a way to visit the museum in Nairobi to study the fossils."
8,"Charles Spence eats many different foods. He even has ice cream made from bee larvae at home. It may look strange, but it tastes a little like nuts and flowers. Spence is a Professor of Experimental Psychology at Oxford University in the UK. He studies how our senses work together to help us taste food. His work helps change what we eat and drink, from big food companies to fancy restaurants.

Spence and his team study many things about food. For example, who we eat with, how food is arranged, and even the color and weight of plates can change how we taste food. In his book, The Perfect Meal, he shares interesting facts about eating. Did you know that the first person to order food in a restaurant usually enjoys their meal more? And when we eat with one other person, we eat about 35% more food. With three people, we eat 75% more!

Spence's lab in Oxford is simple, not high-tech. He has soundproof booths and old audio equipment. This helps him work with chefs who do not have a lot of money for research. Many of his projects are funded by big food companies. In the past, some people thought that research funded by companies was not real science. But now, it is important for universities to show that their work matters to people.

Spence helps food companies reduce salt and sugar in their products. This is good for customers because it helps them stay healthy. Many companies make these changes slowly so that customers do not notice. Spence says that if people know about the changes, they may not like the food as much.

Spence met famous chef Heston Blumenthal while working on a project. They worked together to create a dish called ""Sound of the Sea."" Spence studies how sounds can change the taste of food. For example, high music can make food taste sweeter, while low music can make it taste bitter. Soon, an airline will match music with the food they serve.

Spence has fun at home too. He has had dinner parties where they eat rabbit with fur on the cutlery and play with colorful lights. They even tested different drinks with sounds to see how they taste. For Spence, home and food events are just like his lab."
9,"Our brains are very busy today. We get a lot of information, like facts, rumors, and opinions. We have to find out what is important and what we can ignore. We are also doing more things than before. Thirty years ago, travel agents helped us book flights, and salespeople helped us in stores. Now, we do most things by ourselves. We are trying to do the work of many people while also managing our lives, families, jobs, hobbies, and favorite TV shows. Our smartphones help us with this, but they also make us feel like we need to do everything at once.

However, we are not really good at multitasking, which means doing many things at the same time. A scientist named Earl Miller says our brains are not made for multitasking. When we think we are multitasking, we are actually switching quickly between tasks. This can make us less efficient. Multitasking can also increase stress in our bodies, making it hard to think clearly.

Our brains can easily get distracted by new things. This makes it hard to focus on one task. Just having the chance to multitask can hurt our ability to think well. A researcher named Glenn Wilson found that trying to focus while seeing unread emails can lower our IQ by almost 10 points. This is worse than being tired.

When we try to learn new things while multitasking, the information can go to the wrong part of our brain. For example, if students do homework while watching TV, they may not remember the information well. Without distractions, they can remember better.

Making decisions while multitasking is also hard for our brains. Small decisions can take as much energy as big ones. After making many small decisions, we might make bad choices about important things.

Many people, including business leaders and scientists, talk about the problem of too many emails. It is not that emails are bad, but the large number of them can be overwhelming. One scientist’s son said his dad answers emails for a living, and the scientist agreed that it is true. We feel we must reply to emails, but it can be hard to do that and get other work done."
10,"In a zoo in Sweden, a chimpanzee named Santino broke concrete at night. He threw the pieces at visitors during the day. Was he being mean? In caves in the US, female bats help other bats that are not their babies if those mothers cannot give birth properly. Are they being kind? Fifty years ago, people did not think much about these questions. They believed animals just acted in ways that could be measured, and scientists only looked at those actions. The idea that animals have feelings and thoughts was not taken seriously. 

But now, this is changing. Research on bats, chimps, rats, dolphins, and chickens shows that animals have emotions. This new idea is being talked about in popular science books, like Mark Bekoff’s ""Wild Justice"" and Victoria Braithwaite’s ""Do Fish Feel Pain?"". This has started a big discussion: do animals have thoughts and feelings like humans? 

Another question is about conscience, which is a person’s sense of right and wrong. In a recent study with cows, those that opened a locked gate to get food seemed happier than those that had help. If cows enjoy solving problems, what does this mean for how we raise and eat cows? While people agree on what they see, they do not agree on what it means. Dr. Jonathan Balcombe, who wrote ""Second Nature,"" believes we should stop eating meat. He thinks this is a big change in how we think about ethics, like when slavery ended. 

Aubrey Manning, a professor, thinks we should rethink how we see animal intelligence. He believes animals have a simpler way of thinking than humans. Professor Euan MacPhail thinks we should not put human feelings onto animals. These three people may never agree because the main issue is not just science or morals, but philosophy. It is hard to define what consciousness is, so can we really know what it is like to be a bat?

Balcombe did an important study that suggests starlings, a type of bird, can feel sad. In this study at Newcastle University, starlings were kept in two different types of cages. One group had nice cages with space and water, while the other group had small, empty cages. Both groups learned to eat tasty worms from one box and avoid bad worms from another. But when only bad worms were offered, only the starlings in nice cages would eat. Balcombe thinks that being in a bad cage made the starlings feel negative about life.

Balcombe, who supports animal rights, believes that in the future, people will look back and feel bad about how we treated animals, just like we feel bad about racism. He says we cannot support animal rights while eating meat. If he were the only one with this opinion, it might be easy to ignore him. But Professor Aubrey Manning agrees with him. Manning has written a book about animal behavior. He says we are changing our views again. In the past, people thought animals thought like us, but now we are seeing things differently. This is a complicated topic, and it is important to listen carefully to different opinions."
11,"Critical thinking is a way to understand better what we read or hear. Adrian West, a research director, says that arguing can help us find the truth. Technology helps us store and process information, but it can also make it harder to think deeply about problems. West points out that we see a lot of poor thinking and opinions that can confuse us. More information does not always mean we make better decisions. 

According to the National Endowment for the Arts, fewer people are reading books, and this is getting worse. Patricia Greenfield, a psychology professor, believes that focusing more on visual media, like videos, can hurt our critical thinking. People are multitasking and not focusing on one thing. 

We do not yet know exactly how technology affects critical thinking. Technology can change how we think in different ways. For example, some computer games can help us think critically, while reading online can improve our analysis skills. However, jumping from one link to another on the internet can make it hard to think deeply.

Greenfield says that reading helps our thinking and imagination more than visual media like video games and TV. Reading builds our imagination and vocabulary. But she also found that some visual media can help with processing information. Unfortunately, many visual media do not give us time to think or reflect.

This can lead to many young people not reaching their full potential. How society views technology affects how we think about critical thinking. There is a debate about whether video games are good or bad for kids. James Paul Gee, a professor, says that video games can be a good way to learn. They can help children develop better reasoning skills. Games like Sim City and Civilization teach decision-making and analytical skills in a fun way. 

In the digital age, as reading and math scores go down, we need to understand better how technology affects our thinking."
12,"Matthew Crawford is a motorcycle mechanic. He used to work in an office but did not like it. He writes about how we should live our lives. His first book talks about the good things about working with your hands. His latest book is about how to deal with modern life. 

One day, while shopping, he saw ads on a credit card machine while he was entering his pin number. This made him think about how hard it is to avoid distractions. He believes that we often cannot choose what to think about because of things we do not notice. It is becoming harder to think or remember conversations. People are also avoiding simple things like talking to strangers because they do not want to be interrupted.

Crawford says we see the world through things like video games and apps. These things show us what we want, but they can take over our lives. Many people complain about emails at work but still check emails in their free time. Studies show that just seeing a phone can make it hard to focus. 

Crawford thinks that technology is not the only problem. It has made it easy for us to focus on ourselves. We have many choices, which makes it hard to control ourselves. For example, we prefer to text friends instead of talking to them. He believes that by only interacting with screens, we lose important connections with real people.

He gives an example of his gym. Before, there was one music player for everyone, which could cause some disagreements. Now, people listen to their own music with earbuds. The gym used to be a place to meet others, but now it feels different. 

Crawford has two ideas to help. First, we need to reduce noise and distractions in public places. Second, he believes we should practice skills that help us connect with the real world. For example, cooks, hockey players, and motorcycle racers must focus on real things. They use their judgment and work with others around them. 

Crawford says that when we engage with the real world, we see that fake experiences are not as good. He does not mean everyone should become a chef, but it is important to use our judgment. Focusing on one thing can help us pay attention to other things too."

""What do you do for a living?"" This is a common question. People often talk about their jobs. But if you are a philosopher, like me, it can be a bit tricky. Saying ""I am a philosopher"" can sound a bit showy. It is better to say that you study or teach philosophy. Many people think philosophers know special truths, but this is not true. Philosophers are just like everyone else.

One reason people think this way is that philosophers often judge what others do and talk about thinking. A famous Greek philosopher, Aristotle, said that thinking deeply about life is the best way to live. Many modern philosophers do not agree, but people still connect philosophy with thinking.

Another Greek philosopher, Socrates, said that a life without self-reflection is not worth living. This means that just following what everyone else does can make life less satisfying. Thinking about our lives helps us make better choices. 

However, you do not need to read many difficult books or think all the time to reflect on your life. It just means looking closely at your daily experiences to see if they are important. You do not have to be away from society to think about it. In fact, thinking about life can help us live better, and we should share our knowledge with others.

There is a problem, though. Academic philosophy has become very separate from everyday life. Many philosophers only talk to other experts and do not explain their ideas to regular people. This makes philosophy seem far away from real life. 

I sometimes call myself an ""ethicist"" because I study ethics, which is about what is right and wrong. Recently, I feel this title does not fully describe my work. Ethics is often seen as related to rules and laws. But there is more to it. Ethics can also look at social practices and whether they are fair.

For example, we might discuss if downloading movies illegally is wrong (it is) and then think about our ideas of responsibility and art. Philosophy can help us understand our actions and beliefs better. Sometimes we might find out we already know something, and other times we might see that our beliefs are hard to explain. By thinking about these ideas, we can help everyone."
14,"**Simplified Text:**

Many people love food, like foodies, chefs, and gourmands. They think that thinking about what we eat and how we eat can make eating more enjoyable. In the past, when philosophers talked about food, they often used it to explain other ideas, like learning. Sometimes, discussions about food seem to be about food, but they are really about other topics.

One famous philosopher, Epicurus, believed in seeking pleasure and avoiding pain. He talked about many activities, but people now often connect his name with enjoying food and drink. Many restaurants and food shops use his name because they think it will attract customers.

Food is social and cultural. We do not just eat food; it comes from history and is shared with our communities. These communities help us grow and share food. We interact with food more than with other things, so it is a good topic to think about.

When food is ready, critics write and talk about it. Some people wonder why food critics are important. One philosopher said that tasting food is not a special skill; critics are just better at describing how food tastes. Most discussions about how we sense things focus on sight, but taste should also be studied.

Another interesting point is how we think about the beauty of food. We say paintings or music are beautiful, but we do not usually say this about food. Some philosophers believe that food should be considered beautiful too, especially with the rise of modern cooking. However, food is eaten and gone, while art stays for a long time. This makes it hard to say food is beautiful in the same way.

There are also many ethical questions about food. We can ask what we should eat: organic, free-range, local, vegetarian, or non-GMO foods? Our answers show our beliefs. Philosophers like to discuss these questions about food.

Cooking at home is different from cooking in restaurants. Home cooks have a special duty to their friends and family. Everyone shares food and time together. But restaurant cooks work for their employers and have different responsibilities. Their kitchens are not open to everyone, and they work with colleagues, not friends.

A recent essay called ""Diplomacy of the Dish"" talks about how food can help people from different cultures connect. We can learn to enjoy other people's food and build friendships by eating together. The essay includes many interesting examples and stories that make food philosophy come alive for everyone."
15,"Rob Daviau is a game designer from the US. He makes special board games called ""legacy"" games. When he was a child, he played traditional board games, but he thought they were not fun or challenging anymore. He wanted to create new types of board games with stories and choices that matter in different games.

He changed a classic game called Risk to make a new version called Risk Legacy. In this game, the choices players make can change the game forever. Players might have to tear up cards, change the game board, or open new packets with different rules. The game is played over several sessions, and players can remember past events in the game. Daviau said, “You could point to the board and say: ‘Right here! You did this!’”

After Risk Legacy, he worked on a legacy version of another game called Pandemic. In Pandemic, players work together to cure diseases. His next game was SeaFall, which is set in the time of sailing ships. In SeaFall, players explore a new world. Designers of legacy games must think about all the choices players can make to keep the story interesting. They use play-testers to see how the game works. Jaime Barriga was a play-tester for SeaFall. He said it takes a lot of time to test the game. Sometimes the game works well at first, but later it can break, and they have to fix it.

At first, Daviau did not think legacy games would be very popular. He thought only a few people would like them. But many players, like Russell Chapman, really enjoy them. He thinks legacy games are a big step forward in game design. He said, “It’s a new level of commitment, intensity, excitement.” Another fan, Ben Hogg, said that even though players worry about changing the game, they love the adventure. He compared it to watching a new movie instead of the same one again.

Legacy games are inspired by video games and popular TV shows. Daviau wanted to be a TV writer when he was in college, but he ended up in advertising and then game design. He still loves telling stories. Matt Leacock, the creator of Pandemic, said making legacy games is like writing a book. You need to know how the story starts and ends, but you also need to plan the details.

Daviau is happy with his work but is curious to see how others will use his ideas. He thinks players will soon want something new. Colby Dauch, who works for the company that published SeaFall, believes legacy games have changed how people think about board games."
16,"One night not long ago, an octopus named Inky escaped from his tank at the National Aquarium in New Zealand. He crawled across the floor and squeezed into a small drain that led to the Pacific Ocean. This story was exciting and many people shared it online. 

People enjoy stories about animals escaping because they like to think that animals are like us. Octopuses are very smart and can do many interesting things. They can open jars, recognize faces, use coconut shells for protection, and even play games. 

Dr. Frans de Waal studies animals like gorillas and chimpanzees. He believes that we often do not see how smart animals really are. He says that animals can think about the past and future, feel empathy, and understand what others want. This means animals are smarter than we usually think.

In the past, people believed that animals were smart. For example, in medieval Europe, animals could be put on trial for crimes. Charles Darwin, who had important ideas about evolution, also thought that animals and humans are similar in some ways. 

In the twentieth century, many people started to think of animals as simple machines that only react to rewards and punishments. This idea made people forget that animals might have feelings and thoughts. During this time, humans also harmed animal habitats and did not care about animal welfare.

Now, Dr. de Waal thinks we are starting to understand that animals can think in ways similar to humans. He says that we are learning more about animal intelligence every day. 

He believes that tests for animal intelligence should consider what each animal is good at. For example, squirrels might not do well on human memory tests, but they can remember where they hide their nuts. 

In her book, naturalist Sy Montgomery says that if an octopus tested human intelligence, it might look at how well we can change the colors of our skin. If we could not do this, the octopus might think we are not very smart.

Dr. de Waal is not sure if Inky really knew how to escape to the ocean. He knows that stories like Inky's help people appreciate how smart animals can be. He once did an experiment with monkeys to see if they could feel envy. When some monkeys got cucumbers and others got grapes, the ones with cucumbers got very upset. This study was published in a scientific journal, but a video of the experiment made more people believe the findings. 

This shows how interesting and complex animal minds can be."
17,"Text: 

Robots are becoming very important in our world. They are not just in stories anymore; they are changing how we work. For many years, robots have helped in factories and car making. Now, experts say that robots will be used in many more areas soon, but many people are not ready for this change.

Many people think that robots will do most of the work that humans do in the next 50 years. However, most of them also believe that their jobs will stay the same. This is not true. Robots will affect all types of jobs in the coming years. For example, an Australian company called Fastbrick Robotics made a robot named Hadrian X. This robot can lay 1,000 bricks in one hour. It would take two human workers a whole day to do the same job.

Another example is a robot called Tally, made by a company in San Francisco. Tally walks around supermarkets to check if the shelves are full and the prices are right. It does not clean the aisles, as some might think.

Some people say that robots cannot fix or program themselves yet. This means there will be new jobs for people who can work with robots. But others worry that we need to keep the human touch in jobs. They think society is not ready for the changes that robots will bring.

Dr. Jing Bing Zhang is an expert on robots and how they will change jobs. He says that in two years, many robots will be smarter and work well with humans. In three years, many big companies will have a special person in charge of robots. In five years, salaries in the robot industry will go up, but there will still be many jobs that need skilled workers.

Zhang believes that lower-skilled workers will be affected by robots. He says they should not wait for the government to help them but should learn new skills. People cannot expect to do the same job forever.

New technologies will create new types of robots that we have not seen before. These robots will live with us in our homes and interact with us. This is a big chance for companies, but it also brings challenges, like making sure we are safe and our privacy is protected.

With many jobs at risk, it is important to focus on education. Countries need more graduates in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) to stay competitive in the future."
18,"Text: George Mallory was a mountaineer who wanted to climb Mount Everest. When a reporter asked him why, he said, ""Because it’s there."" This answer shows that many people want to know why someone would take such a big risk to climb a mountain. Some people might feel inspired by his answer to follow their dreams. Climbing can be about adventure and having fun.

In 1967, a Bolivian writer named Tejada-Flores wrote an important essay called ""Games that Climbers Play."" He talked about seven different types of climbing, from playing on small rocks to climbing big mountains like those in the Himalayas. Each type of climbing has its own rules. This idea has become popular in climbing discussions in the West, including in magazines and conversations.

Many climbers love climbing because it makes them feel free. But climbing can also be very hard. For example, being stuck in a tent during a storm is not a fun experience. This shows that climbing can be both freeing and limiting. However, some people believe that having fewer choices while climbing can make life simpler and give a different kind of freedom.

Joe Fitschen, a US rock climber, wrote an essay where he asked, ""Why do people climb?"" He believes that climbing is part of who we are as humans. We like to take on challenges and test our limits, even if it is risky. The joy we feel from climbing is connected to our nature.

Another writer, Brian Treanor, said that climbing can help us develop important qualities like courage, humility, and respect for nature. He thinks these qualities are very important in today’s world, where people often avoid risks. Climbing can help us grow and live better lives outside of climbing.

Some expert climbers, Ebert and Robinson, believe that climbing alone is harder and deserves more recognition than climbing with a team or using extra help, like bottled oxygen. However, this idea has caused some controversy because it might encourage climbers to take unnecessary risks.

Climbing can also be understood in different ways. Many climbers talk about being in the moment or feeling a flow while climbing. The physical effort, the focus needed, and the problem-solving involved in climbing are very important. Some people say that climbing is similar to Zen philosophy, which helps train the mind to find peace. This idea can help us understand why many people are drawn to climbing."
19,"Alfred Brendel is a famous pianist who played classical music for over sixty years. He was very smart and serious about his music. He played and recorded many important piano pieces, but he did not teach many students. People who knew him saw that he could be fun, but he did not show this side during his concerts. He spent his time studying, traveling, and performing.

About four or five years ago, a young boy named Kit Armstrong came to one of Brendel’s concerts and asked him for lessons. At first, Brendel did not think this was a good idea because he had very few students. He thought it was like asking a mountain guide to teach a child how to walk. But when he heard Kit play, he changed his mind. Kit was about 14 years old and played very well from memory. He even gave Brendel a CD of his performance, which impressed him a lot. Brendel thought Kit had a special talent.

Now, Kit is 19 years old and is always busy. He learns new languages, studies math, writes computer code, and plays tennis. His mother is always with him. Kit also composes music. Brendel believes that writing music helps him understand it better. He noticed that Kit has a great memory and can read music very well. Kit listens carefully to his own playing and understands Brendel’s lessons.

Brendel is careful not to raise expectations for Kit. He does not like when newspapers call Kit the next great pianist. He thinks this can be harmful. Young musicians can play some things very well, but they still need time to improve in other areas. 

Now at 80 years old, Brendel is more relaxed. He says that when he was young, he did not want to be famous quickly. He wanted to achieve certain goals by the time he was 50. When he reached 50, he felt he had done most of those things but still wanted to do more. Even though he cannot play as much now, he still thinks about music and enjoys his new life after performing."
20,"When I was a child, I thought gardens were beautiful places. My grandad’s garden was by a river. It sloped down to the water. You couldn’t touch the river, but you could hear the water and the birds in the trees. I thought all gardens were like this – peaceful and quiet. 

Grandad’s garden was simple. He didn’t have a big greenhouse like some neighbors. Their greenhouses were made from old window frames and plastic. At home, my dad was often quiet. He liked to say funny things, like “It’s immaterial to me,” instead of “I don’t mind.” He left school without any qualifications and became a plumber, but he didn’t love it. He thought about moving to Canada with my mum, but it didn’t happen. 

My dad was good at fixing things around the house. He could build bookshelves and cupboards very well. My parents only moved house once, but my mum liked to change the furniture a lot. Just when you got used to one chair, a new one would appear. The biggest change was when a piano came into the house. I wanted to like it, but it made me nervous. I liked the two brass candlesticks on it, but my mum said they were too fancy and took them away. I never got to play the piano; my sister had lessons instead. When I asked my mum why, she said, “You’d never have practiced.”

I loved the river the most. I could imagine many things there. I would take a fishing net and wear old sandals with the front cut out for my toes. I walked along the riverbank looking for a good place to take off my sandals and have a picnic. I tried to catch fish, but they never lived long in my yard, so I put them back in the water.

I wanted to leave school quickly, but it seemed hard. One day, my dad told me there was a job for an apprentice gardener in the Parks Department. He thought I might like it. He usually wanted me to be a carpenter, but I think he hoped I would be happy as a gardener. Even though he didn’t like gardening, he saw how much I enjoyed it."
21,"Lawrence MacEwen is on his Scottish island, the Isle of Muck. I am with him. A strong wind is blowing, and it feels like we might fall off the cliff into the ocean below. But Lawrence’s sheepdog, Tie, comes close, and Lawrence pets him gently. The wind is loud, but Lawrence is calm and happy on his island.

Lawrence shows me around. He points to the north and shouts, “That island is Eigg. The one next to it is the Isle of Rum. It rains a lot there.” I see dark clouds over Rum. “Beyond Rum is the island of Soay.” 

Suddenly, Lawrence says, “I need to move my sheep.” We walk down the hill. He tells me about the island: Muck is three kilometers long and one and a half kilometers wide. The geese here eat a lot of grass. The MacEwen family has lived on this island for 3000 years. 

While herding the sheep, Tie is not doing a good job. Lawrence tells him, “Away to me,” which means to go to the right, but Tie goes straight through the sheep. Lawrence sounds disappointed. 

The Isle of Muck is mostly run by the MacEwen family. Lawrence and his wife, Jenny, run the farm. Their son Colin takes care of the island cottages, and their daughter Mary runs the hotel, Port Mor, with her husband, Toby. Mary and Toby like that their two boys can play outside and sail boats in the summer. “They go out and come back when they are hungry,” Mary says.

But life on the island has some problems. There is electricity only sometimes. On my first night, I wait for the lights to come on. The next morning, I see Mary making breakfast with a flashlight. I also have no mobile phone service. Mary tells me, “You can get a signal on the hill, but most people just put their phones away after a few days.” So I do the same.

Life on Muck is surprising. A boat brings groceries and three musicians who come to play music in the tearoom. The islanders enjoy the concert and tap their feet to the rhythm. 

That night, by the warm fire, Lawrence tells me how he met Jenny. “Her father bought a small farm on Soay without seeing it. He had never been to Scotland. Jenny went to manage it.” I ask if Jenny knew how to run a farm. “She was good at typing,” he replies.

I go to bed listening to the rain and wake up to more rain. But I eat well because most of the food comes from the island. Mary sends me to fisherman Sandy Mathers for fresh fish. I carry it back to Mary’s kitchen. By 7 pm, we have a delicious fish dinner.

The next morning, I worry about my ferry to the next island. Many ferries have been canceled because of rough seas. If my ferry does not come, I will be stuck on Muck for two more days. Part of me secretly hopes for that."
22,"Text: 

The game design industry used to be mostly for computer scientists and self-taught people. Many thought video games were just a hobby for young people. But now, the video game industry is taken seriously. It is not easy to get into this field. Making video games based on new movies needs many team members and a lot of skill and hard work. 

Jim Donelly, who works for an online games magazine, says it is hard to get a job in big companies. But the industry needs game designers now more than ever. They need not just the top people who manage the whole game, but also those who design parts of the game. 

So, how can you start a career in this competitive industry? Many companies want people with a degree in computer science, but Jim thinks differently. He says, ""The best way is to make games. You need to create something to get a job. Game design is not just a job; it is a way of life."" 

Another expert, John Field, agrees but adds that it is more complicated. Many people want to work in games, but few have the skills needed today. It is important to have creativity, technical skills, and the ability to think of new ideas. 

Can you succeed on your own? John says, ""Maybe, but it is hard."" A good course in game design can help you. Most game designers start as programmers or artists and then move up in their careers. They love all kinds of entertainment and are interested in art and culture. They may have worked for a few years after school but know that games are their passion. 

Connections are also important. To succeed in games, like in many jobs, you need to meet people in the industry. 

The idea that only young boys play video games is changing. Now, many families play games together on consoles and smartphones. John believes there is a lot of room for growth in this area. ""Games are popular with many people. They are also a fun way to learn, and I see many new opportunities in this field."""
23,"Since I was a child, I have always wanted to play football. My dad encouraged me to play, but he never forced me. I am thankful for that. I had a friend whose dad was very strict. He always said, ""You can’t do this, you can’t do that."" My friend could have been a good player, but he stopped wanting to play football and never played again. I am happy that I still love the game.

When I score a great goal from far away, some people say it is just luck, but it is not. I have practiced shooting from a distance since I was a kid. You need to practice to score amazing goals. The best players in the world have natural talent, but they also practice a lot.

Sometimes, I see young players bumping into each other, but I learned the right way to play. When I teach kids, I always tell them to enjoy learning new skills. At school, I played many sports like rounders, baseball, athletics, and basketball. I know now that a good education is important, but back then, I only thought about football. The teachers did a good job, but I didn’t notice it at the time.

I don’t want my son to be like that. We are already trying to read him books, even though he is too young to sit still for long. I hope he doesn’t just want to kick the books around like I did.

At the start of my professional football career, the manager made big sacrifices so younger players like me could play for the first team. He never made a big speech about it, but we all knew we had to do our best. I scored in my first game, but we lost. A famous TV presenter said, ""You can’t win anything with kids."" This made us realize we had a lot to do. We had some doubts, but we believed in ourselves as a team.

I depend a lot on my close friends and family. Having money can sometimes cause problems. People ask me why my mother still works. I help my parents with money. I paid off their house loan and bought them a car for Christmas. My family is strong, and they don’t want to be treated like they need my money. My mom loves her job as a hairdresser, even if she doesn’t earn much. I enjoy using my money to help my family.

I have a lot of money, but not as much as people think. Money does not solve all my problems. After I stop playing football, I want to take a year off to do things I couldn’t do before. I want to go skiing the day after I stop playing. I can’t do that now because if I break my leg while skiing, I might not be able to play football again, and I wouldn’t be insured."
24,"It was Sam Carter who helped us move to Reef Point. Sam was my father’s agent in Los Angeles. My father could not write anything while we lived there, so Sam wanted to help us find a cheap place to live. The beach at Reef Point was usually quiet because many people went to a nicer place called La Carmella nearby. But when summer came, many people started to visit Reef Point.

My father was busy every day trying to write a script. I often went to the beach with my dog, Rusty. When we first moved to Reef Point, we did not have a dog, but Rusty came to us. I tried to send him away, but he always came back. One day, I felt sorry for him and gave him some water. My father did not like Rusty at first, but he did not really try to chase him away.

Rusty loved the beach. He liked to dig and bring things to me, but sometimes he found things that did not belong to him, like a sneaker or a beach towel. I had to give those back to their owners. Rusty also liked to swim with me, even though I could swim better and faster than he could. 

One day, after swimming, my father went to Los Angeles to deliver his script. Rusty and I stayed on the beach and watched the surfers. They were having fun riding the waves. One surfer was very good and caught my attention. When she finished, she came over to talk to me. 

“Why didn’t you join us?” she asked. 

“I don’t have a surfboard,” I replied.

“You could get one,” she said.

“I don’t have any money,” I told her.

“Are you British? Are you visiting?” she asked.

“No, I live here,” I said.

“Is your father American?” she continued.

“No, he came here to write a film script from a novel he wrote,” I explained.

“Really? What’s his name?” she asked.

“Rufus Marsh,” I answered.

“Do you mean ‘Tall as the Morning’?” she said.

I nodded. “I read that book,” she said with interest. I felt happy because people were friendly when I talked about my father’s book."
25,"Violet Hetherington was confused. She was in a long line at the dock in Southampton, waiting to get on the Queen Caroline ship. Her friend Annie had told her to arrive late to avoid waiting too long. But now, Violet wished she had come earlier. 

After some time, an announcement said there was a problem with the computer system. The people waiting became unhappy. They had paid a lot of money for this trip, and they wanted to enjoy it. Violet felt like she had made a mistake by coming on this cruise. 

She reached into her bag and realized her phone was missing. This made her even more upset. She needed her phone to call the taxi company to see if she left it in the taxi. But she couldn’t because all her phone numbers were in her phone. Her son Harry always told her to be careful with her phone, and now she wished she had listened.

In the line behind her, a nice couple offered to help. Violet asked to use their phone to call Harry. She left a message for him to ask their neighbor, Kristina, to check if her phone was at home. If it wasn’t, she would have trouble finding important numbers in New York.

Finally, the line moved, and Violet handed over her travel documents to get on the ship. When she entered the ship, it looked like a fancy hotel but not very nice. There were shiny decorations and bright lights everywhere. 

Violet followed the signs to the elevators. The elevator was full of tired passengers, and she felt squished. It stopped at each floor, letting people out until she reached the twelfth floor. 

When she got to her room, she was happy to see it had the balcony she wanted. She had worried about this, but now she felt relieved. She had paid a lot of money to make sure she had a good view of the sea."
26,"When John Maloof bought a box of old photo negatives at an auction, he did not know he was starting to discover the story of Vivian Maier. Maloof wanted pictures for a book about Portage Park, a neighborhood in Chicago, USA. Instead, he found 30,000 photos taken by Maier, a street photographer who had a special talent for taking interesting pictures. Since then, Maloof has collected many things about Maier’s life and work. In his home, he keeps her cameras, 2,000 rolls of film, 3,000 prints, and 100,000 negatives, along with some 8mm movies and audiotapes.

One morning, Maloof looked around at all this and felt excited. He said, “When I bought all this, I had no idea what it was. I could have just sold it to someone else.” For a while, Maloof and his friend Anthony Rydzon have been learning about Maier’s life. They talked to families who hired her as a nanny and to people who developed her film. Maier was born in 1926 in New York and spent much of her childhood in France. In 1951, she returned to New York and then moved to Chicago in 1956 to work as a nanny.

Maier was a private person and always carried a camera. She wore big coats, wide-brimmed hats, and sturdy shoes. Maren Baylaender, whose husband hired Maier to care for his daughter, said, “On her day off, she always had her camera. We wouldn’t see her until late at night.” Maier had strong opinions about movies and politics and knew a lot about theater and films. Even though she was not very social, she walked the streets with her camera and sometimes interviewed people on audiotape. She loved documenting the world around her.

Rydzon said, “She was a true artist and followed her dreams. She didn’t let anything stop her.” Maier’s work is real art; she did not take pictures for money. Her photos often show women, children, the elderly, the poor, and abstract scenes. Photography expert Larry Silverman said, “Vivian has many interesting pictures.” He thinks her work shows the influence of other photographers and wonders if she created her own style.

Maloof often thinks about whether he will ever go through all the negatives he has stored in three tall, fireproof cabinets. He did not care much about photography until he found Maier’s work. Inspired by her photos, he started taking his own pictures. He said, “I realized that the people and street scenes were more important than I thought. I was sitting on something more important than I ever imagined. Now our goal is to make Vivian Maier known and get her into the history books.”"
27,"Eleanor Catton is a young writer from New Zealand. Her book, The Luminaries, is very successful. I spoke with her in the UK when her book was popular. She was calm, even though she was busy. She had just come from Germany and was going back to New Zealand the next day.

Eleanor told me a funny story. Once, at passport control, an official asked her to prove she was a writer. She showed her book and the official asked, “What is it about?” This is a hard question for a writer. 

The Luminaries takes place in New Zealand in the 1860s. There are many crimes, and twelve men are trying to solve them. The story is very complicated. Eleanor wanted to write a murder mystery, but she found that using the past made the story more interesting. Her book is over 800 pages long because she wanted to give a good story to each of the 20 main characters.

When I asked her how it feels to be successful at a young age, she said it feels nice. She feels that people from her small country share in her success. She also mentioned that some people think her book is not serious, which annoys her.

Eleanor had a unique idea for her book. She wanted to write it in a spiral shape, where each part is shorter than the one before. This makes the story speed up as you read. She said she wanted to create patterns in the book that readers could notice if they wanted to.

Even with its special structure, The Luminaries is still an exciting murder mystery. Eleanor did not plan the whole story before writing. Instead, she would write herself into difficult situations and then find creative ways to solve them. She wanted to make the book fun for readers.

We also talked about her love for TV dramas. I asked if she would like to write for TV. She thought that could be cool. She gets very excited when she talks about writing and her home in New Zealand. She notices that being in a different place changes how she thinks. Many writers leave New Zealand for bigger cities, but she wants to stay in New Zealand for now. I hope it inspires her to write more novels."
28,"Jonny Kinkead was a boy who loved to make things in his dad's garage and play the guitar. For the last forty years, he has built acoustic guitars by hand. He is still amazed by how two pieces of wood can make beautiful music. Jonny learned to play guitar when he was eleven and wanted to learn bass guitar at sixteen. Instead of saving money for one, he decided to make it himself. He studied how different shapes and types of wood change the sound of the guitar.

Before making the bass guitar, Jonny and his brothers built model boats and planes. Their dad taught them how to use tools. Jonny also fixed instruments for his friends. His first bass guitar was good, but he did not think about making guitars as a job at that time. He liked painting and sculpture too. After school, he studied architecture because he liked design. But halfway through, he left because it was not for him. He realized that making guitars was like making art, but it was something people could use.

Since then, Jonny has made guitars for a living. For ten years, he also cleaned windows to earn extra money. At first, he sold his guitars for the cost of materials, but as he became known as a good guitar maker, he could charge more. Even now, he says he is just getting by. He can only make about ten guitars a year, which limits his income. In the beginning, he worked hard to get known. He went to music festivals to show his guitars and meet musicians.

Jonny thinks it is easier for new guitar makers today. When he started, many people believed that only American guitars were good. But now, UK-made guitars are respected. He believes new makers should take courses to learn valuable skills. However, he also thinks that learning by trying and making mistakes is very important. He says that if you only learn from someone else, you might miss out on other ways to make a good guitar."
29,"When people talk about English conversation, they often start with the weather. A famous writer from the 1700s, Dr. Johnson, said, ""When two Englishmen meet, their first talk is of the weather."" This is still true today. Many people try to explain why English people talk about the weather so much, but they often get it wrong. They think that English people are very interested in the weather itself.

For example, the American writer Bill Bryson says that English weather is not very interesting. He points out that in England, there are no big storms like tornadoes or monsoons. However, the English broadcaster Jeremy Paxman disagrees. He believes that English weather is interesting because it is always changing. He says that in England, you can never be sure what the weather will be like.

I think both Bryson and Paxman miss the real reason why English people talk about the weather. When they say things like ""Nice day, isn’t it?"" or ""Ooh, isn’t it cold?"" they are not really asking about the weather. These phrases are just ways to start a conversation or fill a pause. Talking about the weather is a way for English people to connect with each other, like how monkeys groom each other to bond.

There are three main times when English people talk about the weather: as a greeting, to start a conversation, or when there is a quiet moment and they need something to say. This is why it seems like English people talk about the weather all the time. A conversation might start with a weather greeting, then move to other topics, and return to the weather when there is a pause. This is why many people think that English people are obsessed with the weather."
30,"Alice Leader was standing in front of Hadrian’s Wall in Britain. She was with her class of 12- and 13-year-olds. She wanted to show them how amazing it was that the Romans built a wall that is 120 km long and 5 meters high about 1900 years ago. The students were excited about this trip. They chose it instead of going to Spain, Greece, or France. But they wanted to know why the wall was built. Alice felt she did not have good answers for them. 

Alice could not find a good historical novel about life at the Wall during Roman times. So, she decided to write one herself. After teaching for 31 years, she started a new career as a writer in 2001. She felt nervous but also excited. She said, “Teaching is like acting. It is hard work. Writing is exciting, but it is not so tiring.” Her old teaching friends were jealous because she still connects with children through her stories.

Alice wants her books to be different from many other books for young people today. She thinks many of these books talk about sad things or are just fantasy, like Harry Potter. Her books are not like that. Alice always taught English and History together. She loved to see when a child goes from being bored to being interested. She said, “I love having bored children because it means I need to make them interested.”

Alice started writing because she saw a need for different stories. She also felt a change was coming as her two sons were leaving home. Her head teacher suggested she take a creative writing course. At first, Alice did not want to do it. She had been teaching for 25 years and thought she did not need the course. But she had to send a story to the teachers before she could join. She quickly wrote a story about a Roman couple and their baby. After three hours, she had 30 pages and sent it in. She was accepted into the course.

During the course, other students read her story and gave her good feedback. They told her to try to publish it. Alice asked her school head teacher for a year off to write her first novel. Her husband, Zachary Leader, helped her by editing her work. Alice said, “My mother-in-law thinks we are rival authors, but I think we help each other. He changes my sentences and suggests better words. I like to add more scenes.” This is how Alice sees the difference between a writer and an editor."
31,"To raise money for charity, a newspaper and a TV company asked brothers Jonny and Alistair Brownlee, who are champion triathletes, to join a special race. This race would have Jonny in a car and Alistair on a mountain bike. They would race in the beautiful and hilly Yorkshire Dales in northern England. Jonny would drive on the roads, while Alistair would ride across the countryside.

“I’m excited!” Jonny said at the start line. “I’ve never done this before. The views are beautiful, and it’s cold, so I can stay warm in the car.” Alistair was also excited but wore warm cycling clothes. He joked, “I’ve seen Jonny drive before, so I’m not sure he will win. I might stop for tea on the way!”

The race started at Semerwater lake and would finish at Fleet Moss, which is the highest road in Yorkshire, about 350 meters up. Jonny had an easy drive, but Alistair had to climb a steep hill right away. They quickly shook hands and began the race. Alistair rode fast on his bike, while Jonny got in his car and drove off. The question was, who would finish first?

Jonny’s confidence dropped quickly. Just 15 seconds into his drive, he had to stop for a big tractor on the road. “Welcome to Yorkshire,” he said to the cameraman. “If Alistair beats me, it’s because of this farmer!” After getting past the tractor, Jonny drove on, while Alistair struggled with the hill. He had to get off his bike and carry it up the steep slope, while sheep watched him curiously.

Finally, Alistair reached the top of the hill. The sun came out, and he started to ride faster. Meanwhile, Jonny faced more problems on the narrow roads of the villages. He had to drive slowly and carefully. After leaving the last village, he raced straight to the finish line.

Neither brother knew how close they were to each other. Jonny drove fast towards Fleet Moss, while Alistair rode hard across his last field. As Alistair reached the finish line, he asked the crowd, “Is he here?” When they said no, he raised his arms in joy and shouted, “Yes!”

A few minutes later, Jonny arrived in his car. “Well done,” he said to Alistair, feeling disappointed. “I’m really sad.”"
32,"The silence is what you notice when you play on Centre Court at Wimbledon. You bounce the ball quietly on the soft grass. You toss it up to serve and hit it, hearing only your own shot. The quiet place, the nice grass, the history, the old stadium, the players in white, and the respectful crowd all make you feel safe and away from the outside world. This silence helps my game. In a tennis match, I try hard to focus only on the game and the point I am playing. 

When a point ends, the silence breaks with noise: applause, cheers, and people shouting my name. I hear them, but it feels far away. I don’t think about the fifteen thousand people watching me. I am so focused that I don’t realize millions are watching me play Roger Federer in the 2008 Wimbledon final, the biggest match of my life. I always dreamed of playing at Wimbledon. My uncle Toni, my coach, told me from a young age that this was the biggest tournament. By 14, I was telling my friends I would play there one day and win.

Before 2008, I had played and lost to Federer twice in the finals. Losing in 2006 was not too hard. I was happy to be there at twenty years old. Federer won easily. But losing in 2007 was very hard for me. I knew I could have played better, but my mind let me down. I cried for half an hour in the dressing room after that loss. Losing hurts, but it hurts more when you have a chance to win and you lose it. 

Toni is usually tough on me, even when I win. But after my loss in 2007, he told me not to cry and that there would be more chances to play at Wimbledon. I told him he didn’t understand; I thought it was my last chance. I know that a professional athlete's career is short, and I want to make the most of it. Every moment is important, but some moments are more important than others, and I let a big one go in 2007. 

Toni could not make me feel better, but he was right. Another chance came in 2008, just one year later. I felt confident I had learned from my loss. The best sign that I was ready was that I believed I would win. The night before the final, at dinner with my family and friends, we did not talk about the match. I didn’t tell them not to talk about it, but they knew I was already thinking about the game in my mind. From that moment until the match started, that space in my mind was just for me."
33,"In early April 1957, a young Englishwoman named Jane Goodall arrived in Africa. She wrote home saying, ""I am living in the Africa I have always wanted."" Jane spent most of her life in Africa. She worked as a journalist, scientist, activist, and environmentalist. 

In 1963, Jane became famous when Britain’s National Geographical Society made articles and TV shows about her research on chimpanzees. She also wrote popular books, including children's books and a bestseller called ""In the Shadow of Man,"" which has been translated into 47 languages. Jane Goodall is one of the most famous female scientists of the 20th century. 

Many stories about her life focus on her adventures and dreams, but they often do not show her real achievements. Jane Goodall is a pioneer in her field and is known for her important research on chimpanzees. She helped us understand that chimpanzees have emotions like humans and live in social groups similar to ours. Before her work, people did not know that chimpanzees eat meat or use tools. 

Her book, ""The Chimpanzees of Gombe,"" published in 1986, is a key work in chimpanzee research. Jane studied wild chimpanzees in Gombe State, Nigeria, for many years. Her work changed how we study animals and how we think about ourselves as humans.

Even as a child, Jane showed her interest in animals. When she was five years old, she disappeared one day. Her family and the police searched for her. After a long search, she came back with straw in her hair. She had crawled into a henhouse to see how hens lay eggs. She stayed very still for five hours until she got her answer. This moment shows her early love for biology."
34,"Shirley Ford is a voiceover artist. In our first conversation, she shows me many different voices. She can sound like a funny 8-year-old boy, a tired mother, an old Scottish woman, and even a fast-talking alien. People who watch children’s TV and cartoons know her voices well. Shirley tells me she just did a voiceover about back injuries and had to learn many medical words quickly.

Shirley explains that doing voiceovers is not just about being funny. You need to make the script interesting for people who cannot see you. Many famous actors want to do voiceovers, but they often do not get the job because they are used to acting with their whole bodies.

After school, Shirley took a drama course. She wanted to be a regular actor. While studying, she sang jingles for TV ads. One day, the man at the recording studio asked her to try out for a rabbit character in a cartoon. She thought it was silly but tried it for fun and got the part. This made her realize she could do voices well and that voiceover work could be her career.

In her second film, she played the main character and also her brother and mother. Many adult women do the voices for small boys and girls because their voices are higher. It is complicated to hire child actors, so production companies often prefer adult women.

Shirley learned to make different sounds and to not always sound the same. She watches children’s TV to collect new voices. She enjoys working on cartoons the most, but she also does educational videos and ads. Sometimes, she has to sound excited about things she does not care about, like vacuum cleaners. She says smiling while talking makes her voice sound happy.

The competition for voiceover work is tough. A good showreel, which shows what an artist can do, is very important. Shirley believes it is worth making a strong showreel. There are agencies that help voiceover artists create them. She thinks she has succeeded because she works hard and does not give up.

For people who want to be voiceover artists, Shirley suggests going to special workshops that teach different types of voiceover work. She loves voices and often becomes the characters she plays. Sometimes, after doing a specific voice, she continues to talk like that for hours or even days. Her children are used to her speaking in many different voices."
35,"People often ask me how I became a cartoonist. This is normal because many kids dream of being cartoonists, just like they dream of being race car drivers. But most people stop dreaming and choose more practical jobs, like being a tax lawyer or making car parts. It seems silly to think you can make a living by drawing simple pictures, but some people do it.

Not everyone becomes a cartoonist in the same way, but most have wanted to be one for a long time. I loved comic strips as a child, drew for school papers, and was known as ""the kid who draws."" I studied graphic design in college. After I graduated, I showed my drawings to different companies. I was lucky to find a newspaper that wanted political cartoons about local issues. I created some ideas, and they bought them. Soon, I was making enough money to live on.

You don’t need much to be a cartoonist. You don’t need a university degree, a lot of money, or even great drawing skills. You just need your brain, your hand, and something to draw with. But if it were that easy, there would be many more cartoonists than teachers. Being a cartoonist is hard work. It is easier to get a regular job that pays well and gives you time for family and hobbies.

The more skills you have, the better chance you have to earn money with your art. I have done political cartoons, comic strips, and comic books. I have also written, made caricatures, and designed things. I take any job because you can learn a lot, even from work you don’t like. It helps to be smart, read a lot, and be curious about the world.

What about the business side of being a cartoonist? In the past, many cartoonists had regular jobs with different newspapers and magazines. Now, most cartoonists have to sell their own work. If you are good at business, you will do better. I have seen cartoonists who are not very creative but have good business skills do much better than those who are very talented but don’t know how to sell their work.

Some people worry too much about others stealing their ideas. They are so scared that they won’t even show their work to anyone! To protect your work, you just need to draw a small ‘c’ for ‘copyright,’ put a circle around it, and write your name and the date. But honestly, it is more likely that no one will care about your work. If someone does take your cartoon and it becomes popular online, it is not a disaster – it can actually be a great opportunity!"
36,"Twenty years ago, I was moving to a new house and cleaning out my things. I decided to throw away an electric guitar that my dad had given me for my 16th birthday. It was a nice black guitar from Japan. I usually don’t like to throw things away, so I was surprised I wanted to get rid of it. I took it to the dump and was about to put it in the trash when a young man came up to me. He looked confused and asked, “You’re not going to throw that away, are you?” I said yes, and he asked if he could have it. I said yes, and we went our separate ways. 

After that, I felt sad about giving it away. A few months ago, I opened an email that changed everything. I remembered a story about a man who lost his wedding ring in the ocean and found it years later in a fish. That’s how I felt when I read the email from a man named Keith Rushton, who fixes and sells guitars. He said, “I have your electric guitar.” 

The guitar had been sold many times since I gave it away. Keith found my name on a label on the guitar and looked for me online. He contacted me through the newspaper I work for and offered to sell it back to me. I was so happy! I would have given him anything for it, but his price was fair. I had forgotten that my dad put name labels on everything I owned, even my guitar. My parents wanted me to learn classical guitar because it was popular in the 1970s. I loved the sound of it; it was calm and gentle. But I didn’t get better at it, so I switched to electric guitar, which was easier to play.

When I opened the box with my old guitar, I remembered my birthday in 1978 when my parents gave it to me. Holding it again felt amazing. I had to stand up and put a strap on my shoulder because electric guitars are played that way. My fingers remembered where to go. I couldn’t draw the chords, but my hands knew what to do. Playing the guitar hurt my fingers a little, but it felt good. 

Electric guitars are usually played in a band. Now that I am learning again, I think I should form a band. My son is learning the saxophone, so maybe we can play together. Or maybe I can find other people my age who have had a similar experience. We could call ourselves “The Regainers!”"
37,"Text: 

There has been a lot of talk about sleep recently. I wrote a book called Insomniac about people who cannot sleep well. I wanted to warn people about the dangers of not getting enough sleep. Sleep is very important for our minds, bodies, and feelings. People who have trouble sleeping know how important sleep is. It is good that people are now talking more about sleep. 

But what about dreams? I have not heard much about dreams in these talks. We lose our dreams all the time. When you wake up early because of an alarm, you miss the last hour or two of sleep. This lost sleep is mostly REM sleep, which is the stage of sleep when we dream the most. Our best and most memorable dreams happen in REM sleep just before we wake up. A good sleeper spends about a quarter of their sleep time in REM. So, if a person lives for 90 years, they will spend six or seven years dreaming in REM sleep.

When researchers take away REM sleep from people, they find that the next night, people have more REM sleep. This shows that dreams are important. In 1953, researchers found REM sleep, and many agreed with psychologist Sigmund Freud, who said that understanding dreams helps us understand our minds. But later studies showed that it is not that simple. Now, researchers focus more on the physical reasons for dreams rather than the psychological ones. 

Currently, there is not much agreement among dream researchers, according to Robert Stickgold from Harvard University. Dreams are important. At a meeting of sleep experts, P.F. Pagel from the University of Colorado found that actors, writers, and directors remember and use their dreams better than other people. He believes that creative people use their dreams more. This makes sense because films are very dream-like.

But I wonder, do only creative people need their dreams? Don’t teachers, software designers, and politicians also need to think creatively? Stickgold says that dreams help us connect ideas in new and surprising ways. They help us find new patterns and think differently. For example, when people are woken from REM sleep and asked to think of something related to a word, their ideas are more original than when they wake from other sleep stages. They think of unexpected connections. This is what creativity is.

I find that I write better after having intense dreams. Even a bad dream can help me think better. On those days, my ideas come out quickly, and I can hardly keep up with my typing. I don’t know how it works, but it does help. Creativity is not just for writers or artists. We all live in a complex world. We need our brains to work well. We need to think creatively and flexibly in our relationships with others. This is why dreaming is important."
38,"Twenty years ago, Susie Ray left London to live in a small town by the sea in south-west England. When you enter her studio, you see a beautiful view of the sea and many empty frames on the walls, along with happy pictures of her two daughters. Susie is a talented copyist artist. She can copy famous paintings from the past very well. “I don’t keep my own paintings,” Susie says. “As soon as I finish them, I sell them.” 

Many people want her work. In her 30 years as a copyist, she has painted many famous artists like Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh. Her copies are so good that experts sometimes think they are the real paintings. The real paintings can sell for millions of pounds, but her copies sell for a few hundred pounds to £12,000, depending on how much time she spends on them. 

Susie does not tell the names of her clients, but they include art galleries and private collectors. Some collectors love art, but others want to show off. One famous buyer likes to say he has a ‘Van Gogh’ painting, but it is really a ‘Susie Ray Van Gogh’. “Many famous people pretend my copies are real,” she says. “That’s their choice.” Some collectors keep the real painting in a bank and show Susie’s copy at home. 

Susie is honest about her work. When she copies a famous painting, she tries to make it look as real as possible. She believes that doing a bad job would be unfair to the original artist. However, she puts her name on the back of the canvas. It is illegal to sell a copy as the real painting, and even though some people make money this way, Susie does not want to do that. People who make fake art often get into trouble. 

Susie is not rich, and she has had hard times, but now she feels more secure. She does not want to risk her good name with collectors and artists. Before being a copyist, Susie worked as an illustrator at a botanical garden after finishing her art degree. She earned very little money, but it helped her learn important skills. She had to be very careful and get things right the first time. She is happy she found a job that pays better.

When young artists ask Susie for advice, she tells them to learn to draw well and to be accurate. She has studied a lot to do her work. She can draw plants and make copies of old paintings, but she now focuses on French impressionists like Manet, Cezanne, and Degas. 

Some people think modern art is easy, but Susie believes that impressionists worked hard and were very careful. This makes their art difficult to copy. People wonder why Susie does not create her own art. She says her work comes from many years of practice, and she earns a good living from it. She has tried to make her own art, like oil paintings of fishing nets, but they looked too much like photographs. 

Susie is a perfectionist, and she wants everything to be just right."
39,"Ellen MacArthur loved the sea and wanted to be the fastest sailor. Since she was a child, sailing was her big passion. She felt very connected to her boat, Kingfisher, which she used to sail around the world. When she was on land, life felt boring. She wanted to be back on the ocean, facing challenges, even in dangerous places.

After she finished second in a big race called the Vendée Globe, she showed me her small boat. She lived in a tiny space for 94 days. She planned everything carefully, even how many paper towels she needed. She had special food, a small stove, and medical supplies. She took great care of her boat because it was her home and her life depended on it.

Now, Ellen sees the world like a boat that is beautiful but fragile. She had a big change in her thinking when she visited South Georgia, a lonely island. There, she helped with a study about albatross birds. This experience made her think about how we use resources. She saw old whaling stations and felt that people take what they want and leave.

When I visited Ellen at her office, she was finishing a call. She told me we need to act now to protect the planet. She said that coal, oil, and gas are limited resources. We need to find ways to use less. At first, she focused on using less, but now she talks about re-using things, like special carpet tiles.

For three years, she has been visiting factories and talking to people about our dependence on resources that cannot be replaced. She says she is not an expert, but she loves learning. She feels that sailing was selfish compared to her new mission. She started the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a charity that helps young people think about a sustainable future.

Ellen misses the adventure of sailing. It is a big part of who she is. When she is at sea, she feels connected to everything and focused on survival. She believes her new message is important, even if it is not as simple as being the fastest sailor. She thinks this work is more meaningful than anything she has done before."
40,"Jordan Romero is 13 years old. He wants to be the youngest person to climb Mount Everest. If he succeeds, he could be very famous. Jordan hopes to inspire other kids to go outside and climb their own mountains. His climbing team includes his father, Paul, and his mother, Karen. They call themselves ""Team Romero."" Climbing Everest is just one of their goals. If Jordan climbs Everest and Vinson Massif in Antarctica, he will be the youngest person to climb the Seven Summits, which are the highest mountains on each continent. Very few people do this before they are thirty years old. Jordan has already climbed five of them and might finish before he turns 20.

Many famous climbers think it is not a good idea for a 13-year-old to climb Everest. They believe that while Jordan may be strong, he might not be emotionally ready. They also think he may not have enough experience to make good decisions while climbing. The Romero family has heard these opinions before. Paul says, ""I know people criticize us, but we have a lot to do. We think about the risks, but we believe our experience will help. Watching Jordan grow gives me confidence.""

Paul also wants to make sure that Jordan really wants to do this. He says, ""This project is not about me wanting to be famous. At first, Jordan thought he would do this later, but we decided, 'Why not now?' We talk to him often to see if he still wants to climb."" When asked why he wants to climb, Jordan says, ""I just focus on my goal.""

In the past, not many people cared about being the youngest or fastest climber. Now, every adventure is shared online, and people want to break records. This makes it hard for Jordan. Some people think that trying to achieve records takes away the fun of climbing. But if Jordan wants to inspire others, he needs to share his journey online, take photos, and give interviews. He needs to do something amazing, like climbing Everest.

Paul adds, ""If Jordan comes home tomorrow and says he wants to stop climbing and play basketball instead, we will stop this project and go to the gym."""
41,"When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, they are probably not listening to classical music. Many people can name many pop groups, but if you ask my friends about Brahms, they look confused. I just started studying music, but my classmates know as little about classical music as other teenagers. If you don’t know who wrote the music, you probably don’t have any of their recordings. This is sad for people who love classical music. Last year, only 3% of concert tickets sold were for classical music, and most classical recordings sell only 300 copies. This is hard to believe.

So, why are fewer people interested in classical music? Older people often blame our love for TV and video games, but I don’t think that is the reason. The truth is that classical music does not attract most people, especially teenagers, who buy the most music and concert tickets. I know some teenagers who go to classical concerts, but they are few. Even though I play in an orchestra, I don’t really like classical music. I enjoy many types of music, but I listen to classical music very little.

Why don’t teenagers like classical music? First, classical music has many changes in mood and rhythm, which can be hard for us. We like fast talking, fast playing, and fast thinking. Experts say we can only pay attention for about three minutes, which is too short for most classical pieces but just right for pop songs. Pop music is simple and easy to listen to, while classical music needs more time and focus. Also, pop music talks about things that interest teenagers, while classical music often does not have lyrics and can be long.

The way we listen to music has changed too. In the past, families would play music together at home, and playing an instrument was important. Now, we can find any music we want online, but we rarely hear classical music in our daily lives. When was the last time you heard classical music in a store? One of my teachers says that more people are going to classical concerts now. Maybe, but I don’t think many of them are teenagers. In my orchestra, we play classical music in many places, but when I look at the audience, I mostly see older people. I don’t know why more middle-aged people like classical concerts, but I do know that if your parents love something, you might want to avoid it.

Some people say schools are to blame for teenagers not liking classical music, but many kids want to play classical music in their school orchestras. They come early to practice and stay after school to rehearse. They enjoy classical music when they play it, but it is not their favorite music otherwise. The two activities have become separate. When we want to relax, we always choose pop music."
42,"Bonnie Wyndham got out of her mother’s car and looked at Almonside School. “I will make you sorry I came here,” she said with a smile. Her mother was getting out of the car too, so she didn’t hear Bonnie, but Bonnie didn’t mind. Her mother knew how she felt. Mrs. Wyndham looked around. Almonside was a strange school with many buildings hidden in the trees on a hill. It looked confusing at first. Then she saw signs: Science block, gym, riding center… “Riding center,” Bonnie said, suddenly interested. “Headmaster’s study,” her mother said. “This way.” Bonnie followed her mother along a wide path between the trees. “I wish you would walk beside me instead of behind me like a dog,” Mrs. Wyndham said tiredly, but she didn’t expect Bonnie to do that.

A few minutes later, her mother was talking to Bonnie’s new headmaster in his office, while Bonnie waited outside the door. Suddenly, Bonnie stood up. “Why should I just sit here?” she said to herself. “I will be sent away soon anyway, so why not go now?” She left the building and went to the riding center, following the sign. There was a nice old building for the horses and a big place for indoor riding. Bonnie looked around, but there was no one there. She walked carefully to the horses, treating them with respect. The horses were well cared for, and she could see that right away. Almost every stall had a horse, and she looked at each one.

“I know what you are doing here,” she said to a small pony, touching its nose. Then she saw the next horse and stopped. “But aren’t you the best!” she said. He was brown with a little white. He looked lively, and Bonnie liked that. “I feel like we have met before,” she said, petting his neck. “In my dreams, I was riding you to win a big competition…” The horse’s name was Maverick. Suddenly, she wanted to ride him. “I wonder where I can find a bridle and a saddle,” she thought. The room with the riding gear was open, and Bonnie was happy to see that.

She was so focused on putting the saddle on Maverick that she forgot about her mother and the headmaster. When she sat on the big horse outside, she felt like a queen. Her old school nickname was Queen Bee, and she laughed as she remembered it. “You are the best horse I have ever ridden, Maverick,” she said. “I know about horses, even if I don’t know about anything else.” She nudged him to walk, then to trot. “If I stay here, I think we could be great friends,” she said. She rode around the paddock, feeling the wind on her face. She could tell Maverick trusted her, and she felt sure he would jump well."
43,"I met Cody Simpson before, and I was impressed by his quiet confidence. Cody is a 15-year-old from Australia. He has already released many successful songs. How did this relaxed surfer become a star in front of many fans? 

Cody says, ""I first picked up a guitar when I was six years old and started writing songs when I was seven."" He loved swimming and surfing more than anything else at that time. When he was 13, he was in high school and posted some videos online. These videos changed everything. He started with a video of him and a friend singing at a school concert. Fans wanted to see more of his videos on social media. So, Cody recorded more videos at home, and the fans loved them.

Cody was also a great swimmer. He trained hard with good coaches. But then, record labels wanted him to sign a deal. He had to choose: stay in Australia and keep swimming or take a big risk and move to the US with his family. Cody decided to take the risk. 

He said, ""It was very difficult for me to choose a career at such a young age. Can you imagine being 12 or 13 and trying to decide what you want to do for the rest of your life?"" He had to tell his swimming coach and friends that he was moving to America. Most people were surprised because he is a quiet kid. He believes it is important to be modest in this crazy world.

Cody packed his bags and moved with his family to another country, giving up one dream to follow another. His family stays out of the spotlight but supports him. Cody thinks it is important to have good people around you to stay grounded.

Sometimes, he feels doubt. He thinks about how his decision affects his little brother and sister. His brother is eight years old and travels the world, doing school on the road. Cody worries about this sometimes, but his family always supports him.

Cody believes that success comes from being ready to say ""yes"" to big opportunities, even if it is scary. He says, ""Everything happened so fast and unexpectedly. Now, I go to countries I never thought I would visit and play for many fans. It is a dream for many people, but I know it won’t last forever."""
44,"I jumped out of bed and looked out the window at the river. I saw a crack in the ice shining in the morning sun. I looked upstream at the sandbags that protect the buildings from flooding when the ice melts. My back hurt from lifting the sandbags last week. I worked hard with many people in the town to help. My grandfather did not notice my work.

I looked at the dark water from the factory. There was ice on both sides of the water. I took off my pajamas and put on my kayaking wetsuit. I saw a boy on the other side of the river. I did not know him. He was trying to balance on the ice near the warm water from the factory. I zipped up my wetsuit and checked my jacket pocket for my lucky silver chain. My grandfather gave it to me after his trip to South America. Only my mom, my grandfather, and I know about it. I also have his diary from that trip, and I read it before I sleep.

I went to the kitchen. “Good morning, Rex,” my mom said with a smile. “You are up early for a Saturday. I will make brunch after your training. Be careful.” “Thanks, Mom,” I replied. I walked down the hallway and almost bumped into my grandfather. “Watch where you’re going!” he shouted. “Where are you going?” “Sorry, Grandpa. I’m going kayaking.” He should have known that by my wetsuit.

Grandpa said, “What’s the point of training? You didn’t win the competition.” His words hurt, but I took a deep breath and counted to three. He went into the bathroom and slammed the door. My mom came to me with a kind smile. “Don’t mind him. He’s…” “...not himself right now,” I said. I wanted to say he always was like this, but I didn’t. I remembered when I was a child, he was my hero. He showed me pictures of his adventures in National Geographic magazine. Those pictures are still on his wall with his medals and trophies. But I don’t go into his room anymore. I have my own trophies now, and maybe one day, I will be in National Geographic too. Still, I want to care for him, even if he is grumpy.

My mom smiled. “At least he is coming out of his room more. Have a good training session, Rex. I admire your determination to keep going, even in the cold!” I smiled back and ate my banana. “It will be warmer in South America if I find sponsors for my trip,” I said. She laughed and went back to the kitchen. I finished my banana and went outside to the boathouse."
45,"Mum grabbed Jess by the arm. ""Come with me,"" she said. Jess followed her to the study. On the table, there was a painting by Grandpa. It was different from his other paintings and not finished. 

""Do you know anything about this?"" Mum asked. Jess shook her head. ""I’ve never seen it before. I didn’t know he was working on anything."" 

Jess looked at the painting. It showed a river, but it was not a river she knew. It looked strange and beautiful. The riverbank was very small, with a little green. The water was pale and seemed to go to a hidden sea. There were no animals, birds, or people in the painting. It felt right that way. Jess thought about autumn coming after a long summer.

Mum spoke again. ""It has a name."" There was something in her voice that showed she was excited. Jess knew why. Grandpa never named his paintings. He just painted them and let others think about them. Mum turned the painting over and pointed to the words Grandpa had written. Jess read them: ""River Boy."" The words felt important to her, but she didn’t know why.

Then Jess looked at Mum. ""There is no boy."" 

""Exactly. It’s strange for him to be so specific. But maybe he will add the boy later. I made the mistake of asking him about it.""

""Mum! You should have known better.""

""I know, but I couldn’t help it. It’s such an unusual painting, especially with a name. You can guess what he said.""

Jess didn’t need to guess. She knew Grandpa would say, ""It’s not the artist's job to explain a painting. Each painting has its own life and language, like a poem. We either understand it or we don’t."" He would say painting is hard work, and he doesn’t have time to explain to everyone.

Mum laughed and said, ""Something like that. I was hoping you might know something about this painting since you seem to inspire him.""

""Inspire?"" Jess asked.

""Yes, someone who helps an artist.""

Jess knew what it meant. Grandpa often said it when she watched him paint. But she thought he meant a goddess, not a real person. It was hard to think anyone could inspire someone as strong-willed as Grandpa. 

""He doesn’t need me to inspire him,"" she said. ""He has been painting all his life."""
46,"This morning, I woke up and accidentally cut a hole in my bedroom carpet. I didn’t mean to do it. I could have tripped over the bed with Dad’s knife in my hand, and the knife might have gone into the carpet. That could have happened, but I’m not saying it did. I just didn’t plan to damage the carpet. I didn’t wake up and think, “Today I will cut a hole in my carpet.” It seemed like a good idea at the time, but later I wondered why I thought that. This happens to me a lot. 

What I was really doing was trying to fit my corner cabinet into a corner. My Gran gave me the cabinet when she moved to a flat. It is very cute! It is small, painted white, and has pink and blue flowers on it. It has tiny glass doors. Gran used to keep pretty china ornaments in it. I keep my shells and stones there. Gran knew I loved her cabinet, and I was very happy when she gave it to me!

The cabinet is a corner cabinet, so it has to go in a corner. My bedroom is the smallest room in the house, and it is shaped like a wedge of cheese. My parents have the big front bedroom, my sister Angela has the back room, and my brother Tom has the little room over the garage. I have the smallest room, which is like a broom cupboard. Mum says when Angela goes to university, Tom can have her room, and I can have Tom’s room. But since Angela is only fifteen, I think I will be in my small room for a long time. 

I don’t mind; I like my little bedroom. It is cozy, like a nest. I love the sloping roof and the window at floor level. The only problem is that there are not many corners! My bed is in one corner, and my wardrobe is in the other. I tried to fit Gran’s cabinet in the space between the roof and the floor, but it was a little too tall. 

Then I thought, if I can’t cut the cabinet, maybe I can cut a hole in the carpet! It seemed like a good idea. Dad always tells us to “think outside the box,” and that is what I was trying to do!"
47,"The novel ""The Borrowers"" is about a family of tiny people who live secretly in the walls and floors of a house. They borrow things from normal-sized people to survive. When I was asked to make a TV show from the book, I knew it would be hard to meet people’s expectations. Fans of the book have strong ideas about how it should be. I used the original drawings from the book a lot because I didn’t want people to say I did it wrong.

The author wanted the show to show things from the Borrowers' point of view, not from the humans'. This made filming more difficult. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans, so when we filmed them walking across a room, we had to be ten times further away than usual. The crew had to crawl on the ground and film from very low, about 15 centimeters high, to show the Borrowers' view. They went through many pairs of jeans!

We only raised the cameras for special shots. One big challenge was making the shadows look right when we combined the tiny Borrowers with the normal-sized background. We created a special way to do this. After the show was on TV, famous director George Lucas called me to ask how I did it.

We built only one set, which was the Borrowers' home under the floorboards. It was filled with giant objects to make the actors look small. It was very fun. I remember the coins we used; they were bigger than dinner plates and hard to lift. We often had to stop filming because the crew laughed so much. In the story, there is a scene where the Borrowers go down a drain. To film this, the actors had to go down a tunnel with hoses, and they said it was so scary that they didn’t need to act.

It was important to me to get the costumes right. I had them made from heavy canvas so they looked like doll clothes. This made it hard for the main actress to move. She couldn’t sit down during breaks and had to be sewn into her dress every morning. The lead actor wore trousers made from a rug because normal fabric looked too smooth. Unfortunately, it was very hot while we filmed, and I don’t think they were happy with me about the costumes!

Most of the action away from the Borrowers' home was filmed with the actors in front of a blue screen. It was hard for them to act with things that weren’t really there. I had to draw pictures of every scene to show how they should look. I made 2,000 drawings! We didn’t have enough money to use special effects studios during the day, so I worked nights for three months. We had to work quickly. One time, I filmed a whole scene and then realized there was no film in the camera! But in the end, everything came together, and I think the show was successful in showing the magic of the books."
48,"Mom stops the car at the corner of my new school, Palm Grove High School. She looks around nervously, expecting to see reporters, but there are none. I know that soon things will get crazy. It always happens. People will smile at me, want to be my friend, and ask for free tickets to my dad’s concerts. “Everything will be fine,” I tell her. She kisses her fingertip and touches my cheek before I get out of the car. Then she drives away, leaving me alone at this new school. But I wanted this. I wanted to leave my old life of traveling and tutors. While the rest of the band is here for recording, we are staying for good. I wanted to come to this school to meet normal kids. I want to meet kids with parents who have regular jobs, like working in an office or cutting grass. That would be so cool.

I walk into the school office. “Hi, I need my schedule, please,” I say to the secretary. “Name?” she asks, looking unfriendly. “Desert McGraw.” “Desirée?” she asks, leaning closer. “Desert,” I say again. The secretary looks confused. “Oh,” she says and types my last name. That’s good because not many people know my last name since my dad uses a stage name. “What grade?” she asks. “Eleventh.” “One second, it’s printing,” she replies. Then she gives me the paper. My first class is English Literature. Great! I like English. But I will be late. English is in Room 214 on the second floor. I studied the map last night so I wouldn’t look silly trying to find my classes.

When I reach the door, I hear the teacher calling names. “Aurelio Gonzalez.” “Here.” I quietly enter and sit at the back of the class. The girl next to me smiles. She looks at my normal outfit – jeans and a T-shirt. “Nice shoes,” she whispers. I look down at my fancy shoes with flowers. Oh no, I shouldn’t have worn these. “Thanks,” I say. The teacher stops calling names. “Desert... McGraw?” she says. “Here.” The teacher smiles and introduces herself as Ms. Smigla. She talks a lot and gives us our course outlines. After that, she lets us talk to each other! All teachers should do this.

“Why did you move here?” my new friend asks. I have a few answers. I could say I wanted a normal life away from cameras and reporters. Or I could say what my dad thinks: “We need a change, Desert,” he said. “This is the perfect place to record the new album.” I think he just wants to relax at the beach. Why else would they choose a studio so close to the sand? “My dad had to move,” I tell her. “What does he do?” she asks. I know everyone will find out soon, but I can pretend to be normal for a while. “He’s an artist,” I say, playing with my backpack zipper. “Cool. I’m Becca, by the way.” She doesn’t seem to care much. That’s good."
49,"Not only is the average American teenage girl expected to be the president of the Student Council, but she also needs to have a part-time job, volunteer, and do well in school. This is what it means to be a teenager in America today. Boys and girls cannot just go to school and be average because being average is not enough anymore. People think that if you do not try very hard, you are lazy.

Teenager Kristen Loose says, “Adults forget how much pressure we have. We have a lot of homework, tests, after-school activities, jobs, chores, and we also want to have a social life.” Even with all this stress, people still have negative ideas about teenagers. They think teenagers are lazy, disrespectful, loud, and only care about themselves. While some teenagers may act this way, it is not fair to say all teenagers are like this.

Kristen Loose believes that many people think teenagers only use their phones to watch TV or play games. She says this is not true. She uses her phone to help her with school and to stay in touch with people. Today, students can do their homework anywhere because of smartphones and social media. They can listen to lessons while going to school. Schoolwork does not stop when they leave school; it is always there, and they have to pay attention to it all the time.

Many teenagers wake up around 6 a.m. or 7 a.m. and often go to bed after midnight. They have a busy schedule with school, activities, family duties, and homework. They do not get enough sleep. The US National Sleep Foundation found that about 20 percent of teenagers get the recommended nine hours of sleep each night. Also, 28 percent of teens said they fall asleep in school about once a week because they are tired.

Teenager Lindamarie Olsen says she has about 18 hours of free time each week. With 168 hours in a week, 18 hours is not much. She does not spend her free time on social media or TV. Instead, she likes to volunteer. She says, “People think teenagers only care about themselves, but I love helping others. I want to make a positive difference in my school and community.”

In 20 years, the ideas about teenagers may change, but they will still be working hard and making the world better. There will always be new students who are doing great things before they finish school."
50,"The Earth to Sky Calculus Club is a group of teenagers who live in Bishop, a small mountain town in the US. This town is surrounded by nature and is near the Sierra Nevada mountains. In the last few years, the club has sent over fifty balloons high into the sky, about 35 kilometers above the Earth. This project is a mix of science and adventure, which is why many teenagers want to join.

One weekend in late spring, I joined them as they prepared to release a balloon. They wanted to see shooting stars, which are bright lights in the sky caused by rocks or metal from space entering the Earth's atmosphere. As it got dark, the teenagers attached a soft lunch box to the bottom of the balloon. Inside the lunch box were a camera, a tool to measure how high the balloon went, and a thermometer to check the temperature. They also put two GPS trackers on the outside to help find the lunch box later.

A gas tank, given by a friend from another state, was used to fill the balloon with gas. The balloon grew to the size of a small car. An older boy drove for seven hours to get the gas tank. He said, “I didn’t really mind.” For these kids, this is normal.

Finally, it was time for the balloon to go up. They counted down, “Five, four, three, two, one,” and the balloon started to rise. Some of the teenagers ran after it with flashlights, trying to see it in the dark sky. There was a quiet moment of wonder as the balloon disappeared into the night.

After the launch, most students went home, but a few stayed to watch for shooting stars. They lay on blankets and looked at the clear sky, which was surprising because it was only four hours from Los Angeles, a big city with about 4 million people. I saw a boy get into a sleeping bag and fall asleep. One girl said quietly, “We're the only ones talking.” Another girl whispered, “I know.” Suddenly, a meteor flew across the sky.

As the balloon went higher, it got bigger until it popped with a loud bang. A parachute helped the lunch box land safely back on Earth. The students would find it the next day using the GPS trackers. Finding it was not easy, but that was part of the fun. There is not much land with people around Bishop, so the lunch box usually lands in a remote area.

The group’s leader said, “Recoveries are a huge part of the program.” They had only lost two lunch boxes in 53 launches. He explained that this project helps them learn about the land in a way they usually do not.

This time, the lunch box landed 84 kilometers west of Bishop. To get it, the team had to drive south and then back up the mountains. They had to decide if they should drive or walk, especially if the lunch box was on a high mountain or in a tall tree. The leader said, “These students know the Eastern Sierra well. What seems wild to some is normal for others.”

In the end, it took them 11 hours to find the lunch box. It was in a canyon, on a flat rock, near a waterfall. The camera did not catch any shooting stars, which was a little disappointing. But it gave them a chance to talk about science and share another adventure story with anyone who asked."
51,"Chloe Morgan did not like science, especially Palaeontology, until she was fifteen years old. It happened by chance. Her younger brother was very interested in dinosaurs, which she did not care about at first. She helped him with a science project and found an article about new dinosaur discoveries. This surprised her, and she decided she wanted to study Palaeontology.

Chloe remembers meeting her first professional palaeontologist, Matt Cornelius. He was young and already famous. She was nervous to meet him because she thought he might find her annoying. But he was friendly and listened to her questions, which made her feel better.

Chloe thinks movies like Jurassic Park have made many people interested in dinosaurs. However, she believes that palaeontologists are often shown in a wrong way in films. They are either seen as strange geniuses or as silly people who cannot talk to others. She says movies do not show what palaeontologists really do.

In her job, Chloe does many things. She digs up dinosaur bones, works in labs to study fossils, and writes scientific papers. Sometimes, she talks to the public about science, especially to young people. She wants them to understand science better and get excited about it. Talking about dinosaurs can help children learn about nature and other science topics.

Chloe worked on a TV documentary called Walking with Dinosaurs. She helped make sure the dinosaurs were shown correctly. She did not have to change much because the show was accurate. The dinosaurs in this program look more real than those in movies like Jurassic Park.

Chloe believes dinosaurs are still interesting to people because they make us curious. They remind us that there is still much to discover in the world. Palaeontology allows us to learn about the past, like a journey through time."
52,"When you travel by car with your family, even if you are six years old, you know you are not at your destination yet. You keep asking, ""Are we there yet?"" But when you arrive, it is not ""there"" anymore; it is ""here."" If you think you are ""there,"" you should ask, ""Are we here yet?"" 

Parents often hear this question many times during long car trips. Kids might think they have a hard time, but they can relax in the back seat. They can watch DVDs, listen to music, or do puzzles while looking at the beautiful views outside. Meanwhile, one of the parents is in the front seat, giving out juice boxes and cookies, and making sure everything is okay.

But sometimes, things can get a little crazy. For example, my younger brother, Tim, might put his foot on my side of the seat. I don’t like that, so I put my foot on his side. Soon, we are fighting, and our parents have to tell us to stop and stay in our own seats. This helps for a while, and we can enjoy the views again.

Then, when I try to read, I feel something strange on my arm. The window is closed, but Tim is quietly blowing his breath on me. He is not touching me, so he thinks it is okay. This makes me angry, and we start fighting again. Our parents have to separate us, and the car swerves a bit.

Over the years, Dad has found ways to deal with us. When we ask, ""Are we there yet?"" he sometimes says, ""Yes, we are here. Get out of the car."" But we are still driving on the highway. Then he says, ""Maybe we are not there yet."" This makes us quiet for a while.

You can tell when you finally arrive because the adults get out of the car and move away from the kids. So remember, if your parents are still close enough to answer your question, the answer is: no, you are not there yet."
53,"John and Zuzi Morgan have opened a café in Oxford, UK. In their café, people can enjoy coffee and cake while playing board games. They hope that customers will love the experience and come back again. Zuzi says they wanted to create a place where people can connect without using their phones or screens. 

The games played in their café are called ""Eurogames."" These games have simple themes, like farming and building. The first Eurogame was called The Settlers of Catan, made by a German designer named Klaus Teuber. In this game, players build settlements on an island and trade resources with each other. Everyone stays involved and has fun until the end of the game.

There are also ""co-operative"" games where all players work together to win or lose as a team. One popular co-operative game is Pandemic, created by Matt Leacock. In Pandemic, players work together to solve global problems. Leacock was inspired by a Eurogame called Lord of the Rings, which is based on a famous book. He remembers feeling scared and excited when he played it with friends. 

Leacock loved board games as a child, but sometimes he felt disappointed when they did not work well. With help from his uncle, he tried to make better games. Pandemic became very popular and included a lot of storytelling, similar to video games. 

The rise of video games has helped board games become more popular. Many people now play games on their phones. Ben Hogg, who works for a game company, says that everyone plays games on their smartphones. 

At first, video games allowed people to play together in the same room. But then, many games moved online, and players could not see each other. Some people who liked video games wanted to play games with friends in person again. 

In John and Zuzi's busy café, board games are more than just fun. In our online world, games are a way for people to connect and share experiences together. This trend is likely to continue."
54,"Jamie Scott is a musician from the UK. He has written and produced many popular songs. His story shows that hard work and not giving up are very important in music, even if you start slowly. Jamie says his mother was a great singer and she helped him learn to play the guitar. He only listened to a local radio station for older people when he was young, so he did not hear new songs until he was 12 years old.

When he was a teenager, Jamie had to choose between playing tennis and making music. He played tennis at a high level, but he liked music more. He spent his lunch breaks in the music room at school, playing the piano. At 17, he left school to become a performer. He started a music duo with a friend who played guitar but did not want to be a performer.

Jamie told his parents that he wanted to make music. His dad said he had 18 months to succeed, or he would need to find a job. After some close calls with music companies, he got a deal with a publisher at 19 because of one song. However, the music companies wanted him to be a solo artist, so he had to leave his friend.

Jamie found success as a songwriter instead of a performer. After some hard times with a record label in the UK, he changed to another label to release a new album, but he did not become famous right away. He felt like he was often in the wrong place at the wrong time. However, as a songwriter, he felt he was in the right place.

He believes he is one of the main songwriters in the UK that new artists come to for help. Sometimes, he tells artists that it is okay to write songs that people will love. He wants to write big songs that can be very popular. Jamie is honest about wanting to create music that can be number one on the charts. He knows he has a talent for it and focuses on making great music. He wants to write songs that will be loved by many people, not just what is popular at the moment."
55,"Tony Connor is a new kind of celebrity. He is very popular online, but many people, like me, do not know him because we do not watch videos of people doing tricks on bikes. He is a ""street trials cyclist."" This means he jumps from hard places, like roofs or walls, to land safely in other strange places. People film these jumps and share them online.

I met Tony one Saturday morning at a BMX park. The local kids all know him, and some older people come to say hello and call him ""an absolute legend."" After watching him, I agree with them. At first, I was unsure about him, but I was impressed by his bravery and creativity. Before each jump, he explains what he wants to do, and sometimes I think he cannot do it. But when I tell him he did a great job, he seems not to care much about my praise.

Even though he is famous online, Tony says he does not like being a celebrity. He finds it hard to talk to fans. He prefers to do things instead of just talking about them. This is funny because his fame comes from social media and the small cameras that help make these videos. He says, ""This technology helps people like me earn money."" Sometimes he feels like everyone is filming themselves or looking at screens, and he does not like that.

Tony makes a good living from his videos, which is different from the past when this was just a hobby. After many years of talking to top athletes, I learned that two important things help a child become a great athlete: energy and the ability to handle disappointment. These qualities can be more important than talent. The riskier the sport, the more mental strength you need. 

Even in the park, Tony fell a few times on what he thought were easy obstacles. He just got up and kept trying until he could do it. Some people do not see him as a hero. They think he takes too many risks. He says, ""People who say this may care, but they do not understand. They probably have never tried riding a trials bike and do not know the sport. I get advice from experts to stay safe.""

Tony is careful about the risks he takes. He explains, ""People are different. Some are not scared, and they should not do these sports. It is smart to know the dangers. Some people cannot get over their fear, but I can. I feel scared but find a way to keep going. I am not addicted to risk. I spend a lot of time planning and getting ready. Sometimes I ride around to prepare myself before trying a new jump. I know I must stay calm before I jump. If I focus completely, I will be fine."""
56,"Television presenter Helen Skelton has done many dangerous challenges to help charity. She has run a marathon in the desert and traveled down the Amazon river in a small boat. For her latest challenge, Helen walked on a high wire. This wire was 66 meters above the ground, between two tall towers of an empty power station. There was no safety net. She only had a belt around her waist that was attached to another wire above her. To help her stay balanced and not fall, she used a long stick that weighed eight kilograms.

Helen learned from an expert high-wire walker. She already had some circus skills, but she found out that walking on a high wire was very different. “The training was a shock,” said Helen. “I didn’t know I needed to be so strong. Every day started at 8 am with a run up a steep hill. Then I did an hour of exercises, and another hour practicing on the wire. I also had to learn how to fall onto the wire so I could keep going if I slipped. Every time I fell, it hurt a lot. But I had to stay positive: if I was nervous and started shaking, the wire would shake too!”

On the day of the challenge, it was windy. Helen took deep breaths to control herself as she moved step by step on the wire. The 150-meter walk took 15 minutes. “That was the scariest thing I’ve done,” she said after. “I’m glad it’s over!” But this experience did not stop Helen from planning her next charity project: to reach the South Pole by ski, kite, and bike."
57,"In 2006, Jeff Somers started a trip around the world on a penny farthing. This is an old bicycle with one big wheel and one small wheel. Before this, he wrote a book about his travels in Canada using a 50-year-old car. He loved cars and worked on racing car engines. To save money, Jeff rode an old bicycle to work and used it to go on holiday to Amsterdam. He said, “That trip opened my eyes. I decided to see the world by bike.”

Jeff did not want a normal bike. He wanted to build a special one. He thought a penny farthing was the craziest bike he could make, so he went to a museum to learn how they were made. After trying to start his trip in 2001 and 2003 but stopping because of a knee injury, he finally began his journey in 2006. He traveled for three years and visited 23 countries on four continents. The best part of his trip was arriving in Tibet and seeing Mount Everest. 

He met other cyclists who could ride up mountains, but he was happy with his penny farthing. People were very surprised to see it as he traveled further from home. His worst moment was when he had to drink dirty water from a stream. He got very sick and stayed in a hostel for ten days without medicine. He had no money for a hospital or to go home. 

Even with these problems, Jeff now says, “If I could afford it, I would start traveling again tomorrow on my penny farthing.”"
58,"I work at a university in the US. My team and I are learning about water birds, especially the American black duck. We just started using a new tool called a ‘night-vision scope’. This tool helps us see the ducks at night! 

We are worried about black ducks because their numbers are very low. We don’t know if there is enough food for them on the east coast. We have a lot of information about what they do during the day, but we don’t know what they do at night. This is because we didn’t have the right equipment before. The new scope will give us clear pictures, even when there is no moon. This will help us learn more and take better care of their home.

Our work is hard. There are four of us, and we each work six hours a day. We have studied ducks in different places. Sometimes, I have to take a boat to see the ducks and write down what I find. The weather can be difficult. Some nights are warm, but many nights are wet. It is very quiet, so I drink a lot of coffee to stay awake! 

We have only missed one workday because the snow was too deep for our special vehicles. I like this challenge, especially when I think about summer. In summer, we will work in a laboratory and look at our results together. It will be hard to be inside, but it is important. I wouldn’t change this job for anything!"
59,"Whenever I tell people about my job, they are surprised. But I am not joking! I spend my days at work eating chocolate! Tasting chocolate is very important to make sure customers get the best chocolate from my company. Every week, I get small samples from our factory. I check them for taste, texture, and smell. I also taste the raw materials we use, like nuts and fruit. I choose the best ones to put in the chocolate.

Next to my office, I have a kitchen where I can test and taste the products I make. I also share samples with my colleagues! My kitchen has many machines and ingredients to use. It is great to have my own space during the day. No two days are the same in this job. Sometimes I work in our food lab, and other times I travel to buy raw materials. This can be hard because I have a young family. But I love the variety in my job, even more than the chocolate!

People often ask me if I get bored of chocolate. I have worked with it for a long time, and I still love to eat it. In fact, I often go home and eat more chocolate in the evening!"
60,"Have you ever thought about what it is like to perform in a circus? Sophia Grayson works at Circus Experience, a place that teaches young people circus skills. She says her course is popular because it teaches many skills. Students learn to juggle, throw and catch things like balls or even fire. They also learn trapeze, which is flying in the air above an audience.

The course lasts one year. Students slowly take more risks in each class, and parents can come to some classes to see how their children are doing. Sophia explains that circus performers need to do different things all the time. It is important to keep performances exciting. To be successful in the circus, you must practice a lot. 

Another great part of being in the circus is making friends with other performers and learning from them. Being fit is very important too. Circus artists, like athletes, train every day to stay strong. Training is important, but the best performers are those who want to succeed, have good ideas, and always want to get better.

Some people think circus performers get hurt a lot or only work for a short time each year. But the real challenge is thinking about the future. You can only travel and perform when you are young, and later you need to think about other jobs. 

The course also teaches business planning. Many past students have started their own businesses around the world and are happy to share their stories. However, Sophia warns that being in the circus is not a way to make a lot of money. “The work usually does not give you a regular salary. It is also very competitive, but it is a lot of fun!”"
61,"You may not know her name or face, but you have probably heard her many times. Mariam Hobson is a backing singer. This means she sings in the background to help the main singer. Many people think backing singers are not as good as lead singers, but that is not true. They often have to be even better! People like Mariam are very important in music.

Mariam loves her job because every time she goes to the recording studio, she does not know what she will sing. It could be classical music, jazz, hip hop, or rock. Sometimes, she even sings funny songs for radio or ads. She is often surprised by what the producers ask her to do. Once, they asked her to sing like a fish underwater! But she never complains; she just does her job.

To be a good backing singer, you need to be very good at music and learn quickly. Sometimes, there is no music sheet to read. Mariam remembers her first time recording music for a film. It was hard because there were eight singers, each singing a different part, and there was also an orchestra. She was scared because if she made a mistake, they would have to record everything again, and nobody likes that. Recording can take a long time.

One of Mariam's favorite jobs is recording for songwriters. Some new writers do not know what type of music is best for a female voice. When they hear Mariam sing their song, they can see how to make it better."
62,"Julie Deane started her business with only a little knowledge about fashion. She makes and sells ‘satchels’, which are traditional bags for schoolchildren. These bags are now sold in famous shops and many celebrities use them. 

Before she chose to make satchels, Julie thought about other business ideas, like cake decorating and party planning. She wanted to be sure about her choice. Some people told her that no one would want the bags, but Julie believed in her idea. She worked with her mother, who had never worked before but was good at business. The design of the satchels was inspired by children’s storybooks.

At first, Julie did not know much about fashion blogs, but they helped her business grow. She started by selling one satchel a week. To get more attention, she sent satchels to fashion writers and hoped they would write about them. They did, and more people became interested in her bags. Now, Julie enjoys seeing which celebrity is seen with a satchel!

While other companies spend money on online ads, Julie uses the internet to get ideas for new styles. There was a tough time when another company copied her design, so now she makes sure she trusts her production team as much as her own staff. People who visit her office say it feels positive and happy. There is a new factory, but it is the team that makes the place special."
63,"When Vicky Harmiston was a child, her parents let her and her brother Jamie choose what to do in their free time. Vicky liked to play many sports. She was a good swimmer, and her coach thought she could be a champion. But the swimming club was far from her home, so it was hard for her to train and do her schoolwork.

When they were teenagers, Jamie loved cycling. He bought a special racing bike and started to compete. Vicky thought it looked fun and wanted to try it too. She says it was the best choice she ever made. Soon, she was cycling every day and doing very well. The track was close to her school, so it was easy for her to go to training after school.

Vicky became a successful track cyclist and won many competitions. When she was 28, she stopped competing. Vicky said, “I loved winning for many years, but I started to feel tired of it. When the fun stops, there is no reason to continue. Luckily, I found a new job.”

Vicky got a job with a charity called CycleZone. She said, “We help young people who have never liked sports. The first thing we do is teach them to ride a bike. We want them to believe in themselves and what they can do. CycleZone is great because it brings young people together.”

The charity uses famous people to help promote their work. Vicky said, “Some people think having a celebrity help is not always good for a charity. They say celebrities do it for their own fame, and this can hide the real work of the charity. But if famous singers and actors can help, I think they should.”"
64,"Ana Ronson is a singer-songwriter from Ireland. Her parents did not play music, but there was always music in her home. Her grandfather played the guitar and taught Ana and her brother how to play.

The first time Ana sang in front of people was at school. She was very nervous, and her teacher had to help her off the stage. The teacher suggested that Ana join the school theatre club to help her feel more confident. After some time in the club, Ana sang happily with 50 other students at a concert.

A year later, her brother, who was in a band, asked her to write a song for them. Ana wrote her first song called ""Falling Stars"" in just three days. She enjoyed writing so much that she took a songwriting course with a professional. Even though she was the youngest student, she knew a lot about music. But Ana felt the teacher did not listen to her, so she wrote a song called ""Something to Say"" about her feelings. She shared this song online, and many people loved it.

Joss Alton, who owns a music company called Isotope Music, flew from far away to ask Ana to join his company. At first, Ana was unsure because she did not know much about Isotope and did not want anyone to tell her what to sing. But Joss convinced her that this would not happen. Soon after, Ana performed at a concert in Dublin organized by Isotope. The tickets sold out quickly, and it was a wonderful night.

Ana prefers to write songs about difficult times in life rather than happy times. One of her favorite songs is ""Decision,"" which is about why her brother stopped singing for a while and how sad it made him. Ana hopes her fans will like her songs, but she wants to write about her own important experiences."
65,"Last year, I went on a great trip. I traveled by boat on a guided tour along the west coast of Canada. It was my brother Harry’s idea. He is a journalist, like me, and he wanted to write stories about the trip. He loves boats, but I do not share that interest. I had always wanted to visit this area because I saw it on TV when I was a child. I knew it was where our great-grandparents lived before they moved to Europe. So, I kept asking Harry if I could go with him, and he finally said yes!

A few days before we left, there were storms where we were going. But the weather was supposed to be nice when we arrived. I was busy with work and did not have much time to prepare. But Harry said he would take care of everything, so I felt better.

When we got to Canada, we joined the group, packed our things into small boats, and started our journey. The guide told us that very few people live along that coast. On the first morning, we only saw dolphins and birds. We could see islands in the distance, but the fog made it hard to see far. I enjoyed watching the beautiful patterns our boat made in the water.

We often stopped to explore the rock pools on the beaches. They were full of colorful fish, many of which I did not know. I loved not worrying about time. We always remembered to make lunch and dinner together over campfires. At night, we slept on the boats. The beds were hard, but it felt nice to be free from stress.

When it was time to go home, I felt sad. I did not want to return to normal life. But I knew I would miss my family and friends. I was also excited to tell everyone at home about our adventures!"
66,"My dad was a professional basketball player in Germany, just like his dad before him. When I was a kid, I went to many of his games. You might think I would love basketball, but I didn’t. I liked to tell my friends how good my dad was, especially when he won, but I often read a book instead of watching the games.

When I started secondary school, I was still two years away from being a teenager, but I was already two meters tall. My sports teacher saw my height and asked if I wanted to train with the basketball team. I enjoyed the training, but I thought I needed to get better before playing in a real game. The teacher believed in me more than I believed in myself. After some time, I agreed to play, and a few weeks later, I played against another school. My parents came to watch, which made me nervous, but it was okay in the end!

For the next four years, I practiced every day and did very well. I even joined an adult team before I moved to a special sports academy in the USA when I was fifteen. The coach there trains Olympic basketball players, and it was amazing to work with him. However, I didn’t enjoy living far from my parents at first. At home, I couldn’t spend much time with my friends because of all the training, so that part was not new for me. I got used to my new life, and my English got better quickly!

I became a professional player at eighteen, three years after arriving in the USA. I was taller than most players in the league since I was fifteen, but I needed to gain weight to play better. My coach knew a team that would take me while I was still in college, so I joined them and have never regretted it."
67,"Seven years ago, I was studying Tourism at college. I needed a part-time job because my course was expensive. I decided to train as a weekend tour guide in my home city, Chicago, USA. I took visitors around the city, and I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. I saw my city in a new way every time!

After I finished my studies, I wanted to be a tour guide full-time. I thought it would be easy, but I learned that I needed to know a lot more. To get a licence as a full-time tour guide, I had to answer many questions about Chicago, like its buildings, history, and public transport rules. After a few months of hard work, I got my tour guide qualification and became an independent tour guide.

Being a tour guide is not just about knowing facts. You also need to be entertaining and tell interesting stories. It is important to handle unexpected situations, like if a place is closed when you arrive. Tourists want to enjoy their tour, not hear about problems. I want my visitors to be happy, so they will leave good reviews online. Good reviews help me get more customers.

I try to make my tours fun and easy for everyone. Because I love my job and put a lot of energy into it, I usually get very good reviews. Many visitors recommend my tours to others coming to Chicago."
68,"My name is Ella, and I am 22 years old. Last year, I went to Thailand for two weeks with my sister, Josie. She is five years younger than me, but we get along well. We went to help at an elephant sanctuary. This is a place where people take care of sick and rescued elephants. At first, I was not sure if we would fit in with the other volunteers because they were older than us. We were also nervous because it was our first time doing this kind of work. But in the end, we had nothing to worry about.

One of our main jobs was to collect food for the elephants. Elephants eat a lot of grass and banana plants, so this took most of the day. Josie found it hard work, but I thought it was worth it to see the elephants enjoy their food. We also helped wash the elephants in the river with big brushes and soap. I had a lot of fun, even though I got wetter than the elephants!

The part of the day I liked the most was the evening. By the light of the moon, we walked the elephants into the forest where they slept at night. All the volunteers stayed in the same house. Josie and I shared a small bedroom because she did not want to be alone. It was hot and humid at night, but we expected that. The meals were delicious and did not have meat, which we do not like.

After dinner, all the volunteers and staff talked and played games together. Now that we are back in the UK, Josie does not often talk about Thailand. But if someone asks her if she liked her time at the sanctuary, she says she loved it. I think she might be a little upset with herself because she missed her friends too much and did not enjoy it fully. But when she thinks back, she can see how lucky she was to go there. Maybe she will go back one day – I know I will!"
69,"My name is Gina D’Costa, and I have a flower shop in the UK. We sell flowers to many different customers. Hotels and offices often buy flowers for their reception areas. Sometimes, we provide flowers for businesses to use in their advertising photos. Once, I even decorated a castle with flowers for a wedding. It was a lot of work, but I was very proud of it.

My day starts at 4 a.m. I go to the market to buy fresh flowers. Most people are still sleeping, and my friends think I am crazy, but I love my job. It is often cold and dark at that time, but I don’t let it bother me. The flower market is amazing, with flowers from all over the world. The sights and smells make it hard to choose. If I were buying for myself, I would choose only pink flowers because they are my favorite. But I have to remember that what I like is not always what my customers want. 

Not all flowers are available all year, so I cannot always find what customers want. I don’t like arguing about prices with the flower sellers, but I have to do it. Flowers can be expensive, so I try to get the best price.

When I am back at the shop, we look at customer orders and prepare vases with the flowers I bought. Then, we make flower bunches and calculate the costs. Customers are often surprised by the prices, and I sometimes ask them to think again about what they want. Some people might think this is too much trouble, but I enjoy finding the best flowers for the money someone wants to spend. I love my job and wouldn’t want to do anything else!"
70,"My city has a modern cinema that shows the latest films and many kids' films on weekends. It is close to my home, but a year ago, I felt something was missing. I wanted to talk about films with other people after watching them. So, I started a film club with two friends!

We decided not to rent a cinema. Instead, we choose a different place in the city each month. For example, we used an old factory to show a film set in Antarctica. It was very cold, which made it a great place for the film. Some places we use are free because the owners sell snacks during the film. This helps us keep our prices low. We just want to cover our costs, not make money.

Each time we show a film, it gets easier for us, especially now that we have our own equipment. We can see how many tickets we sell online, so we don’t worry about empty seats. There is still a lot to do, but when people of all ages tell us they had a great time, it makes us happy.

Our website helps us a lot, and we are now in touch with other film clubs in the country. We have visited them to see how they do things, but we always like coming back to our own club! We also started a blog because many people look for film information online instead of reading local papers. We have put up some posters in cafés, but the best way to get new people is when others tell their friends about us. The audience loves the fun activities we have with each film. Last month, we had a movie quiz that everyone enjoyed!"
71,"Taking photographs was my favorite thing to do when I was a child. When I was 15, I wanted to make my hobby better. So, I decided to start a special project: I would take one photo every day for a whole year. Many other young photographers had done this before, but I thought it was a great idea, so I began.

After a few weeks, I put my photos on a website for young photographers. I wanted to create a photo diary and show my photos to others. I was surprised to find that people liked my photos. I enjoyed taking pictures of many different things. Then, someone suggested that I should focus on one topic for my photos. I agreed and decided to take more pictures of nature, especially birds and the sky.

Most of my photos were black and white, which was different from what many other young photographers were doing. They were taking color photos. Sometimes, I doubted my project and almost gave up. But in the end, I trusted myself and became more confident in my style.

One day, I showed my project to my art teacher. She told me about a photography competition for young people. I entered some of my photos just for fun. I will never forget when the judges told me I won first prize. I was so happy because my project meant a lot to me. It was the first time I realized that my photography was good, and I could be a professional photographer.

Now, I have my own photography studio, and I have never regretted my choice to be a photographer."
72,"I joined the National Youth Challenge (NYC) last year. I wanted to try camping and sailing, and learn skills like public speaking. These were new things for me. In the NYC, you can do many activities to challenge yourself and learn. There are different levels, from beginner to advanced, and adult volunteers called ‘leaders’ help us. When you finish each level, you get a certificate.

When I first joined, my leader said I should help organize activities at a local children’s club for two hours a week. I was not sure about this because I had joined that club when I was eight. I found it hard to make friends because I was shy, and the other kids already had friends. I stopped going after a few weeks. But I decided to take the challenge because I wanted my first NYC certificate.

Soon, I wanted to spend all my free time at the children’s club. It became more important to me than just getting the certificate. When I finished the challenge, the NYC leader let me keep volunteering at the club because I made good friends with the children. Now, I go there for about four hours a week, and I always look forward to it.

Because of what I learned at the children’s club, I want to go to college after school to become a youth worker. A youth worker is someone who helps children. I never thought about this job before I started at the club. This has been my favorite part of the NYC, and I have improved my communication skills while helping others. I have several NYC certificates now, and one of them is for camping!"
73,"I was born in Denver, USA. I started snowboarding when I was eight years old. My dad took me to a place in the mountains, about two hours from Denver. The hill looked very steep, and my dad had to convince me to try snowboarding. I was too young to ask him if I could start, but he loved snowboarding and wanted me to enjoy it too. He made it look easy, and in the end, I did well. Soon, I loved the sport and got better at it. I began competing when I was ten years old. Some people compete a lot and get bored, but I still love to compete and win. This helps me work harder.

I like not having a strict plan. Sometimes this works out well, like when I became the first girl to get a perfect score of 100 in a local competition. I was not sure I could do the jumps that got me this score until I tried. This made me trust my skills more. In the summer, I train and study because there is no snow. I train every day, but I don’t have to follow a strict diet like in winter. I also spend a lot of time with my friends. This helps me feel better when I can’t do what I love.

I think about my future. Snowboarding is a big part of my life, but I want to have another job too, just in case I don’t become a professional snowboarder or if I get hurt. I am thinking about becoming a doctor if I can find time to go to college. I can’t imagine getting tired of snowboarding, but I know I can’t do it forever."
74,"When I was fifteen, I wanted everything my friends had. I did not think about the future. For example, I did not know what I wanted to do after school. One day, my best friend got a new phone for her birthday. I wanted a new phone too. My parents said I could only have one if I paid for it myself. So, I decided to work part-time and save money. I am thankful to my parents for this because it taught me an important lesson.

I worked every Saturday in a café, but I did not enjoy it much. My parents suggested I start my own small business. I had seen my mum making necklaces, so I asked if I could try it too. I thought it would be hard, but it was easier than I expected. My friends thought it was boring, but I liked the idea. My mum showed me how to make pretty things at home with simple tools.

I sold my first jewellery to my friends and family. They said they liked it, but I was not sure if it was good enough for other people. To find out, I rented a market stall with my mum. There are many tourists where I live, and they bought a lot of my jewellery to take home. Soon, people from all over the country called us to buy more. They thought we were a big company, but it was just me and my mum at the stall!

That made me believe my business could work, so I decided to create a website. Since then, I have made a lot of money from my business, mostly online, but we still have our stall. It has been a lot of fun!"
75,"When Janine Stuart was 13 years old, she wrote a book called Being Amelia. This book became very popular. Being Amelia is partly about Janine’s own life. In an interview, Janine said, “Because my father’s job made us move a lot, I learned to make new friends. I know what it is like to be the new student in a class. This helped me write about Amelia, the main character, who starts at a new school. Some funny parts of the book are about Amelia’s home life, especially with her older brother. I am an only child, so I had to use my imagination to write about that.”

Janine started writing her book one summer when she was bored at home. Her mother wanted to be a writer, and her teachers encouraged her to write too. So, writing seemed like a good way to spend her time. The year before, she won a short story competition on a website for young writers. This is why, when Janine finished Being Amelia and sent it to a publishing company, they were excited to read it. They loved the book, and a year later, it was in stores.

One review of Being Amelia says that even though the cover shows happy teenagers, the characters face some hard problems. This makes the story believable. The reviewer thinks that even though Janine is young and her book is not very long, she is a better writer than many famous authors.

Janine is still getting used to being a famous writer. She said, “At first, I hid when people saw me in the street, but now it’s fine. I want to help other young writers, but they need to find their own way. For me, I just need to spend time with my friends, and then I will have something interesting to write about!”"
76,"I’m Tom, and I’m fifteen years old. Three years ago, my family and I moved to a castle on a small island. My father got a job as the manager of the castle. He works for a group that takes care of old buildings and keeps them open for visitors. He was happy to get this job, but it took some time for the rest of us to agree. We were worried about living on the island because we thought the castle might not be as nice as our home, and there was no school there.

After we moved, we got used to life on the island. The castle is not very beautiful, but our apartment is comfortable. In summer, the island is friendly and has many visitors, and there are often beach parties. In winter, we only see the other families who live on the island, and there are not many teenagers. The adults help each other with work on the island, which can be hard.

The biggest change for me was taking a boat to my old school every day. I was excited to go on stormy days when there are big waves, but the ferries do not run then! I also learned that if I miss the bus to the harbor after school, I miss the last ferry home, which is scary. So when my friends come to visit, I always tell them to hurry!

We often see beautiful views, especially when the sun sets over the sea. Some days it is very foggy, and you can’t see anything, but then it can be sunny again in a few hours. This still surprises me, even after living here for a long time. We do have bad storms, and I sometimes wonder if the castle is strong enough. But I remember it has been here for many years, and it is still standing!"
77,"I live in a house in the beautiful countryside of Scotland. I love nature and wild animals. Six years ago, I started a new hobby – birdwatching! I went to the mountains in northern Scotland with my family. We saw many birds in their natural homes. I spent hours watching them with my parents. They taught me how to tell different types of birds apart and where to find them. It was amazing! After that, I joined a local birdwatchers’ club for young people.

My goal is to see 200 different types of birds. I am almost there! When we go on family holidays, I look for birds from other countries too. We always find places with birdwatching activities so I can see new birds. I have been to Egypt, and last summer we went to South America. I thought I would see my 200th bird there, but it didn’t happen. I learned that you need to be patient with birdwatching.

I made a video about my birdwatching challenge and many teenagers liked it. They said it looked like a fun hobby. My teachers saw the video and asked me to talk about birdwatching at school. I was nervous before I went on stage because all my friends and the whole school were watching me! I felt better when it was over. The teachers said I did a good job and they enjoyed it. I might do another presentation next year!

I am lucky to live in the countryside. I understand why many teenagers in cities might not think about birdwatching, but there are many birds to see in green areas. I think birdwatching clubs should try to get more young people interested in this hobby. Everyone should connect with nature, no matter how old they are, and it doesn’t have to cost a lot of money."
78,"I started playing football when I was 7 years old. I would hurry home from school to play with other kids. I loved it, and soon I became a good player. My family thought I would stop playing like I did with other hobbies, but I didn’t. I dreamed of playing football professionally when I grew up. 

One day, I played in a local tournament. A referee saw me and told the manager of a women’s club to watch me. The manager asked me to join her club. I was surprised because I didn’t know young girls could play in women’s clubs. But the manager liked me, and I started training with a big club when I was 13 years old. I got much better at football.

Some people still doubted I would be a star player, which made me a little sad. But my coach told me to believe in myself. He even let me play in an important match earlier than I thought I would! I ran very hard because I didn’t want to let my team down. Then, by chance, I scored the winning goal! I could hear my coach cheering for me, and after the match, my team carried me around the field. It was amazing! Since then, I have scored many more winning goals.

Next month, my coach and I are organizing a football tournament in my area. We want to get teenagers interested in football and help them meet other players in my club. They will see what it is like to play professionally and feel they can also play for a top team if they work hard. I will tell them what my coach told me – there will be good times and bad times. I have been lucky and had very few bad times!"
79,"Text: 

In the UK and around the world, schools and universities are encouraging new students to start doing research early in their studies. Research is not just for famous scholars or scientists. It is a way for everyone to learn and build skills. Research skills are important for your studies and for jobs because they help you think about the world and do your work better.

As a student, you can help create knowledge. You do not just repeat what you learn; you ask questions. You might wonder: Why? How? When? What does this mean? What if things were different? These questions are part of research. 

Research can be very complex, but it can also be simple. It starts with asking questions about everyday things. Most students have done some research before. You have probably asked questions for school projects or at work. You might have researched where to go on holiday, how to grow plants, or how to fix things at home. 

In college and university, you are expected to ask questions, think critically, and explore information. Some students find this hard because in some cultures, knowledge is seen as fixed. They think they should just listen to teachers and books. However, in many places like the UK, US, and Europe, it is important to question what you learn and who teaches it.

This can be challenging, but critical thinking is very important in research. You should not just repeat what you read. Instead, think about it, test it, and see if it makes sense. Do not just accept everything as true. Always question the facts and information you receive."
80,"Cities have always been important places for ideas and creativity. In the past, people met in coffee houses in London to talk about science and politics. In modern Paris, artist Pablo Picasso discussed art in cafés. However, living in a city can be difficult. The same cafés that inspired people also helped spread diseases like cholera. Picasso eventually moved to the countryside.

Today, scientists are studying how city life affects our brains. They found that living in a city can make us feel tired and can even make it harder to think clearly. One big reason for this is that cities lack nature. Research shows that hospital patients get better faster when they can see trees from their windows. Even a little bit of nature can help our brains relax and work better.

More people now live in cities than in the countryside. This means we are often surrounded by many strangers in busy places. Living in such crowded areas can affect our mental and physical health. For example, when we walk down a busy street, our brains have to pay attention to many things, like other people and traffic. This can be exhausting because our brains have to work hard to focus.

Natural places are easier for our brains. They help us relax and recharge. This idea is called attention restoration theory, created by psychologist Stephen Kaplan. He believed that being in nature helps our brains recover because nature captures our attention without causing stress.

Before scientists studied this, philosophers and landscape designers warned about the problems of city life and wanted to bring nature into cities. Parks, like Central Park in New York, give people a break from city life. Spending time in a park can help our brains feel better quickly. 

Even though people try many ways to improve their thinking, like energy drinks or changing office designs, walking in nature is often the best solution. Despite the mental challenges of city life, cities continue to grow. Research shows that crowded cities can also be places of creativity. The many social interactions in cities can lead to new ideas and innovations.

So, the challenge is to find ways to reduce the stress of city living while keeping the benefits of being in a city. After all, there are times when people feel tired of nature and want to be in the city again!"
81,"**Where Should We Look for the Mind?**

This question might seem strange. We usually think that thinking happens inside our heads. Today, we have advanced machines that can show us this. But I believe we should not only look inside our heads to study the mind. There is a lot of evidence from history that shows objects also help us think. 

For example, tools, jewelry, drawings, and writing have all played important roles in how humans have developed and how we think. So, what is outside our heads might also be part of our minds. 

Many scientists focus on the brain when studying the mind. They often separate people from the things around them to study them better. This is useful for scientists, but it can make us forget that we think with the help of things around us. 

I do not want to say that the brain is not important. Instead, I want to explore the idea that our intelligence connects with the culture and objects around us. This is what my new idea, called Material Engagement Theory (MET), is about. 

MET looks at how objects can help us think. For example, when we make numbers from clay or use a stone to create a tool, these actions show how objects are part of our thinking. MET also studies how this has changed over time and what it means for our thoughts. 

Think about a blind person using a stick. The stick helps the person feel and understand the world. The brain sees the stick as part of the body. This shows that our minds can change and grow when we use new tools. 

My idea sees the mind as something that is always changing. The tools we use, from ancient stone tools to modern smartphones, help us understand and interact with the world. This is why humans create things more than any other species. 

I call this ability to change and grow with objects ""metaplasticity."" Our minds are flexible and develop as we use the things around us. I want to show that objects are important for understanding how we think. MET helps us see how different tools and technologies have shaped who we are and how we think. 

People often think of technology as something new, but humans have been using tools to change their minds since the beginning of time."
82,"Text: ""Photography is one of the most important inventions that changed how we see the world. In the United States, photography became a big part of culture. It is used in many ways, like science, industry, and art, and it also brings fun and entertainment. Historians say photography is one of the greatest contributions of the US to visual arts. 

Photography became popular in the mid-19th century. People liked it because it used machines, which matched their interest in new technology. Just like trains and electricity made travel easier, photography brought images of the world into homes quickly. The camera helped people show who they were and share their lives with others. It also helped families keep memories, even if those memories were not always real.

A photograph shows what the photographer wants us to see. It is different from a drawing because it is a record of real events, people, or things. However, every photograph also shows the photographer's point of view. We might think we understand a photo because we know what it shows, but the meaning can be more complicated. 

To understand a photograph, we need to know why it was taken and how people first saw it. The same photo can mean different things in different places and times. 

For a long time, the importance of the camera in art was not well known. But now, many artists use photographs in their work. For example, Andy Warhol used photographs in his paintings. Today, photography is seen as an important part of art, not separate from painting, but a key part of how we represent things before cameras were invented."""
83,"In 1890, William James, an American philosopher and doctor, defined psychology as the ""science of mental life."" This definition helps us understand psychology even today. Everyone has a mental life, which means we have thoughts and feelings. We can study this in humans, rats, and monkeys, but it can be hard to understand completely.

William James was especially interested in human psychology. He believed it includes basic parts: our thoughts, feelings, the physical world around us, and how we know about these things. Our knowledge is personal and comes from our own experiences. Sometimes, this knowledge is different from scientific facts. Because of this, we often make judgments about psychological issues based on our own experiences. We act like amateur psychologists when we share our opinions about why people behave in certain ways, like feeling insulted or unhappy.

Problems can happen when two people understand things differently. Formal psychology tries to find methods to decide which explanations are correct in different situations. Psychologists help us tell the difference between our personal thoughts, which can be biased, and scientific facts. Psychology is about the mind and brain, but psychologists do not know everything about how the brain works. They study behavior to learn more about our thoughts and feelings.

Studying psychology is like solving a crossword puzzle. It requires careful observation and analysis. Psychologists want to describe, understand, predict, and learn how to change the processes they study. When they achieve these goals, they can help us understand our experiences and improve people's lives. For example, psychology has helped in teaching children to read better, designing safer machines, and helping people express their feelings when they are upset.

Although people have talked about psychological questions for a long time, scientific study of psychology has only happened in the last 150 years. Early psychologists used introspection, which means looking at one's own thoughts and feelings, to find answers. While this is still interesting, it has limitations. William James said that trying to understand the mind this way is like trying to see in the dark. Today, psychologists prefer to base their theories on careful observations of others' behavior instead of just their own experiences."
84,"In a storehouse in a business park in Michigan, USA, there is a special place called the Museum of Failed Products. This museum shows products that people did not want to buy. Some examples are A Touch of Yogurt shampoo and Breakfast Cola. The museum is owned by a company called GfK. Carol Sherry, who runs the museum, believes that each product has a sad story about the people who tried to sell it.

It is surprising that this museum exists as a business. Many companies do not keep samples of their failed products. Robert McMath, who started the museum, wanted to collect new products, not just the ones that failed. He began this in the 1960s. He learned that most products do not succeed. Because he collected many new items, most of them ended up being unsuccessful.

Today, many products in the museum were once thought to be good ideas. People in meetings did not see that these products would fail. Sometimes, marketers put more money into a bad product to try to sell it, instead of figuring out what went wrong. This idea of always being positive is also common in self-help advice. One popular idea is ""positive visualization,"" which means if you think good things will happen, they will.

However, research by psychologist Gabriele Oettingen shows that thinking too much about how well things could go can actually make people less motivated to reach their goals. For example, people who imagined having a great week at work ended up doing less.

Psychologist Carol Dweck talks about how our beliefs about ability affect how we feel about failure. Some people think ability is something you are born with, while others believe it can grow with effort and challenges. People who think ability is fixed feel very bad about failing. For example, a sports star who thinks he is a natural talent may not practice enough and then fail. On the other hand, people who believe ability can grow see failure as a chance to learn and improve. Dweck compares this to weight training, where muscles get stronger by being pushed to their limits. Having a growth mindset can make people happier, whether or not they succeed."
85,"Text: 

Everyone knows that sports teams usually do better when they play at home. But why is this? Many people think they know the answer, but things in professional sports are changing quickly. Two main reasons make us question the idea of home advantage: science and money. 

Sports scientists want to understand what helps players do their best. They have many ideas about home advantage. At the same time, people who invest money in sports want to know why home advantage is important. They think that if players are paid enough, they should feel good playing anywhere.

What about the fans? Would it matter if a team like Manchester United played some games far away, in places like the Far East, to reach more fans? It would matter to British fans who believe their team needs their support and energy. Fans often think that if they cheer loudly, their team will score. They remember the times when they cheered and a goal was scored, but they forget the times when their cheering did not help.

One thing that fans believe is supported by science. Home fans not only cheer for their team but also shout at the referee. In a study, referees watched a game with crowd noise and another game without noise. The referees who heard the crowd were less likely to call fouls against the home team. This means that referees try to avoid making calls that would upset the home crowd.

Recent studies show that home advantage has become less important in many sports, but not as much as we might think. For example, in the early days of the Football League in England, home teams won about 70% of the time. Today, they win about 60% of the time. One reason for this change is travel. Now, players travel in comfort, and if their hotel is not good, the team will find them a better one. 

Also, stadiums today look very similar and are very efficient. However, these changes happened only in the last few years. The mystery remains: why does home advantage change from sport to sport? Basketball has the most home advantage, followed by football. Baseball has the least home advantage. This might be because baseball is more about individual players, while team sports like basketball depend on teamwork. 

In basketball, players feel more confident when they play at home, which helps them work better together. There is also another interesting finding. Researchers found that players have higher testosterone levels before home games. This might be because they want to protect their home ground. 

In some recent games, underdog teams won at home against stronger teams. They showed great determination and did not let the other team intimidate them. As one referee said, ""It’s the law of the jungle out there."""
86,"Text: ""Gary Player, a famous golfer, once said, 'The more I practice, the luckier I get.' This saying is popular among many athletes and their coaches. It means that practicing helps you get better at something. 

There is a big question about whether talent is something you are born with or something you can learn. Many people believe that practice is more important than natural talent. Psychologist Anders Ericsson said that to become an expert in anything, you need to practice for 10,000 hours. This idea is in many books, like Malcolm Gladwell’s Outliers, which say that practice is the key to success.

However, author Epstein thinks this idea is not always true. He points out that many studies focus only on very successful people. He asks if there are other reasons why some people are good at things and others are not. He travels around the world to find answers, from Kenya to Sweden and even to Alaska. In Alaska, he learns that the drive of sled dogs might come from their genes, not just their training.

Epstein talks about two important ideas: 'hardware' (which is nature, like genes) and 'software' (which is nurture, like training and environment). He believes both are important for top athletes. For example, if Usain Bolt had grown up in the US, he might have been a good basketball player instead of the fastest runner in the world.

Epstein also discusses race and gender in sports. He asks why we have separate competitions for men and women if practice is the only thing that matters. Sometimes, the best questions are the simplest ones."""
87,"A recent report says that many children in rich countries feel lonely and unhappy. Jay Griffiths asks why children today are not happy. In her new book, Kith, she explains that many children stay inside too much. They spend a lot of time in front of screens, like TVs and computers, and they do not play outside in nature anymore. Griffiths believes this is a big problem.

A follow-up study talked to some children to understand their feelings better. Many of them said they would be happier if they could go outside more. Older people often remember their childhoods fondly. They talk about how they played outside, explored, and had fun in nature. They think this was better than how children live today. However, they forget that they are the ones who keep their children safe and do not let them play outside as much.

Griffiths discusses how parents worry about dangers outside. This worry makes them keep their children at home, which helps toy and gadget companies sell more products to keep kids entertained. She also talks about how some children are given medicine for being restless or how they have to wear goggles to play games. 

Griffiths is passionate about children’s freedom to play and explore. However, some of her ideas go too far. She sometimes compares how we treat children today to racism, which seems extreme. She believes children should be allowed to explore and take risks. She says that children need to have small accidents to learn how to be safe later. But she does not explain how to let children have these small accidents safely.

Not all children want to play outside or take risks. Some children are shy or prefer to stay at home. Maybe the real problem is that we try to make all children act the same way, whether we keep them inside or push them outside."
88,"I am a bio-psychologist and I have studied a lot. I am good at solving problems in my work and life, but this is not just because of my education. Many problems in life cannot be solved with formulas or answers we learn in school. They need judgment, wisdom, and creativity that come from life experiences. For children, these experiences happen during play.

My recent research is about how important play is for children’s growth. All young animals, including humans, play. Animals that need to learn more play the most. For example, meat-eating animals play more than plant-eating animals because hunting is harder to learn than eating grass. Primates, like monkeys, play more than other animals because they need to learn more.

Children play a lot because they have much to learn. Play helps children learn important skills that they cannot learn in school. These skills include thinking creatively, getting along with others, and controlling their feelings. Creativity is very important for success in life. We need people who can ask new questions and solve new problems, not just follow instructions.

Great thinkers, like Albert Einstein, often keep their playful minds as adults. Einstein said that school almost made him lose interest in math and science, but he found it again after school. He called his creative work “combinatorial play.” He imagined chasing a sunbeam and thought about what would happen.

We cannot teach creativity, but school can sometimes take it away. School often focuses on answers that are already known, instead of letting children ask their own questions. It is also very important for children to learn how to get along with others and care for them. Children naturally want to play with each other, and through play, they learn social skills and fairness.

Play is voluntary, which means children can stop playing whenever they want. If they cannot stop, it is not really play. Players know they must keep each other happy to keep the game going. Play is a very free activity.

However, school has become harder. There are fewer breaks, more homework, and more pressure for good grades. Outside of school, organized sports have taken the place of free play. Adults now often supervise playdates instead of letting children play freely in their neighborhoods. This has changed slowly over time, but it has been a big change. Parents worry more, and experts warn about dangers. Many believe children learn better from adults than from each other.

Our children do not need more school. They need more play. If we care about our children and the future, we must change this trend. We need to let children play and explore so they can grow into strong adults ready for the future."
89,"In many countries, more young people in their twenties are using social media to find jobs. Websites like Twitter and LinkedIn help them connect directly with employers. This is easier than before when people had to stand outside offices with signs saying ""hire me."" But using social media can also lead to mistakes.

For example, a young man in the US tried to contact a senior marketing executive on LinkedIn. He thought she could help him because she knew many important people. However, she was upset that he asked her to share her contacts. She rejected his request and sent a rude message that many people saw online. This made others think about how to use social media for work. 

Social media can be risky for job seekers who do not know how to use it properly. Many young people have used sites like Facebook and Twitter for fun, but using them for work is different. When I was a teenager, social media was a way to escape from parents and teachers. It was a place to show off and be creative. You could talk to someone online for hours and then ignore them at school. You could also change how you looked online with pictures and songs.

However, using social media for work is not the same. Some young people still act like they did when they were teenagers. Just because many people liked your posts on Facebook does not mean you will impress employers on LinkedIn. We need to understand that the rules have changed, and we must meet employers' expectations to get jobs.

One common complaint from employers is that young job seekers are too casual and seem arrogant. This makes older people think badly of our generation. In reality, many young people are struggling to find jobs, which is why they use social media. This impression of arrogance can hurt their chances, even if they have the skills to do well at work.

So, how should you contact someone on a professional site? First, clearly say who you are and explain how you can help them. This way, you have a better chance of getting a good response. Avoid sending the same message to many people, and keep your tone polite. Remember, social media can help you make important connections, but you need to use it carefully to avoid problems."

It is hard to say what will happen to newspapers in the future. Many people think newspapers are in trouble. Since 2000, the number of people reading UK national newspapers has dropped a lot, by about one-third to one-half. In the USA, a study shows that only 26% of people get their news from newspapers now, down from 45% in 2001. Some people believe that printed newspapers will disappear in 15 years. 

However, history shows that old forms of media often survive. For example, in 1835, a journalist said that books and theaters would not be popular anymore, but theaters are still here today. Radio is still popular even with television. Movies are still enjoyed, even with videos and DVDs. Even vinyl records are coming back, with online sales increasing a lot since 2008. 

Newspapers were once a new form of media too. It took a long time for them to become the main way people got news. This happened because it became easier to share news with many people thanks to new technology in the 19th century. People also started to think that the world is always changing and they wanted to know what was happening. In the past, people only noticed changes with the seasons or big events like floods or diseases. 

Before the 19th century, journalism was not a job that many people could do for a living. Most people did not feel they needed news every day or week. Newspapers have a regular schedule, which can be a problem. Now, with the internet, people can read news whenever they want. They can also choose what news is important to them. Online news can be updated quickly, and mistakes can be fixed right away. 

However, many news providers focus on being the first to share news instead of helping people understand it. In the past, news was shared in busy places like markets or taverns, where truth and rumors mixed together. Today, it seems like we are going back to that way of sharing news. Newspapers have not always done a good job of explaining how the world works. They might disappear, or they might find a way to help us understand better in this confusing world."

Humans are used to living in the light of the sun. We are not like many animals that are active at night. These animals feel comfortable in the dark. But we have changed the night by adding a lot of artificial light. This is called light pollution. 

Light pollution happens because of bad lighting design. Instead of shining light down where we need it, lights often shine up into the sky. This bright light changes the darkness of night. Many animals, including us, have adapted to the natural light and dark cycles. When we add too much light, it can affect their lives. For example, it can change how they migrate, reproduce, and find food.

A long time ago, in the year 1800, people in London used candles and lanterns. There were not many lights in the streets. If you walked towards London at night, you would smell the city before you saw its dim light. 

Now, we have bright lights everywhere, but many animals are still active at night. Some birds are attracted to bright lights and can get lost or hurt. They may fly around lights until they fall. Other birds sing at strange times because of artificial light.

Light pollution was thought to only bother astronomers who study stars. But all living things need darkness. Without it, our bodies do not work well. Our sleep and wake cycles are important for our health. Changing these cycles can cause problems for us.

In the end, light pollution affects us just like it affects animals. We have lost our connection to nature and the night sky. We forget how small we are in the universe when we cannot see the stars and the Milky Way above us."
92,"A founder of a big company said that his business will not keep track of how much holiday time employees take. He got this idea from another internet company that has a similar rule. The founder said he was inspired by a happy email from his daughter. 

This new rule might not work well for a big company. The internet company has 2,000 workers and does one job, but the big company has 50,000 workers and does many different jobs like finance, transport, and healthcare. The idea of taking as much time off as you want might be better for a smaller company where workers know each other’s jobs well. 

The founder said employees can take as much leave as they want, but they must be sure that their work is done and that their absence will not hurt the business or their careers. But is it really possible to be so sure? When you come back from holiday, there is always a lot of work waiting for you. 

If workers feel guilty about taking time off, they might not take any leave at all. This can lead to stress and lower productivity. There can also be pressure from coworkers about who is taking time off and for how long. In many companies, workers feel they must work late, which can make them feel they cannot take holidays, especially if they want to get promoted. 

Without the legal right to take holidays, workers might feel they cannot take time off because they do not want to seem lazy. This could make them feel stuck and not able to take their holidays. 

Modern technology makes it hard to separate work time from free time. The internet company started their unlimited leave policy because employees wanted to know how to balance work and time off. But if there are no set working hours, workers might feel they are always being watched by their employer. 

Employment laws exist to protect workers. They have the right to take a certain amount of paid holiday because rest is important for their health. The benefits of unlimited leave, like better morale and creativity, can happen without harming worker well-being. So, I am not sure if this new holiday policy will really help workers take the time off they need."

Peer review is a process where experts check a scientific research paper before it is published. This process is important because it helps to make sure that only good quality papers are published. However, reviewing a paper can take a long time, sometimes up to a year. Some people wonder if this delay is worth it.

Many scientists still believe in peer review, but there are changes happening in how research is published. One change is the use of preprints. Preprints are drafts of papers that are shared online before they are reviewed. This allows other scientists to read and discuss the new research quickly. 

Publishing in journals has become very competitive. Scientists want to publish in well-known journals to help their careers. This can sometimes lead to problems, like researchers leaving out important information to make their papers look better. Reviewers may also focus more on whether a paper is good enough for a specific journal rather than if it is good science.

Some scientists are starting to use preprints more. They believe preprints can help solve some problems in the current system. However, not all scientists are ready to use preprints because they worry that journals will not accept papers that have been shared online first. There is also a fear that publishing without peer review could lead to bad science, but this has not happened yet.

A psychology professor named Tanya Elks shared her experience with preprints. She wrote a paper that criticized another published paper. In the traditional system, the authors of the original paper could block her critique. But with preprints, both sides could share their views openly. This way, readers can see all the arguments and decide for themselves.

Preprint archives allow scientists from around the world to discuss their work informally. They can also share negative results, which are often ignored by journals that focus only on new discoveries. Papers shared as preprints are read and cited more often, showing that this method works well for sharing research. 

By using preprints, scientists can focus more on the quality of their work rather than where it is published."
94,"When I ask my students what a poem is, they often say it is ""a painting in words."" But this answer does not make me or them happy. One day, I asked my students to pick an object and write about it in two ways. First, they had to describe it like a scientist. Then, they had to write from the object's point of view and call it ""Poem."" One student wrote: 

""Poem
I may look strange or scary, but I help people breathe. I am used only in emergencies and for a short time. Most people will never need me."" 

The object was an oxygen mask. This choice helped the class understand how poetry works in a special way. The exercise was fun and led to good discussions.

When I was in school, I found poetry confusing. I thought every poem was a silly puzzle that made it hard to understand feelings. After school, many people pay less attention to poetry. Sometimes, you see a poem, and it stands out because it is not like regular writing. It challenges you to read it, but often you feel let down because it is not exciting or hard to understand.

What do we want from poems? We might think a poem should show deep feelings, beautiful images, or clever thoughts. But if we want tears, we watch movies. If we want information, we read articles. Novels take us to new worlds, and music is hard to beat with its mix of words and sounds. 

However, poems can show us something special: ambiguity, or uncertainty. Life is full of this, unlike reading sentences one by one. But this does not really explain what a poem is. If you look up ""poem"" online, it leads you to ""poetry,"" which is described as a type of art that uses the beauty and rhythm of language. This is fancy language, but it does not explain the word's roots. ""Poem"" comes from the Greek word ""poí?ma,"" which means ""a thing made,"" and a poet is ""a maker of things."" 

So, if a poem is a thing made, what kind of thing is it? Some poets say poems are like wild animals – hard to control and unpredictable – or like machines – made by humans and exact. But these comparisons do not always work. The best part of trying to define a poem through comparison is the discussion it creates. Whether you see a poem as a machine or a wild animal, this can change how you think about both. It can help you see everyday things in a new way.

A poem is not hard to understand, especially when we think about how song lyrics can stick in our minds. The mix of words and music is powerful, just like the saying, ""Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt me."" But sometimes, words can hurt, just like sticks and stones. 

Think about a poem in a newspaper or magazine. A poem can touch you like nothing else, even though it is just ink on paper, like the articles around it. Why is there empty space around the poem? This space could be used for a longer article or an ad. A poem is written and rewritten like any article or story, but it is not made to be sold. Publishers send out poetry collections, but they do not expect to make money from them. A poem is not just for the market; it is special for its own sake. Because of this, a poem can still surprise us, even if just for a moment."
95,"I bought my first metal detector after I got married. It cost £70, which was a lot of money at that time. My wife, Marion, was very impressed when I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first trip. Over the years, I have found many things like brooches and coins, and it always makes me happy. I like feeling connected to the past. 

After the gold ring, it took 40 years before I found something that impressed Marion again. One dull February afternoon, I had some free time and a place to search. It was raining, so I chose a closer spot where I knew there were old farming tools. When my detector beeped for the first time, I found a piece of a metal wheel. Then it beeped again. I tried to ignore it, but I had to see what it was. I dug down half a meter and lay in the mud when I saw a round, golden ball. 

I had found brass curtain rails before, so I was careful not to get too excited. But as I cleaned it, I saw it was a beautiful, thick loop. I remembered seeing something like it in the British Museum. It was called a torc, a famous necklace from over 2,000 years ago. It is made of gold and silver and has a twist design. I took it to my car and looked at it all the way home. 

When I got home, I washed it in the sink. I shouted for Marion, saying I had something for her. She came in and asked what it was. I told her it was a very old and rare piece of jewelry. We didn’t try it on because we didn’t want to damage it. At night, I hid it in our wardrobe. I was worried about it being stolen, so I later hid it under a floorboard in my office.

The law says I must tell the authorities about such finds within 14 days. I wanted to enjoy the torc as much as I could before I reported it. I even took it in a plastic bag to show a friend in the hospital. Finally, I took it to the council office. The registrar was busy talking to someone when I put the torc on his desk. He stopped talking when he saw it. 

The torc was confirmed as real and was sold to my local council. Now, it is in the British Museum in London. I received £350,000, which I shared with the owner of the field where I found it. But the torc is more than just money for me. It is something I have saved for everyone. People ask if I will stop using my metal detector now that I found something so amazing. But I still find brooches and coins interesting. Just like a fisherman who catches a big fish, I will keep searching for more treasures."
96,"Sleeping is one of my favorite things about traveling, but I don’t talk about it much because I feel a bit guilty. When my friends tell me about their busy trips with many activities like visiting museums and hiking, I just smile and don’t say much. What would they think if they knew I like to take naps in the afternoon and sleep in on beautiful mornings? Sleeping better is one good thing about traveling. 

When I went to Mexico’s Yucatán coast in my early 20s, I was surprised that I slept more than 12 hours most days. There were loud birds nearby, but it didn’t bother me. Far from home, I could sleep deeply and have nice dreams. Without alarm clocks and responsibilities, I found it easier to sleep. 

I think sleep is part of traveling, not just a break from it. When we travel, we see, hear, and smell new things. All these new experiences fill our minds, and when we sleep, we process them. That’s why sleep feels different when we travel. 

People often worry about jet lag, but I think the trouble I have after long trips is more about getting used to new places than just time changes. For example, in Trinidad, people wake up very early to avoid the heat, then they rest when the sun is high, and they become active again in the cool evening. Even though Trinidad is only one hour ahead of New York, it takes me days to get used to their sleep schedule. When I finally do, I feel like I belong there.

I remember one afternoon in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic. I had a big lunch with new friends in an apartment with a view of the blue Caribbean Sea. After eating, we all felt sleepy and started to relax. One by one, my friends went to lie down on hammocks and sofas. I understood why they had so many pillows. I took some pillows too and joined them. I had heard about the siesta, a nap in the afternoon, but that day I really experienced it. I shared not just sleep, but a part of Dominican life.

Travel sleep is special because I remember it. In a new place, I enjoy the different smells, textures, and sounds while I sleep. If enjoying every moment of travel is what makes a good traveler today, then sleeping is one of the best ways to do that. Maybe I should not feel embarrassed about my love for sleep and tell my friends that sleeping while traveling is an important part of the experience too."
97,"The woman looked at herself in the mirror and asked, ""What do you think? Be honest."" Mia, the shop assistant, picked up a nice hat with a soft layer of fabric and a silk bow. ""I think this one looks best on you,"" she said politely. The woman made a funny face and said, ""But it is so boring. Every other woman will wear a hat like that at my daughter’s wedding. This pretty little hat will make me stand out."" She touched the small red and black top hat on her head and said, ""Yes, this is the one I want."" 

Mia smiled and agreed that the woman would stand out at the wedding. She thought about her own daughter, Jen, who was turning thirty today. They were having a family party, and Mia was excited to see Jen, Dan, and Luke. She was also curious about Jen's friend, Tattie, who they did not know. Mia's husband, Jeff, had joked about the name when Jen called to ask if she could bring Tattie. ""What kind of name is that?"" he had said. Mia replied, ""It’s short for Tatiana. I think it’s nice."" Jeff did not like fancy names and often said Mia was too polite. He would have told the woman in the shop that she was choosing the wrong hat.

After an hour, Mia closed her shop and went home. It took her only forty seconds to get there. Four years ago, when Luke left home, Mia decided to turn an old barn into a shop for her hat business. Jeff was not sure it would work. ""Do you really think people want hats?"" he asked. But Mia knew many women had trouble finding the right hat for special occasions. She was right. From the first day, after Jen helped her make a website, Mia’s Hats became popular. Women came from far away to try on hats in her shop in Little Pelham. She made sure they felt comfortable and encouraged them to bring their outfits to find the perfect match. Recently, she also started selling handbags and jewelry."
98,"Lawrence Okoye has moved from London to Atlanta, and he is thinking about his amazing sports journey. He is confident but surprised by how far he has come. He went from being in the Olympic final for discus throwing to possibly playing American football, even though he has never played it before. 

Lawrence is learning about his new position in football. It is surprising that a 21-year-old from London could be chosen for a big American football team. But Lawrence is good at surprising people. He was offered a place at Oxford University to study law, but he decided to train seriously for discus throwing instead. In just 20 months, he became the fourth-best discus thrower in the world.

Lawrence came to Atlanta to train for the world championships in discus. He thought about American football but only decided to try it when he got to the USA. After arriving, he saw that there were trials for the NFL in Atlanta. Even though he had never played football, he applied to attend the trials. 

When asked if he was nervous about being tested with experienced players, he said no. He is confident in his abilities. His performance in tests showed that he was the best player. He felt proud when he heard this. However, he knows he has no experience in football. He believes that if he works hard, he can succeed.

Lawrence is calm while waiting to hear if he has been selected for a team. He is not worried, even though many people think he will be chosen. This calmness may come from his experience in the Olympic final, where he did not do well. He has moved on from that and is happy that he made it to the final.

The minimum salary for an NFL player is over $400,000 a year, which is a big reason for Lawrence to try football. He has changed from rugby to athletics and now to American football. Some people think he should focus on just one sport, but Lawrence wants to achieve his dreams. If football does not work out, he can always go back to discus throwing, which he loves. He believes every choice he has made is a good one."
99,"I woke up on a plane flying east. It was already morning, and I looked out the window. Below me, I saw a big empty land with dark brown and green colors. It was mid-September, but it still looked like summer in Siberia. I could not see any people, just mountains, rivers, and forests going far away.

My neighbor, Sergei, woke up and smiled at me. “Good morning, Robert,” he said with a slow Russian accent. Sergei was a salesman from Moscow. He was going to sell safety clothes to people who work in mines. His English was not very good, and my Russian was not good either. But I used a dictionary to tell him I was going to Magadan, a city in far-eastern Siberia. I had a one-way ticket because I wanted to ride my bicycle back to England.

“But, Robert,” he said, “there is no road from Magadan. You cannot ride a bicycle.” I told him I thought there was a road, but not many people used it. “Alone?” he asked, pointing at me. “No, I will ride with a friend named Al.” “Just one friend?” he asked. “Yes, just one,” I nodded. Sergei still looked worried and pointed outside, saying “Holodna” (cold). I tried to show him with my hands that I had warm clothes, but I didn’t tell him I was on a tight budget. Most of my clothes were cheap. I was not sure if they would keep me warm, especially my big over-trousers that I bought for £10.

This adventure started in a lecture hall in Scotland. The hall was full of tired students. The teacher was talking, and I was thinking about something important. Should I ask my friend Al to go on a bike trip? I decided to write him a note: “Hi Al, Do you want to cycle across the Karakorum Highway between Pakistan and China this summer? Rob.” I passed the note to Al, who was sitting in front of me. He read it, thought for a moment, and wrote back, “OK.”

Now, six years later, I was going to meet Al in Siberia. I had been working as a geography teacher. The job was hard, but I liked it. I had long holidays to go on adventures. I visited Al twice during these holidays. After our bike ride in Pakistan, Al wanted to travel more. He decided to cycle around the world. He was taking on bigger challenges every time. This trip around the world was his biggest challenge yet. Sometimes he thought it was too hard, but I admired him. He was having an amazing adventure and facing new challenges every day. He was proving to everyone that he could do it, and it made him feel alive."
100,"In The Red Bull Air Race, twelve pilots race through tall pylons that are between 15 and 25 metres high. They make sharp turns and do tricks at speeds of up to 370 km per hour. I was invited to experience this race. 

An hour before my flight, I had to sign two forms. The first form said I was healthy, and the second said I would empty my pockets. Small objects can be dangerous during the flight. I learned that I needed to stay focused. I was told, “The horizon is your best friend,” and the pilot would tell me where to look. I also promised to relax and enjoy the view when flying upside down.

Half an hour before the flight, I had a safety talk. I was told not to touch anything. When we started moving on the runway, I was nervous. My legs were up, and I tried not to touch the important pedals and switches. I knew I had to stay calm to survive the flight. 

Dario, the pilot, and I were in a very fast acrobatic plane called the Zivko Edge 540. The plane took off, and two seconds later, we turned sharply to the right. I felt the air push out of my lungs. I looked at the horizon and tensed my body. For a moment, I felt much heavier than normal. Then we leveled out and turned left, diving down. 

We flew very close to the ground, going 400 km per hour. I was allowed to fly the plane for two minutes, but my hand was shaking. Dario then did a barrel roll, which is a full turn in the air. I was surprised but said I was okay. Then he did a loop, flying upside down. 

Many people would find this fun, like riding a rollercoaster, but I thought it was too much. At the top of the loop, I heard a voice saying, “Relax, relax, look up.” I looked up and saw fields. The flight lasted 10 minutes. It was easier than what the pilots usually do in the race. When we landed, Dario ate sandwiches, but I couldn’t eat for hours. That night, I dreamed about flying upside down again."
101,"Doug Allan films wild animals in cold places. If you have seen polar bears in a nature documentary, it is likely that he filmed them. He likes the cold temperature of -18C. Allan studied marine biology and was a commercial diver. Diving was his first love, and he learned how to survive in cold places. His big chance came when a TV crew came to Antarctica, where he was working, to make a wildlife documentary. He helped the crew find different places to film. After 48 hours, he realized that being a wildlife cameraman was perfect for him because it included travel, adventure, and underwater filming.

Now, he is a famous cameraman and has worked on many important TV wildlife shows. When he started 35 years ago, not many people had been to Antarctica. There were people who filmed coral, elephants, and chimpanzees, but he became known as the ""cold man."" He felt that many amazing scenes were waiting to be filmed. 

When he began, the camera and technology were very simple. He said, ""It is easier to film today. In the past, if you filmed something, you had to remember it. Now, with digital cameras, you can see what you filmed right away."" He explained that in the past, filming was expensive, so you had to be careful about what you shot. 

Allan has a lot of experience in cold places. He feels comfortable on sea ice, like it is crossing the street. He does get cold toes, but he says the poles are healthy places because there are no leeches, diseases, or mosquitoes. 

Wildlife filming has many successes, but also failures. Once, he was in the Orkneys to film kittiwakes, but he could not tell which birds they were. Recently, he got permission to film in Kong Karls Land, a group of islands in the Arctic Ocean. This place is home to polar bears and is very dangerous. In April, it is usually -32C, and the wind is strong. Carrying cameras in deep snow is very hard. After walking for five hours a day and watching polar bear dens for 23 days, he only saw one mother bear and her cub. 

On the 24th day, he felt like he was part of the bear world. He waited by a hole in the snow. After a long time, he saw a black nose, then a bear's head. The bear came out and rested in front of him. She looked at him but did not care. Then, she slid down the slope, and two cubs appeared at the den entrance. Allan felt excited because it was their first time seeing the world.

Now, Allan wants to make his own film about climate change in the Arctic. He wants to talk to the people who live there and see how it affects their lives. He believes he can make an amazing documentary."
102,"In 2004, Pen Hadow was the first person to walk to the North Pole alone without getting more supplies. He had to swim in very cold water, fight frostbite, and deal with polar bears. Eight months later, he also reached the South Pole. Now, he is back in the Arctic, getting ready for a new adventure that is even bigger. 

Pen and two friends will go on a three-month journey of 1,000 kilometers to the North Pole. They will measure the ice to see how thick and dense it is. No one has done this before, and the information will be very important for scientists. This will help us understand how global warming is affecting the ice in the polar areas.

When he was a child, Pen was raised by a woman who worked for a famous polar explorer. She made him tough by sending him outside in bad weather with few clothes. His father also loved adventures in cold places, and Pen became very strong. 

Pen is married to Mary, who loves horses. She helps him with his polar guide business. Mary says she worries more about him when he is at home because he thinks about the Arctic. For fun, she once raced against him in a mountain event, and she finished an hour before him. 

Pen and Mary live in the countryside with their two children. He finds it harder to be away from them this time. When he last left, his son was only one year old, and he told him to take care of his mother and sister. This made his son very worried. Pen feels it was not fair to put that on him. This time, he plans to have little contact with his family while he is in the Arctic because he does not want to remind them how far away he is.

Before he leaves, Pen is getting ready and checking his equipment carefully. He knows that on the ice, it is hard to fix things. He will be with Ann Daniels, a top polar explorer, and Martin Hartley, a photographer. They will have a team of six people to help them with supplies.

Pen is feeling some stress because he is turning 47 soon and has not trained as much as he wanted. He thinks that his mission is important because it will help scientists learn more about the Arctic Ocean. He believes that their skills are now very useful for society."
103,"I took a year off. I thought about what to do. Being an Olympian is special. I had time to write, work on TV, and talk to businesses and schools. I enjoyed these activities, but I wanted to compete again. I wanted to stay fit in case I wanted to try for the Olympics again. So, I joined marathons and triathlons. 

But then, I remembered Ben Fogle, a TV presenter. He asked me, “Do you want to row across the Atlantic with me?” I love rowing and missed it. But I wasn’t ready to train every day. Still, I wanted some competition. I asked my rowing friends if they wanted to join the race, but they were not interested. I knew that if I joined the race, I would want to win. But rowing with Ben might not give me the best chance to win. On the other hand, being an underdog without pressure sounded nice.

I contacted Ben. He was going to join the race anyway and had found the money for the entry fee and a boat. This made the race feel real. We talked about the costs; the boat and equipment would cost £70,000, which is a lot of money. We thought we had a good chance, but we still needed to work hard to get it. I also had to think about losing money because I would be away from home. Speaking at business events is a good way to earn money after being a professional athlete. It feels nice that people want to hear from me. But I find it hard to talk about my past without a new goal. 

Joining the race would mean I was doing something again, not just talking about what I did before. I learned a lot while planning this adventure. One big lesson was to appreciate the easy life of a full-time athlete. Training for the Olympics was hard, but it was simple. I trained almost every day, but I had a set plan and support from doctors and dieticians. 

I was worried about what people would think of me racing with a TV presenter. I thought it might look like I just wanted to be on TV. But as we prepared, my worries went away. The Atlantic Rowing Race is not just about rowing; it is also about the mind. Ben had done tough challenges before, but he didn’t know how to row. I was surprised by how little he understood about rowing, and he was surprised by my honesty. I could have been more patient, but I needed to tell him how much he needed to improve. I should have known what to expect when I agreed to race with him."

A little over a year ago, I left my job to work with huskies in the Arctic Circle in northern Finland. I was 26 years old and wanted a change. I dreamed of cold, snowy landscapes because I was tired of the busy life in London. I found a small company run by Anna McCormack and her husband, Pasi Ikonen, in Finnish Lapland. They hired me as a husky dog handler for the winter season. From December to February, they take many tourists on sled rides pulled by huskies across the snow. They started with six dogs, but now they have more than 100. They also took over a second place called the 'wilderness farm,' which is pretty but basic, with bad electricity and no running water. They told me I could join the team for three months, but the work would be hard. I started packing right away.

On November 6, I flew from London. I looked at a page with pictures of more than 100 huskies. I was supposed to remember their names, but I felt nervous. I put the page down and looked out the window. I thought about how spring moves north, but I saw winter coming south, with rivers freezing.

On November 7, I took a bus north. The ride was beautiful. We drove through dark forests with snow on the trees and stopped for reindeer. I arrived at the farm after dark. As soon as I got in, Anna gave me a pair of boots and sent me outside into the cold. She asked if I wanted to start working right away. I followed the sound of barking and found the dogs. Three people were running around, getting the huskies ready for sleds. The dogs were very excited and wanted to go. I tried to introduce myself, but everyone was too busy. I petted one of the quieter dogs. Then someone told me to get in the sled, and I almost fell in. A command was given, and we took off into the dark with only a headlamp for light.

By November 15, I was learning how to be a husky guide, but first, Anna asked me if I was useful. I didn’t know how to answer. I had never driven a snowmobile, done woodwork, or used an axe. But when someone asked if I had a driving license, I nodded, feeling relieved. I learned the basics of dog-sledding quickly: lean into the corners, use both feet to stop, and hold on to the handlebar. But other tasks were hard. Feeding and watering the dogs was difficult in the freezing cold. Water would freeze quickly, so we made a 'soup' of meat in hot water for the dogs. By the end of my first week, I was tired and my muscles hurt from pulling heavy sleds and being pulled by excited huskies. But I felt proud. I emailed my friends, saying, ""I can chop with an axe, hammer a nail, and use a saw. In the snow!"""
105,"On that day, Radcliffe ran very fast and crossed the finish line. Many reporters came to talk to her about her amazing run. They said her time was good enough to compete in the men's marathon at the world championships in Paris. The journalists asked her about emu oil, a special treatment that helped her heal after she had an accident while training. Radcliffe said she did not fully understand how big her achievement was at that moment. She thought it was just what she was supposed to do that day. She and her team believed in having no limits.

During the race, her husband Gary Lough and her physiotherapist Gerard Hartmann were in a car, listening to the race on the radio. After 16 kilometers, Radcliffe's agent worried that she might not keep up her fast pace. Hartmann was angry about this because he knew how fit she was. With 800 meters left, Radcliffe realized she could finish in under 2 hours and 16 minutes if she ran fast. She had already run 41 kilometers quickly, and she finished the last part in 2 minutes and 25 seconds. At the end, she thought, ""I can run faster than that."" The race director, Dave Bedford, said he never thought anyone would run that fast for a long time. Radcliffe thought she would come back and do it again next year, but that did not happen.

After the race, everyone wanted to know how Radcliffe, who ran in a strange way, beat the skilled East African runners. Hartmann worked with her a lot, helping her with her training. He said he had worked with many Olympic winners, but Radcliffe could handle more pain than anyone else. He often traveled 13 hours from Ireland to help her train. When he arrived, her husband would say, ""Gerard, you're 15 minutes late, Paula's waiting."" There was no time for small talk; Radcliffe wanted to start training right away. Hartmann spent so much time with her that other athletes became jealous.

Radcliffe was asked why no one has come close to her record. She said she trained very hard, but there are other talented runners. She thought Mary Keitany, a two-time London marathon winner, could do it. Radcliffe believed that some runners focus more on beating others than on improving themselves. She always pushed herself to run hard, even when she was winning. Radcliffe did not know it at the time, but that marathon was the best she would ever run. However, she inspired many women to start long-distance running."
106,"When my first cooking show, In Search of Perfection, started, I was not sure how people would like it. There was a lot of talk about a food ‘revolution’ in Britain, and I thought we made a good show that was different. But I worried: would people like a show about cooking that included history and science? I watched the first episode with both joy and fear. I didn’t need to worry. The show became very popular and led to many other interesting projects, including a book about my restaurant. 

In each project, I felt like I was on a journey, whether it was into the past or learning new cooking techniques. I wrote several books in a series called ‘Perfection’, each one with its own TV show. In these books, I traveled to many places and met amazing people, like a man who makes special pasta that tastes great. These people have spent many years trying to reach their own idea of perfection. 

Perfection means different things to different people. Choosing which dishes to include in the show was hard, and I knew some people would be upset if their favorite dish was not there. I could imagine people asking, “Where is steak and kidney pie and bread and butter pudding?” But after a long meeting, my team and I made a list that included something for everyone. This showed me that everyone has their own idea of perfection based on their feelings and memories.

Even though the book is called ‘Perfection’, I knew I could not say the recipes were the best. I believed that by using my cooking skills and talking to food makers and chefs, I could find out what makes these dishes special. The dictionary says ‘perfection’ means being perfect, but it also means trying new ideas and improving them until they are unique. 

The TV show let me explore many foods, people, and places I had never seen before. I was excited to learn about food and memories because I started my career in the same way. Finding the best ingredients took me around the world. I had many adventures, like visiting a factory that was using the wrong tomatoes and a dairy farm that was not good enough for filming. I even tried to make ice cream by hand-milking a cow and using dry ice, cooked chicken in a hospital machine, and almost burned my house while trying to make a real Neapolitan pizza."
107,"We were still far from Marrakech when the van made a loud noise, went off the road into a field, and stopped. John got out and opened the front of the van. He looked at the engine for a long time with his hands in his pockets. He looked like he knew what he was doing. But then he said, “Actually, I don’t know what I’m doing,” and he and Mum started to laugh. Bea was worried. “We can’t stay here forever,” she said. The field was big and had only grass and many flowers, like poppies and daisies. “No, we can’t stay here forever,” I said too, because it was better to agree with Bea. We got back into the van and waited for Mum and John to stop laughing. We watched John get smaller as he walked to find someone who could help with the van. Mum lay down on the grass. “Tell us a story,” she said. Bea lay down next to her. “Go on, tell us a story.” So I told them about how the day before we left London, I heard two birds talking. I told them what the birds talked about: breadcrumbs, other birds, the weather, and an argument over a worm. “That’s silly, no one understands bird language,” Bea said. My eyes felt wet. “I do.” But I didn’t sound sure. “Liar,” Bea said. I felt embarrassed. How could I be lying if I remembered everything? I thought about asking Mum, but she had fallen asleep in the sun. 

John came back with three Moroccan boys who helped us push the van to the hotel. Bea didn’t want to get out. The boys waved and smiled at her through the back windows. We followed John into a café. It was not far from where our van was parked. “It’s a hotel,” John whispered. “It might be a bit expensive.” “We’ll just have some tea,” Mum said, and we sat in the shade. The tea was made from mint leaves and was very sweet. Mum looked into the pot. “It’s like syrup,” she said. We stayed at the café all day while John looked at the engine. “It’s a miracle it got us this far,” he said when it started to get dark. Mum took out blankets and made a bed for us in the hotel garden. It felt nice to sleep on the ground. “I’ll have to get us towed into Marrakech,” John said. 

Half an hour later, we were in a truck watching our van being pulled behind it with John driving. At first, Bea didn’t want to move, so John picked her up and put her in the truck. Now she sat in the front with the driver. I kept thinking about how we would get home now that our van had to be pulled everywhere. I thought it might be easier to take a boat straight to London. Then I must have fallen asleep."
108,"Lucy was at a welcome party in a hotel ballroom. She was talking to two other pianists who were also at the Prague Classical Music Festival. One was a guy from Tokyo, and the other was a girl from Europe named Liesel or Louisa. They were both older than Lucy by about ten years. They spoke good English and talked about the music they were playing and their travels. 

“I think I’m going to Tanglewood this summer,” Lucy said. It sounded impressive, but she didn’t really want to go. She didn’t want to do many things that took her away from school, like concerts and competitions. Because of this, she wasn’t officially enrolled in school anymore. Instead, she worked with tutors from the University of San Francisco. 

Lucy didn’t even want to come to the Prague Festival, which only took fifteen young pianists from around the world. She was lucky to be chosen from thousands of applicants. At the party, her dad gave her a white-gold necklace with an L pendant to celebrate. Her little brother Gus dreamed about being at the festival one day. Lucy’s teacher, Grace Chang, took her out for a special dinner to plan what music she would play. 

The funny thing was, Lucy hadn’t applied to the festival. Her mom filled out the form and sent in a CD of her playing. “I didn’t want you to be disappointed if you didn’t get in,” her mom said. Lucy thought her mom didn’t want to give her a chance to say no. At that time, Lucy believed it was bad to say no to things. 

The guy from Tokyo leaned in and asked, “Tanglewood?” 

“Yeah.” 

“How old are you?” 

“Fifteen.” 

He looked at Liesel/Louisa, who said, “Wow.” Lucy didn’t mean to show off. It was hard to know when to share her achievements and when to keep quiet. 

“It’s just part of this new youth-spotlight thing they’re trying…” Lucy started to explain, but Liesel/Louisa looked away, as if she saw someone she needed to talk to. The guy from Tokyo stayed and asked, “Have you ever been to Japan?” He had long, messy hair, like many musicians, to show he was a cool music nerd. 

“Once, when I was about eight,” Lucy replied. He was about to say something when Lucy's grandfather came over. 

“Lucy, let me introduce you to someone,” he said, taking her arm and pulling her away. “And don’t get too friendly with the competition.” 

“They’re not the competition,” Lucy said. 

“Everyone is the competition,” her grandfather replied. He took her around the room to meet important people. Lucy smiled and nodded a lot, but she only understood part of what they said. 

In the elevator to their room after the party, her grandfather said, “You did well in there, Lucy. I’m proud of you. This is an important festival, and people are talking about you. They all know who you are.” 

Lucy liked that. She liked being someone important, even if some people were jealous or thought she was too young. Being a concert pianist didn’t make her special at school. Even her best friend, Reyna, didn’t know or care that she could play difficult music. But in places like this, Lucy felt she mattered."

“Spending too much time online is not good for you. You need to go outside and enjoy the real world,” said Dad. It is hard to argue with him, so I wanted to learn what experts say about this. I found some interesting information. 

Research shows that many teenagers who use social media have real friends, feel like they belong, and are learning important skills for the digital world. Simon Miles, an expert on online safety, says that social media is a big part of growing up today. Teenagers use social media differently than adults. They do not just check emails or buy tickets; they live in it. This is not good or bad; it depends on how you use it.

How is our social media use different from what our parents did when they were young? Jim Matthews, a social media expert, says it is like the youth clubs of the past. Teenagers today use social media to share jokes and talk about their lives, just like parents did when they were younger. It helps teenagers find their identity away from their parents and deal with issues with their friends.

Psychologist Professor Keith Davidson says that being a teenager is a time to ask, “Who am I?” Social media can help with this. You can share your favorite music or sports and see how others think. Research shows that teenagers who use social media are not more self-centered than those who do not. He also says that for shy people, talking online can be easier than in person. It can help them practice social skills in a safe way.

Professor Andrew Phillips studies how young people use social media. He believes it can help quiet people with special interests connect with others. If you are one of the few people in your school who likes a certain type of music, you might feel alone. But if you find a group online with people who like the same music, you can feel more connected and popular in a different way.

Pauline White, an expert in digital education, says that young people can find new interests online and create their own content. She thinks social media is a way for teenagers to be creative. They can make videos, podcasts, and blogs about what they like. Photo-sharing sites help photographers connect, learn new skills, and share their work. This can help them get jobs in the future. 

Every business uses social media to sell products and reach customers. If you have many friends on social media, they can be potential customers for your product. If you connect all your networks, you can reach even more people. 

Teenagers who use social media creatively will benefit when they grow up and start working. Matthews agrees that many sites allow people to work together to create and share content. Working together is an important skill in today’s world and helps you get a job."
110,"When people think of a fun family vacation, they might not think of a long trip across nine western states in the US and one province in Canada. But my parents wanted to have a special summer vacation this year. My dad wanted to plan a family trip that he thought would bring us closer together. He and my mom often said, “Not enough people do this anymore,” while my twin brother and I looked at each other in surprise.

In mid-June, we packed our car with suitcases, food, and clothes for all kinds of weather. I was excited but also worried about losing my privacy for two weeks. With not much space left in the car, we started our big family road trip. We left our big house for smaller places to stay for the next five thousand miles. I wondered what adventures we would have.

We drove west through Oklahoma. Even though we were still close to home, we had some adventures. One night, we stopped near a town in Oklahoma and saw many stars in the sky, but we almost got blown off the road by a dust storm. We learned that cows have the right to cross the road!

The next day, we woke up early and continued our trip. We saw deserts and then mountains. Each day was different, but they all blended together. We left our footprints in the Great Sand Dunes and then went to Pagosa Springs, Colorado. That town smelled strongly of sulfur, which was new for us. 

As we drove up a mountain, we realized that the roads for Jeeps were not for regular cars. We saw a mix of old and new things everywhere we went. We often got stuck in traffic because of construction. We laughed when we saw big “CLOSED” signs at the Four Corners Monument.

On our way to Yellowstone National Park, we saw many wind farms. At Yellowstone, we watched the sun set over areas where bears lived. Sometimes, we had to stop our car to let bears cross the road, which was called a “bear jam.” We had a close encounter with a bear and a worried park ranger, which made for great memories.

As we drove, I forgot about life back home. Even our old hotel, which had no internet or cell phone service, could not ruin our fun. The hotel was 95 years old, but the views were amazing. After watching a rainstorm from our hotel in Canada, we started our trip back home. My parents were right; you don’t need to go far away to find something special.

When we got home, it felt nice to be together again, and I was happy I didn’t fight with my brother during our long trip. We took three thousand photos of our adventures, and I knew I would remember the unexpected moments the most."
111,"Rose Frost was sixteen years old. She was going to live with her grandmother, Daisy. Rose's family was separating for two years. Her father, Jeff, had a job in another country, and her mother, Dahlia, would go with him. Rose and her older sister, Amy, would stay in England. Amy needed to finish her last year of school, so she would live at the college. She was happy because she got the best room with a kitchen and a study area. Amy could also use the Internet and phone for free. Their parents would check on Amy, even if she did not want them to.

Rose was moving to her grandmother’s house. She only remembered a few happy times with Daisy and did not know her grandfather. Daisy wanted Rose to stay with her, even if Rose's parents were not happy about it. There had been a problem between Daisy and Rose's parents, so Rose had not spent time with her grandmother for a long time. Rose was excited to live with Daisy. Her mother said it would be interesting because Daisy liked to meet people. Rose thought she would get dinner invitations, coffee mornings, and shopping trips soon.

Daisy was not a typical old lady. She went to many social events. Before moving, Rose talked with her mother. Rose was sensible and knew about healthy eating and staying fit. But she wanted to be independent. She wanted to play music loud, invite friends over, and go out without asking for permission. She did not want to be told what to do all the time. Daisy understood this.

Rose's mother gave her a new mobile phone for emergencies. Rose was very happy about it. They all agreed to trust each other. Rose would act mature, and Daisy would not be too strict. If they had problems, they would talk about it.

Rose was not a wild child. She had good friends, and her school reports were always good. In five weeks, she would start at a new school and meet new friends. This was her fourth school in five years, so she felt experienced. She knew this would be her last school before finishing. For Rose, it was a new beginning in her life."
112,"Charlotte Grainger talks about how her primary school teacher thought she might write a book one day. Charlotte felt that writing a book was a big challenge, and when she turned 13, she decided to try. Now, her first novel is going to be published. She told her old teacher about it, and the teacher was surprised. The teacher thought Charlotte would write a book when she was older, around 30 or 40 years old. But Charlotte didn’t understand why she should wait to do something she was good at.

It is a winter afternoon, and I am in the office of Charlotte’s publishers. I am going to interview a 15-year-old girl about her book. I was surprised to see a teenager sitting there. The book is a big achievement. It is exciting and well-written. The only thing that shows it was written by a teenager is the age of the main character. A public relations person is with us in case Charlotte needs help, but she does not. Charlotte is confident and smart, but she is also calm and does not act too proud.

Charlotte knows she is young. When I ask her about the important questions in her book, she says, “I was asking big questions, not answering them. I don’t have many life lessons to share.” She laughs and says she is interested in the idea of taking responsibility.

Charlotte thinks that books for teenagers often show three types of characters: the outsider who becomes accepted, the naïve teenager who knows little about the world, and the awkward teenager who struggles socially. She feels annoyed that there are not many stories about normal teenagers. She believes that some writers make teenagers feel like they do not know who they are, which can hurt their confidence.

Charlotte loves reading books by famous fantasy writers, but sometimes these books made her doubt her own writing. She wondered if she needed to write about deep topics to make a good book. However, she found a helpful book called How Not to Write a Novel. This book says that if readers can guess what will happen next, the story is not exciting anymore.

Some people think Charlotte’s parents helped her get her book published because they are both journalists. Her father knew someone in publishing who read her book first. Charlotte knows she is lucky because it is hard for anyone to get a first novel read. She says, “Every writer needs support and a bit of luck, but after that, you have to rely on your own talent. I don’t take anything for granted.”"
113,"""‘Remember, speed is your friend, not your enemy,’ said Gareth, our instructor, as we looked down the ski slope. ‘Now, who wants to go first?’ The group looked nervous. Then a guy named David, who had some experience with freestyle ski-jumping, stepped forward. He skied down the slope towards the jump. He went up fast and his arms were in the air. We could see something was wrong. We held our breath. He landed hard, lost both skis, and fell into the snow. ‘Remember,’ Gareth said, ‘speed can be unpredictable.’ 

I thought maybe freestyle skiing was not for me. On my previous skiing trips, I liked to practice turns in the snow. I was not like the teenagers who did tricks on ramps and half pipes. I thought it looked fun, but I was afraid to try because I didn’t know how. My parents decided we would have a winter holiday at a freestyle skiing training center in the US. It had a big indoor area with trampolines and ski jumps with fake snow. Students jumped and tried new tricks, landing in foam cubes. This was not like skiing outside.

After practicing indoors, we went outside to try for real. ‘Progression is inevitable!’ the center’s slogan said. Gareth told us that before places like this, new ski jumpers just went down the slopes without training. He warned us, ‘If you land on the knuckle, you’ll be in trouble.’ The ‘knuckle’ is the flat part behind the jump. If you land there, you stop suddenly, and it hurts. So, speed is important.

At first, I found it hard to ignore my fear and go fast towards the jump. My legs wanted to slow down, and I landed on the knuckle. I didn’t fall, but I felt tired. ‘You need to control the jump, not let it control you,’ said Gareth. 

On the second day, we started on the trampolines. I thought I would hate being inside, but bouncing was fun. Some exercises helped us practice ski-jumping moves, and others helped us know where our bodies were in the air. Gareth told us what to do. I needed to work on my ‘aerial awareness’ because I only noticed the jump before I took off and then I found myself in the foam cubes.

We went back to the mountain to try again. I had some problems, but finally, I landed properly. Gareth was happy, and I felt proud. But that feeling didn’t last long. On my last jump of the day, I tried to keep my speed up. I jumped and landed in the right place. Then I saw both my skis sliding down the slope, no longer on my feet."""
114,"Imagine you are on a rollercoaster in an amusement park. You feel scared and hold on tight. The ride stops, and you take a deep breath as the carriage goes slowly up. Then, suddenly, it drops, and your stomach feels funny. You go fast forward, turn left, and even go upside down. You scream because you are scared. But you chose to go to the amusement park, just like many other people do every year.

Amusement parks are very popular and make a lot of money. To make exciting rides, many people work together. There are engineers, designers, and marketing experts who help create these rides. Being a rollercoaster designer sounds fun, but it is a big job. They must make sure the ride is exciting but also safe for everyone. 

Many of the ideas for rollercoasters were created a long time ago by a designer named John Miller. He made rides that were very thrilling, but now there are rules to keep people safe. I talked to some experts about rollercoasters. Professor Brendan Walker, who designs thrilling rides, said it is important to put all the parts together well. Dr. John Roberts explained that the goal is to make people feel like they are being tossed around but still safe.

To make a great ride, the teams think of a fun story, like a space adventure or a jungle chase. They also try to make the ride taller, twistier, and have steeper drops. Professor Walker said that experience and testing are very important in this job. Jeff Hornick, who helps develop theme parks, said it is good to understand what people want and to try the rides before they open.

I asked if new technology, like virtual reality, would change rollercoasters. Walker said that while new technology can be exciting, the real experience of the rollercoaster is still the most important part."
115,"At 25 years old, Miranda Ellington has done a lot as a choreographer. She has created dances for many theatres and dance companies. She also dances sometimes. I wonder why she does both things with her busy life. She says, “Dancing again helps me remember what it is like to be in the studio and follow the orders of choreographers. It can be very tense and frustrating. Choreographers sometimes forget how hard it is to practice all day.”

As a choreographer, Miranda teaches and enjoys working with young students. She says, “New dancers are often open to trying new ideas. Working with students can be easier than with professionals because they are willing to take risks. They want to succeed, but they do not always know their strengths and weaknesses. This makes them open to feedback, even if it is tough. Sometimes they challenge what I say, but I like their honest opinions.”

When Miranda starts with a new group, she focuses on the dance steps, and the music guides her. She says, “There may be music I don’t like, but I still create the best dance routine for it. If dancers do not like a certain music piece, it can be frustrating, but I must find a way to make it work. I wish I could try different pieces of music to make rehearsals more fun. But now, I mostly work on big productions where the music is already chosen.”

Miranda does not want to stay with one place. She believes it is important to meet new people. However, she knows that different theatres and schools have different styles. She must change how she works each time she goes to a new place. This helps her not to get stuck in her ways.

We talk about a recent documentary about ballet dancers and choreographers. Miranda says, “Some documentaries look nice but are not real. This one shows what life is really like in a dance company. There is a scene where a young dancer gets many corrections. I smiled because I understood her struggle. She knows she is not doing it right but cannot make her body do what she needs. It is hard to watch, but it is real. People do not see how much work and dedication ballet takes.”

I ask Miranda what makes a great dance production. She says, “It is when everything comes together – the music, costumes, lighting, and dancers. Perfection is hard to achieve, but aiming high is important. It helps you get away with some mistakes. I have worked on shows where the dance steps are good, but the costumes or props are distracting. That is disappointing.”

Miranda has done many types of work, and I wonder how she sees herself. Is she a modern dance choreographer or a ballet expert? She replies, “People want to label you, but I don’t understand why. There is a trend to focus on one area, but I do not agree with that. Maybe one day I will be known for one thing, but for now, I want to explore more.”"
116,"A friend once asked me why I travel when I can watch everything on TV. I said that TV shows many amazing things, but why stay at home when there is so much to see and do outside? This conversation gave me the idea for my fun four-day trip and a film to make people turn off their TVs.

A friend was giving away his old sofa, and I decided to use it in my trip. I added three wheels and some cables to the sofa and used old seatbelts to hold it on my shoulders. I put my bags on the sofa and slept on it every night, even one night on the beach. Some friends came with me to help pull the sofa and cheer me on.

I have walked on many trips before, but this was very different. It was the longest I have ever walked, and I walked on main roads. This meant I could stop at a café and relax on the sofa with a cappuccino instead of sitting on a rock with my sandwiches blowing away in the wind.

I often told people, “No, I’m not doing this for charity, and I’m not training for a marathon.” When someone at work asks about my weekend, I prefer to tell them how I pulled a sofa 100 miles across southern England instead of talking about the latest TV show. You can see the film on my website."
117,"When I read about swimming trips in the sea around some small Greek islands, I was very excited. I had never been on a group trip before. My brother was busy, so I thought a group holiday would be good for me. The man at the Greek port looked surprised when I asked for a ticket for one person because many families go to the islands. I told him I would not be alone for long; I would join ten other people to swim around the small islands. He still looked confused, but he smiled and let me on the boat.

Before we started, our group had sent emails to each other, but we did not have much time to talk before our first swim. Our guides told us that a support boat would be with us the whole time and showed us how to talk to it. We swam a short distance to split us into speed groups, and then it was time for our first long swim of 1.5 km. I was nervous. I had trained in my local pool and swum in rivers, but I had never swum long distances in the open sea.

Soon, the waves got bigger, and I was at the back of the slow group, which was not where I wanted to be. I saw faster swimmers moving ahead like dolphins. I wanted to finish this first swim, and I was very happy when I did it by myself. 

The next days were similar: we jumped in, swam at a comfortable speed, and stopped to look at the beautiful views. As the swims got longer, I swam faster and enjoyed them more. I felt like I did not need the support boat. I can’t wait to come back next year!"
118,"Being a flight attendant is not easy, but it is a great job. Since I started, I have traveled to many places, like the US and Australia. I work with amazing people, have a lot of free time, and my job is never boring. This makes it a good job for young people like me!

When I was a child, I went to a boarding school far from my family. I often flew alone when school started and ended. Sometimes, I felt lonely, so I asked the flight attendants if I could help serve meals to the passengers. Some of them let me help. 

Later, when I wanted to change from my banking job, I remembered this. I looked for a new job and went to an interview. There were many young people there, and many of them were also changing careers. Before the interview, I practiced what to say. I talked about my skills and my work experience, not just that I loved to travel. Because of this, I got the job!

I think this job is good for anyone. There are many reasons to like it, but the free flights are not the best part. Most airline workers work very hard. There is a saying: ""No one is finished until everyone is finished."" It feels like a big family. Even if we don’t see each other all the time, we are still close.

When I am not working, I don’t have to take work home. If I have difficult passengers, which is rare, I know the flight will end soon, and I will probably never see them again!"
119,"At the summer camp where I work, I really like to see the children do things they thought they could not do. Most of the children can swim and play table tennis before they come here, but rock climbing is new for many of them. Some children feel nervous, but after we encourage them, they try and all reach the top. This makes them very happy. 

At the start of the week, some children miss their homes. It is not the youngest children who miss home the most; it is usually the ten- to thirteen-year-olds. We do not let them use their mobile phones all the time. We tell them they can call home after lunch. When they ask again after dinner, we say it is too late to call now and they can do it tomorrow. Most children feel better in a few days, and at the end of the week, they come to us and thank us because they had a great time.

Sometimes, it is not just the children who feel lonely. We also have parents who call a lot to ask how their child is. This is not necessary. Often, their child is busy playing games or doing other things, so we tell the parents to call back later.

We often see a certain type of child at camp. They usually wear expensive new clothes. These children often argue when we ask them to change into something more suitable, but soon they understand why."
120,"Text: 'Rock the Planet is a musical show where actors also need to be good musicians. It opened in London last year after being in the USA for five years. In the USA, it won the ‘Best Musical’ award four times! 

Doing the show with all British actors was not easy. In the UK, there are rules about how many shows young actors can do each week. In the USA, they can do more shows. Because of this, they needed twice as many actors in the UK. Luckily, the director found many talented actors in the UK, and they just won their first ‘Best Musical’ award.

The theatre in London is bigger than the one in the USA, and it has been full every night. Many people want to hear the songs that became popular in America. I met Jamie, an 11-year-old actor in the show. He said, ‘It’s great that I get paid to play, especially with a beautiful Gibson guitar.’ 

Jamie told me that the young actors are very busy. ‘We have normal school lessons at the theatre. The teacher is great, but I miss my old school friends,’ he said. I asked him what his friends think of the show. He said, ‘My whole class came! The theatre gives special ticket prices for schools. They loved it, and that made me feel confident. My parents come when they can, but it’s expensive for them.’

When I told Jamie I also play guitar, he found a spare one and invited me to play with him and the other young actors. We played a song called Days, which I didn’t know. Jamie helped me, and I was happy when I finally got it right. I was impressed by Jamie’s skills and wished I could play like him. I was just trying to keep up and was glad the director wasn’t there to hear my mistakes!

The young actors were already musicians, and some played several instruments, but none had played in a band before. They found it easy to play together. Jamie said the hard part was looking natural when they first performed. They were so focused that they forgot to smile!

The show will be in London for another year, and it is worth seeing.'"
