1,"Some time ago, a website talked about the dangers of public check-ins, which are online posts that show where you are. The website warned that when you say, ""Hey, I’m at this place,"" you are also telling many people where you are, including some you might not want to meet. This shows that sharing everything online can have negative effects. 

The internet gives us many chances to share our lives with a large audience, which can seem exciting. However, we often forget that sharing too much can lead to problems. In the past, some early internet users, known as bloggers, explored these dangers. They faced challenges like losing jobs and friends before social media became popular. 

One of these early bloggers was Justin Hall. In January 1994, he started sharing his life online when the web was mostly used by students and scientists. He created a personal blog where he wrote about everything, and many people became interested in his stories. However, when he fell in love and wrote about it, his partner asked him to choose between the blog and their relationship. Hall chose to stop blogging because he felt it made people not trust him.

In 2002, Heather Armstrong, who worked in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job, but one day a coworker shared her blog with their bosses, which led to her losing her job. This shows the ""online distribution effect,"" where people say things online that they would never say in person. However, our online lives are connected to our real lives, and we can make serious mistakes if we forget this.

Armstrong's story had a happy ending. After taking a break from blogging, she got married and started a new blog about her family. Now, she is successful as a ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing helps support her family. She learned an important lesson: just because we can say anything online, it doesn’t mean we should."
2,"A while ago, some scientists started a campaign to warn people about a low-budget film called What the Bleep Do We Know? This film mixes documentary and drama to show that there is a lot we don’t understand about our universe. Scientists can sometimes be a bit proud, but even the most confident physicist would not say they know everything about the universe. However, some scientists felt it was important to warn the public about the film, calling it everything from “atrocious” to “very dangerous.” This made me curious to see the movie.

At first, I didn’t understand why there was so much excitement. Various scientists made simple statements about how new discoveries show that the universe is stranger than we thought. But when the film talked about some of these discoveries, I finally understood the excitement. One claim was that water molecules can be affected by thoughts. I had heard before that a Japanese researcher showed that the shape of a water molecule could change based on the feelings of people around it. However, the movie only showed pictures of ice crystals that looked beautiful when someone was happy and ugly when someone was in a bad mood. Many people find this kind of evidence convincing because it is clear and easy to understand. But scientists often respond with skepticism, saying, “Give me a break.” 

I understand their point. The idea that water can be affected by thoughts is amazing and could mean there are new forces in the universe. But before we get too excited, we need good proof that this is true. Pretty pictures of crystals are not enough. The real issue is that the movie’s claims were not strange enough. For example, water molecules might have properties linked to a mysterious energy that is causing the universe to expand. This idea is supported by many years of research in labs and observatories around the world.

In fact, scientists are making discoveries that show the universe is stranger than we ever thought. Astronomers have found that the universe is made of an unknown type of matter and is pushed by a mysterious force called “dark energy.” Other discoveries are also surprising. Neuroscientists have found that our awareness of events happens about half a second after they actually occur, but we don’t notice this delay because our brains edit it out. Anthropologists believe they have found where modern humans first appeared and how they spread across the world. Some theorists even suggest there are connections between life on Earth and the design of the universe.

Despite what some people think, science is not finished. In fact, we seem to know less than we thought. Many natural events may never be fully understood. The ideas of chaos and quantum uncertainty show that there are limits to what we can know. Some of the best theoretical physicists are trying to create a “Theory of Everything” that would explain all the forces and particles in the universe with one equation. Overall, many of us believe that the universe can be described in one word: incredible."
3,"To put it simply, I find writing novels difficult, but writing short stories is a joy. If writing novels is like planting a forest, then writing short stories is like planting a garden. Both activities work together to create a beautiful landscape that I love. The trees provide shade, and the wind makes the leaves rustle, sometimes turning them a bright gold. In the garden, flowers bloom, and their colorful petals attract bees and butterflies, showing us the change of seasons.

Since I started my career as a fiction writer, I have often switched between writing novels and short stories. My routine is this: after finishing a novel, I want to write short stories. Once I complete a group of short stories, I feel ready to focus on a novel again. I never write short stories while working on a novel, and I don’t write a novel while working on short stories. Writing these two types of stories uses different parts of my brain, and it takes time to switch from one to the other.

I began my career with two short novels in 1975, and from 1984 to 1985, I started writing short stories. I didn’t know much about writing short stories back then, so it was challenging, but I found it very memorable. I felt my fictional world grow, and readers liked this new side of me as a writer. One of my early stories, “Breaking Waves,” was included in my first collection, Tales from Abroad. This was how I began as a short-story writer.

One of the best things about writing short stories is that they don’t take long to finish. Usually, it takes me about a week to write a short story (though I can spend a lot of time revising it). Writing a novel, on the other hand, can take a year or two, which feels very long. Sometimes, I wonder if I will make it through writing a novel. So, writing short stories gives me a nice change of pace.

Another great thing about short stories is that you can create them from the smallest ideas – a thought, a word, or an image. It’s often like jazz music, where the story goes in its own direction. Plus, with short stories, you don’t have to worry too much about failing. If an idea doesn’t work out, you can just move on and remember that not every story can be perfect. Even famous writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver didn’t write a masterpiece every time. This thought comforts me. 

I learn from my mistakes and successes in short stories and use that knowledge when I write novels. In this way, short stories are like a testing ground for me as a novelist. It is hard to experiment in a novel the way I want to, so without short stories, writing novels would be even harder.

My short stories are like soft shadows I have left in the world, small reminders of my feelings. I remember where I wrote each one and how I felt at that moment. Short stories are like signs to my heart, and it makes me happy to share these personal feelings with my readers."
4,"At its simplest, science is related to philosophy, but it also helps us cure diseases. Science has made our lives easier, but it can also be dangerous. It tries to understand everything from tiny ants to the vast universe. Science has influenced poets, politicians, and thinkers. Its beauty is often seen only by those who study it deeply, and its dangers are often misunderstood. People sometimes overestimate or underestimate its importance, and the mistakes made by scientists are often ignored or exaggerated.

The history of science is full of conflict. Old ideas are often changed or completely replaced by new ones. Just like in music, new ideas are sometimes laughed at before they become accepted. Scientists can be jealous and angry, and the history of science shows that conflict is common. This book will show how scientific ideas have changed not just science, but also how we think about many things. While science has practical uses, we will focus on the ideas themselves.

Science is always changing. There is always a scientist who is proving another scientist wrong. Most of the time, these changes do not disturb society. However, sometimes big changes challenge our established beliefs. For example, in the 1600s, science described the universe as a giant clock. Now, physics questions some basic ideas, suggesting that we can change the universe just by observing it, and we do not fully understand our most basic concepts.

Some people think that the changing nature of science shows it cannot explain the universe. But when science changes, it usually helps us understand and predict nature better. For example, Isaac Newton explained more than the ancient Greek thinker Aristotle, and Albert Einstein explained even more than Newton. Science may make mistakes, but it keeps moving forward. 

At the end of the 1800s, many physicists thought there was nothing important left to discover. Then came new discoveries like radioactivity, X-rays, and the electron. Biology has also made many discoveries. Today, some people believe we are close to finding a complete theory that explains everything about the universe. 

Science is not just a fun activity. In the last 200 years, we have gone from just observing nature to controlling it in some ways. Sometimes, we have disturbed nature without fully understanding the consequences. It is important for everyone, not just scientists, to understand scientific advances because they will shape the future for our children. Science is now a key part of how we think about and shape our future. The decisions made in science can affect many things, including health and the future of life on Earth."
5,"From around 2015, after many years of growth, big publishers started to say that ebook sales had stopped growing or even decreased in some cases. This raised questions about the future of ebooks in the publishing industry. One publishing executive even said that the excitement about ebooks might have led to bad investments, making his company lose faith in the value of printed books. 

Even though it seems clear that ebooks and printed books can exist together, people still ask if ebooks will replace printed books. Whether people are trying to predict this or deny it, the idea of books disappearing continues to spark our imagination and create strong discussions. Why is this idea so strong? Why do we see ebooks and printed books as competitors, even when evidence shows they can coexist? The answers to these questions go beyond ebooks and show us how we feel about change and new technology.

In my research, I have looked at how the idea of one type of media replacing another often happens when new technologies are introduced. For example, when television was invented, many people thought radio would disappear. However, radio found new ways to be used, like being listened to in cars and on trains. The idea that books might disappear is not new either. In 1894, people thought that the phonograph would replace books with what we now call audiobooks. This pattern has happened many times. Movies, radio, television, hyperlinks, and smartphones have all been said to threaten printed books at different times.

Some people believed that if books disappeared, it would lead to a decline in culture. Others thought that ebooks would bring a better future. The idea of books disappearing often comes up during times of technological change. This idea reflects our mixed feelings of hope and fear about new technology.

We form emotional connections with different types of media as they become important in our lives. Many studies show that we can feel close to objects like books, televisions, and computers. For example, people might name their car or get frustrated with their laptop. When new technology, like e-readers, appears, it changes our relationship with things we have grown attached to. As technology changes, we often miss what we used to have. This is why there are industries that focus on older products and technologies.

For instance, when the printing press became popular in 15th-century Europe, people wanted original manuscripts. The change from silent to sound movies in the 1920s made people nostalgic for the older style. The same thing happened when photography changed from analog to digital and from vinyl records to CDs. E-readers have also made people appreciate the physical qualities of printed books, even their smell. 

This should comfort those who worry about printed books disappearing. However, the idea of media disappearing will continue to be an interesting story about how technology changes our lives and our feelings about change. One way we deal with change is by using familiar stories, like those about tragedy and endings. The story of books disappearing reflects both our excitement for the future and our fear of losing parts of our lives and ourselves."
6,"For a year and a half, I woke up every weekday at 5:30 AM. I brushed my teeth, made coffee, and wrote about how some of the greatest thinkers from the last four hundred years managed their time to do their best work. I looked at their daily lives—when they slept, ate, worked, and worried—to show their personalities and careers. A famous French writer, Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, once said, “Tell me what you eat, and I shall tell you what you are.” I believe, “Tell me what time you eat, and whether you take a nap afterward.” 

This book is not just about the creative work itself, but about the daily habits that help people be creative. I also share my own struggles: How can you do meaningful work while making a living? Is it better to focus on one project or to work a little each day? When time is short, do you have to give up things like sleep or a clean house, or can you learn to do more in less time? I don’t have all the answers, but I share examples of how many successful people faced similar challenges. 

The title of the book is Daily Rituals, but it is really about people’s routines. Routines can seem boring, but they can help us use our time, willpower, and optimism better. A good routine can help us focus and avoid being affected by our moods. The psychologist William James believed that having good habits allows us to focus on more interesting things. Ironically, he struggled with procrastination and could not keep a regular schedule.

This book started because of my own procrastination. One Sunday, I was supposed to write a story for a magazine, but instead, I was cleaning my workspace and making coffee. I am a “morning person,” so I decided to look online for information about other writers’ schedules. I found many interesting stories and thought it would be great to collect them. This led to the Daily Routines blog I started that day, and now this book.

The blog was simple; I shared people’s routines from biographies and articles. For the book, I gathered more detailed and researched information while keeping it interesting. I let my subjects speak for themselves through quotes from their letters and diaries. In some cases, I summarized their routines from other sources. I want to thank the many biographers, journalists, and scholars whose work helped me. I have listed all my sources in the Notes section for those who want to read more."
7,"Howard became a palaeontologist because of a change in his family’s plans when he was six years old. His father, who was careful with money, said they could not go on holiday to Spain anymore because of rising interest rates. Instead, they rented a small house on the English coast. One rainy August afternoon, Howard found an ammonite on the beach. He had always wanted to be a palaeontologist, and by the end of university, he knew what kind he wanted to be. He was interested in the very early history of life, not in dinosaurs or the Jurassic period. He studied small creatures found in grey rocks.

When he finished his doctoral thesis, he worried about finding a job. He believed in himself and knew he had good potential, but he also knew that deserving a job does not always mean getting one. When a job opened at Tavistock College in London, he applied, but he did not expect much.

On the day of his interview, the professor who was supposed to lead the panel had a fight with his wife. He left home upset, crashed his car, and ended up in the hospital. The interview happened without him, and a colleague who did not like Howard’s professor took his place. This colleague helped Howard get the job, even though Howard did not know him. At first, Howard was grateful, but later he learned that it was not because of his skills. He felt a little disappointed but was mostly happy to have the job and do the work he loved.

Howard often thought about how organized his work life was compared to his personal life, which could be chaotic. Sometimes, unexpected things could change everything, like when someone stole his briefcase with his lecture notes at a train station. Angry, Howard went back to college, called to postpone his lecture, and reported the theft. He then went for coffee and met a colleague who was with a visitor from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. 

During this meeting, Howard learned about a new collection of fossils that needed to be studied. This could be a great opportunity for him. Because of the theft, he changed his plans. He decided not to go to a conference in Stockholm or take students on a trip to Scotland. Instead, he would find a way to visit the museum in Nairobi."
8,"Charles Spence is a professor at Oxford University in the UK, and he is very open to trying new foods. He even has ice cream made from bee larvae at home, which he says tastes a bit nutty and floral. Spence and his team are working on making bug-eating more acceptable. He studies how our senses work together to create the flavors we taste. This research affects what we eat and drink, from big food companies to fancy restaurants.

Spence's book, The Perfect Meal, co-written with Betina Piqueras-Fiszman, shares interesting facts about food. For example, did you know that the first person to order in a restaurant usually enjoys their meal the most? Also, we tend to eat about 35% more food when we are with one other person, and 75% more when we are with three people.

Spence's lab is simple and not very high-tech. It has soundproof booths and old audio-visual equipment. By keeping costs low, he can work with chefs who cannot pay for research. Much of his work is funded by a large food company. In the past, some people thought that research funded by companies was not real science. However, now it is important for universities to show that their work matters to people.

Spence is helping food brands reduce salt and sugar in their products. This is important for keeping customers healthy. Many companies make these changes slowly so that customers do not notice. Spence explains that when people know about the changes, they focus on the taste and often do not like it as much.

Spence met famous chef Heston Blumenthal while working on a project for a food company. They worked together to create a dish called ""Sound of the Sea,"" which uses sound to enhance the dining experience. Spence has found that different sounds can change how we taste food. For example, high-pitched music can make food taste sweeter, while lower sounds can make it taste bitter. Soon, an airline will match music with the food they serve.

At home, Spence has unique dinner parties. One time, they ate rabbit with the fur still on the cutlery. Another time, they used remote-controlled lights and tested different drinks with headphones. For Spence, home and food events are just extensions of his research."
9,"Our brains are working harder than ever. We are bombarded with facts, false information, and rumors that we need to sort through to find what is important. At the same time, we are doing more things ourselves. Thirty years ago, travel agents helped us book flights, and salespeople assisted us in stores. Now, we do most of these tasks on our own. We are trying to manage many responsibilities, like our jobs, families, hobbies, and favorite TV shows, often with the help of our smartphones. These devices encourage us to fill every free moment with activities.

However, there is a problem. We think we are multitasking, or doing many things at once, but this is a misleading idea. Earl Miller, a neuroscientist at MIT, explains that our brains are not good at multitasking. When we think we are multitasking, we are actually switching quickly between tasks. Each time we switch, it takes mental effort, which can make us less efficient. 

Multitasking can increase stress hormones in our bodies, leading to confusion and difficulty thinking clearly. It can also create a desire for constant stimulation, making it hard to focus. The part of our brain that helps us concentrate can easily be distracted by new things, like shiny objects that catch our attention. This means that the part of our brain we need to stay focused is often sidetracked.

Research shows that just the chance to multitask can hurt our ability to think clearly. Glenn Wilson, a psychologist, found that trying to focus on a task while seeing an unread email can lower our IQ by almost 10 points. This loss of focus is even worse than being tired. Russ Poldrack, another neuroscientist, discovered that learning while multitasking can send information to the wrong part of the brain. For example, if students do homework while watching TV, they may not remember the information as well.

Multitasking also involves making decisions, like whether to reply to a text message. Making many small decisions can tire our brains, making it harder to make good choices about important matters. Many business leaders and scientists agree that email is a big problem. It’s not that email itself is bad, but the huge amount of messages we receive can be overwhelming. One neuroscience colleague’s son said his father’s job is to “answer emails,” which is not far from the truth. We feel we must respond to emails, but it can be hard to do that and accomplish other tasks."
10,"In a zoo in Sweden, a chimpanzee named Santino spent his nights breaking concrete into pieces to throw at visitors during the day. Was he being mean? In caves in the US, female bats help other fruit bat mothers if they can’t find the right position to give birth. Are they being kind? Fifty years ago, people thought these questions were not important. Animals had behaviors that led to clear results, and scientists only studied those results. The idea that animals have thoughts, feelings, and morals was seen as silly. But this has started to change. Research on bats, chimps, rats, dolphins, and chickens has begun to explore animal emotions. This change has reached popular science books, like Mark Bekoff’s ""Wild Justice"" and Victoria Braithwaite’s ""Do Fish Feel Pain?"". This has started a debate that may never be fully answered: do animals have consciousness? This leads to another question about conscience, which is a person’s sense of right and wrong that guides their actions.

In a recent experiment with cows, researchers found that cows who opened a locked gate to get food showed more happiness by jumping and kicking than those who had the gate opened for them. If cows enjoy solving problems, what does this mean for how we raise and eat beef? While the observations are clear, people disagree on what they mean. Dr. Jonathan Balcombe, who wrote ""Second Nature,"" believes we should stop eating meat because of this new research. He thinks humanity is close to a big change in ethics, similar to when slavery was abolished. Aubrey Manning, a professor at Edinburgh University, believes we should rethink how we understand animal thinking. He thinks animals have a simpler understanding of the world than humans. Professor Euan MacPhail believes we should not project human feelings onto animals. These three views may never agree because the main issue is not just scientific or moral, but philosophical. Since it is very hard to define consciousness, can we ever really know what it is like to be a bat?

Balcombe describes an important experiment he did that suggests starlings, a type of bird, can feel depressed. In a study at Newcastle University, starlings were divided into two groups. One group lived in nice cages with plenty of space and water, while the other group lived in small, empty cages. Both groups learned to eat tasty worms from one box and avoid unpleasant worms from another. But when only unpleasant worms were offered, only the starlings in nice cages would eat. Balcombe concluded that living in a bad cage made the starlings feel negative about life. Balcombe, who has worked with animal rights groups, has a strong opinion. He says, “We look back with disgust at a time of racism. One day, our view of animals will be the same. We can’t support animal rights while eating a cheeseburger.” 

If Balcombe were the only one with this view, it might be easy to ignore him. But Professor Aubrey Manning shares similar ideas. Manning has written a textbook called ""An Introduction to Animal Behaviour."" He says, “What we are seeing is a swing in ideas. In the early 20th century, some people thought animals thought just like us, and then there was a reaction against that. Now we are moving back to the idea that animals have feelings. But this is a complicated topic, and we should be careful about listening to academics with strong personal opinions.”"
11,"Critical thinking is a way to understand what we read or hear more deeply. Adrian West, a research director at the Edward de Bono Foundation in the U.K., believes that arguing can help us find the truth. While technology helps us store and process information, there are worries that it also changes how we solve complex problems and makes it harder to think clearly. West points out that we are often surrounded by poor quality ideas and opinions, which can confuse our thinking. More information does not always mean better knowledge or decisions. 

According to the National Endowment for the Arts, fewer people are reading books, and this decline is getting faster. Patricia Greenfield, a psychology professor, thinks that focusing more on visual media, like videos and games, may hurt our critical thinking skills. She says that people are multitasking and not concentrating on one thing. However, we still do not know exactly how technology affects critical thinking. 

Technology can have both good and bad effects. For example, a computer game might help improve critical thinking, while browsing many links on the internet might distract us from deeper thinking. Greenfield has studied how technology changes the way we think. She believes that reading helps us think better and use our imagination, while visual media like video games and TV do not engage our imagination in the same way. However, she also found that some visual media can help with processing information quickly. 

Unfortunately, many young people may not reach their full potential because they do not spend enough time reflecting or analyzing information. How society views technology affects how we think about critical thinking. There is a debate about whether video games are good or bad for children. James Paul Gee, a professor of educational psychology, argues that video games can actually be good for learning. He says that games like Sim City and Civilization teach important skills like decision-making and analysis in a fun way. These games allow players to explore ideas that they might not be able to in real life. 

In today’s digital world, as reading and math scores go down, it is important to understand how technology affects our thinking and analysis."
12,"When Matthew Crawford is not writing about how we should live, he works as a motorcycle mechanic. He chose this job after he became unhappy with working in an office and for social policy organizations. His first book was about the good things about manual work. His latest book talks about how to deal with modern life. He got the idea for this book when he was shopping and saw advertisements on the credit card machine while he was entering his pin number. Crawford realized that it is becoming harder to avoid these distractions. What we want to think about at any moment is personal, but we often cannot choose this because of things we do not notice. It is getting more difficult to think or remember conversations. Because people want to avoid being interrupted, they often stop talking to strangers.

Crawford says we now experience the world through things like video games and phone apps, which often try to manipulate us. These things reflect our desires and can take over our attention. Many people are worried about this. For example, office workers complain about emails but still spend their free time checking them. Studies show that just seeing a phone can make it hard to focus. There is no clear evidence yet that our attention spans have changed, but people are more aware of other things they could be doing. Some think this problem is caused by technology, but Crawford believes technology has made it easier for us to focus on ourselves. With so many choices, it is hard to control our attention, which affects our social lives. People prefer to text friends instead of talking to them in person. Crawford argues that by only interacting with screens, we might lose important connections in society.

He gives an example from his gym. In the past, there was one music player for everyone, which could cause disagreements. Now, people listen to their own music with earbuds. This has made the gym less of a social place. Real connections often happen when people have different opinions and work through them together.

Crawford suggests two solutions. First, we need to reduce noise and distractions in public places. More importantly, he believes we should engage in skilled activities to connect with the world better. He mentions cooks, ice-hockey players, and motorcycle racers as examples of people who deal with real things. No video can replace the feeling of a hockey puck on ice or the gravel under a motorcycle. These activities require good judgment and the ability to interact with others.

Crawford says that when we engage with the real world, we see that manufactured experiences are not as fulfilling. This does not mean everyone should become a chef, but it is important to use our judgment. There are many benefits to this, including professional satisfaction. Constantly fighting distractions can be tiring and make it hard to focus on what is important. In contrast, paying attention to one thing can help us pay attention to other things too."
13,"Text: 

""What do you do for a living?"" This is a common question in small talk, and many people answer it with a few words about their jobs. But if you are a philosopher, like me, it can be a bit more complicated. Saying you are a philosopher can sound a bit showy. It is better to say you study or teach philosophy. Many people think that being a philosopher means you know some special truth, but that is not true. Philosophers are just like everyone else.

One reason people have this idea about philosophers is that they often judge what others do and celebrate thinking. The Greek philosopher Aristotle believed that a life spent thinking deeply was the best kind of life. While not all modern philosophers agree with him, philosophy is still seen as connected to deep thinking.

Another Greek philosopher, Socrates, said that ""the unexamined life is not worth living."" This means that just going along with what everyone else thinks is not satisfying. Our ability to think about the world helps us control our lives and make our own choices. However, living an examined life does not mean you have to read many difficult philosophical books. It just means paying attention to the everyday experiences that shape our lives.

Philosophy does not have to be about being away from society to think clearly. In fact, examining our lives can be very practical and should be shared with others because it is important for a good life. 

Another reason people misunderstand philosophers is that academic philosophy has become more separate from real life, especially for those who do not have formal training. This is not only the philosophers' fault; universities often focus on expensive journals and evaluations that make it hard for philosophers to share their ideas with the public. Because of this, philosophy can seem far away from everyday life.

Many philosophers used to challenge this view, but now some accept it. The academic world has created a situation where philosophers are isolated. As philosophy has become more focused on specific debates, it has become harder for people outside those areas to understand. In some cases, philosophy seems to have withdrawn from society.

I sometimes call myself an ""ethicist"" because I work in ethics, which is the part of philosophy that looks at human actions. Recently, I feel this title does not fully describe my work because ethics is often linked to formal rules and laws. There is a new area in philosophy called applied ethics, which looks at whether certain social practices are fair or not. 

The job of an ethicist today is to decide if an action is ""ethical"" or acceptable. These are important questions that I think about often. However, philosophy is more than just this. For example, a discussion might start by asking if illegally downloading movies is wrong (it is) and then move on to questions about responsibility, our views on art, and how consumerism affects us. 

In this way, philosophy helps people think more deeply about the actions and behaviors that shape their lives. Sometimes we might find out something we already knew; other times, we may realize our beliefs are hard to defend. By examining these ideas, we can do something good for everyone."
14,"Food lovers, chefs, and anyone who enjoys food might think that thinking about what and how we eat can make eating more enjoyable. However, in the past, discussions about food have often been used to talk about other ideas. When philosophers discuss eating, they usually use it as a way to explain something else, like gaining knowledge. Sometimes, conversations about food seem to be about food, but when we look closer, we see they are really about different ideas.

One interesting philosopher is Epicurus, who believed in seeking pleasure and avoiding pain in many areas of life. His name is now often connected with enjoying food and drink. You can see his name in restaurants, food shops, and recipe websites. These businesses likely hope to attract customers by linking their products to a famous philosopher.

Food is also a social and cultural experience. The food we eat comes from history and is shared with people in our communities. These communities help us grow and share food. We interact with food more than with any other product, making it a good topic for philosophical discussion.

When food is ready, critics start to talk and write about it. But why do they have such a special role? One philosopher pointed out that tasting food is not a special skill; food critics are just better at describing what food tastes like. This area has not been studied much, as most research on perception has focused on sight. This should change.

Another important part of food is its beauty. We often talk about art and music being beautiful, but we don’t usually talk about the taste of food in the same way. Some philosophers believe that, because of modern cooking, food deserves to be discussed as art, like sculpture or poetry. However, food is eaten and gone, while art can be enjoyed over time. This makes it hard to say that food is truly an art form.

There are also many ethical questions about food. We can ask what we should eat: organic, free-range, local, vegetarian, or non-genetically modified foods? Our answers often show our beliefs about what is right or wrong. Philosophers will always question why we choose what we do, and discussing these ideas about food is important.

Cooking at home and in restaurants can be very different. Home cooks have a special responsibility to their guests because of their personal relationships. In a home kitchen, everyone shares food and time together. In contrast, professional cooks work for their employers and focus on the food itself. Their kitchens are not open to everyone, and their relationships are more about work than friendship.

A recent essay called ""Diplomacy of the Dish"" looks at how food and dining can help connect different cultures. This happens in two ways: first, we learn to appreciate others by enjoying their food, and second, we build friendships with people from other cultures by eating together. This practice has a long history in international relations. The essay includes many interesting examples and stories that make this part of food philosophy come alive for readers."
15,"Rob Daviau is a game designer from the US who creates ‘legacy’ board games. He felt that the traditional board games he played as a child were not fun or challenging anymore, so he thought about how board games could change. He wondered if they could have a story and if choices made in one game could affect future games. 

He took a classic game called Risk and made a new version called Risk Legacy. In this game, decisions made during play have lasting effects. Players might have to tear up cards, change the game board, or open new packets with different rules at important moments. The game is played over several sessions, and players can hold grudges that affect the game. Daviau said, “You could point to the board and say: ‘Right here! You did this!’”

Later, he worked on a legacy version of Pandemic, a popular game where players work together to cure diseases. His next game was called SeaFall. While Pandemic Legacy was very successful, SeaFall was seen as a big test for the legacy format because it was a new game, not based on an earlier one. In SeaFall, players become sailors in the 16th to 19th centuries and explore a new world.

Designers of legacy games must think about all the choices players can make to keep the story interesting. To do this, they use play-testers to see how the game works. Jaime Barriga, a play-tester for SeaFall, said it takes a lot of time. Sometimes the game works well at first, but then it can break after a few rounds, and they have to fix it.

Legacy board games were not expected to become very popular. Daviau thought it would only appeal to a small group of people. He said, “I thought I would be known as the guy who did this weird project.” However, many players, like Russell Chapman, really liked the idea. He believes it is one of the biggest improvements in game design in years. He said, “It’s a new level of commitment, intensity, excitement.”

Another fan, Ben Hogg, said that the fun of a new adventure is more important than worrying about how long the game lasts. He mentioned that people don’t usually watch the same movie twice in a row; they want a new experience. Legacy games bring a storytelling aspect similar to video games.

Daviau originally wanted to be a television writer but ended up in advertising and game design. He still loves telling stories. Matt Leacock, the creator of Pandemic, compared making legacy games to writing a novel. He said you need to know how you want the story to start and end, but you also need more than just a basic plan.

Daviau is excited to see how others will use his idea, but he also thinks that gamers will soon want something new. Colby Dauch, the studio manager for SeaFall’s publisher, believes the legacy format has changed how people think about board games."
16,"One night not long ago, an octopus named Inky escaped from his tank at New Zealand’s National Aquarium. He crawled across the floor and squeezed into a small drain that led to the Pacific Ocean. This story was exciting and was shared a lot online. People enjoy stories like this because they like to think that animals are similar to us. Octopuses are especially interesting because they are very smart and look very different from humans. 

Octopuses can do amazing things like open jars, recognize faces, use coconut shells for protection, and even play games. Some scientists think that saying animals are like humans is not scientific. Dr. Frans de Waal, who studies animals like gorillas and chimpanzees, believes that we often ignore the human-like qualities of animals. He calls this ""anthropodenial."" He has studied animal intelligence for many years and found that animals can do many things that we thought only humans could do, like remembering the past and the future, showing empathy, and understanding what others want.

In the past, people believed that animals were smart enough to be put on trial for crimes. Even Charles Darwin, who changed how we see our place in the world, said that the difference between human and animal minds is just a matter of degree, not kind. However, in the twentieth century, many scientists started to see animals as simple machines that only respond to rewards and punishments. This view became popular at the same time that humans were harming animal habitats and not caring for animals properly.

Dr. de Waal thinks we are starting to change our views about animal intelligence. He believes that animals have their own ways of being smart, just like humans. For example, squirrels might not do well on human memory tests, but they can remember where they hide their food. In her book, The Soul of an Octopus, naturalist Sy Montgomery suggests that if an octopus tested human intelligence, it might judge us by how well we can change the colors of our skin. If we failed, it might think we are not very smart.

Dr. de Waal is not completely convinced that Inky really knew how to escape to the ocean. He knows that while some octopuses have escaped before, it might be too hopeful to think Inky planned his escape. However, he understands that stories like Inky's help people appreciate animal intelligence. He once did an experiment with capuchin monkeys to see if they could feel envy. When some monkeys got cucumbers and others got grapes, the ones with cucumbers became very upset. This study was published in a scientific journal, but a short video of the experiment made people really believe the findings. This shows how our understanding of animal minds is changing."

Robotics, once just a part of science fiction, is now changing our world in a big way. Robots have been used in car and factory work for many years, but experts say we are about to see robots used in many more areas. Many people think robots will take over most jobs done by humans in the next 50 years. However, about 80% of people believe their own jobs will still exist in the same way during that time. This shows that people feel their jobs are safe, but they might not be. Every industry will be affected by robots in the coming years.

For example, an Australian company called Fastbrick Robotics has created a robot named Hadrian X. This robot can lay 1,000 bricks in one hour, while two human workers would take a whole day or more to do the same job. Another example is a robot called Tally, made by a company in San Francisco. Tally moves around supermarkets to check if products are in the right place and priced correctly, instead of cleaning the aisles.

Supporters of robots say that robots cannot fix or program themselves yet, which means new jobs will be created for skilled workers like technicians and programmers. However, some people worry that we should not forget the importance of human skills at work. They believe society is not ready for the changes that will come when human interaction is less important.

Dr. Jing Bing Zhang, an expert in robotics, studies how robots are changing jobs. His recent report says that in two years, about one-third of robots will be smarter and able to work with other robots and humans safely. In three years, many big companies will have a chief robotics officer, and some governments will create laws about robots. In five years, salaries in the robotics field will go up by at least 60%, but many jobs will still be unfilled because there aren’t enough skilled workers.

Zhang believes that automation will affect lower-skilled workers the most. He advises them to retrain and learn new skills instead of waiting for the government to protect their jobs. He says that people cannot expect to do the same job for their whole lives anymore.

New technologies will also create new types of robots for homes, which will be more advanced than anything we have seen before. These robots will live with us and interact with us in new ways. This change offers great opportunities for companies, but it also brings challenges, like the need for new rules to keep us safe and protect our privacy.

With many jobs at risk and a global employment crisis approaching, it is important to focus on education. Developed countries need more graduates in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) to stay competitive in the future."
18,"Text: George Mallory, a famous mountaineer, once answered a reporter's question about why he wanted to climb Mount Everest by saying, ""Because it’s there."" This answer shows a common feeling: many people want to know why someone would take such a dangerous risk. Some might feel inspired by his answer to follow their own dreams. It suggests that climbing can be about adventure and fun.

In 1967, Bolivian writer Tejada-Flores wrote an important essay called ""Games that Climbers Play."" He described seven different climbing activities, from playing on small rocks to climbing high mountains, each with its own rules. He believed that the way climbers approach a climb depends on the rules of the specific activity. This idea has become popular in climbing discussions in the West, appearing in climbing magazines and conversations.

Many climbers love climbing because it gives them a sense of freedom. However, climbing can also feel very limiting. For example, being stuck in a tent during a storm is not what most people think of as freedom. This creates a contradiction in climbing. But some argue that having fewer choices can make life simpler, which can also feel like freedom.

When asked ""Why climb?"", US rock climber Joe Fitschen suggests a different question: ""Why do people climb?"" He believes that climbing is part of human nature. We like to take on challenges and test our limits, even if it is risky. The joy we find in climbing is more about our biology than just logical thinking.

US academic Brian Treanor also wrote about climbing, saying it can help develop important qualities like courage, humility, and respect for nature. He believes these qualities are especially important in today's world, which often avoids risks. Climbing can help us grow and live better lives outside of climbing.

Another idea is that climbers who do not depend on others or technology must be fully committed to succeed. Expert climbers Ebert and Robinson stirred some debate by saying that climbing alone is harder and deserves more recognition than climbing with a team or using tools like bottled oxygen. Some worry that this view might encourage climbers to take unnecessary risks.

We can also look at climbing from a different perspective. Many climbers talk about being ""in the moment"" or ""going with the flow."" The physical effort, the focus while climbing, and the instinctive problem-solving are all key parts of the experience. Some argue that climbing is similar to Zen philosophy, which teaches how to find peace of mind. This idea offers another reason why people are attracted to climbing."
19,"Over the last sixty years, the pianist Alfred Brendel became very important in classical music. He was a serious person who studied and recorded many famous European piano works. He wrote and performed a lot, but he did not teach many students. People who knew him saw a fun side to him, but he rarely showed it during his concerts. His life was a busy mix of studying, traveling, and performing.

About four or five years ago, a young boy named Kit Armstrong came to one of Brendel’s concerts and asked for lessons. At first, Brendel did not take this seriously. He had very few students and did not see a reason to start teaching now. He remembered a famous pianist saying, “You don’t hire a mountain guide to teach a child how to walk.” However, he was impressed by Kit, who was about 14 years old. When Brendel listened to Kit play, he thought, “I have to make time for him.” Kit played very well and from memory. He even gave Brendel a CD of his performance, which was beautiful and showed great skill.

As Brendel steps back from performing, Kit is starting to become more known. Kit, now 19, is always busy learning new languages, studying math, writing computer code, or playing tennis, all while his mother watches over him. He also composes music. Brendel believes this is important because writing music helps you learn to read it better. He noticed that Kit has an amazing memory and can read music very well. Kit listens carefully to his own playing and understands Brendel’s instructions. When Brendel tells him something about a piece of music, Kit can apply it throughout the entire piece.

Brendel is careful not to raise expectations for Kit. He gets upset when newspapers call Kit the next great pianist of the 21st century. He thinks this kind of attention can be harmful. Like many talented young musicians, Kit can play some pieces very well, but he still needs time and experience to improve in other areas. It would be unfair for critics to expect him to be perfect.

Now at 80 years old, Brendel is more relaxed in his retirement. He shares that when he was young, he did not want to be famous quickly, but he wanted to achieve certain goals by the age of 50. When he turned 50, he felt he had accomplished most of those goals but still wanted to do more. Although he cannot play as physically strong now, he still has many ideas and pieces in his mind that he has never played. He enjoys this new phase of his life."
20,"When I was a child, I thought gardens were beautiful places. My grandad’s garden was by a river and sloped gently down to the water. You couldn’t reach the river, but you could hear the water and the birds in the trees. I believed all gardens were like this – peaceful and quiet. 

Grandad’s garden was simple. He didn’t have a fancy greenhouse like some neighbors. Their greenhouses were made from old window frames, with plastic covering broken glass. At home, my father was often quiet. He had a sense of humor and liked to say things like, “It’s immaterial to me,” instead of just saying, “I don’t mind.” Deep down, he might have felt disappointed with his life. He left school without any qualifications and became a plumber, which he didn’t love. He wasn’t very ambitious, although he and my mother once thought about moving to Canada, but it didn’t happen. 

My father was good at fixing things around the house. He could build bookshelves or cupboards very well. My parents only moved house once, but my mother liked to change the furniture often. Just when you got used to one chair, another would appear. The biggest change was when a piano came into the house. I wanted to like it, but it seemed scary. I only liked the two brass candlesticks on it, but my mother said they were too fancy and they disappeared while I was at school. I was never allowed to play the piano; my sister took lessons instead. When I asked my mother why, she simply said, “You’d never have practiced.”

Of the places to explore – moors, woods, or the river – I always chose the river. I could imagine a different world there. With a fishing net over my shoulder and old sandals on my feet, I would walk along the riverbank looking for a good spot. I would take off my sandals and leave them with my picnic while I looked for fish to catch. After some failed attempts to keep the fish alive in the yard, I returned them to the water.

I wanted to leave school as soon as I could, but it seemed impossible until one day my father said, “There’s a job for an apprentice gardener in the Parks Department. I thought you might be interested.” In that moment, he surprised me. He might have preferred if I became a carpenter, but I like to think he saw my love for gardening. Even though he didn’t like gardening himself, he had watched me enjoy it and hoped I would succeed if I worked hard."
21,"Lawrence MacEwen is on his Scottish island, the Isle of Muck, and I am with him. A strong wind is blowing, and it feels like we might be blown off the cliff and into the ocean below. But Lawrence’s sheepdog, Tie, comes close, and Lawrence gently pets him. Despite the strong wind, Lawrence feels comfortable on his island.

Lawrence shows me around his neighborhood. He points to the north and shouts, “That island is Eigg. The one next to it is the Isle of Rum, which gets a lot more rain than we do.” I see dark clouds pouring rain on Rum’s big mountains. “Beyond Rum is the island of Soay,” he adds. 

Suddenly, Lawrence says, “I have sheep to move,” as rain starts to come our way. We walk down the hill, and he tells me more about the island: Muck is three kilometers long and one and a half kilometers wide; the geese here eat a lot of grass; and the MacEwen family has lived here for 3000 years. 

While herding the sheep, Tie is not doing a good job. Lawrence tells him, “Away to me,” which means to go to the right, but Tie goes straight through the flock, causing confusion. Lawrence sounds disappointed and says, “That will never do.” Tie looks ashamed.

The Isle of Muck is mostly run by the MacEwen family. Lawrence and his wife, Jenny, run the farm. Their son Colin manages the island cottages, and their daughter Mary runs the island hotel, Port Mor, with her husband, Toby. Mary and Toby enjoy that their two boys can explore the island and sail small boats in the summer. “They go out and come back only when they are hungry,” Mary says.

However, living on the island has its challenges. For example, electricity is not always available. On my first evening, I wait for the lights to come on. The next morning, I see Mary preparing breakfast with a flashlight. I also have no mobile phone service. Mary tells me, “You can get a signal on the hill, but most people stop using their phones after a couple of days.” So, I do the same.

Life on Muck is surprising. A boat arrives with groceries and three musicians who come to play a concert in the island’s tearoom. The islanders enjoy the music and tap their feet along. That night, while sitting by a warm fire as it rains outside, Lawrence tells me how he met Jenny. “Her father bought a small farm on the isle of Soay without even seeing it. He had never been to Scotland. Jenny was sent to manage it.” I ask if Jenny knew how to run a farm. Lawrence replies, “She had good typing skills.”

I go to bed listening to the rain and wake up to more rain. But I eat well, as most of the food comes from the island. Mary sends me to fisherman Sandy Mathers for fresh fish. I carry it back to Mary’s kitchen. By 7 pm, our fish is on the table, and it is delicious.

The next morning, I worry about my ferry ride to the next island. Many ferries had been canceled in the past two months because of rough seas. If my ferry does not come, I would be stuck on Muck for two more days, which secretly, I would not mind at all."
22,"The game design industry used to be mostly for computer scientists and self-taught individuals. It was often seen as just a hobby for young people, but now it is taken seriously. This change may surprise some, but experts in the industry are not surprised. However, getting into this field is not easy. Creating video games, especially those based on movies, requires many team members and a lot of skill and hard work.

Jim Donelly, a spokesperson for an online games magazine, says that it is hard to make progress in big companies or to influence major games. But the industry needs game designers more than ever. They need not only top-level directors but also people who can design systems and individual parts of games.

So, how can you enter this competitive industry? Many companies prefer candidates with a degree in computer science, but Jim believes that the best way is to make games. He says, ""You won’t get a job if you haven’t made something."" Game design is more than just a job; it is a way of life. You need to create to be successful.

Another expert, John Field, agrees that making games is important but says it is more complicated than it seems. Many people want to work in games, but few meet the industry's requirements. It takes creativity, technical skills, and the ability to adapt to changes in the industry.

Can you succeed on your own? John says it is possible but difficult. A good postgraduate course in games can help you and provide support. Most game designers start as programmers or artists and work their way up. They are interested in all types of entertainment and culture. They may have worked for a few years after graduation but realize that games are their passion. They are not just fans; they are excited about the future of games and understand the variety in this field.

Networking is also important. To succeed in games, like in many other areas, you need to make connections.

The old image of a young boy playing video games has changed. Now, games attract a wider audience, including families who play together on interactive consoles. Smartphones also offer many new games through apps and social media. John believes there is a lot of potential for growth in this area. Games are not just for fun; they can also be great tools for learning, and he sees many opportunities for the future."
23,"Since I was a child, I have always wanted to play football. My dad encouraged me to play, but he never forced me to do it, and I am thankful for that. I had a friend whose dad was very strict. He always told him, ""You can’t do this, you can’t do that."" My friend could have been a good player, but he lost interest in football and stopped playing. I am happy that I did not have the same experience. 

When I score a great goal from far away, some people say it is just luck, but it is not. I have practiced taking long shots since I was young. You can only score amazing goals by practicing. The best players in the world have natural talent, but they also practice for many years. Sometimes, I see young players bumping into each other, but I learned the right techniques. When I teach kids, I always tell them to enjoy learning new skills.

At school, I played many sports, like rounders, baseball, athletics, and basketball. I know now that a good education is important, but back then, football was all I thought about. The teachers were doing a good job, but I didn’t notice it at the time. I want my son to have a different experience. We are already trying to read him books, even though he is too young to sit still for long. I hope that when he kicks the books around, it doesn’t mean he will be like me.

At the start of my professional football career, the manager made sacrifices so that younger players like us could play for the first team. He never made a big deal about it, but we all knew we had to prove ourselves. I scored in the first game of the season, but we lost. A famous TV presenter said, ""You can’t win anything with kids."" This made us realize how much we needed to improve. Even though we had doubts, we believed in ourselves as a team.

I depend a lot on my close friends and family. Having money can sometimes create problems. For example, people ask me why I let my mother keep working. I have helped my parents with money. I paid off their house loan and bought them a car last Christmas. My family is strong, and they would not like to feel like they need my money. My mom is a hairdresser and loves her job, but I enjoy using my money to help them.

I have a lot of money, but not as much as people think. Money does not solve all my problems. After I stop playing football, I want to take a year off to do things I have not been able to do. I want to go skiing the day after I stop playing. I cannot do that now because if I break a leg while skiing and cannot play football again, I would not be insured."
24,"It was because of Sam Carter that we lived at Reef Point. Sam was my father’s agent in Los Angeles. He offered to help us find a cheap place to live because my father was having a hard time writing there. He couldn’t sell anything, and Sam was worried about losing his clients and money.

During the summer, the beach was empty because sea fogs often covered the sun. Reef Point didn’t get many visitors. The road to it was not very nice, and a nicer place called La Carmella was nearby. Most people chose to stay there if they had some money. Only those who were broke or loved surfing would come to Reef Point. But now, with the hot weather, many people were at the beach. After being almost alone for months, we were now surrounded by people and activities.

My father was busy every day trying to finish a script. He was stressed and not in a good mood. While he worked, I often went to the beach with a book and my dog, Rusty. When we first moved to Reef Point, we didn’t have a dog, but Rusty started to hang around. I tried to chase him away, but he always came back. One morning, I felt sorry for him and gave him some water. My father threw a boot at him, but he didn’t really mean it. Rusty knew this and came closer. I asked my father, “Who does he belong to? He thinks he belongs to us.” My father replied, “You’re wrong, Jane. He thinks we belong to him.”

Rusty loved the beach. He liked to dig and bring things to me. Sometimes he found things that didn’t belong to him, like a new sneaker or a bright beach towel, and I had to return them to their owners. He also loved to swim and always wanted to join me, even though I could swim faster and farther. Luckily, he never got discouraged.

That day, after swimming, my father went to Los Angeles to deliver his script. Rusty and I spent the afternoon together in the sea. As the sun began to set, it got cooler, and we watched the surfers. They had been surfing all day and didn’t seem to get tired. One surfer caught my attention. She was very good and made the others look clumsy. When she decided to stop, she rode in on a final wave.

“Hi,” she said. “Why didn’t you join us?” 
“I don’t have a surfboard.” 
“You could get one.” 
“I don’t have any money.” 
“You’re British, right? Are you visiting?” 
“No, I live here.” 
“Is your father American?” 
“No. He came here to write a film script based on a novel he wrote.” 
“Really? Have I heard of him? What’s his name?” 
“Rufus Marsh.” 
“You mean, Tall as the Morning?” I nodded. 
“I read that book from start to finish.” 

She looked at me with new interest. I realized that people were friendly but only showed interest when I mentioned Tall as the Morning."
25,"Violet Hetherington was feeling worried as she stood in a long line at the dock in Southampton. She remembered her friend Annie's advice: ""It's better to arrive late at the docks. If you come too early, you will just wait around."" Annie was experienced in traveling, but this time her advice was not helpful. 

After some time, an announcement came over the loudspeakers saying there was a problem with the computer system. The mood among the waiting passengers became tense. Many had paid a lot of money for this cruise, and they were unhappy about the delays. Violet started to feel like she had made a mistake by coming on this trip. 

When she checked her bag, she realized her phone was missing. This was more frustrating than the long wait. Without her phone, she couldn’t call the taxi company to see if she had left it in the taxi. All her important numbers were saved on her phone. 

Behind her in the line, there was a friendly couple. Violet asked them if she could use their phone to call her son Harry. She left a message for him to ask their neighbor, Kristina, to check if her phone was at home. If it wasn’t, she would have trouble finding the numbers she needed in New York. Part of her felt relieved, but she didn’t tell Harry that. He often thought he was wiser than her, while her younger son, Daniel, was more understanding of her mistakes.

Finally, the line started to move, and Violet handed over her travel documents to board the ship. When she entered the ship, she felt disappointed. The inside looked like a cheap hotel with shiny fake wood, big chandeliers, and busy carpets. 

She followed the signs to the elevators, which were crowded with tired passengers. As the elevator moved up, it stopped at each floor to let people out. When she finally reached the twelfth floor, she was happy to find her room had the balcony she had wanted. She had worried about what to say if it didn’t. Ignoring Annie’s advice to wait for a better deal, she had decided to pay more to make sure she had a nice view of the sea."
26,"When John Maloof bought a box of old photo negatives at an auction, he did not know he was starting to uncover the mystery of Vivian Maier. Maloof wanted pictures for a book about the Portage Park neighborhood in Chicago, but he found 30,000 images taken by Maier, a street photographer with a great talent for capturing interesting moments. Since then, Maloof has collected many items related to Maier’s life and work. In his home, he keeps her cameras, 2,000 rolls of film, 3,000 prints, and 100,000 negatives, along with many 8mm movies and audiotapes.

One morning, Maloof looked around at all this and felt he was close to something special, which happened by chance. “When I bought all this, I had no idea what it was,” he said. “I could have easily sold it all to someone else.” For a while, Maloof and his friend Anthony Rydzon have been trying to learn more about Maier’s life. They spoke to families who had hired her as a nanny and talked to people at the shop where she developed her film.

Maier was born in 1926 in New York and spent much of her childhood in France. In 1951, she returned to New York and moved to Chicago in 1956 to work as a nanny. Maier was a private person and had a unique style. She often wore large coats, wide-brimmed hats, and sturdy shoes. “On her day off, she would have her camera around her neck and we wouldn’t see her again until late at night,” said Maren Baylaender, whose husband employed Maier to care for his daughter. “She was private but had strong opinions about movies and politics.”

Maier knew a lot about theater and movies. Even though she was not very social, she walked the streets with her camera and sometimes interviewed people on audiotape. She seemed to be very dedicated to her “second job” of documenting the world around her. “She was a true artist who followed her dreams,” said Rydzon. “Nothing stopped her.”

Maier’s work is pure art; she did not create it for money. Her photos often show women, children, the elderly, the poor, and abstract scenes. “What is interesting about Vivian is that she has so many amazing pictures,” said photography expert Larry Silverman. He sees influences from other photographers in her work and wonders if she developed her own style or borrowed ideas from others.

Maloof often thinks about whether he will ever go through all the negatives he has stored in three tall, fireproof cabinets. The funny thing is that he was not really interested in photography until he found Maier’s work. Inspired by her photos, Maloof started taking his own pictures. “As I learned more about photography and looked at her work again, I realized that the cityscapes were not what mattered to her. It was the people and the street scenes,” he said. “There was so much more to her work than I thought, and I realized I had something very important. Now our goal is to share her name and get Vivian Maier into the history books.”"
27,"When a novel is called ambitious, it often means it has not completely succeeded. However, this is not the case with Eleanor Catton’s book, The Luminaries. I interviewed her in the UK when her book was very popular, but she seemed calm, especially for someone in her twenties. She had just arrived from Germany and was going back to New Zealand the next day. 

Eleanor shared a story about being stopped at passport control and asked to prove she was a writer. She pressed her novel against the glass. The official looked at it and asked, “What’s it about?” This is not an easy question for an author. 

The Luminaries takes place in New Zealand during the 1860s. A series of crimes have happened, and a group of 12 men has come together to solve them. The story becomes very complex. Catton wanted to write a murder mystery, not a historical novel, but she found that the past gave her characters many chances for complications and misunderstandings. The book is over 800 pages long because she wanted to give each of the 20 main characters a good chance to shine.

When I asked her how it feels to be so successful at a young age, she said it feels nice to come from a small country because everyone feels part of her success. She received a lot of support from people back home. However, she finds it annoying when people think her book is not serious or philosophical.

Catton explained that she wanted to write the book in the shape of a spiral, where each part is half the length of the one before it. This makes the story speed up as it goes along. I asked if it matters if readers notice these patterns. She said she wanted to create a book with interesting structures that readers could notice if they wanted to.

Even with its unique structure, The Luminaries is still an exciting murder mystery with a gripping plot. Surprisingly, she did not plan the story in advance. She would write herself into difficult situations and then see how creatively she could get out of them. One of her goals was to make the book enjoyable for readers.

We also talked about her love for TV dramas, which often have cliff-hangers and different points of view. I asked if she would be interested in writing for television. She said that could be fun. 

Eleanor spoke with excitement about her work and New Zealand. She noticed that being in a different place changes her imagination. She understands why writers leave New Zealand for busier areas to be around more people. But for now, New Zealand will still be her home. I hope it continues to inspire her for many more novels."
28,"As a boy, Jonny Kinkead spent his time either making things in his dad’s garage or playing the guitar. For the last forty years, he has been building acoustic guitars by hand. He says, “I am still amazed by the guitar. How can two pieces of wood make such a beautiful sound? Different types of wood create different sounds, and it still surprises me.”

Jonny learned to play his brother’s guitar when he was eleven. At sixteen, he wanted to learn the bass guitar. Instead of saving money for one, he decided to make it himself. He studied how different shapes and types of wood changed the sound of the guitar. Jonny had already built model boats and planes with his brothers, so he was used to making things. His father taught them how to use tools, and Jonny had also repaired instruments for his friends.

Jonny’s first bass guitar turned out well, but he didn’t think about making guitars as a career at that time. He was also interested in painting and sculpture. After finishing school, he went to university to study architecture because it involved design. However, halfway through the course, he dropped out because he felt it wasn’t right for him. He realized that building guitars was like making sculptures, but with sound. He thought it would be a more practical career than pure art because people actually use the guitars.

Since then, Jonny has made guitars for a living. For the first ten years, he also cleaned windows part-time to earn extra money. He sold his first guitars for just the cost of materials, but as he became known as a good guitar-maker, he could charge more. Even now, after almost forty years, he says he is “still scratching a living.” He can only make about ten guitars a year, which limits his income.

In the beginning, Jonny worked hard to get known. He went to music festivals on weekends to let musicians try his guitars and talk about him. He also had to learn how to price his guitars because he didn’t think about money much. Jonny believes it is easier for new guitar-makers today in the UK. When he started, many people thought only American-made acoustic guitars were good. But now, UK-made guitars have a good reputation.

Jonny thinks new guitar-makers should take courses to learn valuable skills. However, he also believes that learning by trying and making mistakes is very important. He says, “You should look at other instruments, see what works and what doesn’t, and try different things. If you make the back of the guitar too thin or too thick, it won’t sound good. If you learn from someone else, you might only learn one way, but if you teach yourself, you learn everything.”"
29,"When we talk about English conversation, we often start with the weather. This is a common tradition, and many writers mention a famous quote from Dr. Johnson, an English writer from the 1700s, who said, ""When two Englishmen meet, their first talk is of the weather."" This is still true today. 

Many people try to explain why the English talk about the weather so much, but they often get it wrong. They think that English people are really interested in the weather itself. For example, the American writer Bill Bryson says that English weather is not very interesting. He points out that in England, we don’t have extreme weather like tornadoes or big storms, which makes it less exciting.

However, another writer, Jeremy Paxman, disagrees with Bryson. He believes that English weather is interesting because it is always changing. He says that even if we don’t have big storms, living near the ocean means we can never be sure what the weather will be like.

I think both Bryson and Paxman miss the real reason why we talk about the weather. Our conversations about the weather are not really about the weather. Instead, they are a way for English people to connect and start talking to each other. For example, when someone says, ""Nice day, isn’t it?"" or ""Ooh, isn’t it cold?"" they are not really asking about the weather. These phrases are just ways to greet someone or to keep a conversation going.

Talking about the weather is like a social tool for English people. There are specific situations when we use weather talk. Some people say that English people talk about the weather all the time, but that’s not true. We usually talk about the weather in three situations: as a greeting, to start a conversation, or to fill a pause when there is silence. 

Because we use weather talk so often, it may seem like we are obsessed with it. An English conversation might start with a weather greeting, then move to more weather talk, and return to it again when there is a pause. This is why people from other countries think that English people only talk about the weather."
30,"Alice Leader was standing in front of Hadrian’s Wall in Britain. She was trying to explain to her class of 12- and 13-year-olds how amazing it was that the Romans built a wall that is 120 km long and 5 meters high about 1900 years ago. The students were interested in this trip, even though they could have chosen to go to Spain, Greece, or France. They wanted to know why the wall was built, but Alice felt she did not have good answers. 

When she could not find a good historical novel about life at the Wall during Roman times, she decided to write one herself. After teaching for 31 years, Alice started her new career as a writer in 2001. She felt nervous but excited about this big change. She said, “Teaching is like acting; it’s a performance every day and very tiring. Writing is exciting and a bit scary, but it is not as exhausting.” Alice’s former teaching colleagues were jealous because she still connects with children through her stories.

Alice wants her novels to fill a gap in children’s fiction. She noticed that many books for teenagers focus on negative experiences or are completely fantasy, like Harry Potter. She wants her books to be different. Alice always taught English and History together, using stories like the Tale of Troy to make lessons interesting. She loves the moment when a child goes from being bored to being interested. “I enjoy having bored children because it challenges me to make them engaged,” she said.

Alice started writing her first novel because she saw a need for it, but she was also inspired by the idea of her two sons leaving home. Her head teacher suggested she take a creative writing course, which surprised her. “I had been teaching for 25 years, and I didn’t want to spend my summer on a course I thought was unnecessary.” Before she could join the course, she had to send in a piece of her writing. Just a few days before leaving, she quickly wrote a story about a Roman couple and their baby. After three hours and 30 pages, she sent it in and was accepted.

During the course, other students read her story and gave her great feedback, encouraging her to publish it. With only her report cards as proof of her writing skills, she asked her head teacher for a year off to write her first novel. Alice’s husband, Zachary Leader, is a critic and editor, and his help was very important for her writing. She said, “My mother-in-law thinks we are rival authors, but I believe we work well together. He helps me improve my writing, while I like to add more scenes.” This is the difference between a fiction writer and an editor."
31,"To raise money for charity, a newspaper and a TV company asked brothers Jonny and Alistair Brownlee, who are champion triathletes, to join a special race. This race would have Jonny racing in a car on the roads, while Alistair would race on a mountain bike across the countryside. They would race to the same finish line in the beautiful Yorkshire Dales in northern England.

“I’m excited for this,” Jonny said at the start line. “I’ve never done anything like this before! The views are beautiful, and it’s very cold, so I can stay warm in the car.” Alistair, dressed in warm cycling clothes, was also eager. “Honestly, I’ve seen Jonny drive before, so I’m not sure he will make it. I might stop for tea halfway!” 

The race began at Semerwater lake and would finish at Fleet Moss, Yorkshire’s highest road, which is 350 meters up. This would be easy for Jonny in the car, but Alistair had to climb a steep hill right away. They quickly shook hands and started the race. Alistair rode off on his bike, while Jonny got into his car and drove away. The big question was: who would reach the finish line first?

Jonny’s confidence quickly faded. Just 15 seconds into his drive, he had to stop for a big tractor on the road. “Welcome to Yorkshire,” he said to the cameraman. “If Alistair beats me, it’s because of this farmer!” After getting past the tractor, Jonny continued driving. Meanwhile, Alistair was struggling with the steep hill. He had to get off his bike and carry it up the hill, while sheep watched him curiously. Finally, he reached the top and was ready to speed down the other side.

In the car, Jonny faced more challenges. The roads in Yorkshire are old and narrow. He had to slow down to get around a tight corner and drive through a small stream on the road. Once he was clear of the last village, he raced straight to the finish line. Neither brother knew how close they were to each other.

As Jonny drove fast towards Fleet Moss, Alistair was racing across his last field and back onto the road. He pushed hard and then suddenly had to brake as he reached the finish line. Alistair looked up and asked the crowd, “Is he here?” When they said no, he raised his arms in celebration. “Yes!” 

A few minutes later, Jonny arrived in his car. “Well done,” he said to Alistair, feeling disappointed. “I’m really upset.”"
32,"The silence is what you notice when you play on Centre Court at Wimbledon. You bounce the ball quietly on the soft grass, toss it up to serve, and hit it, hearing only the echo of your own shots. The well-kept grass, the history, the old stadium, the players in white, and the respectful crowd all create a calm atmosphere. This silence helps me focus on my game. 

In a tennis match, my biggest challenge is to ignore everything except the game and the point I am playing. When a point ends, the silence breaks with applause, cheers, and people shouting my name. I hear them, but it feels distant. I don’t think about the fifteen thousand people watching me closely or the millions watching around the world as I play Roger Federer in the 2008 Wimbledon final, the most important match of my life.

I had always dreamed of playing at Wimbledon. My uncle Toni, my coach, taught me from a young age that this was the biggest tournament. By the time I was 14, I was sharing my dream with friends that I would play there one day and win. Before 2008, I had played and lost to Federer twice in the finals. Losing in 2006 was not too hard; I was just happy to have made it that far. But losing in 2007 was very difficult. I knew I could have played better, and it hurt more because I had a chance to win. I cried for half an hour after that match. 

Toni, who usually criticizes me even when I win, surprised me by saying there was no reason to cry and that there would be more chances at Wimbledon. I told him he didn’t understand; I felt it might be my last chance to win. I know that a professional athlete's career is short, and I want to make the most of it. Every moment is important, but some moments are more important than others, and I had missed a big one in 2007.

However, Toni was right in the end. Another chance came in 2008, just one year later. I felt confident that I had learned from my past defeat. The best sign that I was ready was my strong belief that I would win. The night before the final, at dinner with my family and team, we didn’t talk about the match. I didn’t tell them to avoid the topic, but they understood that I was already focused on the game in my mind. From that moment until the match started, that focus was mine alone."
33,"In early April 1957, a young Englishwoman named Jane Goodall arrived in Africa. In her first letter home, she wrote, ""I am living in the Africa I have always longed for."" Jane spent most of her life in Africa and became known as a citizen, journalist, scientist, activist, and environmentalist. 

In 1963, Jane became famous when Britain’s National Geographical Society published articles and made documentaries about her research on chimpanzees. She also wrote popular books, including award-winning children’s books and the bestseller ""In the Shadow of Man,"" which has been translated into 47 languages and is still available today. Jane Goodall is one of the most celebrated female scientists of the 20th century, second only to Marie Curie. However, her fame sometimes overshadows her real achievements.

Many articles and interviews tell her life story, but they often focus on her personal life rather than her work. People see her as a girl who loved adventure, a woman who wanted to be with wild animals, or a feminist in a man's world. These views do not fully show what she has accomplished. 

Jane Goodall should be recognized as a leading scientist in her field because of her important research and the many students she has taught who have become influential in biology. Her main achievement is that she helped us understand the social and emotional lives of chimpanzees. Before her work, people thought wild chimpanzees were very dangerous, and they did not know that chimpanzees ate meat or used tools. They also did not realize that chimpanzees have emotions similar to humans and that their social lives are like ours. 

Jane's book, ""The Chimpanzees of Gombe,"" published in 1986, is the most important work on chimpanzee research. Her long study of wild chimpanzees in Gombe State, Nigeria, is considered one of the great scientific achievements of the Western world. Jane Goodall changed how we study animals and how we think about ourselves as humans.

Even as a child, Jane showed signs of becoming a biologist. When she was five years old, she disappeared one autumn day. The police and her family searched for her. After a long search, she came back with straw in her hair and clothes. When her mother asked where she had been, Jane explained that she wanted to know how hens lay eggs. To find out, she had hidden in a henhouse for five hours until a hen laid an egg. This moment can be seen as the start of her journey as a biologist."
34,"During our first hour-long conversation, Shirley Ford talks to me using the voice of a funny 8-year-old boy, the boy’s tired mother, an amusing old Scottish woman, and a very fast-talking alien. Her voices are familiar to people who watch children’s TV and cartoons, and to those who have seen computer programs about health and safety. “I just did a voiceover about back injuries,” she says, “so I had to learn how to say many medical terms quickly.” 

Shirley explains what it takes to do voiceovers. “Many actors, even famous ones, think they can do funny voices, and many probably can,” she says. “But there is more to it. You have to bring the script to life for an audience that can’t see you. You wouldn’t believe how many well-known people want to do voiceover work. Producers invite them to auditions, but often they don’t get the roles because they are used to acting with their whole bodies.”

After school, Shirley joined a drama course, hoping for a regular acting career. During the course, she did some work singing jingles for TV ads. “One day,” she says, “the man who ran the recording studio suggested I try out for the voice of a rabbit in a cartoon. It seemed silly – I didn’t study drama to play rabbits – but I tried it for fun and, surprisingly, got a big part.” Shirley discovered she could do voices and that voiceover work might be her path. “Things just happened for me,” she says. “In my second film, I was lucky to play the main character – and her brother and mother.”

Adult female actors often provide the voices for small boys and girls because their voices are lighter than male actors. There are complicated rules for hiring child performers, which production companies prefer to avoid. Shirley has learned to create different sounds and collects new voices by watching children’s TV. Cartoons are the best part of her job, which also includes educational videos and vacuum cleaner ads. “Those are tough because you have to sound excited about something you don’t care about, but my years in this job help,” she says. “I’ve learned that the trick is to smile while you talk – it makes your voice sound happy. When I work on animation, it feels like a holiday; interacting with other actors is great.”

The competition for work is strong, and a good showreel – a recording that shows what the artist can do – is very important. “It’s worth investing in a strong showreel,” Shirley says. “There are agencies that help voiceover artists create them.” She believes she has reached the top of her profession through hard work as much as talent. “Whether it’s making your showreel and showing it to film and TV companies, advertising agencies, and recording studios, or just practicing your voices, it’s all about setting goals and not giving up.”

For anyone thinking about a career in voiceovers, Shirley suggests attending “specialist workshops – they teach all types of voiceover.” She also thinks a love for human sound is very important. She describes herself as obsessed with voices and becoming the characters she plays. “If I’ve been in the studio doing a specific American voice, for example, it can take over me, and I’ll speak like that for hours or even days,” she says. “My children have grown up hearing their mom talk in many different voices.”"
35,"People often ask me how I became a cartoonist. This makes sense because cartooning is a job many kids dream about, like being a race car driver. However, most people give up these dreams and choose more practical jobs, like being a tax lawyer or making car parts. It seems silly to think you can make a living by drawing simple pictures, but some people do.

Not everyone becomes a cartoonist in the same way, but most have wanted to do it for a long time. For me, I had a typical childhood for a cartoonist. I loved comic strips, contributed to school publications, and was known as ""the kid who draws."" I studied graphic design in college and after graduating, I showed my illustrations to different companies. I was lucky to find a newspaper that needed political cartoons about local issues. I created some ideas, and they bought them. Soon, I was making enough money to support myself.

You don’t need much to become a cartoonist. You don’t need a university degree, a lot of money, or even to be a great artist. You just need your brain, your hand, and something to draw with. But if it were that easy, there would be many more cartoonists than teachers. The barriers to becoming a cartoonist are low, but it is still a hard job. You should only try to be a cartoonist if you feel you cannot do anything else. It is much easier to get a regular job that pays the bills and gives you time for family and hobbies.

The more skills you have, the better chance you have to make a living with your art. I have done political cartoons, comic strips, and comic books. I have also been a writer, a caricaturist, and sometimes a designer. I take on all kinds of work because you can learn a lot, even from jobs you don’t really want to do. It helps to be smart, well-read, and curious about the world.

Now, let’s talk about the business side of being a cartoonist. In the past, many cartoonists could find regular jobs with different newspapers and magazines. But now, most cartoonists have to be entrepreneurs. This means you not only create the work but also sell it. If you are comfortable with this, you will do better. I have seen cartoonists with average creativity but great business skills succeed more than those who are very talented but lack other skills.

It surprises me how often I meet people who have never sold a cartoon but are afraid someone will steal their ideas. Some are so worried that they won’t even let others see their work! Legally, to protect your work, you just need to draw a small ‘c’ for ‘copyright,’ put a circle around it, and write your name and the date next to it. But honestly, it is more likely that no one will be interested in your work. If someone does steal a cartoon and it becomes popular online, it is not a disaster – it could actually be a lucky break!"
36,"Twenty years ago, I was moving to a new house and cleaning out my things. I decided to throw away an electric guitar that my dad had given me for my 16th birthday. It was a nice, black guitar from Japan. I usually don’t like to throw things away, so I was surprised that I wanted to get rid of it. I took it to the dump and was about to leave it there when a young man came up to me, looking confused. He asked, “You’re not going to throw that away, are you?” I told him I was, and I started to feel regret. He asked if he could have it, and I said yes. After that, I felt sad about my decision for a long time.

A few months ago, I received an email that changed everything. I remembered a story about a man who lost his wedding ring in the ocean and found it years later in a fish he was eating. That’s how I felt when I opened the email from a man named Keith Rushton, who restores guitars. He told me, “I have your electric guitar.” It had been sold many times since I gave it away. Keith found my name on a label on the guitar and used it to find me online. He contacted me through the newspaper I work for and offered to sell it back to me. I was so happy I almost cried. His price was very fair.

I remembered how my dad always put name labels on my things, including my guitar. My parents wanted me to learn classical guitar because it was popular in the 1970s. I loved the sound of it; it was calming and gentle. But I didn’t make much progress, so I switched to electric guitar, playing easier songs. At that time, punk music was also popular, and anyone could be a rock star, even if they weren’t great at playing.

When I opened the box that Keith sent me and took out my old guitar, I suddenly remembered my birthday in 1978 when my parents gave it to me. Holding it again felt amazing. It was smooth and smaller than I remembered. I sat down to play, but then I wanted to stand up and put the strap over my shoulder because that’s how you play electric guitar. My fingers remembered where to go. I couldn’t explain the chords, but my hands just knew what to do. My fingers felt the familiar pain of pressing the strings to play.

Electric guitars are usually played in a band. Now that I’m learning again, I think I should form a band. My son is learning the saxophone, so maybe we can play together. Or maybe I can find other people my age who have had a similar experience. We could call ourselves “The Regainers!”"
37,"There has been a lot of discussion about sleep recently. When I wrote my book called Insomniac, which is about people who cannot sleep, I felt like I was the only one talking about the dangers of not getting enough sleep. Lack of sleep can affect our minds, bodies, and feelings. Many people who have trouble sleeping understand how important sleep is. It is good that sleep is finally getting more attention. 

But what about dreams? I haven’t heard much about them. We often forget our dreams. When you wake up early because of an alarm, you miss out on the last hour or two of sleep, which is mostly REM sleep, the stage where we have the most dreams. The best and most memorable dreams happen during REM sleep, especially just before we wake up. A good sleeper spends about a quarter of their sleep time in REM. If someone lives to be 90 years old, they will spend about six or seven years in REM sleep. When researchers take away REM sleep from people, they find that the next night, those people have more REM sleep to make up for it. This shows that dreams are important.

In 1953, researchers found REM sleep, and many agreed with psychologist Sigmund Freud, who said that understanding dreams could help us understand our minds. However, later studies showed that it is not that simple. Now, researchers focus more on the physical reasons for dreams rather than the psychological ones. According to Robert Stickgold, a sleep scientist at Harvard University, there is not much agreement among dream researchers.

Dreams are important. At a meeting of sleep experts, P.F. Pagel from the University of Colorado Medical School shared a study. He found that actors, writers, and directors remember and use their dreams better than others. He believes that people who are more interested in being creative use their dreams more. It makes sense that filmmakers have a strong connection to their dreams because films are very dream-like.

But I wondered if only creative people benefit from their dreams. Don’t teachers, software designers, and politicians also need to think creatively? Stickgold says that dreams help us connect ideas in new and surprising ways, using knowledge from the past and present. Dreams can help us find new patterns and create ideas that break our usual ways of thinking. For example, Stickgold found that when people are woken from REM sleep and asked to respond to a word, their answers are more original than when they are woken from other sleep stages. They come up with unexpected ideas that make sense in a different way. This is what creativity is.

I find that I write better after having intense dreams. Even a bad dream or one I can barely remember seems to help me think better. On those days, my ideas come out quickly, and I can hardly keep up with my typing. I don’t know how it works, but it does help. 

Creativity is not just for writers or artists. We live in a complicated world, and everyone needs to think clearly. We need to be creative and flexible in our relationships with coworkers, family, and friends. This is why dreaming is important."
38,"Twenty years ago, Susie Ray left London to live in a small coastal town in south-west England. When you enter her studio, you see a beautiful view of the sea and many empty frames on the walls, along with happy photos of her two daughters. Susie is a well-known copyist artist. She can create copies of famous paintings from the early 20th century and the 16th century very well. She says, “I don’t keep my own paintings. As soon as I finish them, they go.” 

Susie is very popular and has worked as a copyist artist for 30 years. She has painted many famous artists' works, like Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh. Her copies are so good that art experts sometimes think they are the originals. While the original paintings can sell for millions of pounds, her copies sell for a few hundred pounds to £12,000, depending on how long she spends on them. 

Susie does not reveal the names of most of her clients, but they include galleries and private collectors. Some collectors love art, but others want to show off their collection. One famous buyer likes to say he owns a ‘Van Gogh’ painting, but it is really a ‘Susie Ray Van Gogh’. Susie knows that some collectors keep the original painting in a bank and show her copy at home. 

She is honest about her work. When she copies a famous painting, she tries to make it look as real as possible because she wants to respect the original artist. However, she puts her signature on the back of the canvas. It is illegal to sell a copy as the real painting, and even though some people make money that way, Susie has never wanted to do that. She knows that people who make fake art often get into trouble. 

Susie is not rich and has faced challenges, but her life is more stable now. She believes it is not worth risking her good name with collectors and artists. Before becoming a copyist, she worked as an illustrator for a botanical garden after finishing her art degree. She earned very little money, but it helped her learn important skills and gave her a love for plants. She had to be very precise and get things right the first time. She has no regrets about that time, but she is happy to have found a more rewarding job.

When younger artists ask Susie for advice, she tells them to learn to draw well and represent things accurately. She has studied a lot to do her work. She can draw plants and make perfect copies of 15th-century paintings, but she now focuses on French impressionists like Manet, Cezanne, and Degas. 

Susie believes that many people think modern art is easy, but she explains that impressionists painted quickly and freely, yet they were also very careful. This combination is hard to achieve. Some people wonder why Susie does not create her own art. They ask if her original paintings could sell for more than her copies. Susie explains that her work comes from years of training, and she earns a good living from it. 

She has tried to create her own art, like oil paintings of fishing nets, but they looked too much like photographs. She thinks it is like living on simple food after enjoying meals from a great chef. Susie is a perfectionist in her work."
39,"During her racing days, Ellen MacArthur cared most about the sea and being the fastest on it. Since she was a child, sailing was her big passion. She felt a strong connection with her boats, which took her around the world. When she returned to land, everyday life felt unimportant. People wanted to know about her races, but she just wanted to be back on the ocean, challenging nature, even in places that had almost defeated her.

After finishing second in the Vendée Globe, a solo round-the-world race, she showed me her small boat, Kingfisher. She took me into the tiny cabin where she lived and worked for 94 days. She explained how she carefully planned everything, even counting how many rolls of kitchen paper she would need. Preparation was very important to her. She proudly showed me her simple food supplies, a small gas stove, and medical items. She took great care of her boat because her life depended on it.

Now, Ellen sees the world like a boat: small, beautiful, and fragile, with limited resources. A key moment for her was a trip to South Georgia, a lonely island in the South Atlantic, where she helped with a bird survey. This experience made her think differently about the world. She noticed many abandoned whaling stations and felt it was a warning about how we take resources without caring for the future.

When I visited Ellen's office, she was finishing a busy call. She explained why we need to act now to protect the planet. She said that coal, oil, and gas are limited resources that we cannot replace. At first, her message was to use less, but she later realized there was a better way to think about it. Now, she talks about re-using things, like industrial carpet tiles.

For the past three years, she has been visiting factories and power stations, discussing our dependence on resources that cannot be renewed. She says, ""I will never be an expert, but I love learning."" She felt she could not ignore the current situation. Compared to sailing, which felt selfish, this work is about finding how she can help the most. 

Ellen also started the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a charity that helps young people think about and create a sustainable future. She admits she misses the adventure of being at sea, as it is a big part of who she is. At sea, she felt connected to everything and focused on survival. She knows her new message is not as simple as saying, ""I want to be the fastest around the world."" Although she was once the fastest, this new work is even more important to her."
40,"Jordan Romero is 13 years old and wants to be the youngest person to climb Mount Everest. If he succeeds, he could become very famous. He hopes to inspire other kids to go outside and explore nature instead of just playing on computers and video games. Jordan's climbing team includes his father, Paul, and his mother, Karen. They call themselves ""Team Romero."" Climbing Everest is just one of their goals. If Jordan climbs Everest and Vinson Massif in Antarctica, he will be the youngest person to climb the Seven Summits, which are the highest mountains on each continent. Very few people do this before they turn thirty. Jordan has already climbed five of these mountains and might finish before he is a teenager.

Many experienced climbers think it is not a good idea to take a 13-year-old up Mount Everest. They believe that while Jordan may be strong enough physically, he might not be emotionally ready. They also worry that he may not have enough experience to make safe decisions while climbing. Paul and Karen have heard these concerns before. Paul says, ""I know people criticize us, but we have to keep going. We think about the risks, but we believe our experience will help. Watching Jordan grow stronger gives me confidence.""

I wonder if Jordan is doing this because his father wants him to. Paul says, ""This is not about me wanting to be famous through my son. At first, Jordan thought he would do this later in life, but we decided, 'Why not do it now?' We talk to him often to make sure he still wants to do it."" When I ask Jordan why he wants to climb, he says, ""I just focus on reaching my goal.""

In the past, not many people cared about being the youngest or fastest climber. Now, every adventure is shared online, and people want to break records. This creates a problem for Jordan. Some people think that focusing too much on achievements can take away the fun. But if Jordan wants to inspire others, he needs to share his journey online, take photos, and give interviews. He has to do something amazing, like climbing Everest. Paul adds, ""If Jordan comes home tomorrow and says he wants to stop climbing and play basketball instead, we will end this project and go to the gym."""
41,"When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, it is likely they are not listening to classical music. Many people can name many pop groups, but if you ask my friends about Brahms, they usually don’t know who he is. I just started studying music, but my classmates know as little about classical music as other teenagers. If you don’t know who created the music, you probably don’t have any of their recordings. This is sad for fans of classical music. Last year, only 3% of concert tickets sold were for classical music, and the average classical album sells only 300 copies. This is hard to believe.

So, why is interest in classical music going down? Older people often blame our love for TV and video games, but I don’t think that is the reason. The truth is that classical music does not attract most people, especially teenagers, who are the ones most likely to buy music and concert tickets. I know some teenagers who go to classical concerts, but they are few. Even though I play in an orchestra, I am not a big fan of classical music. I enjoy many styles, but my classical music collection is probably close to that 3% figure.

Why don’t teenagers like classical music? First, the pace and rhythm of classical music can be hard for us. We like fast talking, fast playing, and fast thinking. Experts say we can only pay attention for about three minutes, which is too short for most classical pieces but just right for pop songs. Pop music is simple and easy to listen to, while understanding classical music takes time and focus. Also, pop music talks about things that interest teenagers, while classical music often does not.

The way we listen to music has changed too. In the past, families would play music together at home, and playing an instrument was important. Now, you can find any music online, but classical music is rarely part of our daily lives. When was the last time you heard classical music in a store? One of my teachers says that more people are going to classical concerts now, but I doubt many of them are teenagers. In my orchestra, we play classical music in many places, but when I look at the audience, I mostly see older people. I don’t know why more middle-aged people like classical concerts, but I do know that if your parents love something, you might want to avoid it.

Some people say schools are to blame for teenagers not liking classical music, but many kids want to play classical music in their school orchestras. They come early to practice and stay late to rehearse. They enjoy playing classical music, but it is not what they choose to listen to for fun. The two activities have become separate. When we want to relax, we always choose pop music."
42,"Bonnie Wyndham got out of her mother’s car and looked at Almonside School. “I’ll make you sorry I’ve come here,” she said with a smile. Her mother was getting out of the car too, so she didn’t hear Bonnie, but Bonnie didn’t mind. Her mother already knew how she felt. 

Mrs. Wyndham looked around. Almonside was a strange school, with buildings hidden among the trees on a hillside. It looked confusing at first. Then she saw signs that said: Science block, gymnasium, riding centre… “Riding centre,” Bonnie said, suddenly interested. “Headmaster’s study,” her mother replied. “This way.” Bonnie followed her mother along a wide path between the trees. “I wish you’d walk beside me instead of following me like a dog,” Mrs. Wyndham said tiredly, but she didn’t expect Bonnie to do that.

A few minutes later, Mrs. Wyndham was talking to Bonnie’s new headmaster in his office, while Bonnie waited outside the door. Suddenly, Bonnie stood up. “Why should I just sit here?” she thought. “I’ll be thrown out soon anyway, so why not just go?” She left the building and walked towards the riding centre, following the sign. 

There was a nice old building for the horses and a big area for indoor riding. Bonnie looked around, but there was no one there. She approached the horses with respect. They were well taken care of, and she could see that right away. Almost every stall had a horse, and she walked along, looking carefully at each one. “I know what you’re doing here,” she said to a small pony, gently touching its nose. 

Then she saw the next horse and stopped. “But aren’t you the best of them all!” she exclaimed. He was brown with a little white. He looked lively, and Bonnie liked that. “I feel like we’ve met before,” she said, stroking his neck. “In my dreams, I was riding you to win a big competition…” The horse’s name was Maverick. 

Suddenly, she really wanted to ride him. “I wonder where I can find a bridle and a saddle,” she thought. Luckily, the room with the riding equipment was unlocked. Excited, she put a saddle on Maverick’s back and forgot all about her mother and the headmaster. 

When she sat on the big horse outside, she felt like a queen. Her old school friends called her Queen Bee, and she laughed as she remembered that. “You’re the best horse I’ve ever ridden, Maverick,” she said happily. “I know about horses, even if I don’t know much else.” She nudged him to walk, then to trot. “If I stay here, I think we could be great friends,” she said. 

She rode around the paddock, feeling the rhythm of the horse. A light breeze brushed past her cheek, making her feel alive. She could tell Maverick trusted her, and she felt sure he would jump well."
43,"I have met Cody Simpson before, and I was impressed by his quiet confidence. The 15-year-old from Australia has already released many successful songs. So how did a relaxed surfer end up performing in front of thousands of fans? Cody says, ""I first picked up a guitar when I was six years old and started writing songs when I was seven."" He remembers that swimming and surfing were very important to him at that time. He was busy with these activities and had a good life. When he was 13 and in high school, he posted some videos online.

These videos changed everything. He started by sharing a video of himself and a friend singing at a school concert. Fans wanted to see more of his videos on social media. Cody recorded more songs at home and was happy to share them. The response was amazing. 

Cody was also a talented swimmer. He trained hard with great coaches and focused on his sport. But then record labels contacted him, and he had to make a tough choice: stay in Australia and keep swimming or take a big risk by signing a deal and moving with his family to the US. Cody decided to take the chance. He said, ""It was very difficult for me – especially at such a young age – to choose a career. Can you imagine being 12 or 13 and trying to decide what you want to do for the rest of your life?"" 

He had to tell his swimming coach and friends that he was moving to America. ""It surprised most people. I’m kind of the quiet kid,"" he remembers their shocked faces. ""I’m very modest, and I think it’s important to be that way in this crazy world."" So, Cody packed his bags and moved with his family, giving up one dream to try to make another come true. 

Even though his family stays out of the spotlight and does not work directly in his career, they support him. Cody believes it’s important to have good people around you to stay grounded. Everyone has doubts sometimes. ""Sometimes when I’m alone, I think, 'How did my decision affect my little brother and sister?' My little brother is eight years old, and he travels the world and does school on the road; he doesn’t have a normal life,"" Cody admits. ""I worry about how this affects him, but my family always reassures me that they support me in everything I do.""

Success in any career comes from being willing to say 'yes' to your big opportunity, even if it feels scary. ""It all happened so fast and unexpectedly,"" Cody says. ""Now, I go to countries I never thought I would visit and play in front of hundreds of thousands of fans. It’s something many people dream of and try to achieve. But I know it won’t last forever."""
44,"I jumped out of bed, pulled back a corner of the bedroom curtain, and looked at the river. A new crack in the ice sparkled in the morning sun. I squinted and looked upstream at the sandbags that were there to stop the buildings from flooding as the ice melted. My back still hurt from lifting the sandbags last week. I had worked hard with many people from the town to help. But my grandfather didn’t seem to notice.

I looked at the dark water coming from the wood processing factory in Milltown. There were fragile ice shelves on both sides, and solid ice further down the river. As I took off my pajamas and put on my kayaking wetsuit, I saw a boy on the other side of the river. I didn’t know him. He was trying to balance on an ice shelf near the warm water from the factory. I zipped up my wetsuit and put on my kayaking jacket. I checked the pocket for my lucky silver chain, which my famous grandfather had brought back from South America. Only my grandfather, my mom, and I know about this chain. I also have his diary from that trip, which I keep under my pillow and read before I sleep. I touched the chain and went to the kitchen.

“Good morning, Rex,” my mom said with a smile as I took a banana from the counter. “You’re up early for a Saturday. I’ll make brunch after your training. Be careful.” 

“Thanks, Mom.” I walked down the hallway and almost bumped into my tall grandfather as he came out of his room. 

“Can’t you watch where you’re going?” he shouted. “Where are you going?” 

“Sorry, Grandpa. I’m going kayaking.” It was obvious because I was wearing my wetsuit. He always saw me in my kayak every morning. I tried to ignore his anger, but it was getting harder. 

“What’s the point of training? You didn’t win the competition,” he said. His words hurt, but I took a deep breath and counted to three. He walked away and slammed the bathroom door. My mom came over with a kind smile. 

“Don’t mind him. He’s…” 

“...not himself right now,” I finished for her. I wanted to say he was always like this, but I tried to be nice to him. When I was younger, he was my hero. He showed me pictures of himself in National Geographic magazine. Those old photos still hang on his wall, along with his medals and trophies. But I don’t go into his room anymore. I have my own trophies to look at, and maybe one day, my own picture in National Geographic. Still, a part of me wants to stay loyal to him, even though he is grumpy.

Mom smiled. “At least he is coming out of his room more. Have a good training session, Rex. I admire your determination to keep going, even in this cold weather!” 

I smiled back as I peeled my banana. “It will be warmer in South America if I find sponsors for my expedition.” She laughed and went back to the kitchen. I finished my banana and went downstairs. I stepped into the backyard and hurried to the boathouse."
45,"Mum grabbed Jess by the arm. ""Come with me,"" she said. Jess followed her into the study. On the table, leaning against the wall, was a painting. It was clearly one of Grandpa's, but it looked different from his other work and was not finished. ""Do you know anything about this?"" Mum asked. Jess shook her head. ""I’ve never seen it before. I didn’t know he was working on anything."" 

Jess looked closely at the painting. It showed a river that she didn’t recognize. It might not even be a real river, just a made-up one. The painting was strange and beautiful in a spooky way. The riverbank was very small, with a hint of green that was easy to miss. The pale water seemed to lead to a hidden sea. There were no animals, birds, or people in the painting, and it felt right that way. It seemed like there was no place for living things in this distant scene. Still, Jess felt drawn to it, thinking about autumn coming after a long summer.

Mum spoke again. ""It has a name."" There was something in her voice that showed her excitement. Jess understood why. Grandpa never named his paintings. He just painted them and let others figure them out. Mum turned the painting over and pointed to the words Grandpa had written. Jess read them aloud: ""River Boy."" The words felt important to her, but she didn’t know why. 

Then Jess noticed something else. She looked at Mum. ""There is no boy."" 

""Exactly. It’s strange for him to be so specific. But maybe he will add the boy later. I made the mistake of asking him about it."" 

""Mum! You should have known better."" 

""I know, but I couldn’t help it. It’s such an unusual painting, especially with a name. You can guess what he said."" 

Jess didn’t need to guess. She knew Grandpa would have said, ""It’s not the artist's job to explain a painting. Each painting has its own life and language, like a poem. We either understand it or we don’t. Painting is hard work, and I can’t waste time explaining it to everyone."" 

Mum laughed. ""Something like that. Anyway, I was hoping you might know something about this painting since you seem to inspire him."" 

""Inspire?"" Jess asked. 

""Yes, someone who inspires an artist."" Jess understood the word. Grandpa often used it when she watched him paint, but he usually meant that the muse wasn’t helping him that day or that he needed to be nice to the muse. He never said the muse was about her. She thought he meant a goddess, not a real person. It was hard to believe anyone, even a goddess, could influence someone as stubborn as Grandpa. 

""He doesn’t need me to inspire him,"" she said. ""He’s been painting all his life."""
46,"When I woke up this morning, I didn’t plan to cut a hole in my bedroom carpet. I’m not saying it was an accident, but it could have been. For example, if I had tripped over the bed with Dad’s knife in my hand, the knife might have gone into the carpet and made a big hole. I’m not saying that happened, just that it could have. I didn’t mean to damage the carpet. I didn’t wake up thinking, “Today I will cut a hole in my carpet.” It just seemed like a good idea at the time. Later, I wondered why I thought that, but by then it was too late. This happens to me often. 

What I was really doing was trying to fit my corner cabinet into a corner. My Gran gave me the cabinet when she moved to a flat. It’s very cute! It’s small, painted white, with pink and blue flowers around the edge, and it has tiny glass doors. Gran used to keep china ornaments in it, like shepherdesses and old ladies selling balloons. Now, I keep my collection of shells and interesting stones there. Gran knew I loved her corner cabinet, and I was so happy when she gave it to me!

The problem is, it is a corner cabinet, which means it has to go in a corner. I only have two corners in my bedroom because it is the smallest room in the house. It is shaped like a wedge of cheese. The big front bedroom is for Mum and Dad, the back one is for my sister Angela, and the little one over the garage is for my brother Tom. My room is very small, like a broom cupboard. Mum says when Angela goes to university, Tom can have her room, and I can have Tom’s. Then, when Tom goes to university, I can choose any room. But since Angela is only fifteen, I think I will be in my small room for a long time. 

I don’t really mind; I like my little bedroom. It’s cozy, like a nest. I love how the roof slopes down and how the window is at floor level. The only problem is the lack of corners! My bed is in one corner, and my wardrobe is in the other. I tried to fit Gran’s cabinet into the space between the roof and the floor, but it was just a little too tall. I thought, if I can’t cut the cabinet, why not cut a hole in the carpet? It seemed like a good solution. Dad calls this “lateral thinking.” He always tells us to “think outside the box,” and that is exactly what I was doing!"
47,"The novel ""The Borrowers"" is about a family of tiny people who live secretly in the walls and floors of a house. They ""borrow"" things from normal-sized people to survive. When I was asked to direct a TV version of the book, I knew it would be difficult to meet people's expectations. Fans of the book have strong ideas about how it should be. I used the original drawings from the book a lot because I wanted to avoid criticism.

The author wanted the series to show the story from the Borrowers' point of view, not from the humans'. This made filming more complicated. The most important thing was to get the size right. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans, so when we filmed them walking across a room, we had to be ten times further away than usual. The crew had to crawl on the ground and film from no higher than 15 centimeters to show the Borrowers' view. They went through many pairs of jeans!

We only raised the cameras for aerial shots. A big challenge was to create the right shadows when we combined the tiny Borrowers with normal-sized backgrounds. We came up with a special technique for this. After the series aired, famous director George Lucas called to ask how we did it.

The only permanent set we built was the Borrowers' home under the floorboards, filled with giant objects to make the actors look small. It was very surreal. I remember asking them to carry a giant pair of scissors, and they really got into it. The coins we used were bigger than dinner plates and hard to lift, which made the crew laugh a lot.

In the story, there is a scene where the Borrowers are swept down a drain. To film this, the actors had to go down a tunnel with hoses, and they said it was so scary that they didn’t need to act. I wanted to get the costumes right, which has been a problem in other versions. I had the costumes made from heavy canvas so they looked like dolls' clothes. This made it hard for the lead actress to move. She couldn’t sit down during breaks and had to be sewn into her dress every morning. The lead actor's trousers were made from a rug because normal fabric would look too smooth. Unfortunately, it was very hot during filming, and I don’t think they appreciated my attention to detail!

Most of the action away from the Borrowers' home was filmed with the actors in front of a blue screen. It was hard for them to react to things that weren’t really there. I had to draw pictures of every scene to show how they should look – I made 2,000 drawings by the end. The budget didn’t allow for special effects studios during the day, so I worked nights for three months. We had to work quickly. Once, I filmed a whole scene and then realized there was no film in the camera! But in the end, everything came together, and I think the series successfully captured the magic of the books."
48,"Mom stops the car at the corner of my new school, Palm Grove High School. She looks around nervously, expecting to see journalists, but there aren’t any. I know that soon there will be attention on me. It always happens. The fake smiles, the people who want to be my friends, and the ones who ask for free tickets to my dad’s concerts. “Everything will be fine,” I tell her. She kisses her fingertip and touches my cheek before I get out of the car. Then she drives away, leaving me alone in this new school and new situation. But this is what I wanted. I wanted to leave my old life of traveling and tutors. While the rest of the band is here for recording, we are staying for good. I wanted to come to this school to meet normal kids. I want to meet kids with parents who have regular jobs, like working in an office or cutting grass. That would be so cool.

I walk into the school office. “Hi, I need my schedule, please,” I say to the secretary. “Name?” she asks, looking unfriendly. “Desert McGraw.” “Desirée?” she asks, leaning closer. “Desert,” I repeat. The secretary looks confused. “Oh,” she says and types my last name on her computer. That’s good because not many people know my last name since my dad uses a stage name. “What grade?” she asks. “Eleventh.” “One second, it’s printing,” she replies. Then she gives me my schedule. English Literature is my first class. Great! I like English. But I will be late. English is in Room 214 on the second floor. I studied the map last night so I wouldn’t look silly trying to find my classes.

When I reach the door, I hear the teacher calling names. “Aurelio Gonzalez.” “Here.” I slip in quietly and sit at the last desk in the second row. The girl next to me smiles and looks at my normal outfit – jeans and a T-shirt. No one will suspect me now! “Nice shoes,” she whispers. I look down at my fancy shoes with flowers on them. Oh no, I shouldn’t have worn these. “Thanks,” I say. The teacher pauses and says, “Desert... McGraw?” “Here,” I reply. The teacher smiles and introduces herself as Ms. Smigla. She talks a lot and gives us our course outlines. After explaining the books we will read this year, she lets us talk to each other! All teachers should do this.

“Why did you move here?” my new friend asks. I have a few options for my answer. Should I say I wanted a normal life away from cameras and reporters? Or should I say what my dad thinks? He said, “We need a change, Desert, and this is the perfect place to record the new album. Energy, color, culture... just what our last album needed.” I think he just wants to relax on the beach. Why else would they choose a studio so close to the sand? “My dad had to relocate,” I tell her. Yes, it’s easier to lie. “What does he do?” she asks. I know everyone will find out eventually, but I want some time to pretend to be normal. “He’s an artist,” I say, playing with my backpack zipper. “Cool. I’m Becca, by the way.” And she doesn’t seem to care much. Great!"
49,"Not only is the average American teenage girl expected to be the president of the Student Council, but she also needs to have a part-time job, volunteer, and do well in all these areas. This is what it means to be a teenager in America today. Boys and girls cannot just go to school and be average because being average is not enough anymore. People think that not having big goals is being lazy. 

Kristen Loose, a teenager, says, “Adults often forget how much pressure we have. We have a lot of homework, tests, after-school activities, jobs, chores, and we also want to have a social life.” Even though these stresses are normal for teenagers today, there are still negative stereotypes about them. Some people think teenagers are lazy, disrespectful, rebellious, loud, reckless, and only care about themselves. While some teenagers may fit these stereotypes, many do not think it is fair to label all teenagers this way.

Kristen Loose believes that many people wrongly assume teenagers spend all their time on their phones and watching TV. She admits she often has her phone nearby, but she uses it for important things, not just for fun. Teenagers use their phones to make their lives easier and to stay connected. Today, students are expected to have quick access to information and to be reachable all the time, which can look like an addiction to their phones. With smartphones, tablets, and social media, students can do their homework anywhere. Instead of just listening to music on the way to school, they might listen to language lessons.

Now, schoolwork and other activities do not stop when school ends; they need attention all the time. Many teenagers start their day around 6 a.m. or 7 a.m. and often finish their day after midnight. Their schedules are full of school, after-school activities, family responsibilities, and homework. They have to wake up and do it all again the next day, often getting less than the recommended nine hours of sleep. A survey found that about 20 percent of American teenagers get enough sleep, and 28 percent said they fall asleep in school about once a week because they are tired.

Teenager Lindamarie Olsen thinks that after all her activities, she has about 18 hours of free time each week. With 168 hours in a week, 18 hours is not much. She does not spend much of that time on social media or TV; instead, she focuses on volunteering. She says, “People think teenagers only care about themselves, but I love volunteering. I want to make a positive impact in my school and community.”

In 20 years, the stereotype of teenagers may change, but they will continue to prove those stereotypes wrong and make the world a better place. There will always be new generations of students who are making a difference before they even finish school."
50,"The teenage members of the Earth to Sky Calculus Club live in Bishop, a mountain town in the US. This town is mostly surrounded by wild nature, east of the Sierra Nevada mountains. In the last few years, this group has sent over fifty balloons to the edge of space, about 35 km above the Earth. This is a long-term science project that combines astronomy and adventure, which is why many teenagers join. 

I visited them one weekend in late spring. They were getting ready to release a high-altitude balloon to record shooting stars. Shooting stars happen when a rock or piece of metal from space enters the Earth's atmosphere and creates a bright light. As it got dark, the teenagers attached a soft insulated lunch box to the bottom of the balloon. Inside the lunch box, there was a camera, a device to measure height, and a thermometer to check temperature changes as the balloon rose. They also put two GPS trackers on the outside of the lunch box to help find it later. 

A gas tank, given by a supporter from another state, was used to fill the balloon, which grew to the size of a small car. An older boy drove seven hours to get the gas tank. He said, “I didn’t really mind.” For kids in this club, this is normal. Finally, it was time for the balloon to lift off. They counted down, “Five, four, three, two, one,” and the balloon started to rise. Some of the teenagers ran after it with flashlights, trying to follow its path in the dark sky. There was a quiet moment filled with wonder as the balloon disappeared into the night.

After the launch, most students went home, but a few stayed to watch the shooting stars. They lay on blankets on the mountainside and looked at the clear sky, which was surprising because it was only four hours from Los Angeles, a busy city with about 4 million people. I saw a boy get into a sleeping bag and quickly fall asleep. One girl whispered, “We’re the only ones talking.” Another girl replied, “I know.” Suddenly, a meteor shot across the sky.

As the balloon rose, the air pressure decreased, and the balloon expanded until it was almost the size of a house. Then it popped with a loud noise. A parachute helped the lunch box land safely back on Earth. The students would find it the next day using the GPS trackers. Finding it was not easy, but that was part of the fun. There is not much land with people around Bishop, so the lunch box usually lands in a remote area. The group’s leader said, “Recoveries are a big part of the program.” They have only lost two lunch boxes in 53 launches. He added, “Part of the journey is getting to know this landscape in a way you normally wouldn’t.”

This time, the lunch box landed 84 km west of Bishop. To get it, the recovery team had to drive south of the Sierra and then back up the western side of the mountains. They had to decide whether to drive or walk, as it could be dangerous if the lunch box was on a high peak or in a tall tree. The leader said, “These students know the Eastern Sierra well. What seems wild to some is just normal for others.” 

In the end, it took them 11 hours to find the lunch box. It was in a canyon, on a flat rock, near a waterfall. The camera did not capture any shooting stars, which was a bit disappointing. However, it gave them a chance to discuss atmospheric waves and how they work above mountains. It was also another adventure story to share with anyone who asked."
51,"Chloe Morgan admits that she was not very interested in science, especially Palaeontology, until she was fifteen. Her interest started by chance. ""My younger brother was really into dinosaurs, which I didn’t care about at all. I helped him with a science project, and when I read an article about new discoveries in Palaeontology, I was amazed. I knew I wanted to pursue this field.""

I asked Chloe how she got support for her interest, as Palaeontology was not a common career choice for young people back then. ""I remember meeting my first professional palaeontologist, Matt Cornelius. He was already famous, even though he was young. I was very nervous, but he was friendly and listened to me. That made me feel more comfortable.""

I also asked her about how palaeontologists are shown in movies and TV shows. Chloe frowned and said, ""Movies like Jurassic Park have made many people interested in dinosaurs, but they don’t show palaeontologists accurately. We are often seen as strange geniuses or awkward people who can’t talk to others. This is not how our daily work really is.""

Chloe explained her job. ""I do a lot of different things. I dig up dinosaur bones, spend time in labs studying fossils, and write for scientific journals. Sometimes, I also explain scientific findings to the public, especially to young people. It’s important to help them understand science better. Talking about dinosaurs can get kids excited about nature and other areas of science.""

Chloe worked on the TV documentary Walking with Dinosaurs, which helped show dinosaurs more accurately. ""The people who made the show knew what they were doing. I only needed to check a few things, like making sure the dinosaurs were the right size and lived at the same time. We attracted viewers of all ages because we have learned so much about dinosaurs recently. The dinosaurs in this show are much more realistic than those in movies like Jurassic Park.""

I asked Chloe why she thinks dinosaurs still interest us and why research continues. ""I think dinosaurs appeal to our curiosity. They make us want to explore and discover new things. Even though our world feels smaller now, dinosaurs remind us that there is still much to learn. Palaeontology is like time travel."""
52,"When you travel by car with your family, even if you are six years old, you know that you are not “there yet,” even if you keep asking, “Are we there yet?” When you finally arrive, it is not “there” anymore; it is “here.” So, if you think you might be “there,” you should ask, “Are we here yet?” 

Parents often wish they were “there” more than anyone else because kids keep asking this question on long trips. But think about it: wouldn’t you rather relax in the back seat? You can watch DVDs, listen to music, or do puzzles while enjoying the view outside the window. Meanwhile, one of your parents is in the front seat, giving you juice boxes and cookies, changing the radio, and making sure everything goes smoothly.

But sometimes, things can get crazy in the car. For example, my younger brother, Tim, might put his foot on my side of the seat. I don’t like that, so I put my foot on his side. Soon, we are fighting, and our parents have to separate us while driving. They tell Tim to stay in his own seat and keep his hands to himself. This helps for a while, and we can enjoy the beautiful scenery again.

Later, when I try to read, I feel a draft on my arm. The window is closed, so I wonder where it is coming from. Tim is next to me, breathing on me. He is not touching me, so he thinks he is not doing anything wrong. This makes me angry, and soon there is more yelling and swerving in the car.

Over the years, Dad has found ways to deal with us. When we ask, “Are we there yet?” he sometimes says, “Yes, we’re here. Get out of the car.” But if we are still on the highway, we know that is not true. You can tell you are finally “there” when the adults get out of the car and move away from the kids. So remember, if your parents are still close enough to answer your question, the answer is: no, you are not there yet."
53,"John and Zuzi Morgan have opened a café in Oxford, UK, where people can enjoy coffee, cake, and play board games. They hope that customers will love the experience and want to come back. Zuzi explains that they wanted to create a place where people can connect without using their phones or other devices. She believes that people should spend time together and talk to each other.

The games played in their café are called ‘Eurogames’. These games often have gentle themes, like farming or building landscapes. The first Eurogame was The Settlers of Catan, created by a German designer named Klaus Teuber. In this game, players build settlements on an island and trade resources with each other. Everyone stays involved and no one feels left out. 

Later, cooperative games were created, where all players work together to win or lose as a team. One popular cooperative game is Pandemic, designed by Matt Leacock. In Pandemic, players must work together to solve global problems. Leacock was inspired by a Eurogame called Lord of the Rings, which is based on a famous book. He remembers feeling scared and excited while playing it with friends. He wanted to create a game that gave people those same feelings.

Leacock has loved board games since he was a child, but he often felt disappointed when games did not meet his expectations. With help from his uncle, he started to design his own games. Pandemic became very successful and introduced a lot of storytelling, similar to video games, where players develop characters and the story changes as they play.

The rise of video games has helped make board games popular again. Many people now play games on their smartphones, which has made them more open to playing board games too. Ben Hogg, who works for a game company, says that everyone has at least one game they enjoy on their phone. 

For a while, video games allowed people to play together in person, but then many games moved online, making it harder to connect with others. This led some people to look for ways to play games with friends and family in person again. In John and Zuzi's busy café, it is clear that tabletop gaming has become more than just fun. In our online world, games are now something people can share together in real life, and this trend is likely to continue."
54,"Jamie Scott has written and produced some of the biggest hits in the UK in recent years. His story shows that hard work and determination are very important in the music industry, even if your career starts slowly. He says his mother was a great singer and helped him learn to play the guitar. The only radio station he listened to at home was for older people, which influenced his music taste as he grew up. He was 12 years old when he first heard a modern song. Around the same time, he had to choose between playing tennis, which he was good at, and music. He spent his lunch breaks at school learning songs on the piano. He said, “I was good at tennis, but it was not what I wanted to do forever. It was too much hard work.”

At 17, he left school to become a performer. He formed a duo with a friend who played guitar but did not want to pursue a music career. Jamie told his parents that he wanted to focus on music, even though he had been writing lyrics during his economics classes. His dad gave him 18 months to succeed in music; if he didn’t, he would need to find a job. After some close calls with record labels, he got signed to a music publisher at 19 because of one song. However, the record labels wanted him to be a solo artist, so he had to part ways with his friend.

Eventually, he found success behind the scenes instead of on stage. After a tough time with a UK record label, he asked to leave and joined another label to release a new album. He did not become famous right away. He said, “I feel like I’ve been in the wrong place at the wrong time for most of my career, but as a writer, I’ve been in the right place.” Writing for other artists is where he really found success. He believes he is one of the main writers that UK labels turn to for new artists. He sometimes has to explain to these artists that wanting to write popular songs is okay. He asks them, “Don’t you want millions of people to listen to your music?” He wants to help them create songs that are both amazing and likely to sell well.

It is nice to hear someone like Jamie talk openly about wanting to write big hit songs. He is not arrogant; he just knows he has a talent for writing number one songs. Instead of worrying about what others think, he focuses on his work. He says, “When I go into the studio, we need to aim for the best music of next year. It’s not just about what’s cool; we want to write great modern pop songs.”"
55,"Tony Connor is a new kind of celebrity. He is very popular online, but many people, like me, may not know him because we don’t watch videos of people doing bike tricks. He is a ""street trials cyclist."" This means he jumps from hard places like roofs or walls to land safely in other difficult spots. People film these stunts and share them online.

I met Tony one Saturday morning at a BMX park. The local kids all know him, and some older people come to tell him he is ""an absolute legend."" After watching him perform, I agree with them. At first, I was unsure about him, but I was impressed by his bravery and creativity. Before each jump, he explains what he plans to do, and sometimes I can’t believe he will succeed. When I compliment him, he seems a bit uninterested and sad. Even though he is famous online, Tony says he does not like being a celebrity. He finds it hard to connect with fans. He prefers to focus on doing his stunts rather than talking about them.

Tony thinks that the cameras and social media help him earn money from what used to be just a hobby. He feels that many people are always filming themselves or looking at screens, and he doesn’t always agree with that. However, he is not unhappy about his situation. 

From my experience interviewing top athletes, I have learned that two important things help a child become a great competitor: energy and the ability to handle disappointment. These qualities can be more important than talent. In risky sports, it is very important to have mental strength. Even in the park, Tony fell a few times on what he thought were easy challenges. But he got back up and kept trying until he succeeded.

Not everyone sees Tony as a hero. Some people think he is reckless and takes too many risks. He says that those people may care, but they don’t understand the sport. They probably have never tried riding a trials bike and don’t know the technical details. Tony gets advice from experts to help reduce risks.

Tony is careful about the risks he takes. He believes that people are different. Some people are not scared and should not do risky sports. Others can feel fear but still push through it. Tony is in the second group. He feels fear but finds a way to overcome it. He is not addicted to risk; he spends a lot of time planning and preparing. Sometimes, he rides around for a while to get ready before trying a new stunt. He knows he must stay calm before he jumps. If he fully commits to the jump, he feels confident."
56,"Television presenter Helen Skelton has done many dangerous challenges for charity. These include running a marathon in the desert and traveling down the Amazon river in a small boat. For her latest challenge, Helen walked on a high wire, which is a long thin piece of metal, 66 meters above the ground, between two towers of an empty power station. There was no safety net, just a belt around her waist connected to another wire above her. To help her balance and avoid falling, she used a long stick that weighed eight kilograms. 

Helen took lessons from an expert high-wire walker. Even though she had some circus skills, she found out that high-wire walking was very different. “The training was a shock,” Helen said. “I didn’t know I needed to be so strong. Every day started at 8 am with a run up a steep hill, followed by an hour of exercises, and then another hour practicing on the wire. I also had to learn how to fall onto the wire so I could keep going if I slipped. Every time I fell, it hurt a lot. But I had to stay positive: if I got nervous and started shaking, the wire would shake too!”

On the day of the challenge, it was windy. Helen stayed calm by taking deep breaths as she moved step by step along the wire. The 150-meter walk took her 15 minutes. “That was the scariest thing I’ve done,” she said afterwards. “I’m glad it’s over!” However, this experience has not stopped Helen from planning her next charity project: to reach the South Pole by skiing, kiting, and biking."
57,"In 2006, Jeff Somers started a trip around the world on a penny farthing, which is an old-fashioned bicycle with one big wheel and one small wheel. He had already written a book about his travels in Canada using a 50-year-old car. Jeff loved motor sports and worked building racing car engines. To save money, he rode an old bicycle to work and also used it to go on holiday to Amsterdam. He said, “That trip opened my eyes,” and decided to see the world by bike.

Jeff did not want a regular touring bike. He wanted to build one himself. He thought the most interesting bike would be a penny farthing, so he went to a museum to learn how they were made. After two attempts in 2001 and 2003, when he had to stop because of a knee injury, he finally began his journey in 2006. He traveled for three years, visiting 23 countries on four continents. The best part of his trip was reaching Tibet and seeing Mount Everest. He met other cyclists who could ride up mountains, but he never regretted using his penny farthing. People were always amazed by it as he traveled further from home.

His worst experience was when he had to drink dirty water from a stream. He got a serious fever and spent ten days in a hostel without medicine. He had no money for a hospital or to go home. Despite these challenges, Jeff now says, “If I could afford it, I would start traveling again tomorrow on my penny farthing.”"
58,"I work at a university in the US with my team to learn more about water birds, especially the American black duck. We have just started using a new tool called a ‘night-vision scope’. This tool helps us see the ducks in the dark! We are concerned about black ducks because their numbers have dropped a lot, and we are not sure if there is enough food for them on the east coast.

We know a lot about what they do during the day, but we don’t know what they do at night because we didn’t have the right equipment. The new scope will give us clear pictures, even when there is no moon, so we can learn more and make better choices to protect their habitat.

It is hard work. There are four of us, and we each work six hours a day. We have studied ducks in different places, and I have had to take a boat to some locations and write down every duck I see. The weather has been difficult – some nights are warm, but most of the time it is wet. It is very quiet, so I have needed a lot of coffee to stay awake! We have only missed one workday because the snow was too deep for our special vehicles. 

I enjoy the challenge, especially when I think about the summer. In summer, we will spend hours in a laboratory looking at our results together. It will be hard to be inside, but it is important to do this work. I wouldn’t change it for anything!"
59,"Whenever I tell people what my job is, they can hardly believe it. But I’m serious! I spend my days at work eating chocolate! Tasting chocolate is very important to make sure that customers get the best quality chocolate from my company. Every week, I get samples, which are small amounts of chocolate, from our factory. I check them for taste, texture, and smell. I also taste the raw materials we use, like nuts and fruit, to choose the best ones for the chocolate. 

Next to my office, I have a kitchen where I can test and taste the products I make. I also share samples with my colleagues to keep them happy! My kitchen has many machines and ingredients to work with. It’s great to have a private space to go to during the day. No two days are the same in this job. Sometimes I am in our food lab, and other times I travel to other countries to buy our raw materials. This can be hard because I have a young family, but I love the variety in my job, even more than the chocolate itself!

People often ask me if I get bored of chocolate. I have worked with it for a long time, and I have never felt tired of eating it. In fact, I often go home and eat more chocolate in the evening!"
60,"Have you ever thought about what it is like to perform in a circus? Sophia Grayson works at Circus Experience, a place that teaches young people circus skills. She says that her course is popular because it teaches many skills. These skills include juggling, throwing and catching things like balls or even fire, and trapeze, which is flying through the air in front of an amazed audience. 

The course lasts for a year, and students slowly take more risks in each class. Parents can come to some classes to see how their children are doing. Sophia explains, “To have a career in the circus, performers need to do different things. It is important to keep performances exciting and full of action. If you want to be successful in the circus, you must keep practicing. Another great part of this job is making friends with other performers and learning from them. Staying fit is also very important. Circus artists, like athletes, train every day to stay strong. Training is very important, but the best performers are those who want to succeed, have creativity, and always want to improve their skills. 

Some people think that circus performers get hurt often or that they only work for a short time each year. But the real challenge is thinking about the future. You can only travel and perform while you are young, and then you need to think about other options.” The course also teaches business planning. Many former students have started their own businesses around the world and are happy to share their experiences. However, Sophia warns that this is not a job for making a lot of money! “The work usually does not provide a regular salary. It is also very competitive, but it is a lot of fun!”"
61,"You may not know her name or face, but you have probably heard her many times. Mariam Hobson is a professional backing singer. This means she sings in the background to support the main singer. Many people think backing singers are not good enough to be lead singers, but that is not true. They often have to be even better! People like Mariam are the real stars of the music industry.

Mariam says, ""What I love about my job is that when I go into the recording studio, I never know what I will be asked to sing. It could be classical, jazz, hip-hop, or rock. Sometimes, it might even be a funny song for a radio station or an advertisement. I am often surprised by what the producers ask me to do. Once, I was asked to sing like a fish underwater! But I never argue; I just do my job!""

""To do my work well, I need excellent musical skills and the ability to learn quickly. There is often no written music to follow. I will never forget my first time recording background music for a film. It was very complicated because there were eight of us, each singing a different part, along with an orchestra. I was scared because if I made a mistake, we would have to record everything again, and nobody likes that. Recording sessions are already long.""

""One of my favorite jobs is recording for songwriters. Less experienced writers sometimes do not know which musical range is best for a female voice. By listening to me sing their song, they can learn how to make it better."""
62,"Julie Deane started her business with only basic knowledge of fashion. She created a successful line of ‘satchels,’ which are traditional bags used by schoolchildren. These satchels are now sold in famous shops and are popular with many celebrities. 

Before deciding to sell satchels, Julie thought about different business ideas, like cake decorating and party planning. She wanted to make the best choice. When she chose satchels, not everyone agreed with her. Many people said there was no need for them, but Julie believed in her idea.

Julie worked with her family from the beginning. She teamed up with her mother, who had never worked before but was good at business. The design of the satchels was inspired by children’s storybooks. 

At first, Julie didn’t know much about fashion blogs, but they became important for her success. She started by selling about one satchel a week. To get more attention, she sent satchels to fashion writers, hoping they would write about them in their blogs. They did, and interest in her satchels grew. Now, her company makes satchels faster than before. Julie enjoys seeing which celebrity is seen with a satchel next!

While other companies spend money on online ads, Julie uses the internet to get ideas for new styles, keeping her products fresh and exciting. There was a tough time when another company copied her satchel design, so now she makes sure she trusts her production team as much as her own staff.

Visitors to her office often say it has a positive atmosphere, and people enjoy working there. Julie has a new factory, and while the buildings are important, it is the team that makes the place special."
63,"When Vicky Harmiston was a child, her parents let her and her brother Jamie choose how to spend their free time. Vicky liked to do many different sports. She was a good swimmer, and her coach thought she could become a champion. However, the swimming club was far from her home, so it was hard for her to balance training with schoolwork.

As teenagers, Jamie, who loved cycling, bought a special racing bike and started competing. Vicky thought this looked exciting and decided to try it too. She says it was the best decision she ever made. Soon, she was cycling every day and doing very well. The track was close to her school, so it was easy for her to go to training after school. Vicky had a successful career in track cycling and won many competitions. When she was 28, she retired from competitive cycling. Vicky said, “I loved winning for many years, but I started to feel tired of it. When the excitement goes away, there’s no point in continuing. Luckily, I found a new job.”

Vicky got a job with a charity called CycleZone. She said, “We work with young people who have never enjoyed sports. The first thing we do is teach them to ride a bike. We want them to believe in themselves and their abilities. CycleZone does a great job and helps young people feel part of a group.” The charity uses famous people to promote their work. Vicky said, “Some people think having a celebrity support a charity is not always good. They believe celebrities do it for their own benefit, which can hide the real work of the charity. But if famous singers and actors can help, I think they should.”"
64,"Ana Ronson is a singer-songwriter from Ireland. Even though her parents were not musicians, there was always music in her home. Her grandfather played the guitar and taught Ana and her brother how to play.

The first time Ana sang in front of people was at school. She was very nervous, and her teacher had to help her off the stage. The teacher suggested that Ana join the school theatre club to help her feel more confident. After some time in the club, she sang happily with 50 other students at a concert at the end of the term.

A year later, Ana's brother, who was in a band, asked her to write a song for them. She wrote her first song called ""Falling Stars"" in just three days. She enjoyed writing so much that she signed up for a songwriting course with a professional. Even though she was the youngest student, she knew a lot about music. However, Ana felt that the teacher did not listen to her, so she wrote a song called ""Something to Say"" about her feelings. She shared this song online, and it became very popular. She was happy to see that people loved it and found new meanings in the lyrics.

Joss Alton, who owns a recording company called Isotope Music, flew from the other side of Ireland to invite her to join his company. At first, Ana was unsure because she did not know much about Isotope and did not want anyone telling her what to sing. But Joss convinced her that this would not happen. Soon after, she performed at a concert in Dublin organized by Isotope. The tickets sold out quickly, and it was a wonderful night.

Ana prefers to write songs about difficult times in life rather than happy moments because she feels she has more to say then. One of her favorite songs is ""Decision,"" which is about why her brother stopped singing for a while and how sad it made him. Ana hopes her fans will enjoy her songs, but her main goal is to write about personal experiences that are important to her."
65,"Last year, I went on a wonderful trip. I traveled by boat on a guided group tour along the west coast of Canada. It was my brother Harry’s idea. He is a journalist, like me, and he wanted to write articles about the trip. He loves boats, but I don’t share that interest. However, I had always wanted to visit this area since I saw it on TV as a child. I knew it was where our great-grandparents lived before they moved to Europe. So, I kept asking Harry if I could join him until he finally said yes!

A few days before we left, there were storms in the area we were going to. But luckily, the weather was supposed to be good when we arrived. I was busy with work and didn’t have much time to prepare, but Harry said he would take care of everything, so I stopped worrying.

When we got to Canada, we met the group, packed our supplies into small boats, and started our journey. The guide told us that very few people live along that coast now. On our first morning, the only animals we saw were dolphins and birds. We could see islands in the distance, but the fog made it hard to see far, so I just enjoyed watching the beautiful patterns our boat made in the water.

We often stopped for hours to explore the rock pools on the beaches. They were full of colorful fish, many of which I didn’t know. It was nice to forget about time and just enjoy the moment. We always remembered to have lunch and dinner, which we cooked together over campfires. At night, we slept on the boats. Even though the beds were hard, it felt great to live without stress!

When it was time to go home, I felt sad. How could I go back to normal life? But I knew I would miss my family and friends. I was also excited to tell everyone at home about our adventures!"
66,"My dad was a professional basketball player in Germany, just like his father before him. When I was a kid, I went to watch many of his games. You might think that this would make me love basketball, but it did the opposite. I liked telling my friends how good my dad was, especially when he won, but I usually took a book to read instead of watching the games.

When I started secondary school, I was already two meters tall, even though I was not yet a teenager. My sports teacher saw my height and asked if I wanted to train with the basketball team. I enjoyed the training, but I thought I needed to get better before playing in a real match. The teacher believed in me more than I believed in myself. After some time, I agreed to play, and a few weeks later, I played against another school. My parents came to watch, which made me more nervous, but it turned out fine!

For the next four years, I practiced every day and did really well. I even joined an adult team before I moved to a special sports academy in the USA when I was fifteen. The coach there trains Olympic basketball players, and it was amazing to work with him. However, I didn’t enjoy living far from my parents at first. At home, I hadn’t spent much time with friends because of all the training, so that part was not very different for me. Eventually, I got used to my new life, and my English improved quickly too!

I became a professional player at eighteen, three years after arriving in the USA. I had been taller than most players in the professional league since I was fifteen, but I needed to gain weight to match my height. My coach knew a team that would take me while I was still in college, so I joined them and have never regretted it."
67,"Seven years ago, I was studying Tourism at college, but I needed a part-time job because my course was expensive. After thinking about different options, I decided to train as a weekend tour guide in my home city, Chicago, USA. I took visitors around the city, and I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. I saw the city I had lived in my whole life from the tourists' perspective, and it felt new every time!

After I finished my studies, I chose to become a full-time tour guide. I thought it would be easy, but when I looked into it, I found out that I needed to learn a lot more to get a license. All tour guides in Chicago must answer many questions about the city, including its architecture, history, and public transport rules. After several months of hard but interesting work, I got my tour guide qualification and became an independent tour guide.

Being a tour guide is not just about knowing facts or keeping the group together. You also need other skills. You should be entertaining and tell interesting stories. Most importantly, you must be able to handle unexpected situations, like if a place you planned to visit is closed or if the route changes. Tourists want to enjoy a well-organized tour, not hear about problems.

I need to make sure my visitors are happy with my tours, or they might leave a bad review online. Like most tour guides, I know that good reviews are very important because they attract more customers. That’s why I try to make my tours fun and stress-free. I put a lot of energy and enthusiasm into my job, which helps me get good reviews, and many visitors recommend my tours to others coming to Chicago."
68,"My name is Ella, and I am 22 years old. Last year, I went to Thailand for two weeks with my sister Josie. She is five years younger than me, but we get along well. We went to help at an elephant sanctuary, which is a place where people take care of sick and rescued elephants. At first, I was not sure if we would fit in with the other volunteers because they were older than us. We were also nervous because it was our first time doing something like this. In the end, we had nothing to worry about.

One of our main jobs at the sanctuary was to collect food for the elephants. Elephants eat a lot of grass and banana plants, so this took most of the day. Josie found it hard work, but I thought it was worth it to see the elephants enjoy their food. We also helped wash the elephants in the river with big brushes and soap. I had a lot of fun, even though I got wetter than the elephants!

The part of the day I looked forward to the most was the evening. By the light of the moon, we led the elephants into the forest where they spent the night. All the volunteers stayed in the same house. Josie and I shared a bedroom, which was small, but we chose to do this because Josie didn’t want to be alone. It was hot and humid at night, but we expected that. The meals were delicious and did not have meat, which we both don’t like.

After dinner, all the volunteers and staff spent the evenings talking and playing games. Now that we are back in the UK, Josie does not often talk about Thailand. But if someone asks her if she enjoyed her time at the sanctuary, she says she loved it. I think she might be a little upset with herself for not enjoying her time more because she missed her friends. But when she thinks back, she can see how lucky she was to go there. Maybe she will go back one day – I know I will!"
69,"My name is Gina D’Costa, and I own a flower shop in the UK. We sell flowers not just to people for their homes or friends, but to many different customers. Hotels and offices often use flowers in their reception areas, and sometimes we provide flowers for businesses to use in their advertising photos. Once, I even decorated a castle with flowers for a wedding. It was a lot of work, but I was very proud of what we did.

My day starts at 4 a.m. when I go to the market to buy fresh flowers. Most people are still asleep, and my friends think I’m a bit crazy, but I love what I do. It is often cold and dark at that time, but I don’t let it bother me. The flower market is amazing, with flowers from all over the world. The sights and smells make it hard to choose. If I were buying for myself, I would probably choose only pink flowers because it’s my favorite color. But I have to remember that what I like may not be what my customers want. Not all flowers are available all year, so sometimes I can’t find what customers want.

I don’t like arguing about prices with the flower sellers, but it is part of my job. Flowers can be expensive, so I try to get the best price. When I return to the shop, we look at customer orders and prepare vases with the flowers I bought. Then we create flower bunches and calculate the costs. Customers are often surprised by the prices, and I sometimes have to ask them to think again about what they want. Some people might think this is too much trouble, but I enjoy finding the best flowers for the money someone wants to spend. That’s what selling is about, and I wouldn’t want any other job!"
70,"My city has a modern cinema that shows the latest films and many kids' movies on weekends. It is close to my home, but a year ago, I felt something was missing. I wanted to talk about films in detail with others after watching them. So, I started a film club with two friends! 

We decided not to rent a cinema. Instead, we choose a different place in the city each month. For example, we used an old factory to show a film set in Antarctica. It was very cold, which made the experience even better! Some places we use are free because the owners sell snacks during the film. This helps us keep our prices low. We just want to cover our costs, not make a profit.

Each time we show a film, it gets easier, especially now that we have our own equipment. We can see how many tickets we sell online, so we don’t worry about empty seats anymore! There is still a lot to do, but it feels great when people of all ages tell us they had a wonderful time.

Our website has helped us a lot, and we are now in touch with other film clubs around the country. We have visited them to see how they do things, but it’s always nice to return to our own club! We also started a blog because most people look for film information online instead of reading local papers. We have put up some posters in cafés, but the best way to get new members is when people tell their friends about us. 

The audience loves the special activities we organize with each film. Last month, we had a movie quiz that everyone enjoyed!"
71,"Taking photographs was my favorite activity when I was a child. When I turned 15, I wanted to make my hobby more special. So, I decided to start a personal project: I would take one photograph every day for a whole year. Many young photographers had done this before, but I thought it was a great idea, so I began.

After a few weeks, I decided to share my photos on a website for young photographers. I wanted to create a photo diary and show my work to others. I was surprised to find that people liked my way of taking photos. I enjoyed photographing many different subjects. Then, someone suggested that if my photos had a common theme, my project would be even better. I agreed and started focusing on nature, especially birds and the sky.

Most of my photos were black and white, which was different from what many other young photographers were doing, as they were taking color photos. Because of this, I sometimes doubted my project and almost gave up. But in the end, I trusted my feelings and became more confident in my style.

One day, I showed my project to my art teacher. She told me about a national photography competition for my age group. I entered some of my photos just for fun. I will never forget the moment when the judges told me I had won first prize. I was so happy because my project meant a lot to me. It was the first time I realized that my photography might be good, and I could work as a professional photographer. Now, I have my own photography studio, and I have never regretted my choice of career."
72,"I joined the National Youth Challenge (NYC) last year because I wanted to try new things like camping, sailing, and public speaking. In the NYC, you can do many activities that help you learn and challenge yourself. There are different levels, from beginner to advanced, and adult volunteers called ‘leaders’ help run the programs. When you finish each level, you get a certificate.

When I first joined, my leader suggested that I help organize activities at a local children’s club for two hours a week. I was unsure about this because I had joined that same club when I was eight, and I found it hard to make friends. I was shy, and the other kids already had their own friends, so I stopped going after a few weeks. However, I decided to take the challenge because I wanted to earn my first NYC certificate.

Soon, I started to enjoy spending time at the children’s club. It became more important to me than just getting the certificate. After I finished the challenge, the NYC leader let me keep volunteering at the club because I had made good friendships with the children. Now, I go there for about four hours a week, and I always look forward to it.

Because of what I learned at the children’s club, I decided that when I finish school in three years, I want to go to college to become a youth worker, someone who helps children. I had never thought about this job before I started at the club. This has been my favorite part of the NYC, and I have improved my communication skills while helping others. I now have several NYC certificates, and one of them is for camping!"
73,"I was born in Denver, USA, and I started snowboarding when I was eight years old. My dad took me to a mountain resort, which is about two hours from Denver. The hill looked very steep, and my dad had to convince me to try snowboarding. I was too young to ask him if I could start, but he loved snowboarding and wanted me to enjoy it too. He made it look easy, and in the end, I did well. Soon, I loved the sport and got better at it. I began competing when I was ten years old. Some people enter many competitions and get bored, but my love for snowboarding and winning has grown as I got older. This helps me to work harder.

I like not having a strict plan, and sometimes this works out well. For example, I became the first female to get a perfect score of 100 at a local competition. I wasn’t sure I could do the jumps that got me this score until I tried. This achievement made me trust my abilities more. In the summer, I focus on training and studying when there is no snow. I train every day, but I don’t have to follow a strict diet like in winter. I also spend a lot of time with my friends, which helps me deal with not being able to snowboard.

I think carefully about my future. Snowboarding is a big part of my life, but I know it’s important to have another plan in case I don’t become a professional snowboarder or if I get injured. I am thinking about becoming a doctor if I can find time to go to college. I can’t imagine getting tired of snowboarding, but I know I can’t do it forever."
74,"When I was fifteen, I wanted everything my friends had, and I never thought about the future. For example, I didn’t know what I wanted to do after school. One day, my best friend got a new phone for her birthday, and I wanted one too. My parents said I could only have it if I paid for it myself, so I decided to work part-time and save money. I am thankful to my parents for making me do this because it taught me an important lesson.

I worked every Saturday in a café, but I didn’t enjoy it much. My parents suggested I start my own small business instead. I had seen my mum making necklaces, so I asked if I could try it too. I thought it would be hard, but it was easier than I expected. My friends thought it was boring, but I was excited about it. My mum showed me that I could make something nice at home with simple tools and materials.

I sold my first pieces of jewellery to my friends and family. They said they loved them, but I thought they were just being nice. Even though I was happy they bought them, I still needed to know if other people would like them too. So, I rented a market stall with my mum. There are many tourists where I live, and they bought a lot of my jewellery to take home. Soon, we started getting calls from all over the country from people wanting to buy more. They thought we were a big company with many workers, but it was just me and my mum at the market!

That’s when I realized my business could be successful, and I decided to create a website. Since then, I have made a lot of money from my business, mostly online, but we still have our market stall. It has been a lot of fun!"
75,"When Janine Stuart was 13 years old, she wrote a novel called Being Amelia, which became very popular. The book is partly about Janine’s own life. In an interview, Janine said, “Because my father’s job made us move a lot, I learned to make new friends easily. I know what it’s like to be the new student in a class, and that helped me write about Amelia, the main character, who starts at a new school. Some funny parts of the book are about Amelia’s home life, especially her relationship with her older brother. Since I am an only child, I had to use my imagination to describe that.”

Janine started writing her novel one summer when she was bored at home. Her mother always wanted to be a published author, and her teachers encouraged her to write, so it felt natural for Janine to write. The year before, she won a short story competition on a young writers’ website. This is why, when she finished Being Amelia and sent it to a publishing company, they were excited to read it. They loved the book, and a year later, it was in bookstores.

One review of Being Amelia says that even though the cover shows happy teenagers, the characters face real challenges, which makes them believable. The reviewer noted that even though Janine is young and her book is not very long, she is a better writer than many other bestselling authors.

Janine is still getting used to being a famous writer. She said, “At first, I hid when people recognized me in the street, but now it’s fine. I want to give advice to other young writers, but they need to find what works for them. For me, I just need to spend time with my friends, and I will have something interesting to write about!”"
76,"I’m Tom, and I’m fifteen years old. Three years ago, my family and I moved into a castle on a small island! It all started when my dad was asked to be the manager of the castle. He works for a group that takes care of historical buildings and keeps them open for visitors. He was happy because he thought this was a great opportunity, but it took some time for the rest of us to agree that he should take the job. We were worried about what life on the island would be like. We knew the castle might not be as comfortable as our warm home across the water, and there was no school there.

After we moved, we quickly got used to living on the island. The castle isn’t very beautiful, but our apartment in it is nice. In the summer, the island is lively because many visitors come, and there are often beach parties. In winter, we only see the other families who live on the island, and there aren’t many teenagers like me. The adults help each other with repairs on the island, which can be hard work.

The biggest change for me was taking a boat every day to my old school. I looked forward to going on stormy days when there are big waves, but the ferries don’t run then! I also found out that if I miss the bus to the harbor after school, I miss the last ferry home, which is stressful. So when my friends come to visit, I always tell them to hurry! But we often see amazing views, especially when the sun sets over the sea. Some days, it’s so foggy that you can’t see anything, but then it can be bright and sunny again in just a few hours. It still feels incredible when that happens, even after living here for a long time. 

Of course, we do have bad storms, and I sometimes wonder if the castle is strong enough to stay safe. But then I remember it has been here for hundreds of years, and it is still standing!"
77,"I live in a house in the beautiful countryside of Scotland. I have always loved nature and wild animals. Six years ago, I started a new hobby: birdwatching! I went to the mountains in northern Scotland with my family, where we saw many birds in their natural homes. I spent hours watching them with my parents, who taught me how to tell different bird species apart and where to find them. It was amazing! After we came back home, I joined a local club for young birdwatchers. My goal is to see 200 different bird species, and I am almost there. On family holidays abroad, I have seen birds from other countries too. We always look for places with birdwatching activities so I can add new birds to my list!

I have been to Egypt, and last summer we went to South America, where I thought I would see my 200th species. I was not too disappointed when it didn’t happen because I learned that you need to be patient with this hobby. I made a video about this challenge and many teenagers liked it and said it looked interesting. When my teachers saw it, they asked me to give a presentation about birdwatching at school. I felt nervous just before I walked onto the stage because the whole school and my friends were watching me! I relaxed after it was over, and the teachers said I did well and they enjoyed it. I might even do another presentation next year!

I am lucky to live in the countryside. I understand why many teenagers in cities might not think about becoming birdwatchers, but there are many birds to see, especially in green areas. I believe birdwatching clubs should try to get more young people interested in this hobby. Everyone should connect with nature, no matter their age, and it doesn’t have to cost a lot of money."
78,"I started playing football when I was 7 years old. I would hurry home from school to play with other kids. I loved it, and after some time, I became a good player. My family knew I often liked new hobbies but then stopped doing them, so they thought I would do the same with football. But that didn’t happen. I even dreamed of playing football professionally when I grew up. 

The chance came sooner than I expected. I played in local tournaments, and one referee saw that I was a talented player. He asked the manager of a professional women’s club to watch me play. After that, she invited me to join her club. I was surprised because I didn’t know young girls could join women’s clubs. But the manager liked my skills, and I started training with a big club when I was just 13 years old. I improved a lot after that.

Even so, some people were not sure I would become a star player, which made me a little sad. But my coach told me to be myself and believe in my abilities. He even let me play in an important match earlier than I thought I would! I ran very hard because I didn’t want to let my team down. Luckily, I scored the winning goal! Even with a big crowd, I could hear my coach cheering for me, and after the match, my team carried me around the field. It was amazing! Since then, I have scored many more winning goals.

Next month, my coach and I are organizing a football tournament in my area. The goal is to get teenagers interested in football and to let them meet other players from my club. It will show them what it is like to be in a professional environment and encourage them to think they could play for a top team if they work hard. My advice to them will be the same as my coach gave me – there will be good times and bad times. I have had very few bad times, so I feel lucky!"
79,"One interesting change in education in the UK and around the world in recent years is that schools and universities want new students to start doing research as soon as they can. This shows that research is not just for famous scholars or scientists, but is a natural way to build knowledge and skills. Research skills are important not only for studying but also for jobs, as they help us think about the world and how to do our work.

As a student, you can contribute to knowledge. You do not just learn and repeat information; you create it. Creating knowledge means asking questions instead of just accepting things. You might wonder: Why? How? When? What does this mean? What if things were different? These questions are at the heart of research.

Research can be seen in two ways. On one side, there is complex and groundbreaking research done by highly trained experts. On the other side, there is everyday research that involves asking thoughtful questions about issues and making practical suggestions. Most students have done some form of research before. You have likely asked questions and looked for answers in school or at work since you started learning.

In college and higher education, it is important to have a curious mind, identify problems, and critically explore information. You are expected to create your own knowledge and add to discussions. Some students may find this difficult because, in some cultures, knowledge is seen as fixed, and students are expected to listen to teachers and texts without questioning them. However, in the UK, US, and many other places, it is important to question established knowledge and those who claim to be experts.

This process of questioning and creating knowledge can be challenging. Critical thinking is very important in research. The research done by others can help us as students and in our future jobs, but we should not just repeat what we read. We need to think about it, test it, and check if it makes sense and is supported by evidence. We should not blindly accept facts and information from others without thinking critically."
80,"Cities have always been important places for ideas and discussions. In the 18th century, people in London met in coffee houses to talk about science and politics. In modern Paris, artist Pablo Picasso shared his thoughts on art in cafés. However, living in a city can be difficult. The same cafés in London that encouraged conversation also helped spread diseases like cholera, and Picasso eventually moved to the countryside.

Today, cities are known for creativity, but they can also feel overwhelming. Scientists are studying how city life affects our brains, and their findings are surprising. While we have always known that city life can be tiring, new research shows that living in a city can actually make it harder for us to think clearly. One big reason for this is the lack of nature in cities. Studies show that hospital patients heal faster when they can see trees from their windows. Even small views of nature can help our brains relax and improve our thinking.

For the first time in history, more people live in cities than in rural areas. Instead of being in open spaces, we are surrounded by many strangers in crowded places. This unnatural environment can affect our mental and physical health and change how we think. When we walk down a busy street, our brains have to pay attention to many things: people, traffic, and confusing street layouts. These small tasks can tire us out because our brains are always trying to focus and avoid dangers.

Natural environments, on the other hand, do not require as much mental effort. This idea is called attention restoration theory, created by psychologist Stephen Kaplan. He believed that being in nature can help our brains recover. Natural places have things that catch our attention without causing stress, unlike loud noises like police sirens. This allows our minds to relax and recharge.

Long before scientists studied this, philosophers and landscape designers warned about the negative effects of city life and looked for ways to bring nature into cities. Parks, like Central Park in New York, give people a break from city life. A well-designed park can help our brains feel better in just a few minutes. While many people try different ways to improve their thinking, such as energy drinks or new office designs, walking in nature seems to be one of the best solutions.

Despite the mental challenges of city life, cities continue to grow. Research shows that the same crowded features of cities that can make it hard to focus also help create new ideas. The close social interactions in cities are important for creativity. Just like the crowded streets of 18th-century London led to new ideas, the busy environment of modern cities can also inspire innovation. However, less crowded areas might not produce as many new ideas over time.

The challenge is to find ways to reduce the stress of city living while keeping its benefits. As the saying goes, there will always be times when people feel tired of nature and want to return to the city."
81,"Where should we look for the mind? This question might seem strange because we usually think that thinking happens inside our heads. Today, we have advanced brain imaging techniques to support this idea. However, I believe we should not limit the study of the mind to just the brain or the body. There is a lot of evidence, from ancient times to now, showing that objects and tools also play a role in how we think. 

For example, in archaeology, we see that stone tools, jewelry, carvings, clay tokens, and writing systems have all helped shape human evolution and our minds. So, what is outside our heads might also be part of our minds. It is easy to connect the mind with the brain because most of what we know about the mind comes from studying people without the objects they usually use. This is useful for scientists who study the brain, but it can make us forget that much of our thinking happens with the help of things around us.

I do not want to deny that the brain is important for thinking, but I want to show that the mind is more than just the brain. I suggest we explore the idea that human intelligence extends beyond our bodies into culture and the material world. This is where my new theory, called Material Engagement Theory (MET), comes in. MET looks at how objects can help us think, like when we use clay to make numbers or use a stone to create a tool. It also studies how these ways of thinking have changed over time and what that means for us.

This approach helps us understand what minds are and how they work by looking at how objects help our thinking. For example, think about a blind person using a stick. Where does this person’s self begin? The connection between the blind person and the stick shows how minds and objects can work together. The stick helps the blind person feel their surroundings, and the brain treats the stick as part of the body. 

The stick reminds us that human intelligence can change and adapt by using new tools. I see the human mind as something that is always developing and evolving. It is important to remember that, throughout history, tools have been pathways for us to explore and understand the world, not just barriers. 

For humans, tools are used to satisfy our curiosity. This special ability to engage with objects explains why we create things and how those things shape our minds. I call this metaplasticity, which means our minds can change and grow as we interact with the world around us. I want to bring the importance of objects back into how we think about the mind. MET provides a new way to understand how different tools, from ancient stone tools to modern smartphones, have influenced who we are and how we think. While the idea of technology changing our minds may sound futuristic, humans have been using it since the beginning of our existence."
82,"Text: ""Few inventions have changed our lives as much as photography. This is especially true in the United States, where photography quickly became part of everyday life. It is used in science, industry, art, and entertainment. Historians believe that photography is one of the greatest contributions of the US to the visual arts. This shows how important photography has become in American culture, and to understand its impact, we need to look at its beginnings in the mid-19th century.

Why was photography so popular? First, it was a mechanical process that matched the growing interest in technology. People were excited about changes in their lives, like steam power and electricity, which made communication and travel easier. Photography brought images of the world into people's homes in a new and exciting way.

Second, the camera became a popular tool for showing personal identity. It allowed people to create images of themselves and their families, helping to shape their identities. Third, photographs provided a way for families to keep memories, even if those memories were idealized. Finally, the realistic nature of photographs matched the trend in American art towards showing everyday life.

Every photograph draws attention to something specific, showing what the photographer wants us to see. Because photographs are made by machines, they are records of real events, people, and things. However, each photograph also reflects the photographer's personal view. We might think we understand a photograph because we recognize the subject, but the meaning of a photograph can be more complicated.

Photographs do not speak for themselves. They are always presented with some context, like a caption in a newspaper or their placement in a gallery. To understand a photograph's history, we need to consider why the photographer took it and how people first saw it. The same image can have different meanings depending on where and when it is viewed.

For a long time, the importance of the camera in art was not well known, but now it is clear. In recent decades, artists like Andy Warhol have used photographs in their work in many ways. Today, photography is seen as an important part of art, working alongside painting and helping us understand representation before the camera was invented."""
83,"In 1890, William James, an American philosopher and doctor, defined psychology as the ""science of mental life."" This definition helps us understand psychology even today. Everyone has a mental life, so we have some idea of what this means. Psychology can be studied in humans, rats, and monkeys, but it is still a complex topic. James focused on human psychology, which he believed included basic elements like thoughts, feelings, the physical world, and how we know about these things. Our knowledge is mostly personal and comes from our own experiences, which may or may not match scientific facts.

Because of this, we often make judgments about psychological issues based on our own experiences. We act like amateur psychologists when we share our opinions on complex topics, such as whether brainwashing works or why people behave in certain ways. Problems can arise when two people understand things differently. Formal psychology tries to find methods to determine which explanations are most likely correct in different situations. Psychologists help us tell the difference between our subjective thoughts, which can be biased, and objective facts.

Psychology studies the mind and brain, but psychologists do not fully understand how the brain works in relation to our feelings, hopes, and behaviors. It is often hard to study the brain directly, so psychologists learn more by observing behavior and making educated guesses about what happens inside us. A challenge in psychology is that scientific facts should be objective, but we cannot see the mind like we can see a machine. We can only understand the mind through behavior.

Studying psychology is like solving a crossword puzzle. It requires careful observation, accurate measurement, and logical thinking. Psychology aims to describe, understand, predict, and control the processes it studies. When psychologists achieve these goals, they can help us understand our experiences and apply this knowledge to real life. Psychological research has helped improve teaching methods, design safer machines, and support people dealing with emotional distress.

Although people have discussed psychological questions for centuries, scientific investigation of these questions has only happened in the last 150 years. Early psychologists used introspection, which means looking at one’s own thoughts and feelings, to find answers. While this method is still interesting, it has limitations. As Sir Francis Galton said, it only shows a small part of what the brain does automatically. William James compared trying to understand the mind through introspection to quickly turning on a light to see the darkness. Today, psychologists prefer to base their theories on careful observations of others' behavior rather than just their own experiences."
84,"In a storehouse in a regular business park in Michigan, USA, there is a unique place called the Museum of Failed Products. This museum shows products that were taken off the market because very few people wanted to buy them. It is owned by a company called GfK. The museum's owner, Carol Sherry, believes that each product has a sad story about the designers and marketers who created it.

What is surprising is that this museum exists as a business. Many companies do not keep samples of their failed products, showing how little they want to think about their failures. The museum started by accident. Robert McMath, a former marketing worker, wanted to create a library of consumer products, not just failed ones. He began collecting every new item he could find in the 1960s. He did not realize that most products fail. Because of this, his collection ended up being mostly unsuccessful products.

Today’s positive culture may be a reason why many products in the museum failed. Each product likely went through meetings where people did not see the problems. Even if they did, marketers might have put more money into a failing product to save face. There was little effort to understand why the products did not work, and people often avoided talking about it.

This focus on being positive is also common in the self-help industry. One popular idea is ""positive visualization,"" which suggests that if you imagine good outcomes, they are more likely to happen. Research by neuroscientist Tali Sharot shows that people may be naturally inclined to think things will go well, which can help them survive. However, her studies also suggest that people who are mentally healthy may not have a clear view of their true abilities compared to those who are depressed.

Psychologist Gabriele Oettingen has studied how thinking positively about the future affects motivation. Her findings show that spending time imagining success can actually reduce people's motivation to reach their goals. For example, people who thought about having a great week at work ended up achieving less.

Another psychologist, Carol Dweck, explains that how we view failure is connected to our beliefs about ability. People with a ""fixed mindset"" think that ability is something you are born with. They find failure very scary because it shows they did not meet expectations. For instance, a sports star who believes he is a natural talent may not practice enough and fail. On the other hand, people with a ""growth mindset"" see failure as a chance to learn and improve. Dweck compares this to weight training, where muscles grow stronger by being pushed to their limits. Having a growth mindset is not only better for success but also leads to a happier life."
85,"Text: 

Everyone knows that sports teams usually do better when they play at home. But why is that? Many people think they know the answer, but professional sports are changing quickly, and what we thought was true is now being questioned. Two main reasons for this are science and money. Sports scientists want to understand what helps players perform their best, and they have many ideas about home advantage. At the same time, people who invest money in sports want to know why home advantage is still important. If players are paid well, shouldn’t they feel comfortable playing anywhere?

What about the fans? Would it matter if a team like Manchester United played some of their home games far away, like in Asia, to reach more fans? It would matter to the fans in Britain, who believe their support is important for the team. Fans often think that the order of events explains what happens. For example, when a team plays well, the home fans cheer loudly, and sometimes this leads to a goal. Fans remember the times they cheered and a goal was scored, but they forget the many times they cheered and nothing happened.

There is one idea that seems to be supported by science. Home fans not only cheer for their team but also direct their noise at the referee. In a famous study, referees watched a game with crowd noise and another group watched the same game in silence. The referees who heard the crowd were less likely to call fouls against the home team. This shows that referees try to avoid making calls that would upset the home crowd.

Recent studies show that home advantage has decreased in many sports, but not as much as expected. For example, in the early days of the Football League in the 1890s, home teams won about 70% of the points, while today they win about 60%. One reason for this change is travel. In the past, traveling was difficult, but now players travel in comfort, and if their hotel isn’t good, the team will find them a better one. Stadiums also look more similar now, which may affect the home advantage.

However, these explanations do not fully explain the data. Home advantage varies by sport. Basketball has the most home advantage, followed by football, while baseball has the least. One reason could be that baseball is more about individual players, while team sports like basketball rely on teamwork. In basketball, players build confidence by playing together at home, which helps them perform better.

Another interesting finding is about players’ testosterone levels. Researchers found that players’ testosterone levels were normal before away games, but they were much higher before home games. This increase may be linked to a natural desire to protect their home ground. In recent Rugby World Cup games, underdog teams won at home against stronger teams, showing the power of home advantage. As one referee said, “It’s the law of the jungle out there.”"
86,"Text: ""‘The more I practice, the luckier I get,’ said golfer Gary Player many years ago. This saying is popular among athletes and their coaches. It is easy to understand why. First, many people argue about who really said it first. Second, the meaning is not clear. Player did not mean luck in a real way; he was being ironic. His real message was: ‘The more I practice, the better I get.’ 

But there is a limit to this idea. The question of where that limit is, or if it even exists, is part of a big discussion about whether talent is something you are born with or something you can develop through practice. This discussion is not balanced; it seems that practice is much more important than natural talent. 

Psychologist Anders Ericsson is known for saying that anyone can become an expert in any field with 10,000 hours of practice. Many books, like Malcolm Gladwell’s Outliers, support this idea. They all say that practice is the most important thing, and that ‘10,000 hours is enough to make anyone an expert in anything.’ 

However, in his interesting book, Epstein argues that this is not always true. He points out a big problem in studies about successful people: they often only look at those who are already excellent. He asks if there are other ways to understand why some people have special abilities while others do not. He travels around the world, from Kenya to Sweden, to find answers. 

In Alaska, he learns that in a tough sled dog race, the dogs’ drive and desire are very important. This suggests that some traits might be connected to genetics. Some people think that commitment and determination are choices, but Epstein wonders if they might also be influenced by genes. 

He talks about the difference between ‘hardware’ (nature) and ‘software’ (nurture). He believes that both are important for elite athletes. For example, if Usain Bolt had grown up in the US, he might have been a good basketball player instead of the fastest man in the world. 

Epstein also discusses race and gender. He asks: ‘If only practice matters, why do we separate men and women in sports?’ Sometimes, the best questions are the most obvious."""
87,"A recent international report shows that many children in rich countries feel lonely and unhappy. Jay Griffiths asks a simple question: why are today’s children so sad? In her new book, Kith, she explains that these children spend too much time indoors, looking at screens like TVs and computers, and they have lost touch with nature, like forests, mountains, and rivers. She believes this is a big part of the problem.

A follow-up study talked to some children to understand their feelings better. The children did not say they wanted more high-tech toys; many said they would be happier if they could go outside more. Older people often remember their own childhoods fondly, saying they enjoyed playing outside, swimming, and exploring. They think this was better and healthier than how children live today. However, they often forget that they created the rules that keep their children indoors, worried about safety.

Griffiths discusses how parents' fears about dangers outside lead them to buy more toys and gadgets to keep their children entertained at home. She also talks about strange rules, like giving medicine to children who can’t sit still or making them wear goggles during games. It’s unclear how common these rules are, but Griffiths expresses her anger about them in a strong way. She also shares her thoughts on childhood freedom and rules, from fairy tales to school regulations.

While her ideas are interesting, Griffiths sometimes goes too far. She makes strong claims, even comparing how we treat children today to racism, which seems extreme. She has a romantic view of children, believing they are naturally good and creative. However, this view might not match reality, especially when dealing with energetic young kids.

One important idea in her book is that children should be allowed to explore and take risks. Griffiths thinks kids need to experience small accidents to learn how to handle bigger dangers later. However, she does not explain how to create these small accidents safely. Also, not all children want to explore the wild; some are shy or prefer to stay at home. Perhaps the real issue is that we try to make all children fit into the same mold, whether by keeping them inside or pushing them outside."
88,"I am a research bio-psychologist with a PhD, which means I have studied a lot. I am good at solving problems in my work and life, but this skill does not come only from school. Many problems in life cannot be solved with complicated formulas or answers we memorize in school. They need judgment, wisdom, and creativity that come from life experiences. For children, these experiences happen during play. 

My recent research focuses on how important play is for children's development. All mammals, including humans, play when they are young. Those who have more to learn tend to play more. For example, carnivores (meat-eaters) play more than herbivores (plant-eaters) because hunting is harder to learn than grazing. Primates, like monkeys and apes, play more than other mammals because they need to learn more and rely less on instincts. Children, who have a lot to learn, play more than any other young primates when they can.

Play is a natural way for both adults and mammals to learn. The most important skills children need to live happy and productive lives cannot be taught in school. These skills are learned and practiced through play. They include thinking creatively, getting along with others, cooperating, and controlling emotions. Creativity is very important for success in today’s world. We do not need people who just follow instructions or do simple calculations. We need people who can ask new questions and solve new problems. 

If we can help people think ahead and find solutions, we will have a strong workforce. But this requires creative thinking. Creative people often keep a playful attitude throughout their lives. For example, Albert Einstein said that school almost made him lose interest in math and physics, but he found it again after leaving school. He called his innovative work “combinatorial play.” He imagined chasing a sunbeam and thought about what would happen if he caught it, which helped him develop his ideas.

We cannot teach creativity, but school can sometimes take it away by focusing on fixed questions and answers. More importantly, children need to learn how to get along with others, care for them, and cooperate. Children naturally want to play with each other, and through play, they learn social skills, fairness, and morality, which are important for their future.

Play is voluntary, meaning players can choose to stop whenever they want. If they cannot stop, it is not really play. Players know they must keep each other happy to continue the game. This freedom makes play a very democratic activity. 

However, school has become more difficult. There are fewer breaks, more homework, and more pressure for high grades. Outside of school, organized sports have taken the place of spontaneous games. “Play dates” with adult supervision have replaced unsupervised play in neighborhoods, and adults often feel they need to step in instead of letting children solve their own problems. 

These changes have happened slowly but have had a big impact over time. They are caused by many social factors, like parents’ fears, warnings from experts about dangers, less connected neighborhoods, and the belief that children learn more from adults than from each other. 

Our children do not need more school; they need more play. If we care about our children and future generations, we must change this trend that has been happening for the last fifty years. We need to give childhood back to children. They should be allowed to play and explore so they can grow into strong adults ready for an unpredictable future."
89,"In many countries, more young people in their twenties are using social media to find jobs. Websites like Twitter and LinkedIn allow them to connect directly with potential employers. This is different from the old way of trying to get noticed by standing outside an office with a sign saying ""hire me."" However, using social media can also lead to mistakes.

For example, a young job seeker in the US tried to connect with a senior marketing executive on LinkedIn. This executive had many important contacts, and the job seeker thought she could help him. But the executive was upset by his request. She refused to connect with him and sent a rude message that became very popular online. Many people were shocked by her response, and she might regret how she acted. However, if this incident makes young people think more carefully about using social media for work, it could be a good thing.

Social media can be risky for job seekers who do not know how to use it properly. Many young people have been using sites like Facebook and Twitter for years for their social lives. When older generations were teenagers, social media was a way to escape from parents and teachers. It was a place to show off and be creative. You could have long conversations online and then ignore those people in real life. You could also change how you looked to others by choosing different pictures or songs for your profile.

But using social media for professional reasons is very different. Some young people do not see this difference. They may still act like they did when they were teenagers, thinking that being bold and confident is good. Just because many people liked your posts on Facebook does not mean you will impress employers on LinkedIn. Young people need to understand that the rules of social networking have changed, and they must meet employers' expectations to succeed in their careers.

One common complaint from employers is that young job seekers are too casual in their messages and seem arrogant. This makes older generations think that young people feel entitled. In reality, many young people are struggling to find jobs, which is why they are using social media. This impression of arrogance can hurt their chances, even if they have the skills and motivation to be good employees.

So, how should you contact someone on a professional networking site? First, clearly explain who you are and what you can offer them, like helping with research. This way, you have a better chance of getting a helpful response. Avoid sending generic messages, and keep your tone polite to make a good impression. Remember, social media can help you make important connections, but you need to use it carefully to avoid being ignored."
90,"Text: ""Anyone who says they can predict the future of newspapers is either lying or not thinking clearly. The numbers show that newspapers are in trouble. Since 2000, the number of people reading most UK national newspapers has dropped by one-third to one-half. In the USA, the Pew Research Centre reports that only 26% of people get their news from newspapers now, down from 45% in 2001. Many people believe that printed newspapers will disappear within 15 years. However, history shows that old forms of media often survive. 

For example, in 1835, a journalist in New York said that books and theater were finished and that newspapers would be the most important source of news. But theater survived, even with the rise of newspapers, cinema, and television. Radio has also done well during the TV era, and cinema has continued to thrive despite videos and DVDs. Even vinyl records have become popular again, with online sales increasing by 745% since 2008.

Newspapers were once a new form of media, but it took a long time for them to become the main source of news. This happened because, in the mid-19th century, it became easier and cheaper to produce news for many people thanks to inventions like the steam press, railways, and the telegraph. People also started to believe that everything around them was always changing, and they wanted regular updates. In the past, people only noticed changes with the seasons or during disasters like famine or disease.

Before the 19th century, journalism was not a full-time job that could support someone. Even then, most people did not see the need for news every day or week. The regular publication of newspapers can sometimes feel limiting. Today, online news allows people to read what they want when they want. Advanced search engines help us find news that matters to us. When big news happens, online news can provide updates every minute. Mistakes can be corrected quickly, and we can access full documents related to news stories.

This is very different from the limitations of newspapers. However, many news providers seem more focused on being the first to report news and getting comments from readers, rather than helping people understand the news. In the past, news was often shared in busy places like markets or taverns, where truth mixed with rumors and misunderstandings. In some ways, we seem to be going back to that time.

Newspapers have not always done a good job of explaining how the world works. They might be facing extinction. Or maybe, as the internet adds to our feeling that we live in a confusing world, newspapers will find a way to help us understand things better."""
91,"If humans really felt at home under the moon and stars, we would walk happily in the dark, just like many animals that are active at night. But we are daytime creatures, with eyes that are made for sunlight. This is a part of our nature, even if we don’t think about it. This is why we have changed the night by adding light. We have made the night bright, similar to how we can change a river’s flow. However, this change has a downside called light pollution, which scientists are just starting to study.

Light pollution happens mostly because of poor lighting design. This means that artificial light shines in the wrong directions, lighting up the sky instead of focusing on the ground where it is needed. Bad lighting makes the night less dark, which affects many living things, including us. When artificial light spreads into nature, it can change important activities like migration, reproduction, and feeding.

For most of human history, the term ‘light pollution’ would not have made sense. Imagine walking towards London on a moonlit night in 1800, when it was the largest city in the world. Almost a million people lived there, using candles and lanterns for light. There were only a few gas-lit houses, and no public streetlights yet. From a distance, you would smell London more than see its faint glow.

We have brightened the night as if it were empty, but many animals are active at night. Light is a strong force in nature, attracting many species. For example, scientists have seen songbirds and seabirds getting confused by bright lights, flying in circles until they fall. Birds that migrate at night often crash into tall buildings that are brightly lit, and young birds are especially affected. Some birds, like blackbirds and nightingales, sing at strange times because of artificial light.

At first, people thought light pollution only bothered astronomers, who need to see the stars clearly. But we all need darkness, just like we need light. Without darkness, our bodies do not work properly, which can lead to health problems. The natural cycle of day and night is important for our well-being. Changing this cycle is like changing our balance.

In the end, humans are just as affected by light pollution as frogs living near a bright highway. By living in our own bright lights, we have lost touch with our natural and cultural roots – the stars and the natural rhythms of day and night. Light pollution makes us forget our true place in the universe and the beauty of a dark night filled with stars."
92,"A founder of a big international company recently said that his company will no longer keep track of how much paid holiday time employees take. This idea seems to come from a smaller internet company that has a similar policy. The founder mentioned that he got the idea from a happy email from his daughter. However, some people think this way of announcing the change is not very sincere and may hide a less generous decision.

The internet company has 2,000 employees and offers one service, while the multinational company has 50,000 employees and many different services, like finance, transport, and healthcare. The idea of ""take as much time off as you want"" might work better in a smaller company where employees know each other's work schedules. The founder said employees can take as much leave as they want, but only if they are sure their absence will not hurt the business or their careers. But is it really possible to be that sure? No matter how much work you finish before a holiday, there will always be more work waiting when you return.

If employees follow these guidelines, they might not take any holiday at all or feel very guilty about taking time off. This guilt can lead to stress, and if workers do not take enough leave, it could lower their productivity over time. There may also be pressure from coworkers and gossip about who is taking time off and for how long. In many companies, there is a culture of working late, which could lead to a ""no holiday"" culture where employees feel they cannot take time off.

If the legal rights to paid leave are removed, workers might feel they cannot take the time they need because they do not want to seem lazy. This could lead to a situation where employees do not feel they can take their entitled leave, or they might still use their legal rights as a guide, making the new policy useless.

Modern technology makes it easy to receive work messages anytime, which blurs the line between work and free time. The internet company started its unlimited leave policy because employees wanted to know how to balance this new way of working with the old rules about time off. However, without set working hours, employees might feel they are always being watched, which can lead to stress.

Employment laws exist for a reason. Workers have the right to a minimum amount of paid leave because taking breaks is important for their mental and physical health. The benefits of unlimited leave, like better morale and creativity, can happen without sacrificing worker well-being. Therefore, I am not sure if allowing employees to take as much holiday as they want is really the goal or will be the result of this policy."
93,"**Simplified Text:**

Journal-based peer review is the process where experts check a scientific research paper before it is published. This process is seen as important for ensuring the quality of research. It is supposed to stop bad or silly papers from being published. However, reviewing a paper can take a long time, sometimes up to a year. Is this delay worth it? The answer is both yes and no. 

I still believe that papers should be checked before they are published, but I see changes happening. More researchers are using preprints, which are drafts of papers shared online without peer review. Preprints help researchers share new findings quickly so others can read and discuss them. 

Publishing in journals has become more about gaining fame and advancing careers. This focus can change the motivations of authors and reviewers. Scientists often compete to publish in top journals, which can lead to great research. But the pressure to publish in these journals can also lead to shortcuts, where important data is left out. Reviewers now often decide if a paper is good enough for a journal rather than if it is good research. For top journals, the decision can depend on how interesting or newsworthy the paper is, not just its scientific quality.

Many people know about these problems, but few want to change the current system. However, some experts believe that preprints could help solve these issues without changing everything. Preprints have been around for twenty years, but not all scientists use them. Some think that journals will not accept papers that have been shared as preprints. There is also a worry that publishing papers without peer review could lead to bad science, but this has not happened yet.

Preprints may not be peer-reviewed, but authors know that their work will be open to feedback from a global community of reviewers. For example, Tanya Elks, a psychology professor, shared her experience. She wrote a paper that criticized another published paper. In traditional journals, the original authors could block her paper or complain about it. But by using a preprint, both sides could share their views openly, allowing readers to judge the arguments themselves. 

Preprint archives allow scientists to discuss their work informally on a larger scale. They can also be a good place to share negative results, which are often ignored by journals that focus only on new discoveries. Additionally, papers on preprint archives are read and cited more often, showing that sharing work this way is effective. By using the internet's openness and the collaborative spirit of the scientific community, preprints can help shift the focus back to the research itself, rather than where it is published."
94,"When I ask my literature students what a poem is, they often say it is ""a painting in words."" But this answer usually does not satisfy anyone. One day, I asked a group of students to pick an object and write two paragraphs about it. One paragraph was to describe the object like a scientist, and the other was to be from the object's point of view, titled ""Poem."" One student wrote about an oxygen mask. This unusual choice helped the class understand how poetry works in a unique way. The exercise was fun and led to interesting discussions.

When I was in school, I found poetry confusing. I thought every poem was a silly puzzle that made it hard to understand feelings. After school, many people pay less attention to poetry. Sometimes, you see a poem, and it stands out because it is not like regular writing. It challenges you to read it, but often you feel let down because it is boring or hard to understand. 

What do we want from the poems we read? We might expect them to express deep feelings, beautiful images, or clever thoughts. But if we want tears, we watch movies; if we want information, we read articles. Novels take us to different worlds, and music combines words and melodies in a way that is hard to beat. 

However, one thing that poems can do is show us ambiguity, which is common in everyday life. But this still does not explain what a poem really is. If you look up ""poem"" online, it leads you to ""poetry,"" which is described as a type of art that uses the beauty and rhythm of language. This is a complicated definition. The word ""poem"" comes from the Greek word ""poí?ma,"" which means ""a thing made,"" and a poet is someone who makes things. So, if a poem is a ""thing made,"" what kind of thing is it?

Some poets compare poems to wild animals, which are unpredictable, or to machines, which are precise. But these comparisons can break down when we think about them closely. The best part of trying to define a poem through comparison is the discussion it creates. Whether you see a poem as a machine or a wild animal, this can change how you think about both. It can help us see ordinary things in a new way.

We often remember song lyrics, showing how powerful the mix of words and music can be. A poem on a page can have a strong impact, even though it looks like the prose around it. The empty space around a poem could have been used for a longer article or an ad. A poem is written and rewritten like any article or story, but it is not usually made to be sold. Publishers promote poetry collections, but they do not expect them to make money. A poem exists for its own sake, and because of its special place in a magazine or book, it can still surprise us, even if just for a moment."
95,"I bought my first metal detector soon after I got married. £70 was a lot of money back then, and I could have spent it on something useful for our home. However, my wife, Marion, was very impressed when I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first trip. Over the years, every brooch and coin I found made me happy because it connected me to the past. But after the gold ring, it took 40 years before I found something that impressed Marion again.

One dull February afternoon, I had a couple of hours free and a place in mind to search. It was raining, so I chose a closer spot where I knew there were old farming tools. When my detector beeped for the first time, I found a piece of a metal wheel. Then it beeped again. I tried to ignore it, but I couldn’t walk away without checking. I dug down half a meter and lay in the mud when I saw a round, golden ball. I had found brass curtain rails before, so I tried not to get my hopes up. But as I cleaned it, I saw it was a thick, beautifully designed loop. I stopped and stared, remembering to breathe. I had seen something like this before at the British Museum. It was called a torc, a famous necklace from Iron Age Britain, over 2,000 years ago. The word ""torc"" means ""twist,"" and it is made of gold and silver, with a gold ring at each end.

I took it to my car and looked at it on the way home. I rinsed it in my kitchen sink, which was probably the first time it had been cleaned in a long time. “Marion!” I shouted, “I have something for you.” When she came in, she stopped and asked, “What is it?” I told her it was a very old and rare piece of jewelry. We didn’t try it on because we were afraid of damaging it. At bedtime, I hid it in our wardrobe. I was worried about it being stolen, so I eventually took it out, unscrewed a floorboard in my office, and hid it there.

The law says I must report such finds to the authorities within 14 days. I wanted to enjoy the torc as much as I could before giving it up. I even took it in a plastic bag to show a friend in the hospital. Finally, I took it to the council office in the same bag. The registrar was talking to someone when I placed the torc on his desk. He turned around, stopped talking, and was surprised. The torc was confirmed as real and was sold to my local council. It is now in the British Museum in London. I received £350,000, which was shared between the owner of the field and me. 

But the torc means more to me than just money. I feel like I have saved something important for the country. People often say to me, “Now that you found something so amazing, will you stop detecting?” But I still find brooches and coins interesting. Just like a fisherman who catches a big fish, I won’t stop searching while there’s a chance to find something even bigger tomorrow."
96,"Sleeping is one of my favorite things about traveling, but I don’t talk about it much because I feel a bit guilty. When my friends share their carefully planned trips with lots of activities like visiting museums and hiking, I just smile and don’t say much. What would they think if they knew that my travel plans often include time for naps during the day and relaxing mornings in nice beds? 

Sleeping better is one of the nice surprises of traveling. When I went to Mexico's Yucatán coast in my early 20s, I was surprised by how many hours I slept—more than 12 hours most days. There were loud birds nearby, but it didn’t bother me. Away from home and my own bed, I could sleep deeply and enjoyably. Without alarm clocks and responsibilities, it was easier to sleep. 

I believe that sleep is part of the travel experience, not just a break from it. When we travel, we see, hear, and smell new things. All these new experiences fill our minds, and when we sleep, we process them. This is why sleep can feel so much deeper when we are traveling. 

People often worry about jet lag, but I think the challenges I face after long trips are more about adjusting to new places and cultures than just time changes. For example, in Trinidad, people wake up very early to avoid the heat, slow down around 10 a.m. when the sun is strong, and then become active again in the cool evening. Even though Trinidad is only one hour ahead of New York, it takes me days to get used to their different sleep patterns. When I finally adjust, I feel like I have truly arrived.

I remember one afternoon in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic. I had a big lunch with new friends in an apartment with a view of the beautiful Caribbean Sea. After eating, we all felt sleepy and the conversation faded. One by one, my friends went to lie down on hammocks and sofas. I understood then why they had so many pillows around. I took some pillows and joined them. I had heard about the Latin American tradition of the siesta, but that day I really experienced it. I shared not just sleep, but a part of Dominican life.

Travel sleep has another great quality: I remember it. Being away from home, I enjoy the new smells, textures, and sounds that fill my mind while I sleep. If the idea of ‘slow travel’—enjoying every moment instead of rushing—is what makes a modern traveler aware, then sleep is the slowest activity of all. Maybe I should stop feeling embarrassed about my love for sleep and tell my ambitious friends that travel sleep is an important part of the experience too."
97,"The woman turned away from the mirror and asked, “What do you think? Be honest.” Mia picked up a nice hat with a soft layer of fabric and a silk bow. “I still think this one looks best on you,” she said politely. The woman wrinkled her nose and made a funny face. “But it’s so boring,” she replied. “Every other woman will wear a hat like that at my daughter’s wedding. This beautiful little hat will make me stand out.” She touched the small red and black top hat on her head. “Yes, this is the one I want,” she decided. 

Mia smiled and agreed that the woman would stand out at the wedding. She thought about her own daughter, Jen, who was turning thirty today. They were having a family gathering, and Mia was excited to see Jen, Dan, and Luke. She was also curious to meet Jen’s friend, Tattie, whom they didn’t know much about. When Jen called last week to ask if she could bring Tattie, Mia’s husband, Jeff, had reacted quickly. “Tattie? What kind of name is that?” he asked. “It’s short for Tatiana,” Mia explained. “I think it’s nice.” Jeff thought it sounded pretentious. He didn’t like anything showy and often told Mia she was too polite. He would have told the woman in the shop that she was choosing the wrong hat and that a trash can lid would look better on her.

An hour later, Mia closed her shop and entered her home, Medlar House, which was just a short walk away. Four years ago, when Luke, their youngest child, moved out, Mia decided to turn the empty barn next to their house into a space for her business. Jeff was doubtful. “Do you really think people want to buy hats?” he asked. But Mia knew from her friends that many women had trouble finding the perfect hat for special occasions. She was right. From the first day, after Jen helped her create a website, Mia’s Hats became successful. Women came from far away to her shop in Little Pelham, where she made them feel welcome and allowed them to try on as many hats as they wanted. She encouraged customers to bring their outfits to make sure everything matched. Recently, she also started selling handbags and costume jewelry."
98,"It’s a long way from London to Atlanta, and in his new American home, Lawrence Okoye thinks about his amazing sports journey. He feels confident but is surprised by how far he has come, from competing in the Olympic final in discus to possibly playing American football. Even though he has never played American football before, Lawrence is likely to be chosen for one of the big teams in the USA.

In Atlanta, Lawrence is still learning about his new position in football. It is surprising that a 21-year-old who is new to the sport could be selected for one of the biggest teams in American sports. But Lawrence is good at proving people wrong. He was offered a place at Oxford University to study law, but he decided to focus on training for discus instead of going to school. After just 20 months of training, he became the fourth-best discus thrower in the world.

Lawrence originally went to Atlanta for warm-weather training for discus because he wanted to prepare for the world championships. When asked about his sudden interest in American football, he said, “It was in the back of my mind, but I only decided to try it when I got to the USA.” He had thought about it while in school in London, but it seemed like a crazy idea at the time. After arriving in America, he learned about the NFL trials in Atlanta. Even though he had never played football, he thought he could be good enough to attend the trials. “Pretty much,” he said when asked if he believed he could make it.

When asked if he was nervous about being tested with experienced players, he said, “No, not at all. I don’t get nervous for many things.” He is not very talkative, but he is sure of his abilities. His performance in various tests showed that he was the most impressive player. “I was very happy to hear that,” he said, showing a bit of pride.

However, he is also cautious. He has no experience in football, so how can he make it into an NFL team? He said, “Coaches have told me I have the right skills. It’s all about how hard I work.” When asked if he would be calm while waiting to hear if he was selected, he replied, “I will be. There’s no pressure on me. Many people say I will be chosen, but I’m not too worried.”

This calmness might come from his disappointing experience in the Olympic discus final, where he came in last. He seems to have moved on from that moment and is proud that he qualified for the final with a great last throw. “That was an amazing day,” he said. “The final didn’t go as I wanted, but that’s part of sports. I can always return to it.”

After his Olympic disappointment, some people thought that he let the experience affect him. Lawrence does not want to talk about it. An NFL player’s minimum salary is over $400,000 a year, so there are clear financial reasons to play. Lawrence has switched from rugby to athletics and now to American football. With all his physical talent, wouldn’t it be better to focus on just one sport? “I understand why someone would say that,” he replied. “I’m trying to achieve something I’ve dreamed about since I was a kid. If it doesn’t work out, I can go back to discus, the sport I love. Every decision I’ve made has been thought out.”"
99,"We had been flying east all night, and I woke up to see that it was already morning. Looking out of the window, I saw the empty land below. The dark shades of brown and green made me feel better because, even though it was mid-September, it was still summer in Siberia. I could see no signs of people, just mountains, streams, and forests stretching to the horizon. I shook my head. 

My neighbor woke up and smiled at me. “Good morning, Robert,” he said slowly with a Russian accent. His name was Sergei, and he was a salesman from Moscow. He was flying to sell safety clothing to the local mining companies. His English was not very good, and my Russian was not great either, but we used a dictionary to talk. I told him I was going to the city of Magadan in far-eastern Siberia with a one-way ticket because I planned to ride my bicycle back home to England. 

“But, Robert,” he said, “there is no road from Magadan; you cannot ride a bicycle.” I explained that I thought there was a road, but not many people used it. “Alone?” he asked, pointing at me. “No, I will ride with a friend named Al.” “Just one friend?” he asked. “Yes, just one,” I nodded. Sergei still looked unsure and pointed outside, saying “Holodna” (cold). I tried to show him with my hands that I had warm clothes, but I didn’t mention that I was on a tight budget. Most of my clothes and gear were bought at low prices. I wasn’t sure if they would be good enough, especially my big postman’s trousers that I bought for £10.

It all started in a lecture hall in Scotland. That morning, the hall was full of tired students. Some were taking notes without much energy. The lecturer was talking on and on. I was thinking about a question. Should I ask him or not? “Well, why not?” I wrote a note to my old school friend Al, who was sitting in front of me. I asked him if he wanted to cycle across the Karakorum Highway between Pakistan and China that summer. He read my note, thought for a moment, wrote something back, and passed it to me. It said, “OK.” 

Now, six years later, I was going to meet Al in Siberia. I had been working as a geography teacher. The job was challenging but also rewarding, and I had long holidays to go on adventures. Twice, I had used these holidays to visit Al. After our bike ride in Pakistan, Al caught the adventure bug and decided to cycle around the world. Since then, he had taken on bigger and bigger challenges. This trip around the world by bike was his biggest yet. Sometimes he thought the ride would be too hard for him, but I envied him. He was having an amazing adventure and facing new challenges every day. He was proving the doubters wrong and doing something that scared him, which made him feel alive."
100,"In The Red Bull Air Race, twelve pilots race through tall pylons that are between 15 and 25 meters high. They make sharp turns, do barrel rolls, and loops while flying at speeds up to 370 km per hour. I was invited to experience what it feels like to be part of this race. 

An hour before my flight, I had to sign two forms. The first form said I was healthy, and the second said I would empty my pockets because small objects can be dangerous during the flight. I learned that I needed to stay aware of my surroundings. I was told, “The horizon is your best friend,” and the pilot would tell me where to look. I also had to promise to relax and enjoy the view when flying upside down.

Half an hour before the flight, I had a safety briefing. I was told not to touch anything during the flight. When we started moving down the runway, I was nervous. My legs were up, my feet were away from the important pedals, and my hands stayed away from the switches. I decided I would not relax and enjoy the flight. This is a challenge in high-speed flying. To stay safe, you need to be calm and focused. You must know when to tense up and when to relax. Panicking is not a good idea.

As we took off, the pilot, Dario, and I quickly turned to the right. It was a sudden move, and I felt the air leave my lungs. I looked at the horizon, tensed my body, and gasped as I sank into my seat. For a moment, I felt like I weighed 6.2 times my normal weight. Then we leveled out and made another sharp turn, diving down. I felt my stomach drop as we flew low, just 10 meters above the ground, aiming for a small space between two pylons. We passed them at 400 km per hour, and I felt excited, but then we turned sharply again.

For two minutes, I got to fly the plane, but my hands were shaking so much that the plane shook too. Then Dario said something, but I couldn’t hear him. Instead of answering, he did a barrel roll, turning the plane completely upside down. He asked if I was okay, and I said yes. He then asked if I had enough, and I lied and said no. After that, he did a loop, flying up and over in a full circle. 

I know many people would find this exciting, like those who enjoy rollercoasters. But for me, it was too much. At the top of the loop, while we were upside down, I heard a voice saying, “Relax, relax, look up.” I looked up and saw some fields. The flight lasted 10 minutes, and it felt easy compared to what the pilots experience during the race. When we landed, Dario happily ate sandwiches, but I didn’t eat for hours. That night, I kept dreaming about the loop over and over again."
101,"Doug Allan films wild animals in cold places. If you have ever seen amazing videos of polar bears in a nature documentary, it is likely that he filmed them. He says his favorite temperature is -18°C. Allan trained as a marine biologist and commercial diver. Diving was his first love, where he learned how to survive in cold environments. His big opportunity came when a TV crew came to Antarctica, where he was working, to make a wildlife documentary. He helped the crew find different locations, and after 48 hours, he realized that being a wildlife cameraman was perfect for him: it included travel, adventure, and underwater experiences.

Now, he is a well-known cameraman and has worked on many important TV wildlife series. He started his career at a good time because not many people had been to Antarctica. There were people who filmed coral, elephants, and chimpanzees, but he became known as the ""cold man."" He felt that many amazing scenes were waiting to be filmed.

When he began 35 years ago, the camera and communication technology were very simple. He says, ""It is much easier to film today. Back then, if you filmed something, you had to remember it. Now, with digital technology, you can film a lot and see it right away. You had to think about what shots you needed next and what you missed. You filmed less because film was very expensive. Today, you can have too much footage.""

Allan believes his experience in cold conditions is very valuable. He has spent so much time on sea ice that it feels normal to him. He does get cold toes, but he says the poles are healthy places with no leeches, diseases, or mosquitoes. Wildlife filming has many successes, but also failures and embarrassing moments. Once, he was in the Orkneys to film kittiwakes, but he could not identify the birds.

Recently, Allan got permission to film in Kong Karls Land, a group of islands in the Arctic Ocean. He knew it would be a tough job because it is home to polar bears and is very dangerous. In April, the temperature is usually -32°C, and the wind is strong, making it hard to carry cameras in deep snow. After walking for five or more hours a day and watching polar bear dens for 23 days, he had only seen one mother bear and her cub. However, on the 24th day, he felt like he was in the world of bears, moving and sensing like them. 

He describes how they would find a new hole and wait, moving around to stay warm. After five hours of watching, he finally saw a brief glimpse of a bear. The camera was ready, and he quickly focused on the viewfinder. After a few seconds, he saw a black nose, then the bear's head, and soon she was resting in front of the hole. She looked at him but did not seem worried. Just as he thought it could not get better, she slid down the slope, and then two cubs appeared at the den entrance. He felt like they were watching a special show.

Now, Allan wants to make his own film about climate change in the Arctic. He wants to talk to the people who live there and see how it affects their lives. He believes he could create an amazing documentary."
102,"In 2004, Pen Hadow became the first person to walk to the North Pole alone without getting more supplies on the way. He had to swim in very cold water, deal with frostbite, and avoid polar bears. Eight months later, he also reached the South Pole. Now, he is back in the Arctic, getting ready for a new adventure that he says is even bigger. Explorers like Pen are confident and determined. This time, however, there is a lot more at stake. Pen and two friends will go on a three-month journey of 1,000 kilometers to the North Pole. They will measure the thickness and density of the ice. No one has done this before, and Pen knows the results will be very important for scientists. This work will show how global warming is affecting the ice in the polar region.

Pen was prepared for this job since he was a child. His father’s old nanny, who worked for the famous polar explorer Scott of the Antarctic, helped him become strong. She sent him out into the Scottish mountains during storms with very few clothes. His father also loved adventures in cold places, and Pen grew up to be very strong. 

Pen is married to Mary, who loves horses and the outdoors. She helps him with his polar guide business. Mary says she worries more about him when he is at home because he often thinks about the Arctic. For fun, she once raced against him in a mountain event where horse riders compete with runners. Mary and her horse finished an hour before Pen. They live in the countryside with their two children. Pen says it is harder to be away from them this time. When he last left, his son was only one year old, and he told him to take care of his mother and sister. His son took this very seriously and kept asking how they were, which became too much for him. Pen thinks it was not fair to put that pressure on his son.

For this trip, Pen plans to have little contact with his family while he is in the Arctic. He believes that calling them will remind them of how far away he is. In the days before he leaves, he is carefully preparing his equipment. He says that when you are on the ice, it is very hard to fix things or do anything complicated. 

He will be joined by Ann Daniels, a top polar explorer, and Martin Hartley, the expedition photographer. They will have a team of six people to help them by flying in supplies. Pen finds being part of a team stressful, and he is also worried about his age. He will turn 47 soon and feels he has not trained enough. He says that organizing everything has taken more time than he expected, and he is nervous about what he will have to do.

Pen believes that this mission connects exploration with the search for knowledge that drove explorers in the past. He admits that reaching the North Pole was a personal goal, but this time, the scientists will benefit from the information they collect. They want to involve as many people as possible in understanding what is happening in the Arctic Ocean. Pen feels that their skills, which may seem strange, are now very important and useful."
103,"I took a year off. What was I going to do? Being a successful Olympian is amazing. I had the chance to do more writing, TV work, and speak to businesses and schools. Even though I enjoyed these activities, I wanted something competitive to focus on. I wanted to stay in shape so I could try for another Olympic spot if I felt inspired again. So, I signed up for marathons and triathlons. 

But then, I remembered Ben Fogle, a TV presenter, who kept asking me, “Do you want to row across the Atlantic with me?” I have always loved rowing and the feeling of the boat moving through the water. I missed that feeling, but I wasn’t ready to train every day. Still, I wanted some kind of competition. I asked my rowing friends if they wanted to join the race, but they were not very excited. I knew that if I entered the race, I would want to win, even though it was called an adventure. 

I thought about whether rowing with Ben would help me win. Maybe not. But being an underdog without pressure sounded nice. I contacted Ben. He was going to join the race anyway and had found a way to pay the big entry fee and deposit for a boat. This made the race feel real, not just a dream. We talked about the costs; the boat and equipment would cost £70,000, which is a lot of money. We believed we had a good chance, but we still needed to work hard to get it.

Besides the race costs, I also had to think about losing money because I would be away from home. Speaking at business conferences is one of the best ways to earn money after being a professional athlete. It feels good that people are interested in what I have done. But I find it hard to talk about my past without having a new goal. Joining the race would mean I was not just talking about what I did before; I would be doing something exciting again: rowing across the Atlantic.

I learned a lot while planning this adventure, but one big lesson was to appreciate the easy life of a full-time athlete. My training for the Olympics was hard, but it was also simple. I trained almost every day, but I had a set program and support from doctors and dieticians. I was worried about what people would think of me racing with a TV presenter. I thought it might look like I just wanted to be on TV, instead of choosing a better partner to win the race. 

However, my worries went away as we prepared. The Atlantic Rowing Race is about more than just rowing; it’s also about mental strength. Ben had done tough challenges before, like the Marathon des Sables, and spent time at sea and on a deserted island. But he didn’t know how to row well. I was surprised by how little he understood about rowing, and he was surprised by my lack of patience. I could have been more understanding, but I felt it was important to tell him how much he needed to improve. I should have known what to expect when I agreed to race with him."
104,"Just over a year ago, I left my job to work with huskies in the Arctic Circle in northern Finland. At 26, I felt restless. I dreamed of cold, empty landscapes, maybe because I was tired of the noise and crowds of London. I found a small company run by Anna McCormack and her husband, Pasi Ikonen, in Finnish Lapland. They offered me a job as a husky dog handler for the busy winter season. From December to February, they take many tourists on sled rides pulled by huskies across the ice and snow, for trips that can last from one hour to five days. They started with six dogs, but now they have more than 100. Recently, they took over another place called the ""wilderness farm,"" which is beautiful but basic, with unreliable electricity and no running water. They told me I could join the team for three months, but I needed to know what I was getting into. ""The hours are long, the conditions are tough, and the work is very physical,"" they said. I started packing right away.

On November 6, I flew from London. I found myself staring at a page with more than 100 pictures of huskies. I was supposed to memorize their names, but I felt distracted and nervous. I put the page down and looked out the window instead. I thought about how spring moves north at about 26 km per day, bringing flowers and leaves. But now, I saw winter moving south, and rivers freezing.

On November 7, I took a bus north. It was everything I hoped for. We drove through dark forests with thin trees covered in snow, stopping sometimes for reindeer to cross the road. I arrived at the farm after dark. As soon as I walked in, I was given a pair of boots and sent out into the cold. ""Do you want to be thrown in at the deep end?"" Anna asked. I followed the sound of barking, which got louder as I reached the dogsheds. Three people were running around, getting the huskies ready for sleds. The dogs were very excited, pulling against their ropes. I could barely introduce myself because everyone was too busy. I stood to the side and petted one of the quieter dogs. Someone told me to ""Get in!"" and I almost fell into the nearest sled. A command was shouted, and we took off into the dark, with only a headlamp for light.

By November 15, I was starting to learn how to be a husky guide, but first, I had to answer questions about what I could do. ""Are you useful?"" Anna asked. I was confused. I didn’t know. After more questions, I realized I wasn’t very useful: I had never driven a snowmobile, hadn’t done woodwork since school, and had never chopped anything with an axe. ""You do have a driving license?"" someone asked. I nodded, feeling relieved. 

I learned the basics of dog-sledding quickly: lean into the corners, use both feet on the brake to stop, and never let go of the handlebar. But other tasks were complicated. Simple things like feeding and watering the dogs were hard in freezing temperatures. A bowl of water would freeze quickly, so we had to make a ""soup"" of meat in hot water for the dogs. By the end of my first week, I was overwhelmed with instructions, and my muscles hurt from pulling heavy sleds and being pulled around by excited huskies. But I felt proud. I emailed my friends, saying, ""I can chop with an axe, hammer a nail, and use a circular saw, in the snow!"""
105,"On that day, when Radcliffe ran past the finish line, reporters came to understand her amazing performance. They noted that her time was good enough to compete in the men's marathon at the world championships in Paris. Curious journalists asked her about a special treatment called emu oil, which Olympic gold medalist Cathy Freeman had suggested to help Radcliffe heal from an injury caused by an accident when she hit a bike while training. Radcliffe said that she didn’t fully realize how big her achievement was at the time. She felt it was just what she was meant to do that day, so it didn’t feel special to her then. She and her team had decided not to set any limits on what they could achieve, and their motto was ""no limits.""

During the race, Gary Lough, Radcliffe's husband and coach, was in a car with her support team, listening to the radio. Gerard Hartmann, her physiotherapist, was with him. After 16 kilometers, Radcliffe's agent worried that she might not be able to keep up her fast pace and might drop out of the race. Hartmann was angry about this, but he understood that people who didn’t know how fit Radcliffe was might think it was risky to start so quickly.

With 800 meters left, Radcliffe started to think about her time. She realized she could finish in under 2 hours and 16 minutes if she ran the last part in less than three minutes. She had already run 41 kilometers very fast, but she still managed to sprint the last part in 2 minutes and 25 seconds. At the finish, she thought, ""I can run faster than that."" She remembered the race director, Dave Bedford, saying he never thought anyone would come close to that time for a long time. Radcliffe thought, ""I will come back and do it next year,"" and she really believed she could.

Unfortunately, that did not happen. After the race, everyone wanted to know how Radcliffe, who had an unusual running style, had beaten the skilled East African runners. Hartmann had worked with Radcliffe for weeks, helping her with her training as she ran 250-300 kilometers each week. He said, ""I’ve worked with 63 Olympic medalists, and no one could handle the pain like she could. She would make me work hard because I had to go deep into her muscles.""

Hartmann described how he would travel 13 hours from Ireland to Radcliffe's training place in France, only to be greeted by her husband saying, ""Gerard, you're 15 minutes late, Paula's waiting."" There was no time for greetings or tea; Radcliffe was ready for a two-hour training session. Hartmann said, ""Paula would push you to your limits, and that’s what made her so good."" He spent so much time with Radcliffe that other athletes he worked with became jealous.

When asked why no one has come close to her record, Radcliffe said, ""I trained really hard, but there are more talented people out there."" She thought someone like Mary Keitany, a two-time London marathon winner, might break her record. Radcliffe explained that some runners focus more on competing against each other than on improving themselves. She believed that her strong mental focus helped her push herself to run faster, as she never thought she could relax during the race.

Radcliffe did not know it at the time, but that marathon was the best performance of her career. She would never run that fast again, but she inspired many women to start long-distance running."
106,"When my first cooking show, In Search of Perfection, was released, I was unsure how viewers and critics would react. There was a lot of talk about a food ‘revolution’ happening in Britain, and I believed we had created a series that added something new to it. However, I worried if people would like a cooking show that included not just cooking techniques but also history and science. I watched the first episode feeling both happy and nervous. I didn’t need to worry. The show became very successful and led to many other interesting projects, including a book about my experiences at my restaurant.

In each project, I felt like I was on a journey, whether it was exploring the past, understanding cooking techniques, or learning about people. I wrote several books in a series called ‘Perfection’, each one linked to its own TV show. In these books, the journey was often physical, involving travel and new experiences. The latest book, In Search of Total Perfection, takes you around the world to meet amazing artisans, like a man who makes golden pasta that tastes better than any other. These artisans have spent many years trying to reach their own idea of perfection.

Perfection is different for everyone. Choosing which dishes to include in the series was very difficult, and I knew some people would be upset if their favorite dish was not included. I could imagine people asking, “Where is steak and kidney pie and bread and butter pudding?” But after a long meeting, the TV team and I created a list that would please many people. This showed me that everyone has their own idea of perfection, based on their feelings, memories, and experiences.

Even though the book is called ‘Perfection’, I knew I wouldn’t say that the recipes were the best or final. I believed that by using my cooking skills and knowledge, and by talking to food producers, chefs, and their customers, I could find out what makes these dishes special. The dictionary says ‘perfection’ means being perfect, but it also means improving through practice and trying new ideas until you create something unique.

The TV series allowed me to explore many foods, people, and places I had never seen before. I was excited to learn about food and memories because I started my career in the same way. Finding the best ingredients took me all over the world. I had many adventures, like visiting a canning factory that was using the wrong tomatoes and going to a dairy farm that was not good enough for filming. I even tried new cooking techniques, like hand-milking a cow to make ice cream and using a hospital machine to cook chicken, which almost caused a fire while trying to make a real Neapolitan pizza."
107,"We were still a long way from Marrakech when the van made a loud noise, went off the road into a field, and stopped. John got out and opened the engine. He looked at it for a long time with his hands in his pockets and a serious look on his face. “Actually, I don’t know what I’m doing,” he finally said, and he and Mum started to laugh. Bea was worried, “We can’t stay here forever,” she said. The field was big and empty, just grass and many flowers like poppies and daisies. “No, we can’t stay here forever,” I agreed, because it was better to support Bea. We got back into the van and waited for Mum and John to stop laughing. We watched John get smaller as he walked away to find someone who could help with the van. Mum lay down on the grass. “Tell us a story,” she said. Bea lay down next to her. “Go on, tell us a story.” So I told them about how the day before we left London, I heard two birds talking. I shared everything they talked about: breadcrumbs, other birds, the weather, and an argument over a worm. “That’s silly, no one understands bird language,” Bea said. My eyes felt wet. “I do.” But I didn’t sound very sure. “Liar.” I felt embarrassed. How could I be lying if I remembered everything? The more I thought about it, the less sure I became. “Mum…?” But she had fallen asleep in the sun. 

John came back with three Moroccan boys who helped us push the van to the hotel. Bea didn’t want to get out. The boys didn’t mind and waved and smiled at her through the back windows. We followed John into a café that was not far from where our van was parked. “It’s a hotel,” John whispered. “It might be a bit expensive.” “We’ll just have some tea,” Mum said, and we sat in the shade. The tea was made from mint leaves and was very sweet. Mum looked into the pot. “It’s like syrup,” she said. We stayed at the café all day while John looked sadly at the engine. “It’s a miracle it got us this far,” he said as it got dark. Mum took out blankets and made a bed for us in the hotel garden. It felt nice to sleep on the ground. “I’ll have to get us towed into Marrakech,” John said. 

Half an hour later, we were in a truck watching our van being pulled behind with John driving. At first, Bea didn’t want to move, so John picked her up and put her in the truck. Now she sat in the front with the driver. I kept thinking about how we would get home now that our van had to be towed. I thought it might be easier to take a boat straight to London. Then I must have fallen asleep."
108,"Lucy was at a welcome party in a hotel ballroom. She was talking to two other pianists who were also at the Prague Classical Music Festival. One was a guy from Tokyo, and the other was a girl from a European city named Liesel or Louisa. They were both about ten years older than Lucy and spoke good English. They discussed the music they were playing and their recent travels. 

“I think I'm doing Tanglewood this summer,” Lucy said. It sounded impressive, but she didn’t really want to go to the Tanglewood festival. She often felt overwhelmed by the concerts and competitions that took her around the world. Because of this, she missed so much school that she wasn’t officially enrolled anymore. Instead, she worked with tutors from the University of San Francisco. 

Lucy hadn’t even wanted to come to the Prague Festival, which only accepted fifteen pianists her age from around the world. She was one of the lucky few chosen from thousands of applicants. At the celebration, her dad gave her a white-gold necklace with an L pendant to congratulate her. Her little brother Gus dreamed of being at the same festival one day. Her teacher, Grace Chang, took Lucy out for a special dinner to plan her music pieces. The truth was, Lucy hadn’t applied herself. Her mother had filled out the form and sent in a CD. “I didn't want you to be disappointed if you didn’t get in,” her mom had said. Lucy thought her mom just didn’t want to give her a chance to say no. Back then, Lucy believed that making waves was bad, so she didn’t think about trying to get out of it.

The guy from Tokyo leaned in, surprised. “Tanglewood?” he asked. “Yeah.” “How old are you?” “Fifteen.” He looked at Liesel/Louisa, who said, “Wow.” Lucy didn’t mean to brag. It was hard to know when to share her achievements and when to keep quiet. “It's just part of this new youth-spotlight thing they're trying...” Liesel/Louisa then looked across the room and said she had to go talk to someone. The guy from Tokyo stayed and asked, “Have you ever been to Japan?” He had long, messy hair, like many musicians, to show they were cool. “Once, when I was about eight,” Lucy replied. 

Just then, Lucy's grandfather came over. “Lucy, let me introduce you to someone.” He took her arm and pulled her away from the conversation. “And don’t get too friendly with the competition.” “They’re not the competition,” Lucy said. “Everyone is the competition,” her grandfather replied. He took her around the room to meet important people. Lucy smiled and nodded, understanding only part of what was said.

Later, in the elevator to their suite, her grandfather said, “You did well in there, Lucy. I’m proud of you. This is an important festival, and people are talking about you. They all know who you are.” Lucy liked that. She enjoyed being recognized, even if some people were jealous or thought she was too young for the attention. Being a concert pianist didn’t earn her respect from the kids at her old school. Even her best friend, Reyna, didn’t know or care that she could play a difficult piece by Rachmaninov. But in places like this, Lucy felt she mattered."

“It’s not good for you to spend so much time online. You need to get out into the real world,” said Dad. It’s hard to argue with him, so I wanted to see what experts say about this. I found some interesting information. 

Research shows that many teenagers who use social media have a lot of real-life friends, feel good about themselves, and are learning important skills for the digital world. Simon Miles, an expert on online safety, says that social networking is a big part of growing up today. Teenagers use social media differently than adults. They don’t just check things quickly; they are part of it. This can be good or bad, but it depends on how you use it.

How does our social networking compare to what our parents did when they were young? Jim Matthews, a social media expert, says it is like the youth clubs that parents used to go to. It helps teenagers connect with friends, share jokes, and talk about their lives. It also helps them learn about themselves and deal with teenage problems.

Psychologist Professor Keith Davidson says that during adolescence, we often ask ourselves, “Who am I?” Social networking can help with this. You can share your favorite music or sports and see how others think differently. Research shows that teenagers who use social media a lot are not more self-centered than those who don’t. He also says that for shy people, talking online can be easier than in person, and it helps them practice social skills.

Professor Andrew Phillips is studying how young people use social networking sites. He believes these sites can help quiet people with special interests connect with others who like the same things. For example, if you are one of the few people in your school who likes a certain type of music, you might feel alone. But if you find a group online with similar interests, you can feel more connected and popular in a different way.

Pauline White, an expert in digital education, shared something interesting: teenagers who find new interests online and join groups of people with similar interests are really using social networks well. She thinks social networking is becoming a way for teenagers to be creative. They are making videos, podcasts, and blogs about what they like. Photo-sharing sites help photographers connect, learn new skills, and share their work. This can help them get jobs in the future because businesses use social media to sell products and reach customers. 

If you have many friends on social networks, they can be potential customers for your products. Teenagers who use social media creatively will benefit when they grow up and start working. Matthews agrees that many sites allow people to work together to create and share content. Working together is an important skill in today’s job market."
110,"When most people think of a relaxing family vacation, they might not imagine a long trip across nine western states in the US and a part of Canada. But my parents wanted to do something different for our summer vacation this year. My dad decided to plan a big family trip, which my twin brother and I were not very excited about. They often said, “Not enough people do this anymore,” while we exchanged worried looks.

In mid-June, we packed our car with suitcases, food, and clothes for any weather. I was excited but knew I would miss my privacy for the next two weeks. With barely enough space left in the car, we started our “Family Great American Road Trip.” Leaving our big home for smaller places for the next five thousand miles made me wonder what we were getting into.

We drove west through Oklahoma. Even though we were still close to home, we had some adventures. We stopped for the night in Oklahoma, where we saw beautiful stars, but we almost got blown off the road by a dust storm. We learned that cows have the right-of-way on the road!

The next day, we woke up early and continued our journey. We saw deserts turn into mountains. Each day felt similar, but we still had unique experiences. We left our footprints in the Great Sand Dunes and visited Pagosa Springs, Colorado, where we noticed a strong smell of sulfur. As we climbed to our next stop, we realized that the roads meant for Jeeps were not for us.

Every place we visited showed a mix of old and new. We often got stuck in traffic because of construction. We laughed when we saw big “CLOSED” signs at the Four Corners Monument. On our way to Yellowstone National Park, we saw many wind farms and watched the sunset over bear habitats. We even experienced “bear jams,” where traffic stopped to let bears cross the road, creating unforgettable memories.

As we drove, life at home felt far away. Even the old hotel we stayed in, which had no internet or cell phone service, couldn’t ruin our fun. It was a 95-year-old building, but the views were amazing. After watching a rainstorm from our hotel in Canada, we headed back south. My parents were right; you don’t need to go to a faraway place to find something special.

It was nice to be home together again, and I was happy that my brother and I didn’t fight during our long trip. We took three thousand photos of our adventures, and I knew I would remember the unexpected and fun moments the most."
111,"Rose Frost was sixteen years old and was going to live with her grandmother, Daisy. Rose's family was separating for two years. Her father, Jeff, had a job in another country, and her mother, Dahlia, would go with him. Rose and her older sister, Amy, would stay in England. Amy needed to finish her last year of school, so it was better for her to stay. She was happy because she got the best room at her college, which had its own kitchen and study area. She also had free Internet and phone access. Jeff and Dahlia would check on Amy, whether she liked it or not.

Rose was moving to her grandmother’s house. She only remembered a few happy times with Daisy from when she was younger, and she never knew her grandfather. When Daisy offered Rose a place to stay, her parents were not very excited, but Daisy was happy to have Rose with her. Rose didn’t understand why her parents didn’t get along with her grandma, but there had been a disagreement in the past. Because of this, Rose spent her summers away from Daisy.

Dahlia told Rose that living with Daisy would be interesting. Daisy was very social and loved to bring people together. Rose expected to get many dinner invitations, coffee mornings, and shopping trips soon, which made her smile. Daisy was not like a typical old lady; she seemed to go to more events than anyone else.

Before moving, Dahlia and Rose talked. Rose was sensible and mature for her age. She knew about healthy eating, staying fit, and getting enough sleep. But she wanted one thing: her independence. She wanted to play music loud, invite friends over, and go out without asking for permission. She felt she could be trusted to do these things. She didn’t want to be reminded about homework or staying out late, and she didn’t want to be taken everywhere by her grandmother. Daisy understood.

Dahlia gave Rose a new touch-screen mobile phone for emergencies only, and Rose was very happy. They all agreed to trust each other. Daisy would trust Rose to make good choices, and Rose would trust Daisy not to be too strict. If either of them went too far, they would talk about it again.

Rose was not a wild child. Her few friends were similar, so her school reports were always good. In five weeks, Rose would start at a new school, meet new friends, and begin her life again. This would be her fourth school in five years, so she felt experienced. At least she knew this would be her last school, as she would be starting her final two years. For Rose, this was a new beginning in her life."
112,"Charlotte Grainger shares that her primary school teacher first thought she might write a novel. She said, ""I believed writing a book would be a big achievement because it seemed very challenging. I didn’t know what other teenagers were doing, like competing in the Olympics. When I turned 13, I decided to try writing a book."" Now, the novel she started at that age is about to be published. 

Charlotte recently told her former teacher about her book, and the teacher was surprised. She thought Charlotte would write a book when she was 30 or 40 years old. Charlotte didn’t understand why she should wait to do something she was good at.

It is a winter afternoon in the offices of Charlotte’s publishers. Even though I knew I was going to interview a 15-year-old girl about her book, I was surprised to see a teenager sitting there. The book is a great achievement: it has a strong story and is full of action. Nothing about it, except for the age of the main character, shows that it was written by a teenager. 

A public relations representative is with us in case Charlotte needs help, but she doesn’t. She is confident, smart, and steady, which keeps her from being overly confident. Charlotte understands that she is still young. When I ask her about the complex moral questions in her book, she says, ""I was trying to ask big questions, not answer them. I don’t have many life lessons to share with my readers."" She laughs and adds, ""I don’t think my age limits my understanding of the world, but I also don’t think I’m very wise. I just wanted to explore the idea of taking responsibility.""

Charlotte has a theory about how teenagers are often shown in books. She believes there are three types of teenagers in novels: the outsider who becomes accepted, the naïve teenager who knows little about the world, and the awkward teenager who struggles socially. She found it frustrating to read about these types. ""What if you’re just fine? There aren’t many stories about teenagers who are okay in some way. Some writers give the impression that teenagers can’t know who they are because they lack experience. This can hurt their self-confidence.""

Charlotte loves reading famous fantasy authors, but their books almost stopped her from writing. ""These books explore deep topics about life and psychology. I wondered if I needed to write like that to create a good book and if I could do it."" However, she appreciates a book called How Not to Write a Novel. ""It says that if the reader starts to guess what will happen, the suspense is probably gone.""

Some might think that Charlotte’s parents, who are both journalists, helped her get her novel published. Her father knew someone in publishing who read her book first. Charlotte knows she is lucky because it is hard for anyone to get their first novel read, no matter their age. ""Every writer needs support and a bit of luck, but after that, you are on your own. In the end, writers succeed or fail based on their talent, so I don’t take anything for granted,"" Charlotte concludes."
113,"""‘Remember, speed is your friend, not your enemy,’ said Gareth, our instructor, as we looked down the ski slope. ‘Now, who wants to go first?’ The group looked nervous. Then a guy named David, who had some experience with freestyle ski-jumping, stepped forward and skied down the slope towards the jump. He went up the ramp quickly and flew into the air, but something seemed wrong. We held our breath. He landed hard, lost both skis, and fell into the snow. ‘Remember,’ Gareth said kindly, ‘speed can be unpredictable.’ 

I thought maybe freestyle skiing was not for me. On past skiing holidays, I enjoyed practicing turns in the snow. I wasn’t like those teenagers who did tricks on ramps and half pipes in skate parks. I thought it looked fun, but I was afraid I would look silly trying to join them. Then my parents decided we would have a winter holiday at a freestyle skiing training center in the US. It had a big indoor area with trampolines and ski jumps covered in fake snow. Students jumped and tried their new tricks, landing in foam pits – not a real introduction to skiing outside. 

After practicing indoors, we went outside to try our skills. ‘Progression is inevitable!’ the center’s slogan said. Gareth explained, ‘Before places like this, inexperienced ski jumpers would just go down the slopes and hope for the best. But remember – if you land on the knuckle, you’ll be in trouble.’ The ‘knuckle’ is the flat area behind the jump before the slope goes down to the landing zone. If you land in the zone, you keep moving forward, which is safer. If you land on the flat, you stop suddenly, which hurts. So, speed is important.

At first, it was hard to make my body go fast towards the jump. My legs wanted to slow down, and I often landed on the knuckle. I didn’t fall, but by midday, I felt exhausted. ‘You need to control the jump, not let it control you,’ said Gareth. 

On the second day, we started on the trampolines. I thought I would hate being indoors, but bouncing was fun. Some exercises copied ski-jumping moves, while others helped us learn ‘aerial awareness’ – knowing what your body was doing while in the air. Gareth gave us tips. My ‘aerial awareness’ needed improvement – I only noticed the moment before take-off and then found myself in the foam cubes next to the trampoline.

We went back to the mountain to try again. There were more mistakes, but I finally landed properly. Gareth was as happy as I was, and for a moment, I felt proud of my achievement. But that feeling didn’t last long. On my last run of the day, I made myself keep my speed up as I approached the jump, flew into the air, and landed correctly. Then I saw both skis sliding down the slope, no longer attached to my feet."""
114,"Imagine you are on a rollercoaster in an amusement park. Your hands are sweaty with fear, and you hold on tightly as the ride stops. You take a deep breath before the carriage slowly goes up. Then, suddenly, it drops, and your stomach feels like it is in the air. You go fast forward, turn left, and even go upside down. You scream in fear, but you chose to be there, just like millions of others who pay to enter theme parks.

It is interesting that amusement parks, with their exciting rides, are a big business. Many creative people work behind the scenes, including engineers and designers, to make these rides safe and thrilling. The job of a rollercoaster designer might sound like a child's dream, but it is actually very challenging. They must find the right mix of fun and fear while keeping riders safe. They also need to create new experiences to keep visitors coming back.

Most of the ideas for rollercoasters today were created by a designer named John Miller in the early 1900s. In the past, rides were more extreme, but now designers must follow certain rules and use specific designs from ride manufacturers. I talked to three experts about rollercoasters. Professor Brendan Walker, a ""thrill engineer,"" said that the skill is in putting all the parts together. Dr. John Roberts explained that it is important to quickly switch between feelings of excitement and safety so that riders feel thrilled but not scared.

To create an amazing ride, teams must come up with a strong story, like a space adventure or a jungle chase, and combine it with exciting features like tall heights and steep drops. However, Professor Walker said that in creative work, experience and testing are very important. Jeff Hornick, a senior director in theme park development, agreed that it helps to love thrills when designing rollercoasters to understand what riders want.

I asked if rollercoaster designers will use new technology like virtual reality. Walker said we should not expect too much from it. He believes that while new technology can make rides more exciting, the real experience of being on a rollercoaster will always be the most important part for many years to come."
115,"At 25, Miranda Ellington has done a lot as a choreographer. She has created dances for many theatres and dance companies, and she still dances sometimes. I wonder why she does both things with her busy schedule. She says, ""Dancing again helps me remember what it’s like to be in the studio, following the orders of strict choreographers. It can be tense and frustrating. Choreographers sometimes forget how hard it is to rehearse all day.""

As a choreographer, Miranda teaches and enjoys working with young students. She explains, ""Beginners are often open to new ideas. Working with them can be easier than with professionals because they are willing to take risks. They want to succeed but don’t always know their strengths and weaknesses. This makes them open to criticism, even if it’s tough. Sometimes they challenge me, and I appreciate their honest feedback.""

When Miranda starts with a new group, she focuses on the dance steps, and the music guides her. She says, ""There might be music I don’t like, but I still create the best dance routine for it. If dancers don’t respond well to the music, it can be frustrating, but I have to find solutions. I wish I could experiment more and change the music to improve the mood during tough rehearsals. But now, I mostly work on big productions where the music is already decided.""

Miranda believes in meeting new people and not sticking to one place. She says, ""It’s important to make new contacts. But I have to remember that each theatre and school has different methods and styles. I need to adapt my work each time I go somewhere new, so I don’t get stuck in my ways.""

We talk about a recent documentary about professional ballet dancers and choreographers. Miranda says, ""Many past documentaries looked glamorous but were not true. This one shows real life in a dance company. There’s a scene where a young dancer gets many corrections, and I smiled because I recognized that feeling. She knows she’s not doing it right but can’t make her body move as needed. It’s hard to watch, but it’s real. People often underestimate the hard work and dedication in ballet.""

I ask Miranda what makes a great dance production. She replies, ""It’s when everything comes together – the music, costumes, lighting, and dancers. Perfection is hard to achieve, but aiming high is important. It helps you get away with some mistakes. I’ve worked on shows where the dance was great, but the costumes or props were distracting, and that’s disappointing.""

Miranda has done many different types of work, so I ask how she sees herself: is she a modern dance choreographer or a ballet specialist? She says, ""People want to label you, but I don’t understand that. There’s a trend to focus on one area of expertise, but I don’t follow that. Maybe one day I will be known for one thing, but for now, I want to explore more."""
116,"A friend once asked me why I travel when I can see everything on television. I agreed that TV shows many amazing things, but I think it is better to go out and experience the world. This conversation inspired me to take a fun four-day trip and make a film to encourage people to turn off their TVs.

A friend was giving away his old sofa, and I decided to use it in my film. I added three wheels and some cables to it, which I connected to old seatbelts that I wore over my shoulders. I put my luggage on the sofa and even slept on it at night, including one night on the beach. Some friends joined me during the trip, helping to pull the sofa and cheering me on.

I have done many walking trips in the past, but this was very different. It was the longest distance I have ever walked, and I walked on main roads. This allowed me to stop at cafés and relax on the sofa with a cappuccino instead of sitting on a rock with my sandwiches blowing away in the wind.

I often had to tell people, “No, I’m not doing this for charity, and I’m not training for a marathon.” When someone at work asks about my weekend, I prefer to share my experience of dragging a sofa 100 miles across southern England rather than talking about the latest TV show. You can watch the film on my website."
117,"When I read about guided swimming trips in the sea around some small Greek islands, I felt excited. I had never tried group trips before. My brother, who I usually travel with, was busy, so I thought a group holiday would be good for me. The man at the Greek port looked surprised when I asked for a ticket for one person, because the islands are popular with families. I told him I wouldn’t be alone for long; I would join ten other people to swim around the small islands. He still looked confused, but he smiled and let me on the ferry.

Before we started, our group had exchanged emails, but there was not much time to talk before our first swim. Our guides told us that a support boat would follow us, and they made sure we knew how to communicate with it. We did a short swim to divide us into speed groups, and then it was time for our first long swim of 1.5 km. I felt nervous. I had trained in my local pool and swum in rivers, but I had never swum long distances in the open sea. Soon, the waves got bigger, and I found myself at the back of the slow group, which was not where I wanted to be. I watched the faster swimmers move ahead like dolphins. I wanted to finish this first swim, and I was very happy when I finally did it on my own.

The next days followed a routine: jumping in, finding a comfortable speed, and stopping to enjoy the beautiful views. As the swims got longer, I also got faster and enjoyed them more. I felt like I didn’t need the support boat anymore. I can’t wait to come back again next year!"
118,"Being a flight attendant is not easy, but it has many rewards. Since I started this job, I have traveled to many places, from the US to Australia. I work with amazing people, have a lot of free time, and my life is always interesting. This makes it a great job for someone young like me!

When I was a child, I went to a boarding school far from my family. I often flew alone when school started and ended. Sometimes I felt lonely, so I asked the flight attendants if I could help serve meals to the passengers. Some of them let me help. This experience stayed in my mind when I wanted to change from my banking job and look for something new.

At the interview for the flight attendant job, there were many young people, and many of us were accepted. Most of us had good qualifications and were changing careers. Before the interview, I practiced what to say. I talked about my skills and past work experience, not just my love for travel, which everyone else said. Because of this, I got the job!

I would recommend this job to anyone because there are many good things about it. The free flights are nice, but they are not the best part. Most airline staff work very hard, and there is a saying: ""No one is finished until everyone is finished."" It feels like a big family. Even if we don’t see each other all the time, we are still close.

When I am not working, I don’t have to take my work home. If I do have difficult passengers, which is rare, I know the flight will end soon, and I probably won’t see them again!"
119,"At the summer camp where I work, I really enjoy seeing the children do things they never thought they could do. Most of the children already know how to swim and play table tennis before they come here, but rock climbing is new for many of them. Some kids feel nervous at first, but with some encouragement, they try it and all reach the top in the end. This makes them feel very happy.

At the start of the week, some children miss their homes. It is not the youngest ones who feel this way the most; it is usually the ten- to thirteen-year-olds. We do not let them use their mobile phones all the time. First, we tell them they can call home after lunch. When they ask again, usually after dinner, we say it is too late to call now and suggest they do it tomorrow. Most children feel better in a couple of days, and at the end of the week, they all come to thank us because they had a great time.

Sometimes, it is not just the children who feel lonely. We also have parents who call all the time to ask how their child is doing, which is not really needed. Often, their child is busy playing games or doing other activities, so we have to tell the parents to call back later.

We often see a certain type of child who comes to camp, usually wearing expensive new clothes. These children often argue when we ask them to change into something more suitable, but soon they understand why it is important."
120,"Text: 'Rock the Planet is a musical show where the actors also need to be good musicians. It opened in London last year after being in the USA for five years, where it won the ‘Best Musical’ award four times! However, doing the show with an all-British cast was not easy. In the UK, there are more rules about how many performances young actors can do each week compared to the USA, where they can do more shows. Because of this, they needed twice as many actors in London. Fortunately, the director found many talented actors from the UK, and they have just won their first ‘Best Musical’ award.

The theatre in London is bigger than the one in the USA, and it has been full every night. Many people want to hear the songs that became popular in America. I met Jamie, an 11-year-old actor in the show. He said, ‘It’s amazing that I get paid to play, especially with a beautiful and expensive Gibson guitar.’ He told me that the young actors are very busy. ‘We have regular school lessons at the theatre. The teacher is great, but I miss my old school friends,’ he said. 

I asked Jamie what his classmates thought of the show. He replied, ‘My whole class came! The theatre offers special ticket deals for schools. They loved it, and that made me feel really confident. My parents come when they can, but it’s expensive for them.’ When I mentioned that I also play guitar, Jamie found a spare one and invited me to play with him and the other young actors. We played a song called Days, which I didn’t know. Jamie helped me learn it, and I felt happy when I finally got it right. I was impressed by Jamie’s skills and wished I could play like him. I was just trying to keep up and was glad the show’s director wasn’t there to hear my mistakes!

Even though the young actors were already musicians and some played several instruments, none had played in a band before. Luckily, they found it quite easy. Jamie said the hardest part was looking natural when they first performed together. They were so focused that they forgot to smile! The show will be in London for another year, and it is definitely worth seeing.'"
